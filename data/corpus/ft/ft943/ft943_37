FT  22 JUL 94 / Telegraph chairman in sharp attack on Cazenove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph group, has launched an
unprecedented public attack on Cazenove, the most discreet and illustrious
of British stockbrokers, for the manner in which the firm withdrew from the
Telegraph account.
Mr Black described Cazenove's abrupt resignation last month as broker to the
Telegraph as 'scandalous and dishonourable'.
The resignation followed the row over Hollinger, Mr Black's Canadian company
that controls the Telegraph group, selling Pounds 73m worth of shares to
institutions in May, a month before the weekday cover price of the Daily
Telegraph was cut.
On the day the price cut was announced, Telegraph shares fell by 191p to
349p, enraging investors who had bought the shares through Cazenove at 587p
barely a month before.
The Stock Exchange has cleared Mr Black of any impropriety. Mr Black says he
was given two hours' notice of Cazenove's decision even though he believed
after talking to senior Cazenove staff they would 'not do anything
provocative' and would not withdraw abruptly. He believed there would be a
natural parting of the ways once the dust had settled.
Cazenove had a great name, Mr Black said, but on this occasion the firm's
behaviour had been 'absolutely outrageous'.
Mr Black's comments were put yesterday to the stockbroking firm's new senior
partner, Mr Mark Loveday, who said he would not respond to any of the
allegations.
Apart from the abruptness of the decision, Mr Black is angry that an unnamed
senior Cazenove official told the Financial Times that it was the first time
in recent memory the firm had voluntarily resigned as stockbroker to a
company.
This, Mr Black said, had the effect of 'poisoning the wells' and of
'inflicting the maximum damage on the company's reputation.' Mr Black added:
'They took the line of least resistance and scurried out the back door into
the tall grass.
'Any company using Cazenove as a broker or an adviser should take note of
this. The fact is in this business you have to have some reasonable level of
reliability from people you are paying to serve you.'
Cazenove, which concentrates on providing advice to companies on share
issues rather than becoming a more broadly based investment bank, is widely
regarded as successful.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Blair wins mandate to push Labour into centre ground: New
leader says party must shun the old dogmas of left and right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair won a clear mandate yesterday to push Labour further into the
political centre ground by securing a decisive victory in the party's
leadership election.
The 41-year-old successor to the late John Smith committed himself to a 'war
against complacency' in the party. He won an immediate pledge of loyalty
from his newly elected deputy, the more traditionalist Mr John Prescott.
Promising to drive forward the process of 'modernisation' and echoing the
themes of President Bill Clinton's 1992 US presidential campaign, Mr Blair
said Labour must eschew the old dogmas of both right and left.
Instead it would present the electorate at the next general election with a
new left-of-centre agenda based on economic regeneration and the restoration
of Britain's social fabric.
The youngest-ever Labour leader told supporters at a London rally that the
Conservatives had 'lost the nation's trust'. But Labour had still to work
for and earn that trust by launching a 'crusade for change'. Mr Blair's
victory with an outright majority of 57 per cent across the three sections
of Labour's electoral college was accompanied by Mr Prescott's comfortable
win in the race for the deputy leadership.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, who took over as interim leader from Mr Smith, was
defeated in both contests. She immediately pledged her loyalty to the new
leaders, indicating she would be seeking a senior post alongside Mr Blair
and Mr Prescott after this autumn's elections for the shadow cabinet team.
Mr Blair, whose victory coincided with the first meeting of Mr John Major's
reshuffled cabinet, will delay until after the shadow cabinet elections his
planned shake-up of Labour's team.
But he is already studying changes to the party's cumbersome policymaking
machinery and will next week provide a glimpse of his new leadership style
at the launch of a policy document linking industrial policy and education.
As Mr Jeremy Hanley, the new Conservative party chairman, attacked Mr Blair
as 'all style and no substance', senior ministers said the government's
strategy would be to highlight the 'clear water' which remained between the
two parties on the economy, taxation and Europe.
But in his acceptance speech the new Labour leader left no doubt of the
direction he intends to travel in an effort to end the run of four general
election defeats which have led to more than 15 years in the political
wilderness.
Labour would embrace the market economy but buttress it with a partnership
between government and industry; it would end the dependency of the poor by
promoting employment rather than welfare; and it would extend high standards
in education to all schools.
Mr Blair offered a clear hint also that he intends to continue the internal
reform process which saw the influence of trade union leaders in the
leadership election eclipsed by the votes of MPs, constituency members and
rank-and-file union members.
Mr Prescott, whose comfortable victory in the deputy leadership contest
underlined his popularity with the party faithful, said he intended to take
a high-profile campaigning role in the run up to the general election.
But he made it clear he would also expect a pivotal role in policymaking and
that he would continue to promote the goal of full employment which was at
the centre of his campaign for the leadership.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Former B&amp;C chief Gunn faces bar as director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gunn, the former head of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, faces
disqualification as a director after a highly critical Department of Trade
and Industry report.
The report, published yesterday, also censures merchant bank Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and accountants Spicer &amp; Oppenheim over their role in B&amp;C's
Pounds 400m acquisition of Atlantic Computers in 1988 which led to the
financial services group's collapse in 1990. However, N M Rothschild, which
floated Atlantic in 1983, escapes criticism.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is making a court
application for the disqualification of Mr Gunn and five other individuals
involved.
B&amp;C collapsed in 1990 with debts of Pounds 1.2bn after writing off Pounds
550m against its investment in Atlantic, a computer leasing company, which
the report concludes had probably never made a profit since it was formed in
1975.
The long-awaited report criticised Mr Gunn and two fellow B&amp;C directors, Mr
Peter Goldie and Mr Rusty Ashman, for failing to alert other board members
or shareholders when they learned of a Pounds 160m 'black hole' in
Atlantic's accounts in April 1989.
They were also criticised for publishing a 'grossly misleading' set of
accounts following the discovery.
The inspectors added, however: 'We are satisfied that they were acting in
what they perceived at the time (albeit in our view erroneously) to be the
best interests of B&amp;C and that they did not act dishonestly in the sense of
seeking to defraud any person.' Others facing disqualification are Mr David
McCormick, a director of Atlantic at the time of the acquisition, Mr
Nicholas Kennedy Scott, who was finance director, and Mrs Sien Yen Cheng Kai
On, who was a board member.
Mr Gunn said yesterday he was astonished at the report which was 'a shoddy
piece of work' containing material inaccuracies. He is to 'vigorously
defend' the disqualification action.
He attacked the charge that B&amp;C had failed to investigate Atlantic
adequately before the acquisition. 'It was the only deal where B&amp;C employed
outside advisers.'
He also defended the decision not to alert shareholders immediately problems
were discovered at Atlantic. 'We were running a company based on the
confidence of lenders and market participants and took a prudent approach.'
Mr McCormick, who was appointed chief executive of Atlantic after the
acquisition, said: 'Despite taking nearly four years to report their
findings, the inspectors have criticised me for failing to solve all of
Atlantic's problems in little over one year.'
Individuals mentioned in the report said that criticism of City institutions
in earlier drafts had been toned down.
Mr Vernon Davies, co-founder of Atlantic with the late Mr John Foulston and
a director and major shareholder until 1986, is criticised in the report but
is not facing disqualification.
Meanwhile, the administrators of B&amp;C have launched legal action against
Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, auditor to Atlantic and now part of accountants Touche
Ross.
A writ lodged in the High Court on Wednesday claims damages from the firm in
relation to negligent professional advice provided during its time as
adviser and auditor to the group. The administrators - from accountants
Ernst &amp; Young - have also started litigations against BZW and against the
directors of the Atlantic companies.
The writ does not specify the exact value of a claim, but it may seek
redress for any compensation not available from the other actions up to the
total of Pounds 416m lost plus interest and costs.

FT  22 JUL 94 / MEPs give Santer grudging backing as Brussels chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament offered a grudging endorsement yesterday of Mr
Jacques Santer as the next president of the European Commission, averting a
crisis with EU governments committed to the Luxembourg prime minister.
After a nerve-wracking climax to a debate in which newly elected MEPs
demanded to be treated as equals of the EU's governing Council of Ministers,
the parliament voted by 260 votes to 238 to support the Santer nomination,
with 23 abstentions.
Mr Santer, looking relieved, told MEPs in Strasbourg: 'I think the European
Parliament has shown itself worthy of the powers that have been given to
it.'
The lukewarm endorsement ends a period of uncertainty over the succession to
Mr Jacques Delors, but it foreshadows a broader power struggle between the
parliament and other institutions which is expected to come to a head in
1996 when the European Union reviews the Maastricht treaty.
After the vote, MEPs seemed pleased at having delivered an unambiguous
warning to member state governments to consult it in future, but mildly
relieved at avoiding an institutional crisis, which EU national governments
might have exploited to the parliament's disadvantage.
The Maastricht treaty gives MEPs the right to be consulted on the Commission
president-designate, as well as the power to reject the president and his
team after they present their programme for the next five years to the
parliament later this year.
Yesterday, during a debate in which Mr Santer's fitness for the top
executive job in Brussels was often questioned, the parliament turned the
right of consultation into a de facto vote of confidence.
Mr Santer, 57, a Christian Democrat who has served for 10 years as prime
minister of Luxembourg, squeezed through only after support from Greek,
Portuguese, and Spanish socialists who were reluctant to upset their
national party leaders at home.
He was also backed by the neo-fascists from Italy, and won overwhelming
support from fellow Christian Democrats. Many MEPs voiced unhappiness that
Mr Santer had emerged only as a compromise candidate as a result of
Britain's veto last month of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister
backed by France and Germany. One Dutch MEP called him 'a man of the past'.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, predicted Mr Santer would be a
first class successor to Mr Delors. He acknowledged weaknesses in the
selection process, and pledged to consult more closely with the European
Parliament, which he said should develop its powers.
Before the vote, Mr Santer presented to Parliament a rough outline of the
priorities the Commission would follow during his five-year term which runs
in tandem with the newly elected parliament and begins next January.
Mr Santer said EU leaders and institutions should bridge the gulf with
ordinary European citizens, many of whom boycotted last month's European
parliamentary elections. It was vital to convince the public European
integration was unavoidable.
He also stressed the need for new economic growth in order to tackle endemic
unemployment which was undermining the fabric of European society.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Junk food odds on to console the betting
person
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A tenner each way and a double cheeseburger,' could be the order of the day
at Britain's betting shops following the government's decision to ease
restrictions which have governed the industry for 33 years.
All the main chains welcomed the announcement by Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, which will allow clear glass shopfronts, larger television
screens and a wider range of food.
Ladbrokes, which has 1,900 betting shops, said it would 'significantly
increase' investment in refurbishment to Pounds 75m over the next three
years to take advantage of the changes.
William Hill, the 1,800-strong chain owned by Brent Walker, said it would
continue to invest about Pounds 8m a year.
Mr Chris Bell, deputy managing director of Ladbrokes, said: 'It is ludicrous
that the public have not been able to see that the interior of a betting
shop is far removed from the traditional image, or buy a snack other than
crisps or confectionery when inside.'
The rules, which date back to 1961 when off-course betting was legalised,
were designed to limit the attraction of betting shops to the young and
impressionable. The industry has lobbied hard for their removal,
particularly in the face of competition from the National Lottery.
Coral, the 700-shop chain owned by Bass, said the most important change was
to allow ordinary shopfronts. 'It will demystify betting shops and help
attract people who have not been in one before.'
Bookmakers have known changes were likely for over a year and have ensured
that shops refurbished recently could be adapted quickly. 'We will be
putting in new shopfronts as soon as the law is changed early next year,'
said Coral.
Ladbrokes has already designed a new format for its shops and fitted one out
as a pilot.
Betting shops will be allowed to display race and betting information in
their windows and provide larger television screens, currently restricted to
30 inches. They will be able to offer 'hand-held' food, such as burgers and
chips, but the ban on alcohol will remain. Mr Howard has made clear that the
changes should not result in betting shops becoming 'general entertainment
centres'.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: AGF may sell bank stake
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance company scheduled for
privatisation in the autumn, yesterday confirmed it was considering the sale
of its 43 per cent stake in Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE),
the specialist banking group.
AGF also verified that it was in talks with Credit Lyonnais, the troubled
French banking group that owns 24 per cent of BFCE, over the proposed
disposal. However, AGF and Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on
speculation that they were considering selling their holdings together as a
controlling stake.
The disposal of their combined holdings, a majority stake of 67 per cent
with an estimated value of FFr2.8bn (Dollars 534m), would in theory raise
more money than the separate sales of the individual stakes, given that a
potential purchaser could be expected to pay a premium for control of BFCE.
AGF and Credit Lyonnais are making disposals. AGF, which has denied
speculation about substantial losses on the bond market, is trying to raise
capital after last year's making of heavy provisions on its property
portfolio and its exposure to ailing concerns such as Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs, the troubled financial group.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, AGF chairman, is reviewing the future of all
the insurer's non-strategic interests. AGF yesterday confirmed that the BFCE
stake was 'not considered to be a strategic investment' and might therefore
be sold.
Credit Lyonnais is under even greater financial pressure. Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, its chairman, this spring secured the government's support for
a FFr44.9bn rescue package after disclosing a net loss of FFr6.9bn for 1993.
However, he recently confirmed that his group would require yet another
capital injection following the discovery of more financial problems. Mr
Peyrelevade is also intent on raising capital from disposals.
Credit Lyonnais last week agreed terms to sell its controlling stake in
Fnac, the music retailing group, to Mr Francois Pinault, the entrepreneur,
for FFr1.9bn.

Bayerische Vereinsbank is to take complete control of Bank von Ernst, an old
Swiss firm specialising in private business.
It will take over the 50 per cent it does not own from the
Creditanstalt-Verein in Vienna, subject to approval by the relevant
authorities, the bank said yesterday.
Bank von Ernst, with a balance sheet total of SFr1.7bn (Dollars 1.2bn), has
branches in Bern, Zurich, Geneva and London, and employs 250 people.
It has representative bureaux in Frankfurt, Tokyo, Miami and Caracas.
Bayerische Vereinsbank said it intended to strengthen Bank von Ernst's
business with institutional clients, especially in asset management and
capital markets business.
Detailed terms were not disclosed, although the Viennese partner in the deal
is to take over Bayerische Vereinsbank's minority holdings in two Austrian
banks.
Since Bayerische Vereinsbank's 1992 purchase of the Schoellerbank had given
it full coverage of the Austrian market, its 4.7 per cent in the Bank fur
Oberosterreich und Salzburg, and a similar stake in the Bank fur Tirol and
Vorarlberg were no longer of any strategic importance, Bayerische
Vereinsbank said.

<TEXT>
Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second largest bank, has reported a
13.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Es9.26bn (Dollars 58m) for the
first half of 1994.
BPA said the slide was due mainly to a 31.7 per cent increase in provisions
against credit and other risks to Es11.74bn as a result of recession in
1993.
Earnings were also affected by investments in overseas subsidiaries and in
Uniao de Bancos Portugueses, a small retail bank in which BPA acquired a
controlling stake in 1993, BPA said.
Cash flow in the first half rose 10.6 per cent, compared with the same
period last year, to Es24.37bn. Total deposits increased 7 per cent to
Es1,364.76bn. The group's loan portfolio grew 1.6 per cent to Es811.46bn.
Net assets rose 16.4 per cent to Es2,538bn.
BPA has set aside Es326m for tax payments on first-half earnings. No tax
provisions were made during the first half of 1993.
The state is due to sell its remaining 24.39 per cent holding in BPA but no
date has been set. A group of Portuguese businessmen has acquired a
controlling stake of about 27 per cent since privatisation of the bank began
in stages in 1990.
BPA increased its capital from Es100bn to Es110bn in a rights issue that
closed on July 1.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK needs effective opposition, not
petulant and petty outbursts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir COLIN CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With Mortimer on foreign affairs, Brittan on economics and Rogaly on
politics, there's not much need to look elsewhere - congratulations on such
an excellent team.
But can I take issue with Joe Rogaly, whose recently expressed enthusiasm
for a change of government is perhaps ahead of itself? With almost certainly
two and perhaps three years to go before the next general election, should
he not be emphasising the need for an effective opposition party in the
interim? Otherwise the job will be left, as it increasingly has been, to the
less objective sections of the media.
And an effective opposition party depends not just on one person, its
leader, but on the whole team, and I for one have been disappointed with the
performance of most shadow cabinet members recently. One example was a
seemingly petulant and petty outburst by Dr David Clark, the shadow defence
secretary, on the government's recent announcements about agreed orders for
defence equipment.
This company benefited from a contract for 259 Challenger 2 main battle
tanks. Dr Clark dismissed this piece of good news for manufacturing industry
as old news dressed up for the parliamentary occasion. In fact, the
secretary of state for defence announced the government's intention to
purchase up to 259 Challenger 2 tanks on December 1 1993. Without detracting
from that announcement, I am sure that even Mr Malcolm Rifkind would agree
that statements of intent do not necessarily count for very much. What does
count, for the Army, for the taxpayer, for this company and its suppliers,
is the quantity of tanks, the specification, the delivery dates, the price
and the payment terms. To have agreed all of those in 7 1/2 months is
remarkable by any commercial standards.
If Dr Clark had instead said the decision was good news for industry but
should have been taken a long time ago, I would have more confidence that 15
years in opposition had been spent learning about the real world rather than
practising the art of empty slogans.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN CRAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stephen Sidkin and Nigel Miller ('Stay secure on safety', July 19)
appear to take a dim view of the quality of British manufacturing industry.
They apparently regard requirements to supply safe goods, to warn purchasers
about any particular risks, to investigate complaints and to recall
dangerous products as 'costly and onerous'. It is not one that we share.
It is true that the European General Product Safety Directive provides (to
us, welcome) additional protection for consumers, although the UK is
unlikely to take up all the powers which the directive sets out. But it is
also good news for reputable UK manufacturers, because their European
competitors will now be subject to similar obligations to those set out in
the UK's 1987 Consumer Protection Act. Dangerous products cross frontiers
and this legislation is a boost for consumers for fair competition and for
the single market.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unemployment factors also a myth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW SENTANCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Robinson (Personal View, July 18) usefully dismisses some of the
myths surrounding the current debate on employment and unemployment. But he
concludes by perpetuating a myth of his own. He alleges that it is the
decentralisation of pay bargaining and the abolition of incomes policy in
the private sector which have been responsible for a worsening
inflation/unemployment trade-off in the UK and, hence, the country's
currently high jobless total.
That is the wrong conclusion to draw from the experience of the 1980s. The
secular rise in UK unemployment was mirrored in other European countries
which did not experience the same changes in pay bargaining structure. Many
of them have very centralised systems of pay determination. Moreover, this
European experience stands in stark contrast to the US - which has a very
decentralised system of pay bargaining, and where unemployment has not
followed the rising trend apparent in most of Europe.
There is no simple link between pay bargaining systems and unemployment
experience across different countries. The key to maintaining a high level
of employment is real wage flexibility, so that unpleasant shocks are
reflected in lower labour costs rather than rising unemployment. Real wage
flexibility can be achieved under centralised pay bargaining systems in
corporatist economies (eg, Germany and Scandinavia). But it is also a
feature of the decentralised system in the US.
If there is any conclusion to be drawn about pay bargaining structures and
real wage flexibility, it is that overlapping centralised and decentralised
structures combine the worst of both worlds. So, having embarked on the
decentralised route, Britain's best chance of improving its
unemployment/inflation trade-off would be to continue in that direction.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr CHRIS ROWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT's coverage of the railway signal workers' dispute (such as
'Signal workers reach crucial turning point', July 13) is over-simplistic.
It continues to ignore that:
The RMT union has little option but to pursue the long-standing grievances
of the signal workers, particularly as these workers had their own union in
the past.
If Railtrack forces a cessation of the strikes, it may not end grievances
and conflict in the signal boxes.
Fewer, larger, hi-tech signal boxes, each covering many miles of track, will
greatly enhance the strategic power of the remaining signal workers in the
future.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I read with dismay Clement Crisp's pompous article (Arts: 'The decline and
fall of elegance', July 18) about dressing up for Covent Garden.
I would love to dress up to go to Covent Garden, but as I have to buy my own
ticket to attend the Royal Opera House (and also English National Opera) on
a regular basis, I am only able to afford a seat in the lower or upper slips
if I wish to see all the new and the old operas. As an office worker, there
is not enough time for me to have a meal before the performance; and, as I
have to leave promptly at the end to catch a late train home, I picnic on
the stairs in the interval (this also keeps my costs down for the evening).
Besides, there are often long queues in the smoke-filled bars.
In the circumstances, I prefer to be a regular opera-goer even if it means
sitting in a cheap seat - among the real opera buffs who go to see and not
to be seen]

FT  21 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Wedge' versus 'social wage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theories about the causes and cure of unemployment arrive in every post. One
way to keep one's head above water is to examine together clusters of ideas
with a common core, even though this does less than justice to each
individual variant. A cluster, known for a long time but growing in
popularity, is called the 'wedge theory'.
The wedge is the gap between what the employer pays in wages and what the
worker takes home. In its simplest form it runs: there are so many add-ons
on top of the wage bill to pay for social benefits that labour has become
expensive to employ. Non-wage labour costs were estimated by a House of
Lords report1 to amount to 44 per cent of total labour costs as an EU
average, but 'only' 30 per cent in the UK. In Japan they were 24 per cent
and in the US 28 per cent. Businesses understandably seek to avoid these
add-ons by mechanisation, labour-saving drives, macho-management and so on.
As Anthony de Jasay2 has put it: 'Social protection costs more than it is
worth to at least some of those that it protects. The result is that, at the
margin, employment is taxed more than the subsidy is worth to workers . . .
and there is a net extra burden on the economy. Enterprises have to
restructure and unemployment is born of social protection.'
Why are these wedge theories so familiar? It is because they have been
previously promulgated in a very different political setting by leaders such
as Harold Wilson, UK Labour prime minister in the 1960s and part of the
1970s.
Wilson called the wedge the 'social wage'; and he used it to sell pay
restraint, arguing that real wages were much higher than take-home pay
because part of workers' remuneration took the form of welfare state
benefits, such as health, education, social security and so on. He used this
notion in his campaign for pay restraint.
One of the most numerically sophisticated recent attempts to stand up the
wedge doctrine has come from a US securities economist, John Mueller3. He
relates unemployment to what economists used to call 'efficiency wages',
that is pay adjusted for prices and productivity. He shows that, on
plausible assumptions, efficiency wages can be approximated by 'labour's
share of the national income'. To arrive at the latter he subtracts from
gross pay taxes on labour, such as payroll levies and a share of income tax.
He adds on domestic transfer payments, which are mainly for social security.
The adjusted series throws light on one paradox: why has UK unemployment
risen so much over the last decade and half when the combination of labour
market shakeout and Thatcherite policies has pressed down on pay relative to
profits? The accompanying chart suggests that although the employees' share
of the national income has fallen, labour's share, after making the fiscal
adjustments just described, has actually been 5 to 10 percentage points
higher than it was in the 1970s.
There are several points to clarify. It is not always realised that there is
little difference, apart from presentation, between social security
contributions levied on employers and those levied on employees. Both will
be passed forward into the cost of labour. For instance, the main impact of
UK mainstream National Insurance contributions derives from their total
weight of just over 20 per cent, rather than from the fact that they are
divided almost equally between employers and employees.
In some European countries with high payroll contributions, a shift from
payroll taxes to income taxes or indirect taxes such as VAT has been
discussed. But this would not solve the problem either. Income tax is - like
payroll taxes - an almost proportional levy on wages and salaries, with some
alleviation at the bottom of the scale. Indirect taxes are taxes on that
proportion of income (about 90 per cent) that is spent. If workers have the
market power to make employers recoup in higher pay the burden of payroll
taxes, they also have the power to recoup other taxes levied directly on
their incomes or expenditure.
The wedge theory was originally advanced not as an explanation for
unemployment, but as a warning about the distortions to the supply of effort
which too ambitious a welfare state could impose. This can be seen from the
earlier writings4 of Assar Lindbeck, the Swedish economist who pioneered the
wedge theory when Sweden still had full employment.
The wedge may nonetheless affect employment for three reasons:
Workers do not value the social wage as much as take-home pay, and at the
margin are less inclined to take jobs or more inclined to work shorter
hours. Unemployment of this kind is surely voluntary.
Union representatives do not fully take into account the social wage and
insist on higher settlements than they otherwise would, to recoup the tax
wedge. As a result, workers are priced out of jobs.
There are many factors other than the immediate state of the labour market
that determine employers' pay offers. These factors cover ideas of fairness
and a desire for labour goodwill. They discourage employers from trying to
recoup the wedge in lower pay, but they respond by cutting payrolls instead.
Other questions arise. Why should the size of the wedge be limited to
benefit expenditure? De Jasay includes all welfare expenditure - health and
education as well as benefits. But why stop even there? Surely taxes on
workers to pay for military expenditure, public administration or interest
on the national debt are just as much part of the wedge.
What then are the policy implications of the wedge theory? Many of the
academics who espouse it suggest that social security contributions should
be actuarially related to benefits. In other words, contributions to finance
the dole should be related to the chance of falling out of work in the
particular occupation; and social security rates should be sufficient to
finance state pensions on normal actuarial expectations.
In these circumstances, the argument goes, payroll levies would be for
defined benefits, for which workers would be prepared to pay without
recouping in wages. The view is plausible only if the actuarial
contributions are also voluntary - in which case a social security system
could hardly be said to exist. Moreover, the actuarial principle could not
realistically cover health and education, let alone non-welfare spending.
The whole focus on non-wage labour costs is open to suspicion. It appeals to
politicians because it looks less like union-bashing; and British ministers
can also feel self-satisfied because the burden of these costs is less in
the UK than in other EU countries.
But it is surely total labour costs per head which determine whether it is
worthwhile to employ an extra person. These include pay and non-pay
elements. Some of the latter escape measurement, such as restrictions on
hours or on adjusting pay fully to age, experience or skill. All these
things make workers expensive and it is arbitrary to pick on any one of
them. 'Pricing out of work' is still the best encompassing formula.

SIRENS (15) John Duigan
LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS (18) Denys Arcand
THE FLINTSTONES (U) Brian Levant
SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (U) David Hand
MY GIRL 2 (PG) Howard ZieffSirens is a smug, frothy ode to bohemianism that
leaves you wondering if stuffy conservatism might not be such a bad way of
life after all.
Set in 1930s Australia, it concerns a young English vicar (Hugh Grant) who
is asked to try to persuade the rebellious artist Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill)
to remove an allegedly blasphemous painting from an exhibition. The vicar
travels to the painter's remote studio accompanied by his new bride (Tara
Fitzgerald), the sort of repressed Englishwoman abroad who has become a
stock-in-trade in art house cinemas of late.
The buttoned-up couple discover that Neill leads a seemingly amoral
existence with a free-thinking wife and three dishy models, all of whom pose
naked for his racy, idiosyncratic paintings.
The vicar proves no match for all that naturalism, while his wife soon lets
her hair down, aided by a steamy encounter with a brain-damaged ranch-hand
who looks like a blind Chippendale.
The promise of Elle Macpherson (as the lead model) turning Hugh Grant on to
the more earthly pleasures in a film which espouses creativity over
convention should have proved a winning formula.
Unfortunately, the film's celebration of artistic freedom is so
self-satisfied that it defeats itself at just about every turn.
Neill and his models are so piously cocksure about their lives that it is
they who come across as the fundamentalists, utterly contemptuous of anybody
or anything that does not fit their narrow sensual agenda.
Grant and Fitzgerald, meanwhile, prove to be the only real human beings,
flawed yet likable characters who are willing to listen, grow and love.
You soon pity them for having to endure this squad of cultural onanists for
more than a few minutes. Now, if this ironic reversal had been intended it
would have made for a fine comedy, but director John Duigan takes his bohos
seriously, littering the film with Edenic imagery of snakes and apples and
references to lost paradises.
Indeed, there is something brazenly two-faced about a film which lectures
you on the value of artistic integrity while shoving a nude supermodel in
your face at every opportunity.
Grant's and Fitzgerald's eventual conversion to a more sensual life is
utterly unbelievable, more a product of wishful thinking on the director's
part than anything intrinsic in the story.
* Where Sirens is never more than a pale imitation of art, Love and Human
Remains looks like the real thing.
French Canadian director Denys Arcand's first English language feature has
the messy, enthralling feel of modern life. It centres on David (Thomas
Gibson), a gay actor who rooms with Candy (Ruth Marshall), a depressive book
reviewer.
She secretly loves him, while herself serving as the object of the
frustrated affections of a lesbian schoolteacher and a married bartender.
David, meanwhile, divides his time between his womanising best friend, a
confused rich boy and a clairvoyant dominatrix.
While Arcand might not reach the dizzying mythic heights of his Jesus of
Montreal here, he does manage to create a film whose honesty is disturbing.
For the most part, he avoids emotional cliches and facile resolutions as he
charts the interactions of this diverse group. David believes he can live
without love yet finds that this refusal causes pain to everyone around him,
while Candy wrongly thinks she can love several people equally.
It is only in a gratuitous subplot involving a serial killer that Arcand
falters - his vision is much too strong to need such artificial bolstering.
* The Flintstones is a curious cultural phenomenon. Not a film in any
meaningful way, it is rather a Dollars 30 million exercise in problem
solving on the part of supremo Steven Spielberg and his crew.
Can the filmmakers accurately reproduce the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoon
using live actors and real sets? Can they create a world in which everything
is made of leather and rock, where dinosaurs and people coexist, where every
name is a paleolithic pun? Can John Goodman as Fred bring to mind the
shambolic presence beloved by a generation of couch potatoes? Can the
special effects boffins fabricate a credible Dino?
It is a measure of how dismal the film is that, even though the answer to
all these questions is yes, you are still left with a tediously pointless 90
minutes. The few good moments - a living garbage disposal, a soap opera
called 'The Young and the Thumbless' - are not nearly enough to sustain a
project which completely abandons the adult irony and Middle America satire
that makes the cartoon so enjoyable.
The filmmakers must hope that we are so dopey with nostalgia and impressed
by the film's dubious cartoon-into-life alchemy that we will forgive them
for not bothering to entertain us.
Or maybe Spielberg just had some dinosaurs left over from Jurassic Park.
* At the end of The Flintstones there is a moment when a prehistoric bird,
facing imminent extinction, rues not having signed a contract with Disney.
'They would never have done this to me,' he quips.
How true, as this week's reissue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs reminds
us. It is nice to see that there are examples of animation created by people
who believe in the art form still on show.
* Interestingly, the Disney classic is not the most schmaltzy film on offer
this week. This distinction must go to My Girl 2. For those who missed the
original episode - congratulations. That said, at least the first instalment
provided the unalloyed pleasure of watching Macaulay Culkin die horribly in
a bee-sting accident.
No such luck here as Anna Chlumsky, now 13, reprises her role as the
motherless girl with a heart of gold. As part of a school project, she
travels to LA to research her dead mother's life, discovering that she was
in fact a serial killer and an S&amp;M hooker who . . . just kidding.
The film's only distinction is its uncanny ability to present a world in
which everyone, including a sergeant in the Los Angeles Police Department,
is unfailingly nice. Good soundtrack, though.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Arts: Peter Brooke bows out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone knew Peter Brooke was about to lose his job as the national
heritage minister. Always good humoured and laid back, he has seemed even
more relaxed in recent weeks as he dutifully attended the arts functions,
the heritage briefings, the broadcasting confrontations and the sports
meetings which litter the life of the Minister of Fun.
He only got the job because of the sudden crisis in September 1992, when
David Mellor, the prime minister's friend and the main advocate of the new
ministry, was forced out of government. Brooke was chosen as a safe pair of
hands who, at 58, harboured no great ambitions. He has done his duty with
urbanity and pragmatism and leaves with the warm goodwill of most of the
disparate band of supplicants who look to the heritage minister for funds.
His great achievements were getting the Lottery up and running with little
fuss, and securing a new charter for the BBC. He has proceeded slowly and
safely with other broadcasting reforms; he has proved a friend of the media
by not rushing through a draconian Privacy Act; and as a collector of
watercolours and an old-fashioned gentleman he was a quiet supporter of the
heritage lobby.
He cut the Arts Council grant this year - the first time ever - but he will
argue that he fought his corner against an axe-wielding Treasury with skill.
Things might have been worse and the total budget of his ministry increased,
quite an achievement.
He reformed the council gently, making it more accountable. Perhaps his
greatest long-term contribution was to strengthen its management by
appointing Lord Gowrie as chairman, and names such as Trevor Nunn and
Richard Rogers as members.
Like his predecessors Brooke failed to get to grips with the British Library
juggernaut, which acts like a leech on his budget and got him embroiled
earlier with the Commons Heritage Committee, which yesterday released a
scathing report.
He also lacked imagination in dealing with the powerful British film lobby:
the UK still starves its movie makers of necessary financial incentives.
His main blunders were small but emotive. He failed to catch the public mood
after fire destroyed part of Windsor Castle and unwisely pledged government
money for the rebuilding, and he somehow messed up the D-Day commemoration.
If John Major was looking for an excuse to shed him, rousing the ire of the
strongest Conservative lobby in the land provided it.
But Peter Brooke went because he was expendable, and because he was too
sensitive and restrained to bang the promotional drum. The Heritage Ministry
was designed as a vote winner for the government, to spread a powerful
feel-good atmosphere throughout the land. Mellor had the personality to lead
the parade; it went against Brooke's grain.
It might suit Brooke's successor, Stephen Dorrell, rather well. He is a
politician on the make. He will see heritage as a step up the ladder. He
will raise his profile through the ministry, and be keen to demonstrate that
this is one government department that sees its job as improving the mental,
and physical, health of the people. He is as much the new-style politician
as Peter Brooke represented the dying breed.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Arts: Message lost in double Dutch - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among other things, the Almeida Festival has brought us the Schoenberg
Quartet from the Netherlands, and in turn they brought us not only two works
by their eponym, but two recent Dutch pieces.
One of them was Louis Andriessen's 1991 quartet Facing Death, from about the
time of his De Materie - an imposing success, as I reported here, at the
South Bank's Meltdown festival; so I went.
There is nothing much new to report about Andriessen. Like each movement of
De Materie, Facing Death (title unexplained) explores a narrow vein at
relentless length, here a jazzily syncopated tune in innumerable variants
and simple counterpoint.
It just about succeeded in holding our interest, and might do so a second
time or even perhaps a third; but around then its sell-by date may have
passed. Such obsessive, close-focus treatment works better as a segment of a
larger whole than as a self-standing piece - at least when it takes some 20
hectic, exhausting minutes.
Though the Schoenberg Quartet are doughty players, they missed the degree of
gleaming precision that Reinbert de Leeuw got from his De Materie bands, and
there were occasional lapses in pitch.
Yet they are a keen, intelligent ensemble: blunt and sometimes - to
non-Dutch ears, anyhow - even graceless, but attentively musical and fully
equal to severe technical demands. In Schoenberg's Ode to Napoleon (after
Byron) they gave us a superbly lucid performance, better than almost any I
have heard of this gritty, angry piece, and Michael Grandage delivered the
text with grand Byronic flair.
Sepp Grotenhuis, the excellent pianist in the Ode, sounded odder in Webern's
quintet-version of Schoenberg's evergreen Chamber Symphony no. 1 for 15
instruments.
Certainly Webern's arrangement sets knotty problems of balance - even more
than the original] - but can Grotenhuis really have listened to the
original, so as to learn what he was standing in for? In the event, he let
subsidiary voices loom up like the Kraken's howl while understating the
crucial ones. It was like meeting the work in a reversed negative: weirdly
fascinating if you already knew it, baffling (though maybe exciting) if you
didn't.
I hesitate to mention the fourth work, the First Quartet of Klaas de Vries,
because I could make no sense of it. I could describe it - its elements are
not complicated, and they include some deliberate (very faint) echoes of
earlier quartets; but what it thought it was saying, or doing, remained
opaque to me.
There is perhaps a dense Dutch sub-culture of musical avant-garderie which
has taken different turns from those familiar elsewhere; if one doesn't know
the local history, its latest products may well be impenetrable.

Since 1982 more than 100m Swatches have been sold worldwide, and today
children at fee paying schools are more likely to collect the Swiss fashion
accessory than stamps. The Business looks at the plastic phenomenon which is
credited with saving the Swiss watch industry and considers plans for the
Swatchmobile city car (7.30 BBC2). The last of the present series of
Hypotheticals is concerned with euthanasia (8.00 BBC2). ITV begins another
new comedy series: Downwardly Mobile in which poor but happy Rosemary
(Frances de la Tour) and Clem find themselves providing house room for
Clem's whiz kid brother and his insensitive wife Sophie (Josie Lawrence)
(8.30). Modernising zoos probably comes pretty low down the list of
priorities in the ex-communist east European states, yet the horrific
pictures shown so far in State Of The Ark suggest that, if more humanity is
one of the aims of the new states, then perhaps better treatment of animals
in confinement should come quite high up the list. Today's programme (9.30
BBC2) visits zoos in Romania and Armenia.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Arts: The Miracle Worker - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What an extraordinary play The Miracle Worker is. Such a standby for
provincial reps, such an easy option for tatty tours. Yet despite vague
memories of William Gibson's 1959 Broadway success as a well-tailored
tear-jerker, the piece works theatrically every time.
Of course, the plot is fool-proof: the true story of how the infant Helen
Keller, blind, deaf and dumb and reduced to the status of an imperfectly
domesticated animal, was rescued from this living death by an inspired
teacher, Annie Sullivan, half-blind herself and from a heart-rendingly
deprived background.
The moment of breakthrough towards the end of the play, when the wild and
speechless child makes the connection between the finger-language words
pressed out on her palm and the actual outside world, is tremendous theatre.
I defy any cynic to be unmoved.
The scene passes with flying colours in the production by Richard Olivier at
the Comedy Theatre, even cast with a shrewd-looking Helen, for whom
communication is patently only a matter of time, and an Annie whose cool
confidence is never really in doubt.
If juvenile memory serves me, London's original Annie was Anna Massey, whose
gawky, homely vulnerability marked her as potentially one of life's losers.
She had to fight to survive, let alone sustain the effort of will to drag
her pupil into the world. Here we have Jenny Seagrove, fine-boned, delicate,
beautiful, an obvious heroine figure despite all her anguished, haunted
recollections of the little brother who died in the workhouse.
Catherine Holman gives a technically remarkable performance as Helen,
convulsive, scenting strangers like an animal, switching from tantrums to
the pathetic demand for comfort and reassurance.
But she misses the frighteningly feral quality that some actresses have
brought to the role. There is no need to be brought up by wolves to be wild;
helplessly indulgent parents in well-to-do Alabama in the 1880s will do the
trick for you just as well.
The play is funnier than might be expected, the humour centring on the
blusteringly bewhiskered paterfamilias, Captain Keller. There are queasy
hints that he is meant to be a lovable old softy - and a wispy sub-plot
concerning tensions with his grown-up son steer dangerously near the
squelchy quicksands of pop'n'junior plays - but William Gaunt gives him
tough authority.
Judi Bowker's Mrs Keller is also a rounded character, understandably
inclined to indulge her maimed child. If, as with other aspects of the
production, Annie's struggle to tame her bristling, isolated pupil looks a
trifle contrived - one long, soundless physical scuffle is as elaborately
choreographed as any western saloon-bar brawl - the message emerges clearly.
For Annie Sullivan it was not enough to transform the untamed creature into
a clean, napkin-wielding household pet; Helen had to be made as aware of,
and as hungry for, the richness of life as any normal person. Here acting,
production and the play itself come into their own.
The Comedy Theatre.

FT  21 JUL 94 / People: Sabberwal helps take off the brakes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the motor components and materials group, yesterday announced the
appointment of Amar Sabberwal, chief executive of the company's friction
products division, to the board of Japan Brake International, the Japanese
vehicle parts business.
Sabberwal, 60, is expected to strengthen the existing links between T&amp;N and
JBI, which in 1990 formed a joint venture company, Ferodo Automotive
Products, in Nashville, Tennessee, to supply brake pads and linings to
Japanese car plants in North America and indigenous US manufacturers.
Although Sabberwal will remain in charge of the frictions business, Colin
Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, says his position with JBI would
enhance an association which has 'helped T&amp;N to meet its Japanese customers'
needs and led to T&amp;N being the first choice supplier to Japanese plants in
Europe and the US'.
The move marks the latest in a series of promotions for Sabberwal, who was
named an executive director in 1989 after serving on the board of TN
Technology, T&amp;N's central research and development facility.
Before that he was managing director of BIP Chemicals and managing director
of T&amp;N Materials Research. He is also a non-executive director of University
of Salford Holdings.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Virgin Atlantic Airways directors are leaving the group as a result of
a reorganisation of senior management. A six-person supervisory board has
been created, reporting to executive chairman Richard Branson.
The streamlined structure, which was devised after consultation with 40
middle managers, is intended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
the airline's senior management, and give the 10-year-old company a better
structure to compete into the next century.
It replaces a system comprising two joint managing directors, reporting to
Branson, and ten other directors. As a result, Syd Pennington, one of the
joint mds, has left the airline but is in discussions on a possible role
within Virgin Group.
The other joint md, Roy Gardner, is to become chief executive of a new
company, Virgin Atlantic Engineering, which will meet the airline's
engineering needs but also seek external customers.
Sales director Rohan Alce, engineering director Dick Plowes and personnel
director Nick Potts have also left or are leaving because their
responsibilities will be handled by the new, slimmed-down board, all of
whose members are internally recruited.
'With this new supervisory board, we will be giving our directors and their
staff greater responsibility for the areas they manage and putting in place
the right teams for the right jobs,' Branson said.

Hoare's senior management need not worry too much about its latest recruit

FT  21 JUL 94 / Technology: Inventors with time to think - A look at the
potential of independent projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate research is excellent at bringing incremental improvements to
technology that is already available, but it is far less good at coming up
with bright ideas that could lead directly to entirely new products. And
when it does the final connection may not be made.
It was, for instance, Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Centre in
California that did much of the work leading to intuitive interaction with
computers based on using visual icons on the screen. Seeing itself as a
copier company, however, Xerox did not reap the benefit of the ideas
embodied in the prototype 'Star workstation'. Apple Computer's Steve Jobs
did.
To overcome this kind of mental block, David Liddle, formerly of Xerox
Corporation, and Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft, have set up
Interval Research, which aims to explore new ways that we might interact
with technology.
They dislike being labelled a thinktank. 'We are inventors, not writers of
papers,' says Bill Verplank, a researcher at the company who worked on the
Star workstation. Interval Research, of Palo Alto, has a foundation
investment of Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) to fund it over five years.
This provides breathing space - the 'interval' - to embark on projects that
are not beholden to any particular manufacturer or type of product. 'A lot
of the computer companies are so tied up in doing incremental product
design, that it is difficult to stand back and say, well, 'what's the next
great thing to do?',' says research fellow Colin Burns.
Interval Research aims to profit from its inventions by selling its ideas or
by spinning off small, start-up companies to pursue them further.
In London, Liddle has arranged the five-year sponsorship of a research
design studio at the Royal College of Art. The Pounds 2.5m programme will
allow Interval researchers to participate in design projects at the college
and students to work in California. The RCA is the first design school
Interval has worked with.
'They are interested in the different take that designers have from
engineers,' says Gillian Crampton-Smith, professor of computer-related
design at the RCA. The other aim of the liaison is to encourage involvement
from British and European companies. The RCA already has links with
companies such as BT, Logica and Philips, which are likely to take an active
role.
The starting point for Interval Research activity is 'interaction design' -
the shaping of the way people use technology. Disciplines as diverse as
design, psychology, anthropology and dramatic arts are brought under this
banner in an attempt to make people's interaction with products more
natural.
One topic concerns 'place' in a computer environment. For example, asks
Crampton-Smith, 'how do you do the equivalent of putting your head round the
door of the canteen to see if there is anyone there you would like to have a
chat with?' Designers can use their skill in visualising in three dimensions
to give this electronic landscape an appearance that is usable in an
intuitive way. Such understanding is expected to help in the design of
products that incorporate a computer in such a way that its presence does
not intimidate ordinary users.
One putative example is a telephone-answering machine designed by Durrell
Bishop, a graduate of the RCA and now a research fellow at Interval. This
would spit out messages in the form of marbles with solid-state memory chips
embedded in them; to replay the message, the user would simply drop the
marble into the right slot on the machine.
Other items on the research agenda include the combinination of forms of
sensory interaction - sound and a more subtle use of feel as well as sight
and touch. As Crampton-Smith points out: 'We are stuck with a keyboard and a
mouse and pathetic feedback, so that you have to concentrate on using a
computer. You should be able to concentrate on your work.'

Unofficial estimates suggest that more than 50m men in Europe and the US
suffer from impotence. The true figure could be much higher because it is a
condition that many are reluctant to discuss with their doctors.
Most sufferers go untreated not least because there are no attractive
remedies available. The only drugs sanctioned by health regulatory
authorities are muscle relaxants that improve blood flow to the penis. They
must be given by injection and the effect lasts an hour or so.
But now, clinical trials have started on a pill which might do the trick.
Texas biotechnology company Zonagen has obtained a licence to commercialise
research conducted by Adrian Zorgniotti, professor of clinical urology at
New York University School of Medicine.
He worked on drugs that had a much more modest effect than the injection.
Zonagen's compound seems simply to make a man more likely to achieve an
erection rather than trigger an uncontrolled response.
It also seems to be more effective with men who suffer from impotence than
those who do not, providing some reassurance to health regulators who fear
that the drug will find a market as an aphrodisiac.
But apart from a physiological response, little is known about how it works,
admits Joseph Podolski, Zonagen's president. The tablet takes effect about
15 minutes after being swallowed and works best with men whose impotence
derives from psychological problems or poor arterial blood flow.
Even its name is under wraps while Zonagen tries to secure patent
protection. It was originally developed in the 1950s as a heart treatment
and Zonagen fears that without the threat of patent action, manufacturers of
the heart treatment will simply offer a tablet version.
At least the trial results should be clear quickly, says Podolski, and a
product could be on the market within two years.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Technology: Chemistry by design - Scientists are
constructing enzymes artificially
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL MILGROM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine looking down the barrel of a microscope at a single wriggling cell.
It could be a deadly bacterium, a human sperm or a white blood cell. The
tiny, writhing glob of protoplasm is a highly efficient chemical factory,
doing the same as any other chemical plant the world over - making and
transforming chemicals.
The chemical output from a cell is minuscule - micrograms compared with the
tonnes from man-made chemical factories. But cells are doing chemistry
faster and more efficiently than any chemical plant is ever likely to do.
For example, it would require a laboratory the size of Britain to reproduce
the number of chemical reactions in a single cell using conventional
chemistry.
A cell's ability to package and control complex chemical processes is
awe-inspiring. With pressure building on chemical manufacturers to clean up
their operations, while remaining competitive and profitable, research
chemists are now taking a hard look at how cells do chemistry with a view to
mimicking the process.
One area being studied is enzymes, made from large, intricately folded,
protein molecules. Enzymes can orchestrate almost every chemical process in
cells with total finesse, speed and selectivity. They can bring together two
seemingly unreactive molecules (by recognising them), make them react
(catalysing reactions between molecules which under normal circumstances
would not react or would take a long time to do so), and then release the
products, ready to start the cycle again. This is all done in less than one
ten-millionth of a second, with a subtlety that ensures only one chemical
outcome from the many possibilities available.
In contrast to the slow, comparatively haphazard progress of man-made
chemical reactions, enzymes make and break chemical bonds in a fast and
controlled manner.
'The trouble is we don't know all the rules of this game yet,' says Jeremy
Sanders, a chemistry lecturer at Cambridge University in the UK. 'We want to
build molecules that mimic enzymes in order to discover those rules,'
Sanders adds, and not purely for the chemical insights such a discovery
would bring.
Artificial enzymes are being developed from the insights obtained so far.
Although inferior to the real thing, they are built out of simpler, tougher,
molecular components that are relatively easy for chemists to assemble.
Molecules like these could one day help chemists perform their own,
large-scale chemical processes, much faster and more efficiently.
How is an artificial enzyme made? There are two approaches: by design and by
empirical research. In the design approach, a particular system is selected
and made, preferably out of molecular building blocks enabling a big
molecule (artificial enzymes have to be big in order to contain the reacting
molecules) to be assembled in as few steps as possible.
The new molecule is then studied to see how well it binds other molecules
and makes them react. 'The beauty of this approach,' says Sanders, 'is that
we know what we are trying to make, so we can build in rational changes as
we go along. The disadvantage is that because we don't know all the rules
yet, any molecule we design is likely to fail as an artificial enzyme.' In
other words, the design approach involves inspired guesswork. Nevertheless,
Sanders and his Cambridge team have had some success.
In constructing their artificial enzymes, the researchers adopt a minimalist
approach. Their target molecules consist simply of a rigid cavity with
several binding sites for other molecules (real enzymes, of course, are more
flexible and much more complicated). Nevertheless, one of Sanders's rigid
cavities can speed up, by approximately a thousandfold, an industrially
important reaction, called the Diels-Alder reaction - used to make
insecticides.
Sanders's rigid cavity accelerates the Diels-Alder reaction much less than
real enzymes speed up their reactions. Also, the Diels-Alder products remain
strongly bound within the cavity, so that Sanders's molecules are not
behaving as true catalysts. Even so, they are much tougher than real
enzymes.
In its latest work, Sanders's group has tried out artificial enzymes on a
different type of reaction; this time, they behave as proper catalysts.
Again, the rate of acceleration of the reaction is nowhere near as good as
that achieved by enzymes, but it is a start. 'We have a long way to go
before we have synthetic enzymes worthy of the name,' says Sanders, 'but at
least we know it can be done.'
The empirical approach can quickly generate a large number of molecules  -
usually big proteins called catalytic antibodies - for testing as enzyme
mimics. The most catalytically active ones are then selected.
The disadvantages with this approach are that it can be difficult to
identify a catalytically-active species. The very nature of these catalytic
antibodies also makes them difficult to modify in any systematic way. Both
these disadvantages can lead to problems in figuring out the rules that the
empirical approach was intended to understand in the first place.
Nevertheless, Frederic Menger and his chemistry team at Emory University in
Atlanta have come up with a simple enzyme mimic based on the empirical
approach. It operates in a way that many chemists believe enzymes may have
evolved billions of years ago.
Enzymes work by bringing together two molecules leaving them no choice but
to react. Menger uses molecules with long, fatty chains at one end and
reactive sites at the other. When the mixture is put in water, the fatty
chains cause the molecules to behave like oil and form a clump. As with
enzymes their reactive ends are now so close together they react very
smartly indeed.
'It's almost as if our randomly created clumps are like random mutations,'
says Menger.
The artificial enzymes Sanders and Menger have created could be the
blueprint for future industrial chemical catalysts. The rules and criteria
these and other chemists working in this field are discovering, seem set to
revolutionise chemistry in the 21st century.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): From neutral to
higher gear - A revamped BHS hopes to excite shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not enough people get up in the morning and think 'I must go to BHS'. That
is the problem Helena Packshaw, marketing director of the British retailer,
faces as she attempts to transform the chain into a 'destination' store,
rather than somewhere shoppers just drift in to from the high street.
The BHS brand, says Packshaw, is 'too neutral'. Christopher Satterthwaite,
from BHS's advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, puts it more
bluntly: 'Reality and perception are not matching now. It's better than you
expected when you go in the store.'
The first evidence of a vast brand-building exercise aimed at remedying this
situation is about to hit the television screens as BHS starts to advertise
for the first time in about five years. The logo has also been revamped and,
from next year, the shop interiors will also begin to look different.
The moves are part of the restructuring and recovery of the Storehouse
group, of which BHS is part. The last three or four years have been spent
developing a young, energetic organisation, and defining the store's 'value
proposition' says Packshaw.
The three parts of this proposition, central to the way the brand is
promoted, are: 'fashion-moderate' products, which are up-to-date but
mainstream, rather than at the cutting-edge of fashion; consistent and
appropriate quality; and low prices attractive to mothers on tight budgets,
who form by far the largest group among BHS's customers.
The TV advertising, which starts in early August, will use real people at
specially-staged 'happenings' in BHS stores around the country. In a new
piece of advertising jargon which, one suspects, will not catch on,
Satterthwaite hails the campaign as 'Fresh TV'. There will be just a few
days' gap between filming and screening, and a new ad will be made about
every two weeks.
Pilot advertisements were shot in Watford last month. Over one day, five
'beach parties' were staged in BHS stores in the town. Members of the public
were stopped on the street, invited to join the parties and to take part in
catwalk shows featuring BHS clothing. The linkman, a young black actor
called Sylvester, is the only professional to appear in the ads.
Out of this unscripted filming, a 60-second commercial is distilled. There
is a deliberately 'home movie' feel, with black and white video until the
point when the BHS products are featured, when the film moves into colour.
The overall effect is lively and loud, with Sylvester as a slightly nervous
parody of the male in the traditional soap powder advertisements.
The format will be adapted to show different seasons' clothes and could also
be extended to other BHS lines, for example its lighting. The first place to
get the treatment will be Gateshead's giant shopping centre, the
MetroCentre.
The idea of the in-store 'event' will be used to drive local publicity and
as a general promotional tool, and will be extended to shops which are not
featured in the TV commercials. The intention is that customers should be
able to go to the stores and immediately locate the merchandise featured on
television.
The new logo is, says Packshaw, a 'more feminine, more fluid' version of the
existing one, which is 'OK but doesn't give her (the customer) the feeling
of excitement or energy' that BHS is keen should be associated with the
brand.
Do not expect to see the new logo on high-street shop fronts for some time.
The 122 fascias will be replaced as stores are refurbished. In any case,
Packshaw believes that customers know where their local BHS store is and so
rarely look up at the sign.
Instead, the company is concentrating on getting the new logo on to carrier
bags, inside the stores for displays, and on to labels.
The final piece in the jigsaw is a revamp of the store interiors which,
Packshaw says, will show merchandising off to greater effect and 'allow it
to breathe'. The new look is being unveiled in the Cambridge store next
year.
As far as the entire strategy is concerned, Packshaw will want to see
concrete evidence of success. The shops currently show Pounds 200-Pounds 220
revenue per square foot, compared with about Pounds 400 at Marks and
Spencer, she says.
Although no one is expecting sales densities to double overnight, there will
have to be an appreciable narrowing of this gap.
Apart from sales, there will also be longer-term measurement of perceptions
of the brand, for the campaign 'is also about elevating the brand in the
minds of people to whom it might be neutral'.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hospitality joins
the fast track - A look at the business of sport and its value to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The popularity of corporate hospitality or employee motivation evenings in
the form of 'arrive and drive' go-kart racing has inspired dozens of
circuits catering for the activity throughout Europe.
The concept is poised to be lifted on to an altogether higher plateau - with
200 horsepower Alfa Romeo 155 saloons of similar appearance, if not quite
the performance, of the bright red Alfa Romeos currently leading the British
Touring Car Championship.
Companies, or even wealthy individual drivers, will rent every car competing
in the 'Pro-Series' Alfa 155 championship planned for the 1995 motor racing
season.
The championship departs from conventional motor sport concepts in that
sponsoring companies and their drivers can expect to complete a full
championship season at a fixed cost, with the onus on providing raceworthy
cars for each round switched to the actual operator of the championship.
The venture operators, Graham Hathaway Racing and entrepreneur and
rallycross driver Peter Earnshaw, will retain full ownership of the cars;
repair, maintain and take them to and from the circuit, and provide the
hospitality facilities for participating companies to entertain their
guests.
Pioneered in North America in the Zerex Saab championship, the concept is
intended to eliminate one of the biggest disincentives to all commercial
motor sport sponsorship, spending spiralling out of control as competitors
seek technical advantage over rivals.
Motor sport is an expensive activity, with even a single-car budget for a
modest 'one-make' championship likely to approach Pounds 50,000 for a
season. It is also notorious for its disillusioned sponsors. Many companies
vow never to involve themselves again when confronted with a choice between
injecting extra funds part way through a season or their team's withdrawal
and the collapse of the sponsorship venture.
Earnshaw, who is currently negotiating approval and administration of the
series with the British Automobile Racing Club and motor sport authorities,
says that companies not wanting to back a single car will instead be able to
join a small pool of sponsors whose branding will be carried on every
competing car throughout the dozen or so races which will make up the
championship.
The concept is about offering a financially predictable, rather than
necessarily cheaper, entree into motor sport. Costs have not been finalised
but several thousand pounds per race is certain.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Game of sponsorship
 -A look at the business of sport and its value to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sport is not just a game. It is a business. Anyone who doubts this need only
consider the sponsorship contract signed this week between Mercury Asset
Management, the UK's biggest fund management group, and cricketer Brian
Lara.
The sponsorship deal, valued by Lara's agent at Pounds 500,000 - but which
MAM insists is actually Pounds 100,000 - illustrates the value which a
financial services firm, whose products have nothing to do with cricket,
places on sport.
Among financial services companies MAM, which is considering further sports
sponsorship deals aimed at encouraging junior competitors in a wide variety
of sports, is hardly alone. National Westminster Bank, sponsors since 1981
of the one-day NatWest Cricket Trophy, spent Pounds 450,000 on
sports-related promotion last year. Scottish Provident signed a contract
worth Pounds 600,000 with ITV to sponsor the last British Lions rugby tour.
Cornhill Insurance sponsors a cricket series and Britannic Assurance
sponsors county cricket championships. London Global Securities, which
specialises in international securities lending, sponsored Eamonn Martin,
winner of the 1993 London Marathon.
In the UK, according to Mintel, the market research group, corporate
sponsorship covers a range of sports from swimming to darts. Sports
sponsorship deals in 1993 were valued at Pounds 242m and is forecast to grow
to Pounds 250m this year.
But what does an advertiser gain from sports sponsorship, particularly when
the product is unrelated to sport?
MAM said this week that it wishes to draw a connection between the
excellence at sport demonstrated by Lara - who holds two world cricket
batting records - with its fund management skills.
Significantly, the Mintel research showed that four of the eight leading
corporate sponsors of cricket in 1993 were in the financial services
industry. Among so-called AB television viewers whose incomes and
educational levels are the highest in the country, cricket ranked number
five of all sports watched, with 31.7 per cent of that socio-economic group
choosing to watch it.
Mike Bloxham, director of The Bloxham Group, a company which helps corporate
clients devise long-term sponsorship strategies, says that sport may be a
way for a financial services firm to reach a much broader audience than
other forms of advertising.
'People who could be buyers of their products may not encounter their name
in everyday life. It's not like Heinz,' he says. For a company such as MAM,
which opted for individual sportsman sponsorship instead of team or event
sponsorship, there can be a specific marketing goal. 'One approach to
sponsoring individuals is that they can be seen to encapsulate certain
values with which the sponsor wishes to associate himself.'
The downside with individual sportsman sponsorship, he says, is that 'you
cannot legislate for aspects of an individual's behaviour'. Sportsmen and
women periodically engage in activities which corporate sponsors feel will
tarnish their brand image. 'OJ Simpson is no longer a good person to be
associated with,' Bloxham said.
Martin Loat, a spokesman for ITV's sponsorship arrangements, notes that
there is also a 'chairman' factor in selecting individuals for sponsorship.
'It may also be a chairman's wife factor,' he says.
Moreover, sponsorship allows companies to offer corporate hospitality to
their clients and contacts, an aim which ranks high in NatWest's decision to
sponsor the one-day cricket matches. Sponsoring an individual may allow a
company to introduce him personally to clients, an experience likely to
reinforce warm feelings about the sponsor.
And, for a firm such as MAM, sponsorship means the opportunity for Lara to
don a MAM cap immediately after leaving the field of triumph, just in time
to be interviewed on national television.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Accountancy: Uncertain returns from a 50-year investment -
Why the the IMF and World Bank are coming under greater scrutiny from their
backers

Fifty years ago tomorrow, representatives from 44 countries signed an
agreement at the Mount Washington hotel in the forests of the White
Mountains in Bretton Woods in the US, which led to the creation of two of
the most powerful institutions on the planet: the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
They dispense over Dollars 30bn in funds every year to countries in Asia,
Africa, Latin America and the former Soviet bloc, the largest source of new
money for these countries.
But how effectively have these funds been spent? If we are to take the word
of the institutions, very effectively. If we are to believe a new coalition
of social and environmental groups that sprang up this year - called '50
years is enough' - or critics on the libetarian right, such as the Cato
institute, the institutions are the main source of poverty and environmental
degradation in their borrower countries.
Two years ago, Willi Wapenhans, a former vice-president of the World Bank,
was commissioned to examine its existing portfolio of 1,800 projects. The
results showed that 37.5 per cent of the bank's loans had failed to meet
their own minimum estimation of an economic rate of return.
Bank staff promptly replied that their standards were higher than most. They
could not explain why the failure rate had risen by 150 per cent over the
previous decade. 'This pressure is not temporary; it is attributable to deep
rooted problems which must be diagnosed and resolved,' wrote Wapenhans.
The Wapenhans review made two comparisons: it compared staff appraisal
reports, which are issued before a loan is made, to project completion
reports, which are written up after the last penny has been paid out, as
well as looking at reviews conducted by its operations evaluation
department.
What they had not looked at was how valid were the figures used in these
reports and how timely they are in order to ensure that there is some way of
correcting problems before it is too late. This process has now begun and
the first report that has come back is less than encouraging.
The Financial Reporting and Auditing Task Force, headed up by George
Russell, a financial adviser in the World Bank's central and operational
accounting division, shows that over 60 per cent of the audits of its
projects are not received within the grace period of four to nine months
after the fiscal year ends, 'making it inconsequential for project
management purposes,' according to the reviewers. And 7 per cent are not
received at all.
A fifth of those received have a qualified, adverse or disclaimed opinion:
the auditors believe that either additional information is required before
the audit can be signed, the audit is misleading or there is insufficient
information for the auditor to judge the audit.
In addition, Russell's team report that the 'format of the (financial)
information received often does not allow for, (1) comparison with staff
appraisal reports, (2) linkage of physical achievements with project
expenditures, and (3) reconciliation with bank disbursement records'.
Why is this so? Interviews with members of the team reveal that in many
countries, particularly in Africa, the government auditors have no clue
about how to prepare proper financial statements.
Even within the World Bank itself at its headquarters in Washington, the
importance of proper financial reporting has been downgraded. The Wapenhans
taskforce pointed out that in 1980, the bank had 270 financial specialists
of which 29 per cent were considered experienced. By 1992, it discovered
there were 190 specialists, 30 per cent less, of which a mere 22 per cent
were considered experienced.
As for the International Monetary Fund, its critics say that while it
provides interested parties with statistics galore, it leaves out the most
crucial information. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, who has advised a
dozen countries from Bolivia to Russia on their economic policies, told a
recent Congressional hearing there was no way to judge the performance of
the institution because nobody knew any more than its most general
recommendations.
'I must say that the IMF resisted in a number of cases the very measures
which turned out to be enormously successful after the fact and then the IMF
is able to say, after the fact, we supported those policies because there is
no documentation to say to the contrary,' he said.
Between 1980 and 1989, 241 structural adjustment programmes were put in
place in 36 countries. As the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) points
out, over the same period, three quarters of these countries in Africa, Asia
and Latin America experienced marked declines in their per capita income.
This discrepancy in performance evaluation is about to change. Using advice
from activist groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and International
Rivers Network, the Senate has drawn up a list of minimum conditions the IMF
must meet if it wants more money from the US.
Under these recommendations, the IMF must encourage borrowing countries to
give them permission to publish the Article IV agreements, which are the
details of policies that the IMF wants the country to follow, the recent
economic development papers and the policy framework papers for each country
as well as the letters of intent.
To underscore their impatience with the IMF, the Senate slashed
contributions to the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility from a
requested Dollars 100m to Dollars 25m next year. The House of
Representatives went further and recommended giving the IMF nothing at all.
Karin Lissakers, the US executive director on the IMF's board, who as the US
representative controls 18.3 per cent of the votes in the institution, says
she hopes to get the rest of the board to agree to make these changes. Last
week the IMF said that it was trying to put some of the policies into effect
by its annual meeting in Madrid in September.
Will this make a difference? The bank was persuaded, by similar pressure
from activists last year through the US Congress, to give out more
information through a new 'public information centre' and to set up an
independent inspection panel to review complaints. The panel will come into
existence next month, but the information policy has been in place for six
months. US Congressman Barney Frank called a hearing last month to review
progress.
Testifying before Frank was Lori Udall of IRN. She said: 'Since 1989 the
bank has had an information policy that states the general presumption in
favour of disclosure of information in the absence of a compelling reason
not to disclose. Despite this presumption, in practice the bank has
consistently restricted almost every type of information regarding bank
projects.'
Fifty years on, if it is not possible to evaluate the success of these
institutions, how are they are able to survive? First, they have sovereign
guarantees that ensure that the World Bank and the IMF have to be paid back
and that their debt cannot be rescheduled. Second, without their stamp of
approval, no country can receive international credit.
Thus the World Bank and IMF cannot fail no matter what recommendations they
make to countries. Things might be very different if these guarantees were
withdrawn and they were forced to compete with the private sector they are
so eager to espouse. At the very least, governments should be entitled to
know whether they are getting their money's worth. Fifty years of opaqueness
is enough.

FT  21 JUL 94 / George backs interest rate rises to contain inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, favours a pre-emptive rise
in interest rates if the rate of economic growth quickens to the point of
threatening price stability one to two years ahead.
According to the minutes of his June 8 monetary meeting with Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, the governor argued that early action - 'before any
pick-up in inflation had become established, and before it came through into
the price figures' - would be 'the best chance of sustaining the expansion
and avoiding the need for more severe restraint later on'.
But the minutes, published yesterday, show that Mr George was not advising
an immediate rise in interest rates.
Mr Clarke and Mr George agreed that a change in rates was not appropriate.
Mr Clarke said there was agreement on the aims and conduct of policy. The
main issue was how to sustain growth with low inflation.
'If inflationary pressures picked up, interest rates might have to be raised
at some point in the future,' the minutes record Mr Clarke as saying.
'However, at the moment inflation pressures remained under control.' The
minutes explain how Mr George came to warn in his Mansion House speech on
June 15 that the next move in interest rates would be upwards. Although the
governor - like the chancellor - said present economic circumstances were
very favourable, he singled out three developments which 'needed to be
watched very closely over the next two to three months'. These were:
The rate of monetary growth, and particularly narrow money or M0, which
consists mainly of notes and coins in circulation;
Expectations about future inflation;
Cost increases, particularly increases in labour costs.
Mr George said the three-month growth rate in M0 - which turned out to be an
annualised, seasonally adjusted 8.1 per cent in June - was 'uncomfortably
high' and he would be looking for it to decline in the months ahead.
The minutes prompted some City economists to predict an early rise in UK
bank base rates from their current 5.25 per cent level.

FT  21 JUL 94 / June consumer spending shows steady growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales by clothing and footwear retailers rose sharply in June, while
household goods fell back, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Overall, however, the retail sales data showed that the slow and steady
growth in consumer spending continued in June in spite of April's tax rises.
The volume of retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in June
compared with May, and 3.3 per cent compared with the previous June. This
monthly annual increase was lower than in the last three months, but
analysts yesterday pointed out that the figures had been depressed by a
sudden surge in retail sales last June.
Measured on a three-monthly basis, which provides a better guide to the
trend, retail sales volumes rose 1 per cent in the three months to June
compared with the three months to March.
Compared with the same period a year ago sales volumes rose 3.9 per cent in
the quarter. Sales values grew at exactly the same rate in this period,
indicating that overall prices were flat and highlighting the low level of
retail sales inflation.
Although the monthly figures were roughly in line with City expectations,
they were slightly more downbeat than a Confederation of British Industry
survey of distributive trades released this week.
But one reason for this, analysts suggested, might be that the CBI survey
was conducted slightly later than the CSO report, and so incorporated more
of July's sales. This suggests July's retail sales data could show further
growth.
Other analysts suggested that the discrepancy might indicate that the CSO
had not captured the full growth in sales and so would revise up the numbers
next month. The CSO yesterday made significant upward revisions to previous
months' figures, revising May's rate of growth to 4.2 per cent from 3.9 per
cent.
The growth in sales was spread fairly evenly across sectors. Sales of
clothing and footwear performed best in the non-food sector in June, growing
1.8 per cent in volume terms, and 2.1 per cent in value terms compared with
May, after falling back slightly the previous month. Over the quarter,
clothing and footwear sales volumes rose 1.4 per cent.
Good weather helped boost shoe sales the British retail consortium said,
though it price competition remained extremely fierce in the clothing
sector, with annual inflation under 1 per cent.
Household goods dipped back in June after rising in May, growing 0.6 per
cent, in volume terms in the three months to June, compared with the
previous three months. The British Retail Consortium said that this
reflected the mixed fortunes of the housing market.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Lending beats City hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank and building society lending in Britain grew by an unexpectedly sharp,
seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.9bn last month, confounding City expectations
of a Pounds 1.3bn increase and well ahead of May's Pounds 1.5bn growth, the
Bank of England reported yesterday.
Last month's 0.5 per cent increase in so-called M4 lending compared with
May, brought the seasonally adjusted increase in bank and building society
lending to private-sector UK residents to Pounds 21.7bn in the year to the
end of June. Last month's lending was 3.5 per cent up on the level of June
last year.
The Bank said its provisional figures for lending were broadly consistent
with seasonally adjusted statistics from the British Bankers' Association,
published yesterday. These showed that total sterling lending to the private
sector by the nine biggest British banking groups rose Pounds 949m in June.
This increase, which was slightly below May's Pounds 1bn increase, but in
line with the average rise in the big banks' lending for the previous six
months, represented an annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent.
The association's figures showed that lending growth was concentrated in the
financial and personal sectors. The big banks' lending to building
societies, insurance companies and 'other' financial companies increased by
an adjusted Pounds 300m, Pounds 252m and Pounds 537m respectively.
Manufacturers increased their borrowing by Pounds 162m whereas lending to
other companies generally fell. The banks' lending to persons in June
increased by Pounds 870m, the largest rise since November.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Brewers accused of 'bully tactics'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many tenants of tied public houses were being subjected to 'heavy-handed
bully-boy tactics' by some of the big brewing companies, Ms Kate Hoey,
Labour MP for Vauxhall, told the Commons yesterday.
She claimed that the legal requirement limiting to 2,000 the number of tied
properties linked to each brewery was being ignored, and that tenants were
being forced to pay rent increases of between 100 and 150 per cent in some
cases.

FT  21 JUL 94 / 'Big gaps' in Brent Walker records
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former senior Brent Walker accountant instructed to investigate
allegations of improper transactions within the property and leisure group
was unable to find documents relating to the deals, the Old Bailey heard
yesterday.
Mr David Day, a former group chief accountant, was giving evidence in the
trial of Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman; and Mr Wilfred
Aquilina, its former finance director.
The two men deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to
falsify the company's accounts. The prosecution claims they fraudulently
boosted Brent Walker's profits by Pounds 19m.
Mr Day, a prosecution witness, said that in 1988 he was asked by Mr Aquilina
to investigate press claims that transactions within the company's film
division had not been properly handled, but found 'large gaps' in the
supporting documentation relating to the transactions.
Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina reacted with 'no great surprise', he said.
The prosecution claims these transactions, concerning the sale of film
rights, were bogus and a means of disguising the illegal profit-boosting.
The trial continues today.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Cash for questions probe veto fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour backbenchers failed in the Commons last night in their attempt to
ensure that the parliamentary inquiry into the 'cash for questions' affair
is conducted solely by MPs with no outside business interests, Ivor Owen
writes.
They selected Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the Conservative backbench
1922 committee, who holds seven directorships and a number of consultancies,
as a token target. But their attempt to exclude him from the privileges
committee which is to examine the issue was defeated by a majority of 115
(158-43).
A motion appointing nine Conservative MPs, seven Labour MPs, and one Liberal
Democrat to serve on the committee was approved by a majority of 128
(151-23).
It will investigate the action of Mr Graham Riddick, Tory MP for Colne
Valley, and Mr David Tredinnick, Conservative MP for Bosworth, in agreeing
to accept payments of Pounds 1,000 to table parliamentary questions, and
whether they were subject to entrapment by The Sunday Times.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Clash over rail passenger numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail clashed yesterday with the RMT transport union over the number
of passengers who used the rail service provided on the signal workers'
sixth one-day strike.
The union said that only 10 per cent of the usual number of passengers had
made use of the trains. British Rail said some services had carried
'virtually normal numbers of customers'.
British Rail said it ran 3,800 of its normal 15,000 services, more than in
any strike so far. The Chiltern and the London, Tilbury and Southend lines
carried nearly normal numbers of passengers. Thames Trains carried
two-thirds of usual numbers, while commuter services in the south-east
carried one-third of normal traffic.
Railtrack said it had managed to open 29 per cent of the rail network
compared with 23 per cent last week by 'a better management of resources'.
Train operating companies doubled the number of commuter services into
London Victoria.
The union said the use of supervisors without recent experience of the
signal boxes where they were working posed a safety hazard.

FT  21 JUL 94 / CMN seeks guarantees on Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French-based company which is the only prospective bidder for Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, said yesterday it would
only go ahead with a deal if the British government guaranteed the yard two
years' base workload.
Soffia, the parent company of Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie (CMN),
said it may still buy Swan Hunter from the receiver in spite of the
shipbuilder's failure to win the contract to refit Sir Bedivere, the landing
ship, on which the original proposal was conditional.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team for Swans, said it needed an
indication from the government that it wished to see Swan Hunter survive.
He added: 'We are saying we need one meaningful contract to get the thing
started, or a series of minor ones to the same value. If Swan Hunter is to
survive, the MoD must guarantee a base workload for two years.'
Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards had both, he said, been allocated much
more substantial workloads by the Ministry of Defence. CMN was looking for
work worth about Pounds 50m.
The government on Tuesday offered Swans the refit of the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary tanker Olwen, a three-month, Pounds 6m contract. The company's
only other work - fitting out the Type 23 frigate Richmond - will finish in
November.
The ministry said yesterday that its policy was to place orders in terms of
best value for money. 'It's been continually the policy that work is not
directed to specific shipyards.'
Devonport, it said, had been guaranteed nuclear-submarine refits because of
the large investment required, while Rosyth's allocation of surface-vessel
refits over 12 years was to give it an opportunity to restructure as a
non-nuclear surface yard.
Yesterday Swan Hunter union leaders met Mr Iskandar Safa, Soffia's senior
director, to assure him of the workforce's commitment to saving Swans.
Mr Safa later called for a 'partnership' involving Soffia/CMN, the unions,
the ministry, receiver Price Waterhouse, and Swans' major creditor, Lloyds
Bank, to find a solution. CMN hopes to meet ministers urgently - the offer
of the Olwen refit must be finalised by August 1.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Improving business confidence reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improving business confidence is leading both manufacturers and service
companies to increase their workforce, with skilled manual workers the main
growth category, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday.
But the chambers warned that growing numbers of businesses were reporting
difficulties recruiting staff, particularly skilled manual workers.
The difference between manufacturers reporting staff increases and those
reporting cuts was a positive 11 per cent, up from 0 per cent in March.
The proportion in the service sector was a positive balance of 12 per cent,
with a balance of 17 per cent expecting to increase staff in the next three
months.
But 45 per cent of manufacturing companies and 44 per cent of service-sector
businesses reported recruitment difficulties. This was the largest
proportion reporting recruitment difficulties since 1990. The main shortage
was skilled manual workers.
The survey, which covers 7,935 companies in services and manufacturing,
shows that companies are now reporting moderate, albeit patchy, growth.
Manufacturers were the most buoyant group, with a positive balance of 35 per
cent reporting increased exports last quarter. Investment intentions
remained relatively good, with a balance of 21 per cent of manufacturers
saying they intended to boost investment in the next quarter.
Meanwhile business confidence grew in both sectors over the quarter, with a
majority of companies now expecting improved profitability next year.

FT  21 JUL 94 / BT union rejects flexible hours deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main union in British Telecommunications has decided to recommend
rejection of a new package of flexible working hours which would mean many
more staff working in the evenings and on Saturdays.
The executive of the National Communications Union had been expected to take
a neutral stance after union officials negotiated a deal which ensured that
all changes would be voluntary.
But in spite of the misgivings of many officials the executive has decided
to recommend rejecting the changes in a consultative ballot after pressure
from some branches.
BT had said that it would withdraw an inducement of Pounds 1,000 for those
opting for weekend work and Pounds 400 for those who do early morning or
evening shifts if the union recommended rejection. But last night the
company said the offer was still on the table.
Separately, the three unions in BT yesterday issued an 'alternative
prospectus' to shareholders, arguing that the company is undermining morale
in the way it is trying to reduce staff numbers.
Mr Simon Petch, general secretary of the Society of Telecom Executives,
which represents BT managers, said that the unions wanted to help BT. But he
said that threatening many of the 32,000 managers with compulsory redundancy
was counter-productive as many would volunteer to go if their redundancy was
handled in the right way. BT has said that it wants 3,000 redundancies as
soon as possible from the 7,000 senior managers on personal contracts.

FT  21 JUL 94 / New home loans up 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New mortgage lending by building societies rose sharply last month to reach
its highest level for almost two years, in contrast to some other recent
indicators which have cast doubt on the housing market recovery.
But alongside the increase in lending was an outflow in retail funds from
societies so that significant reliance for mortgage funding was placed on
money raised in the wholesale markets and interest credited to retail
accounts.
According to figures published yesterday by the Building Societies'
Association, net new lending totalled Pounds 1.14bn in June - a 38 per cent
increase on the Pounds 830m figure for May, and higher also than the Pounds
976m recorded in June last year.
Gross new lending, which takes no account of repayments of principal, rose
to more than Pounds 3bn in June for the first time since March. It totalled
Pounds 3.22bn compared with Pounds 2.93bn in May.
There was also an increase in net new commitments made by societies, which
rose from Pounds 3.29bn in May to Pounds 3.58bn in June. Because the
commitments given take some weeks to translate into loans, these figures are
seen as an important leading indicator for the direction of the market in
the coming months.
Although the figures were more positive than other recent housing market
indicators, Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, was wary of
predicting a sustained and strong recovery.
'Caution is still needed in what continues to be an uncertain market,' he
said before adding that building societies' market share had been rising
this year.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Tec chiefs resist merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chairmen of the nine London Training and Enterprise Councils have rejected a
request by the government that they review their structures, including
making formal proposals for mergers.
The request was made by Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, who is
understood to be concerned that some London Tecs are failing to meet
government criteria. Tecs are responsible for delivering government-funded
training programmes and fostering enterprise.
Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, based in south London, and the capital's
representative on the Tec national council, said yesterday: 'The London Tecs
will not be reviewing their structure in response to the government's recent
suggestion, but they will continue to collaborate and improve their
service.'
It is understood that the Tecs believe that any discussions about their
futures should not start with a carve-up of boundaries but rather on what
they are trying to do together and separately.
Tecs in London have been striving to work more closely together, but
achievements on programmes such as Business Links, the umbrella bodies for
business advice, have been modest. It is understood the Tecs are considering
whether to set up a joint secretariat.

FT  21 JUL 94 / MPs call for NHS spending overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A complete overhaul of the way the National Health Service makes decisions
on drugs spending has been proposed by the Commons health committee.
In a report published yesterday the committee calls for more appropriate
prescribing of medicines - the first time parliament has become involved in
clinical decisions.
The most radical proposal is the creation of a national list of drugs which
would be reimbursed by the NHS. All drugs would be included at the time of
their launch, but their inclusion would be subject to a scientific review
after five years.
Those found less effective than existing therapies, or more expensive with
no additional therapeutic value, would be excluded from the prescribing
list.
This process would in effect create a fourth hurdle for medicines. Drugs
companies would have to demonstrate their products were not only safe,
effective and manufactured to sufficient quality, but also cost-effective.
The recommendations have drawn a sharp response from the industry. Bayer's
UK subsidiary said a prescribing list would be cumbersome, inflexible and
bureaucratic.
Mr Peter Lumley, director of public affairs at the Association of the
British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: 'The threat of a national formulary
(prescribing list) will certainly not help the Department of Health or the
Department of Trade and Industry in their endeavours to attract inward
investment to the UK from American and Japanese companies.'
Most of the report's conclusions were supported unanimously by the
committee. But the creation of the prescribing list was opposed by two
Labour MPs.
A number of committee members called for a review of prescription charges.
They argued that the charge, now Pounds 4.75, is excessive, but that the
number of people exempted should be cut. At present 80 per cent of drugs are
dispensed without any charge to groups including pensioners, children,
pregnant women and nursing mothers.
The rise in the drugs budget above the general rate of inflation was not
necessarily a serious cause for alarm, the committee says in the report. The
success of drug therapies could lead to savings elsewhere in the health
service.
However, the committee criticises the present system of controlling NHS
drugs spending, in particular the limited lists of drugs that could not be
prescribed.
The committee calls for a National Audit Office report on the pharmaceutical
price regulation scheme by which the government controls drug company
profits and which the committee says is too complex and insufficiently
transparent.
Members suspected multinational companies manipulated the intricacies of the
scheme to their own advantage.
Four Conservative committee members called for the abolition of the scheme.
It should be replaced by a system based on using the NHS' considerable
purchasing power, said Mr David Congdon, MP for Croydon North East.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Police to get 3% pay rise under Sheehy formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 120,000 police officers in England and Wales will get a pay rise of 3
per cent from September 1 under a new pay formula recommended in the Sheehy
report on police reorganisation.
The rise is at the top end of public-sector groups - most civil servants and
local-government employees will get just over 2 per cent - but below the
3.75 per cent that the police officers would have received under their old
pay formula.
The old pay formula linked the pay rise to the average earnings figure in
May. The new formula links the pay rise to the median of private-sector
non-manual pay settlements.
The pay rise is accompanied by an overhaul of police pay and the agreement
to introduce a new appraisal system in 1996.
The new grading system will give many officers a substantial increase in
their basic pay. The starting salary for a constable, for example, will rise
from Pounds 12,744 to Pounds 13,585 and the lowest level for a sergeant will
rise from Pounds 20,343 to Pounds 20,750.
The total cost of the re-grading is about Pounds 65m but that will be
covered by savings from other aspects of the restructuring. The most radical
is an abolition of the housing allowance - about Pounds 4,000 per year - for
new entrants, and a less frequent up-rating of the present allowance.
There will also be a change in the way that police overtime is paid for,
with some overtime no longer being paid for at all.
The Police Federation said that the overall effect of the restructuring will
be to reduce the pay of a new recruit by up to 20 per cent.
Although many of the restructuring plans draw on proposals made in the
Sheehy report the most radical Sheehy proposal - to abolish incremental
scales - was rejected.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Belfast airport to be sold to staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belfast International Airport is to be sold to its 300 management and staff,
the government announced yesterday.
The news surprised many observers who felt that the buy-out bid was the
least likely to succeed.
The management-employee buy-out team defeated three rival bidders on the
shortlist with a bid of Pounds 32.75m which, together with the company's
cash reserves of Pounds 15.15m, will boost Treasury coffers by Pounds 47.9m.
The airport has undergone a Pounds 25m development programme over the past
five years and now boasts some of the best regional airport facilities in
the UK.
Unsuccessful contenders included an Airports Europe Group led by Mr Paul
McWilliams, chairman of Ulster's Local Enterprise Development Unit, whose
partners included Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.
The others were a high-profile group led by Mr John McGuckian, chairman of
the Industrial Development Board, and backed by TBF Thompson and the
Northern Bank, and the Ulster Investment Bank, whose bid was supported by
City financial institutions.
Mr Tim Smith, Ulster's economy minister, said that all of the government's
criteria of price, efficiency and competition, as well as the involvement of
local interests, had been met successfully by the winning bid.
The completion of the sell-off means Northern Ireland's two main airports
are now in private hands.
The Belfast Harbour Airport, near the city centre, is owned by
Shorts-Bombardier, the Canadian transportation group. Both airports have
been involved in heavy competition on domestic routes and that rivalry is
likely to intensify.
Birmingham International Airport, the fifth largest in the UK, yesterday
unveiled an expansion programme which will cost Pounds 400m over the next 10
years and will involve the private sector taking a majority interest in the
ownership, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The airport's local-authority owners - the councils of Birmingham, Coventry,
Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton - are prepared to give
up at least 51 per cent of their equity to attract private capital, said Mr
Fred Hunt, chairman of the airport company.
Private-sector control will give the airport greater financial flexibility.
Its borrowing is at present subject to government constraints.

FT  21 JUL 94 / British Library project 'a shambles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction of the new British Library in central London has
degenerated into a shambles, a committee of MPs says in a report on the
project published yesterday.
The Commons National Heritage committee says that more than 16 years after
the building was started, no one has any idea when the building will be
completed, when it will open or how much it will cost.
The committee calls for a public inquiry into the project to establish
whether there has been maladministration and incompetence in its design and
construction.
Earlier this month, Mr Peter Brooke, the then heritage secretary, told the
committee that the Treasury held the contractors responsible for delays and
cost overruns.
He said the cost of the library would exceed the Pounds 450m ceiling imposed
in 1990. The Treasury had agreed to fund the extra spending after being
convinced that the extra money could be recovered from contractors, whose
mistakes in planning and installing equipment had contributed to the
spiralling cost.
The report describes the building, designed by Mr Colin St John Wilson, as
'an edifice that resembles a Babylonian ziggurat seen through a fun-fair
distorting mirror'.
The report adds: 'The new building's interior will be at best clinically
utilitarian and at worst actively unattractive.'
The committee recommends that the existing Round Reading Room in the British
Museum be retained for the British Library's use.
It also says that the land to the north of the site of the new library, near
St Pancras station, be retained to provide space for expansion.
The report says that the building of the new opera house at Glyndebourne
showed that attractive buildings could be delivered on time and to budget.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Move to cut building trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A taskforce to reduce Britain's Pounds 1.44bn trade deficit in building
materials was launched yesterday by some of the country's biggest
contractors, property developers and consultants.
The initiative was supported by the Department of the Environment which has
seconded a senior civil servant, Mr Malcolm Dodds, to be director of the new
Construction Procurement Group.
Its aim is to work closely with building-material and component producers to
increase the competitiveness of UK construction products in domestic and
export markets.
Members include chairmen of leading contractors Amec, Bovis, John Laing,
Tarmac and Taylor Woodrow as well as senior directors from property
developers MEPC, Land Securities, Stanhope Properties and Greycoat.
The property developers include some of the industry's biggest critics which
say they have turned to overseas suppliers because British companies do not
produce the products they want, or lack the ability to supply adequate
quality.
Mr Nigel Thompson, chairman of the group and a director of consultants Ove
Arup, said: 'In one horror story, very large concrete cladding panels were
made in Kentucky, hauled halfway across the United States, sailed across the
Atlantic and transported across the UK to be fixed on a building in
Stevenage.'
The group intends to identify products 'where there is insufficient choice
from domestic manufacturers'. Members will work with suppliers to help them
'develop the product and services they offer'. A few leading producers will
be asked to join the group after initial studies.
It is the latest in a series of joint initiatives by the environment
department and the industry to improve its competitiveness.
An independent review, jointly financed by the department and the industry,
this week recommended wide-ranging measures, including legislation, to
reduce conflict and improve management practices in the sector. Its aim is
to cut UK construction costs by 30 per cent by the end of the century.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Effect of tolls on Severn revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High tolls on the Severn Bridge between England and Wales are causing about
1,500 vehicles a day to divert to other routes, a Highways Agency report has
found.
The study was set up to investigate complaints of greatly increased truck
traffic on local routes through Gloucestershire to Wales. The one-way toll
is Pounds 10.10 for a heavy-goods vehicle.
Revenue from the bridge is paying for the construction by Laing-GTM of the
second Severn crossing, due to open in 1996.
The report claims the tolls are 'not a significant factor' in increasing
traffic on other routes, but that factors such as congestion play a bigger
part. It says the problem should be eased when the second bridge opens.
The report showed that about 2,700 more vehicles a day than might be
expected were travelling west through Gloucestershire after allowing for
traffic growth, said Mr Robert Key as minister for roads and traffic. He
said: 'Only 1,500 of these can be positively identified as avoiding bridge
tolls.'
He argued that the extra traffic was fairly evenly spread over the M50
motorway and other main diversion routes.
The Road Haulage Association, which has called for bigger discounts for
regular users of the bridge, rejected the view that the tolls were not a
significant factor.

FT  21 JUL 94 / West 'leads regions in financial services'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol and the west of England has a larger financial-services industry
than any other UK regional centre, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
said yesterday.
In a survey it estimates that the industry in the region employs 75,000
people, not including support services such as lawyers and accountants. This
compares with recent estimates of 35,000 to 40,000 people for the other main
regional centres based on Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds and Manchester.
It also says the findings contrast with a City perception, confirmed by a
telephone survey of 12 financial-services organisations in London, that the
Bristol and the west region ranked only fifth.
'The west of England is demonstrably the largest and most influential
financial base in the UK outside London,' the report says.
The report, Financial Services in the West, was prepared for the Western
Development Partnership, a regeneration agency. It says 55,000 of those
employed by the industry in the region are based in the immediate Bristol
area. The rest are in the surrounding counties of Avon, Gloucestershire,
Wiltshire and Somerset. The insurance industry is the leading employer,
accounting for 51 per cent of the workforce.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand's survey covered 90 organisations, including all of the
region's top 20 companies in the sector.
The report states: 'The survey dispelled the popular image of modern
financial services, where the workforce is commonly believed to constitute
far more female than male staff and where part-time labour is the norm.'
In the west, male staff constitute 45 per cent of the workforce and there
were nine full-time workers for every one part-time. The report also says
respondents took a very bullish view of employment prospects for their own
businesses.

FT  21 JUL 94 / British Steel to increase strip and plate prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel is raising prices of its strip and plate products in September
and may raise them further at the beginning of next year.
Over the past few days British Steel has told customers that prices for its
strip products - used in the automotive, domestic-appliance and other
industries - will rise by between Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 a tonne from
September 1. This is equivalent to a price rise of 3 per cent to 6 per cent.
Its plate product prices will rise between Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 a tonne,
depending on the grade, from September 3. A Pounds 20 increase would be
equivalent to nearly 10 per cent.
Strip products are made at British Steel's south Wales plants. Steel plates,
which are rolled at Scunthorpe, Humberside and in Scotland, are used in
heavy engineering industries such as shipbuilding.
A series of price rises by British Steel last year caused controversy among
steel users, who complained they were being squeezed between suppliers and
their own customers who refused to pay more.
But British Steel has consistently argued that the rises were necessary to
get an adequate return on investment, and said this week that prices were
still below 1990 levels for both strip and plate products.
The latest increase in strip products is the fifth since April last year,
while that for plates is the first since the middle of last year. British
Steel said the increase in plate prices reflected the strength of recovery
in international plate market sectors, including shipbuilding.
There is also a European-wide shortage of steel slabs, from which plate is
made.

FT  21 JUL 94 / EU laws 'threaten London banking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's position as an international banking centre could be undermined by
protectionist European Union legislation, or by the adoption of common
banking supervisory standards around the world, according to research
published yesterday.
A study of London's position compared with financial centres such as New
York and Frankfurt concludes that it could be damaged by increased
regulation of the underwriting and trading of securities and financial
derivatives.
The study by Professor Harold Rose of the London Business School was
published together with a study of the growth of international banking as
part of the City Research Project sponsored by the Corporation of London.
Prof Rose says London's share of cross-border bank lending fell from 18 per
cent in the mid-1980s to less than 14 per cent today of a much higher world
total, largely due to the rise in importance of Asian centres including
Tokyo.
However, he argues that the chief competitive threats to London as a banking
centre are the liberalisation of markets abroad and the changes in
supervision which weakened London's previous advantage of being seen as
lightly regulated.
Prof Rose argues that London's position as the leading foreign-exchange
centre is likely to be reinforced by European Monetary Union (Emu). Losses
of trading among European currencies would be offset by European Currency
Unit trading.
However, he says that Emu could lead to business switching from London to
Frankfurt.
The second study by Professor Richard Brealey and Mr Evi Kaplanis of London
Business School argues that the post-war growth of international banking
depended largely on a 'catch-up' effect in the 1960s and 1970s.
Prof Brealey said yesterday that the most important issue was less a 'battle
between megalithic financial centres' for a bigger share of banking than the
question of whether the rapid post-war expansion would resume.
He said he was 'relatively pessimistic' about achieving the 20 per cent real
growth in international assets of banks achieved between 1960 and 1985.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Renewable energy 'has promise'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewable energy forms 'offer a very long-term promise for a permanent
solution' to energy problems, the World Energy Council says today.
Renewables, which include solar, wind and wave power, must take account of
all environmental impacts, and avoid unsound technology and economics, the
group says.
It estimates that renewables will account for about 4 per cent of world
energy by 2020 if present policies are pursued. But if more ecological
policies were adopted, renewables could contribute 12 per cent by the same
date.

FT  21 JUL 94 / MPs back wind farms for Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More wind farms should be allowed in Wales, the Commons Welsh affairs
committee said yesterday, Roland Adburgham writes.
The committee's report says: 'Within the framework of a robust, appropriate
and locally accountable planning system we see no objection to the
continuing development of wind farms in Wales, subject to their
environmental acceptability.'
The committee's support comes at a time when there has been increasing
opposition to the turbines on grounds of visual intrusion, noise and lack of
economic justification.
The MPs stress: 'We believe that concerns over visual impact are the most
deep-seated and firmly held objections to the development of wind energy.'
There should be 'the strongest presumption' against turbines in national
parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
The report adds: 'Whether wind turbines become accepted will crucially
depend both on the sensitivity with which they are sited and on their being
seen as a genuine contribution to clean, renewable and economically viable
electricity generation, rather than as evidence of the greed of developers
for a generous subsidy.'
The MPs criticise the fact that seven wind farms were built in Wales before
there was a requirement for environmental impact assessments.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Union seeks shareholder revolt over directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest union at British Steel is organising a shareholder revolt among
its members against large boardroom salary increases, including an Pounds
109,000 bonus paid to Mr Brian Moffat, the company chairman.
The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation is asking members to register their
concern by voting against the re-appointment of Sir Nicholas Goodison. He is
the only one of six non-executive directors seeking re-election at the
annual general meeting next week who agreed the pay rises for executive
directors.
Mr Moffat received a 20 per cent increase in his base salary in 1993-94
which rose from Pounds 321,630 to Pounds 386,960. The additional performance
bonus took his total annual pay to almost Pounds 500,000.
At the same time the basic pay of British Steel employees, said the union,
had risen by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, or between Pounds 6 and
Pounds 9 a week.
Mr Keith Brookman, union general secretary, accused British Steel directors
of having 'the national disease afflicting British boardrooms  - pure
financial greed'. He added that the rises were 'galling and distasteful'.
Between 21,000 and 22,000 union members have shares in the company but this
still only represents about 5 per cent of the total shareholding. ISTC
claims to be the first union to have organised such a gesture.
British Steel said that directors' bonuses were linked to profits unlike
other employees. Mr Moffat's increase in basic pay reflected the fact that
he was now doing two jobs - chairman and chief executive.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Labour leaders face fight on renationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's modernising leadership faces a battle at this year's party
conference with union and constituency delegates demanding renationalisation
of large parts of the economy.
The list of resolutions for the October conference in Blackpool, released
yesterday, shows substantial support for renationalisation of the gas, water
and electricity industries.
Many motions on the economy also call for renationalisation of the railways,
basic industries such as steelmaking, coal-mining and shipbuilding, and the
Post Office, which the government wants to privatise.
There is also significant support for a literal interpretation of Labour's
long-standing commitment to public control of the 'commanding heights' of
the economy.
Several motions urge the conference to instruct Labour's leadership to
propose the nationalisation of at least one top company in each financial
and manufacturing sector.
The depth of support for a return to old-style nationalisation will concern
Labour's dominant modernising tendency, which will be boosted today by the
almost certain election of Mr Tony Blair as party leader with between 50 per
cent and 60 per cent of the vote.
It will also concern Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment
secretary, who is expected to win a narrow victory over Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the leftwing interim leader, for the deputy leader's job.
Mr Prescott has largely supported Mr Blair and Mr Gordon Brown, the
modernising shadow chancellor, in their efforts to prevent commitments to
renationalisation, with the exception of British Rail.
Instead, the modernisers have promised stronger regulation of monopolies,
which would be forced to place greater emphasis on consumers and
reinvestment, and less on dividends and executive salaries.
Renationalisation has remained a potent totem for the left, including Mrs
Beckett, who promised during the leadership campaign to consider taking
water back into public ownership.
However, Labour's continuing debate over nationalisation is regarded as a
public relations gift by Conservative officials, who believe the policy is
deeply unpopular with voters.
The modernisers face a further battle over their attempts to update the
party's social security policies through the mechanism of a commission on
social justice, set up by John Smith, the late Labour leader, and chaired by
Sir Gordon Borrie.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Many MPs expected more losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was little surprise at Westminster yesterday over the four names
struck off the prime minister's cabinet list. If anything, many Tory MPs had
been expecting a few more.
Mr John Patten has long been tipped to return to the back benches after an
unhappy - and sometimes disastrous - spell as education secretary.
In the last two years the 49-year-old minister with coiffured hair and a
natty line in shoes has presided over sweeping U-turns in many aspects of
the government's education policy. He has also had worse relations with
union leaders than any cabinet minister.
Compulsory national curriculum tests for schools have been abandoned. The
government's proposals to reform student unions disintegrated at the hands
of Tory rebels in the Lords. And the flow of schools opting out of local
education authority control - a keystone of the government's 1988 Education
Reform Act - slowed to a trickle.
His anger at dismissal came through in a terse resignation letter. He wrote:
'My dear Prime Minister, when we met last night, you explained that you no
longer wished me to remain as Secretary of State for Education, and I am
writing to say how glad I have been to serve in Her Majesty's Government.
With my best wishes for the future, yours ever, John.'
Mr John MacGregor's performance as transport secretary has been mixed. There
were indications yesterday that he was leaving the post at his own request
and that he is expected to take up a job in the City.
Mr MacGregor has pushed the railway privatisation bill through parliament in
the face of intense opposition, and the government is well set to proceed
with the sell-off of British Rail in spite of some public hostility.
But he has been forced to cut his road-building programme in the face of the
green lobby and the Department of Environment. He has no strong following on
the back benches, and has been criticised by some Tory MPs for an
un-inspiring performance.
Mr Peter Brooke always looked vulnerable as national heritage secretary
because he had acquired the job after the extrovert Mr David Mellor was
forced to resign.
Mr Brooke has, by contrast, been criticised for lacklustre leadership. He
introduced the National Lottery, but was dogged by speculation that the
government would press ahead with a privacy bill. He has been heavily blamed
for the recent fiasco over the D-Day celebrations.
Lord Wakeham, the departing leader of the Lords, came to his job with a
reputation as a powerful behind-the-scenes political operator. He is
understood to have told Mr Major in recent days that he was 'entirely at his
disposal', although there was little doubt that he wanted to stay in his
post.
However, he has been blamed for a succession of embarrassing defeats for the
government in the upper house on the criminal justice bill and the police
and magistrates bill. Like Mr MacGregor, there has been strong speculation
that he will take up a City job.
Brooke bows out, Page 19

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Portillo shift a sinister omen, says
Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour was yesterday putting a brave face on the government reshuffle, which
was derided by party leaders as a largely cosmetic exercise.
Labour officials said the prime minister's failure to sack Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, would
fatally undermine his hopes that the government could make a fresh start.
'Most people won't notice any difference,' a senior official said. 'John
Major has promoted a few new faces who will give us a few new phrases, but
there will be no changes in policy.
'The only real difference is the promotion of Michael Portillo to the
employment department, which is a significant and sinister move to the right
in that area.'
Labour strategists are relaxed about the promotion of the articulate and
tough-minded trio of Mr Jonathan Aitken, Dr Brian Mawhinney and Mr Stephen
Dorrell, all accomplished parliamentary performers.
However, the reshuffle increases the likelihood of a wide-ranging shake-up
on the opposition front bench when MPs return to Westminster in October
after the summer recess.
Mr Tony Blair, who will almost certainly be crowned Labour leader today in
succession to John Smith, will delay his reshuffle until the autumn to allow
time for fresh elections to the shadow cabinet.
The most likely casualty is Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary,
who is thought by many Labour MPs to have performed poorly, even against Mr
John Patten, who was sacked by Mr Major yesterday.
There was less certainty about other potential changes, although Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the interim party leader, is regarded as a strong
candidate to replace Mr Blair as shadow home secretary if she fails to win
either leadership post.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Victims spared media gauntlet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will go down as the compassionate reshuffle.
The cameras clustered outside Mr Major's front door early yesterday morning
were interested of course in quick confirmation of who the rising stars
were.
But mainly they wanted to see blood. They were destined to be disappointed.
In a break with convention, the knife had already been wielded some 12 hours
earlier.
Those who were to be dropped from the cabinet had been told discreetly by
the prime minister at Number 10 on Tuesday evening - after a well-publicised
cocktail party.
This thoughtful touch spared Messrs Patten, Brooke, MacGregor and Wakeham
the unpleasant task of running the raucous media gauntlet within minutes of
being informed of their fate.
The first clue that there were to be no public executions came when word
began circulating in the scrum outside Downing Street that a government car
had collected Mr Patten's ministerial red boxes without picking up the
education secretary.
By this time the ritual reshuffle-day comings and goings at Number Ten had
already started, with Mrs Gillian Shephard appearing first at 9am to the
press gang's initial confusion. 'In past years it was common for the victims
of reshuffles to arrive early, but Mrs Shephard is tipped for promotion,'
reported the Press Association.
There was more confusion some minutes later when Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, came into view.
This was the instant when some experienced commentators momentarily
abandoned their back-of-envelope reshuffle predictions and thought about
early retirement: it had been universally forecast that none of the 'Big
Three' positions at the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Home Office
would change hands.
But Mr Hurd was only teasing. Within seconds he had strolled past the
waiting crowd and disappeared safely into the Foreign Office, a gleam in his
eye.
From then on it was plain sailing as Mr Major's chosen few arrived at
irregular intervals, doing their best to look composed. The prize for the
longest stay went to Mr Jeremy Hanley, the new party chairman, followed by
Mrs Shephard, who had stayed for a cup of coffee with Mr Christopher Meyer,
the prime minister's press secretary.
When Dr Brian Mawhinney, another cabinet newcomer, departed at 11.33
precisely, the show was over.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Aitken brings splash of colour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, will provide a
much needed splash of colour in the grey ranks of Mr John Major's cabinet.
Few other ministers have campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis,
stood trial at the Old Bailey, and insulted Baroness Thatcher in print.
But there is more to Mr Aitken than a knack for making headlines. If he has
the profile of a maverick outsider, he also has the authentic air of a
Conservative grandee. Indeed, the question on the lips of observers at
Westminster is not so much why he has been promoted to the cabinet as why it
took him so long to make it.
Mr Aitken has the ideal curriculum vitae: great-nephew of Lord Beaverbrook,
son of a Tory MP, graduate of Eton and Oxford, wealthy merchant banker. But
after entering the Commons in 1974 for Thanet East (now Thanet South) he
spent 18 years on the back benches before becoming a junior defence minister
in 1992.
Explanations for his tardy progress are as varied as the lunch menu at his
elegant Lord North Street home, once the residence of Brendan Bracken,
wartime intimate of Churchill.
Some put it down to his campaign in the 1960s for the de-criminalisation of
the offence of possession of cannabis, which he once compared to a minor
motoring offence. Others ascribe it to his background in journalism, which
culminated in a sensational report about British arms supplies to Nigeria
during the war against Biafran secession.
That report led to an appearance at the Old Bailey in 1970, where he was
charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act. He was acquitted, and has
since been both a role model for aspiring 'investigative' journalists and a
campaigner for less secrecy in government.
The other explanation is that Lady Thatcher, prime minister from 1979 to
1990, simply did not like him very much. He took little trouble to disguise
his own view of Lady Thatcher as prime minister.
Politically, Mr Aitken is a thoughtful free-market rightwinger. His
promotion to the cabinet is in part a reward for loyalty to Mr Major during
the tortuous parliamentary passage of the Maastricht bill. Unlike some
Euro-sceptic ministers, he refrained from giving arms-length support to the
rebels.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Mawhinney smoothes his way to transport
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be few smoother operators in Mr John Major's reshaped cabinet
than Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary.
During his two years as number two at health, the dark-browed Ulsterman's
consistently polished public performances have helped to earn him a
reputation for competence and unflappability in what has traditionally been
a difficult department for the Conservatives.
In doing so, he has managed to dodge the banana-skins which have lately
stalled his old boss Mrs Virginia Bottomley's meteoric rise.
In fact, the velvet-smooth public facade masks a tough streak which will
stand Dr Mawhinney in good stead in his new role, but which has not always
endeared him to civil servants.
'If he is not pleased with you, you certainly know all about it,' said one
MP.
'A number of people in the Northern Ireland Office look upon his possible
return with dread,' according to one Whitehall insider, speculating that
this former Northern Ireland minister might one day go back to the province
as secretary of state.
But even his detractors acknowledge that he performed capably and
effectively during his six-year stint in the Northern Ireland Office.
The phrase for which his spell at the Ulster office is most frequently
remembered came in December 1991: 'This is the latest Christmas message from
the IRA,' he said, surveying the scene of devastation around Craigavon
police station left by a 2,000lb bomb.
It is a sign of how skilfully he has navigated the most treacherous shoals
on the health beat - such as tobacco advertising, dentists' fees and the
future of London's hospitals - that his time there too may be best
remembered for a Christmas-related gesture.
In October 1992 he moved to prevent doctors prescribing Christmas pudding on
the National Health Service.
'No matter how tasty, I am amazed that some GPs have prescribed this and
even chocolate digestive biscuits to their patients,' he said.
A radiation biologist by training Dr Mawhinney won Peterborough in East
Anglia from Labour in 1979.
This puts him in the same vintage as Mr Major, then a little-known former
banker.
With his practical, and largely non-ideological approach to politics, Dr
Mawhinney, 54, remains every inch the Major loyalist.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: When a good butcher has to wield the axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpected promotions, reluctant resignations, and the occasional outburst
by those who prefer to acknowledge the sack, have been a feature of
ministerial reshuffles down the years.
So, too, has clear evidence of prime-ministerial anguish at having to retain
a rival in the cabinet because of the fear that he would be even more
dangerous on the back benches.
David Lloyd George's dictum that a successful prime minister has to be a
'good butcher' does not seem to have made it any easier for most of his
successors to wield the axe.
Harold Macmillan did not relish dispensing with senior colleagues in spite
of the notoriety he gained in 1962 from the 'night of the long knives' when
he got rid of a third of the cabinet.
The loss of Orpington, a seemingly impregnable Tory stronghold which fell to
the Liberals in a by-election, caused the supposedly 'unflappable' prime
minister to panic.
Macmillan did not join the laughter when one Tory backbencher ironically
congratulated him on 'keeping your head while all about you were losing
theirs'.
In 1966 Mr Harold Wilson - now Lord Wilson - let it be known that a system
of promotion and relegation, similar to the football league, would be in
regular use to keep ministers on their toes.
In the event he found it difficult to apply his football doctrine. His anger
at colleagues who frustrated his proposals for curbing the power of trade
unions only resulted in one sacking. The victim was Mr Richard  - now Lord -
Marsh, who has recalled that Lord Wilson needed the best part of an hour to
explain that he was 'carrying out a re-organisation'.
The prize for the most disastrous reshuffle in recent times must go to the
then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's mid-term reconstruction in 1989 - at exactly
the same point during the last parliament as Mr Major's latest changes.
Her decision to force Sir Geoffrey Howe from the Foreign Office developed
into an unseemly row over his status as deputy prime minister and leader of
the Commons.
Mrs Thatcher managed also to offend both Mr Douglas Hurd, then home
secretary, by offering Sir Geoffrey the Home Office without bothering to
mention it to Mr Hurd; and the then Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, by
compensating Sir Geoffrey with Mr Lawson's country house.
Celebrating her 10th year in office Mrs Thatcher had the audacity to dub her
reshuffled cabinet: 'The Right Team for Britain's Future'. Within months Mr
Lawson had quit, to be followed by a steady stream of other members of the
team. A year later the captain also was obliged to depart.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Sweeping shake-up hits the junior ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the political heavyweights had emerged from Downing Street, it was the
turn of the nearly-men - the 54 Tory MPs and peers who won or lost posts
outside the cabinet.
From mid-morning, when they started arriving to see the prime minister, it
was clear that the reshuffle would be much more sweeping among the junior
ranks than in the cabinet.
In departmental terms, the biggest changes took place at the Treasury, where
three of the four non-cabinet ministers were replaced, and defence, where
two of the three junior ministers changed.
Overall, rightwingers prospered, although Mr Major also promoted some highly
regarded leftwingers.
As expected, there was no room for Lord Archer, tipped for a middle-ranking
job before news leaked recently of an official inquiry into alleged
share-dealing irregularities.
Five ministers of state leave the government: Sir Wyn Roberts, Welsh office;
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister; Sir John Cope, paymaster-general; Mr
Nicholas Scott, disability minister; and Mr Peter Lloyd, prisons minister.
The first three are understood to have asked to step down. The prime
minister is thought to have sacked Mr Lloyd, a long-serving Home Office
minister, and Mr Scott, who has faced sustained opposition from the lobby
for the disabled.
The big winners are: Mr David Davis, the rightwing parliamentary secretary
for the Citizen's Charter, who moves up a rank to replace Mr David
Heathcote-Amory as the Foreign Office minister of state responsible for the
European Union; Mr Nicholas Soames, the rightwing agriculture parliamentary
secretary and food minister, who replaces Mr Jeremy Hanley as minister of
state at defence.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, the rightwing employment under-secretary, becomes
minister of state in the same department. Mr Gerald Malone, a rightwing
backbencher and former whip enters government at minister-of-state level,
replacing Mr Brian Mawhinney as health minister.
Mr William Hague, a junior social security minister, becomes minister of
state in the same department; Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish is promoted from
the Lords whips' office to become an additional social security minister of
state.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the backbench Treasury select committee, enters
the government as transport minister of state, taking over from Mr Roger
Freeman as public transport minister.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, keeps his job,
but is promoted one rung up the ladder to minister of state.
Mr Eric Forth, the rightwing schools minister, replaces Baroness Blatch as
education minister of state.
Several ministers move sideways: Mr Forsyth replaces Mr Lloyd at the home
office; Sir George Young, the leftwing housing minister, replaces Mr Stephen
Dorrell as financial secretary to the Treasury; Mr Heathcoat-Amory replaces
Sir John Cope as paymaster-general; Mr Roger Freeman moves to defence to
replace Mr Jonathan Aitken as procurement minister.
Viscount Ullswater, the former chief whip in the Lords, becomes minister of
state at environment, replacing Sir George Young. Baroness Blatch moves to
the Home Office as minister of state, replacing Earl Ferrers, who moves to
the Department of Trade and Industry. At the lowest ministerial level, three
parliamentary under-secretaries leave the government: Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd,
who leaves the Foreign Office with a knighthood; Mr Patrick McLoughlin from
the DTI, and Mr Robert Key from transport.
There are eight new under-secretaries: Mrs Angela Browning at agriculture;
Mr James Paice and Mr Phillip Oppenheim at employment; Mr Robert Jones and
Sir Paul Beresford at environment; Mr Roger Evans at social security; Mr Ian
Taylor at the DTI; and Mr Roderick Richards at the Welsh Office. Mr Richards
replaces Sir Wyn Jones, formerly minister of state, signalling a downgrading
of the Welsh office.
Several junior ministers move from one department to another: Lord Henley
from social security to defence; Mr Antony Baldry from environment to the
Foreign Office; Mr Nicholas Baker from the whips' office to the Home Office;
Viscount Astor from the Lords whips' office to national heritage; Mr Robert
G. Hughes from the whips' office to the Citizen's Charter department; Mr
James Arbuthnot from the whips' office to social security; Mr Charles Wardle
from the home office to the DTI; and Viscount Goschen from the Lords whips'
office to transport.
Four government whips leave office: Mr Irvine Patnick, with a knighthood,
and Lords Strathmore, St Davids and Annaly. Lord Strathclyde moves from
under-secretary at the environment department to become Lords' chief whip in
place of Viscount Ullswater, who becomes leader of the Lords.
Earl Arran moves from Northern Ireland office under-secretary to become
Lords deputy chief whip; and Mr Andrew Mitchell and Mr Derek Conway are
promoted to whip from assistant whip in the Commons.
Four new assistant whips have been appointed in the Commons: Mr Simon Burns,
Mr David Willetts, Mr Michael Bates and Dr Liam Fox. Two assistant whips
join the government in the Lords: Lord Lucas of Crudwell and Baroness Miller
of Hendon.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Senior party job goes to author
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Dobbs, author of the television series and novel House of Cards,
was appointed a joint deputy party chairman.
Dubbed the 'second Jeffrey Archer' by friends, he recently said he sought
not the Booker Prize but to entertain in his writing.
Party managers hope he will bring a sense of excitement to his new job.
As a former chief of staff for Lord Tebbit when party chairman he also has
experience of the workings of Central Office.
Mr John Maples, a former financial secretary to the Treasury, is the other
new holder of the post.
Mr Maples was tipped for promotion to the cabinet before he lost his
Lewisham West seat at the last general election. He is currently chairman of
a government lobbying arm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
Dame Angela Rumbold remains the third deputy chairman.
Mr Graham Bright, dismissed as Mr Major's parliamentary private secretary in
favour of Mr John Ward, was knighted and appointed a vice chairman.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Dorrell joins his rival Portillo in
cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell's elevation to the cabinet was the least surprising
aspect of Mr John Major's ministerial shake-up.
The promotion of the financial secretary to the Treasury to the post of
national heritage secretary confirms his place in the ranks of potential
future leaders of the Tory party.
But Mr Major has been careful not to annoy the fractious right wing of his
party by promoting Mr Dorrell too quickly. He might have hoped for the post
of employment, transport or education secretary rather than the less exalted
role of running arts and the National Lottery.
The 42-year-old MP for Worcester is everything his rightwing colleagues love
to hate. He is unashamedly pro-European, a liberal on social policy and, on
economic policy, a pragmatist rather than an ideologue. With a substantial
personal interest in the future of a family-run clothing company he cares
about manufacturing industry.
He is also one of that ever smaller band of senior Conservatives who can
string together enough sentences to present a case that his party - or at
least his faction - still has a coherent prospectus for governing Britain.
For the centre-left of the Tory party that makes him the ideal rival to Mr
Michael Portillo, the equally youthful torch bearer of the Thatcherites.
Neither could expect to lead the party were Mr Major to stumble before the
next general election. But Labour's choice today of the 41-year-old Mr Tony
Blair as its leader will reinforce their claim on any vacancy after that.
Mr Dorrell is not quite as 'wet' as he used to be. He is a former aide to Mr
Peter Walker (now Lord Walker) and was rebellious thorn in the side of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's first administration, but has dried out since the days
when he regularly defied the government from the back benches.
Like everyone nowadays in the Tory party - and most in the Labour party - he
believes in the market economy. He is a strong advocate of privatisation and
of the injection of private finance into public-sector infrastructure
projects.
But he also thinks politicians should treat market economics as a means to
an end rather than an end in itself. He remains a liberal on social policy -
particularly in debates about such issues as immigration, the subject of a
number of rebellions in his earlier years.
His rivalry with Mr Portillo has frequently resembled a private war
conducted with little reference to the rest of the government. Mr Dorrell is
still a step or two behind Mr Portillo, but has not too far to catch up.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: PM eschews glitz to maintain a balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reshuffles are like Budgets. The more clever they look on the day the more
chance they will unravel once the novelty wears off. So perhaps Mr John
Major should be applauded for eschewing anything that might be termed glitz.
His midterm shake-up did include one significant gamble - the elevation of
the untested Mr Jeremy Hanley to the party chairmanship. Mr Major was tough
enough to sack Mr John Patten from the education department and to let go
three other cabinet ministers.
He took also the longstanding advice of friends and replaced Mr Graham
Bright as his parliamentary private secretary with the non-descript but safe
Mr John Ward.
But overall it was a play-it-safe reshuffle rather than a dramatic
restructuring of the team that will face the Labour party in the second half
of the present parliament.
It left the clear impression that Mr Major has given himself room for
another, albeit smaller, shake-up before the general election due by
mid-1997. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, who stays for now at defence, looks like a
foreign-secretary-in-waiting.
An extensive series of dismissals and promotions at the level of minister of
state and below is designed also to prepare a number of up-and-coming
ministers for eventual promotion to the cabinet.
On one level the prime minister's hands were tied. Mr Kenneth Clarke was
never likely to move from the Treasury. Mr Douglas Hurd, a pillar of
stability in the cabinet, was needed at the Foreign Office for at least
another year to prepare the ground for the European Union's
intergovernmental conference.
Moving Mr Michael Howard from the Home Office or Mr Michael Heseltine from
the Department of Trade and Industry would have created too many waves.
But even within those constraints Mr Major once again preferred careful
calculation over political showmanship. The various moves were all designed
to preserve a careful political balance.
Overall, Tory MPs detected a slight shift to the right - but not by anything
like enough to persuade them the recent rightwards shift in his rhetoric
signalled that Mr Major had truly become 'one of us'.
Thus Mr Michael Portillo's promotion to employment. The right was assured
that their standard-bearer would retain an influence on economic policy. Mr
Portillo will work closely with Mr Peter Lilley, his Thatcherite ally at
social security, to introduce the tough new Jobseekers' allowance for the
unemployed. He will be ideally placed also to indulge his distaste for
Brussels by opposing further social legislation.
On the other hand employment is the most junior of the economic posts: the
centre-left will be told Mr Portillo can be reined in when necessary by Mr
Clarke and Mr Heseltine.
Mr Jonathan Aitken's move into the chief secretary's slot bore the same
hallmark. Meanwhile Mr Stephen Dorrell, the darling of the One-Nation left,
won his much-deserved elevation to the cabinet. But his new position is
sufficiently uncontroversial not to enrage the right.
Other moves have a wider political objective. Mrs Gillian Shephard's
promotion to education is designed to restore some common sense to the
government's approach. After six years of upheaval the promise now is of
consolidation and bridge-building with teachers and local authorities. Mrs
Shephard would not claim to be a great innovator but her experience as a
teacher and education officer has left her far more in touch with the
concerns of parents than her predecessor.
Elsewhere Mr Major rewarded competence. Mr William Waldegrave's move to
agriculture was widely regarded as a good decision. As was the choice of Sir
George Young as financial secretary to the Treasury, the post generally seen
as a waiting room for the cabinet. Mr Brian Mawhinney's promotion to
transport was appropriate for his hard work and loyalty.
Mr Hanley's appointment was the main puzzle. In one respect it reflects the
influence of Mr Chris Patten, now governor of Hong Kong and party chairman
at the last election. Mr Hanley was his protege. The new chairman is
energetic and enthusiastic. But his presentational skills and cheerful
disposition are not matched by hard experience.
The new top-heavy structure at the top of Central Office bears the mark of
indecision. It carries within it the seeds of future confusion and conflict.
Mr Hanley will be backed up by Mr David Hunt, whose sideways move to take
charge of public services and the Citizen's Charter is more than it seems.
Mr Hunt will take the chairmanship of a number of cabinet committees and act
as a ministerial troubleshooter on Mr Major's behalf. He will be expected to
give a new political edge to policy-making by reconnecting Whitehall and
Central Office.
The message from 10 Downing Street last night was that the reshuffle must be
seen as a package: that taken together the changes might not be flashy but
would stand the test of time. Not everyone at Westminster was quite so sure.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: 'Cheerful cove' picked as party
cheerleader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Hanley's appointment as Conservative party chairman was the
biggest surprise of the reshuffle.
More ministers were mentioned as potential candidates for the post than for
any other position. Mr Hanley was considered only to be an outsider  - and
as a member of the party's 'wet' wing whose promotion was blocked by Lady
Thatcher in the 1980s it is not difficult to see why.
A protege of the liberal-inclined Mr Chris Patten, a former party chairman
whom Mr Hanley served as a parliamentary private secretary, he is not an
obvious contender to unify a party which has being moving steadily to the
right.
Some Tory Euro-sceptics were heard muttering criticism of his appointment at
Westminster. One leading sceptic said: 'Mr Hanley would do well to fully
acknowledge the party's sceptical view of the European Union.'
Although he is a member of the anti-federalist European Movement, the new
chairman is best remembered by many sceptics as secretary of the all-party
group on Europe when he took an unambiguous pro-European stance.
But Mr Hanley was not appointed for ideological reasons. As the political
arm of the prime minister, he will not be expected to voice opinions of his
own.
After a string of election defeats the Tory grassroots are demoralised and
dispirited. Mr Hanley's widely acclaimed skills as a good communicator and
raconteur are seen as the essential tools for the job.
He also won the party managers' support for his performance as minister for
the armed forces when he chaired important reviews in the defence cost
study. 'It could so easily have gone wrong,' said one senior backbencher.
'When you are having to make billions of savings leading to the loss of
thousands of jobs the potential for mistakes is huge. Jeremy Hanley avoided
all the pitfalls.'
Sir Jerry Wiggin, Conservative MP for Western-Super-Mare and a defence
expert who watched Mr Hanley perform at close quarters, believes his ability
to make friends and get on with people will be crucial in forming good
relationships with party officials across the country.
'Never mind his views on Europe' said Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent
North. 'He will be an excellent party cheerleader.'
Mr Hanley, 48, was described by another MP as 'a cheerful cove'. His friends
say his family's acting skills should enable him to bring a bit of
razzmatazz to the job. Mr Hanley's father was the actor Jimmy Hanley and his
mother is the actress Dinah Sheridan.
The new chairman is not without his critics. Once seen as something of a
rebel, voting against the government on the abolition of the Greater London
Council and arguing against an increase in water charges, his detractors now
accuse him of being 'crawlingly loyalist'. After expressing fears that the
privatised Thames Water would sell off valuable acreage around Barn Elms
reservoir he loyally voted for the bill in July 1989.
As Northern Ireland minister in 1990 he was criticised by some of the
participants in the round-table talks on the province's political future for
being a poor chairman. 'He found it hard to deal with a competitive agenda,'
said one participant.
Perhaps Mr Hanley's greatest political achievement has been in winning the
marginal Richmond and Barnes seat by 74 votes in 1983 and then holding it
under sustained attack from the Liberal Democrats.
With a majority of just 1,766 he remains vulnerable. MPs were yesterday
voicing concern that he might suffer the same fate as Mr Chris Patten who
lost his Bath constituency in the last election. However Mr Hanley will have
the advantage of defending a London seat in which even his opponents concede
he is a popular MP.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's reshuffle: Cranborne treads 'king-maker' path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With his appointment as the new leader of the House of Lords, Viscount
Cranborne takes another step along the political path traversed by his
grandfather, the Fifth Marquess of Salisbury, who was the Conservative
party's 'king-maker' in the 1950s.
Lord Cranborne's rapid advance from the ranks of the junior ministers to a
seat in the cabinet reflects his impressive performance as the government's
chief defence spokesman in the Lords since 1992.
His entry to the Lords was accelerated, again like that of his grandfather,
to strengthen a politically-fragile government front bench.
Lord Cranborne, who is 47, had an undistinguished spell in the Commons from
1979 to 1987 as Conservative MP for Dorset south - a constituency his
grandfather represented in the 1930s. Lord Cranborne takes up the post of
leader of the Lords - with the ministerial title of Lord Privy Seal - at a
time when the flaws in bills at the heart of the government's programme,
particularly on law and order, have been ruthlessly exposed.
His main task will be to satisfy independent-minded Tory back benchers, the
former law lords and other well-informed peers, who play an active role from
the cross-benches, that there will be no repetition of the recent flood of
ill-digested legislation.
The Marquess of Salisbury played his 'king-maker' role in 1957. His
interrogation of the Cabinet virtually decided that Harold Macmillan, rather
than R A Butler, should succeed Sir Anthony Eden as prime minister.

The Egyptian government has approved a private-sector plan to build an oil

A group of Egyptian and Kuwaiti investors, operating as the Sahara Company
for Petroleum Products, plan to spend about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 769m) on
the refinery, which would probably use Saudi or Kuwaiti crude and refine
products for export, oil minister Hamdi el-Banbi said yesterday.
Plans to build a separate private-sector refinery of about the same size on
the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria were more advanced than those for
the Suez one.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers and officials from Caribbean Community (Caricom) countries have
spent this week solving a dispute which threatened to overshadow next week's
formal establishment of the new Association of Caribbean States trade bloc.
A diplomatic shuttle was needed to persuade President Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela to attend Sunday's signing ceremony. Venezuela had considered
recalling its diplomats from Caricom before a hurried visit to Caracas by
Caricom officials resolved the problem.
Venezuela's displeasure arises from a letter sent by Caricom leaders to
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who is in prison awaiting
trial on corruption charges. In his two terms in office, Mr Perez promoted
closer ties with Caricom and the letter expressed 'profound appreciation'
for his contribution to 'the development of democracy and economic
advancement in the hemisphere'.
Mr Caldera's administration interpreted the letter as interference in his
country's domestic affairs.
Caricom quickly sent the fence-mending mission to secure the participation
of one of the more important members in the new trade group.
With Venezuela mollified, attention is now on the start of the new economic
group of 25 countries, with about 15 dependent territories to be offered
associate membership.
The 13 Caricom members (English-speaking countries including Belize in
Central America and Guyana in South America) will be joined in the ACS by
the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela), the countries of
Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Surinam. Haiti's
seat will be offered to the government in exile.
'The signing of the convention creating the ACS will launch new
opportunities for the pursuit of collective initiatives by 40 states,
countries and territories, comprising some 200m people, united by the waters
of the Caribbean,' the Caricom secretariat said.
The aims of the new group include the expansion of trade among its members
and an increase in the level of functional co-operation in several sectors,
including energy, seabed mining, agricultural and industrial development,
transport and communication.
The ACS will take a common approach in international trade negotiations,
such as with the European Union and with the members of Nafta. It will be
involved in the negotiations of 'preferential arrangements for trade in
goods and, pending the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations, in
services as well', according to Caricom.
The row between Caricom and Venezuela was an early hurdle for the ACS to
clear. The involvement of Cuba may prove less easy to resolve.
Cuba sees the new trade group as a possible opportunity of escaping from its
economic morass. Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, says his
country is seeking regional co-operation in tourism, and to expand its
market for a range of goods and services.
US concern at Cuba's inclusion has already meant the loss of some associate
members. Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, both US territories, will
not join the ACS.

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Gatt shuts door on environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A proposal by the US to make Gatt a more open institution was turned down by
its trading partners yesterday, in a move that will give US environmental
groups further ammunition in their campaign against the Uruguay Round trade
accords.
Mr Booth Gardner, US ambassador to Gatt, said environmental organisations
should be invited to an open meeting of Gatt's governing council to discuss
a panel report condemning a US embargo on tuna imports. The embargo applies
to countries deemed to kill too many dolphins in tuna fishing nets or which
import from those countries.
The tuna-dolphin case has become a cause celebre among US environmentalists,
who see it as proof that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
antipathetic to environmental concerns. Much of their indignation has
centred on the secrecy of Gatt dispute settlement procedures, in which a
three-person panel hears evidence from governments in private before passing
judgment.
The US proposal met with almost universal opposition. The European Union
said it would set a dangerous precedent for other interest groups such as
farm unions, while Brazil dismissed the idea as 'inappropriate, impractical
and unreasonable'. India, Australia, the Nordic states, Asean, Canada,
Argentina, Mexico and New Zealand also expressed disagreement.
The Gatt panel report, the second to condemn the US tuna embargo, says the
US breached fair trade rules in imposing a trade ban designed to force other
nations to change their own domestic laws and practices, however worthy the
motive.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said in May the US would
'challenge the dispute settlement panel's failure to provide a fair hearing
and due process'.
However, the EU yesterday won wide support for formal endorsement of the
panel ruling, on a complaint brought by Brussels after Mexico declined to
press ahead with the earlier case. In a statement, Mexico said it would now
consider requesting adoption of the first report at the next meeting of the
council in October. Under present rules panel reports must be adopted by
consensus.
Figures compiled by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission show that
dolphin deaths associated with tuna fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific
have fallen from 133,000 in 1986 to 3,600 in 1993, compared with a dolphin
population of 9.5m. The fall reflects conservation efforts by fishing
nations and predates the 1990 US embargo.
Earlier, the council approved Vietnam's request for observer status - seen
as a first step in the membership process - and endorsed Gatt entry terms
for Slovenia.

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Modest results seen for EU's regulatory
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's plans to stimulate greater regulatory competition
between member countries - a keystone of its single market programme - are
likely to produce only modest results, according to a study*.
The study, by Stephen Woolcock, a research fellow at the London School of
Economics, says this is likely to limit the application of subsidiarity -the
principle, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, that decisions be taken at
the lowest appropriate level.
The study also concludes that the approach pioneered by the EU does not
offer a basis for an effective framework for global deregulation, because it
requires governments to surrender a politically unacceptable degree of
sovereignty.
Since the mid-1980s, the EU has sought to break down nat-ional barriers by
requiring member countries to recognise one another's regulations and
standards for products and services, in the belief cross-border competition
would lead them gradually to converge. But the study finds little evidence
that has happened so far and says important obstacles remain:
Persistence of past national policies and practices, which prevent
development of a true single market;
Limited transparency and lack of information on the impact of national
regulations and the effect of changing them;
Inadequate enforcement of EU and national rules, which undermines mutual
confidence among regulators;
The ability of national regulators to keep standards above the agreed EU
minimum level.
When national rules have converged, it has been more often due to technical
discussions between experts than to cross-border competition.
'The general conclusion that appears to emerge. . . is that the scope for
competition be-tween rules is, in reality, fairly limited,' the study says.
'Those who see it as a panacea for problems of deciding be-tween national
and EC-level regulation, or as a means of avoiding having to decide on the
form of European-level regulatory policies, seem likely to be disappointed.'

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: The joint way to break steel bars - A look
at Japanese-American partnerships that beat the import barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, last week agreed to take a 10
per cent equity stake in New CF&amp;I of the US, a subsidiary of Oregon Steel,
and provide its subsidiary, CF&amp;I, with the technology and facilities to
manufacture head-hardened rail.
The arrangement will enable Nippon Steel to overcome the impact of the yen's
sharp rise against the dollar and to deflect US anti-dumping charges, while
CF&amp;I will benefit by being able to supply the railway industry with a
leading product.
The venture comes two years after CF&amp;I joined Bethlehem Steel in bringing
charges against Japanese steelmakers of dumping rail in the US, and is one
of six ventures by Japanese steelmakers in the US.
Through partnerships with US steel companies, Japanese producers have been
enjoying thriving business in the US while the domestic market has been in
the doldrums.
The US recovery and the longer term need to invest in infrastructure are
expected to support continuing demand for steel products, which Japanese
producers will be able to supply through their US operations without the
worry of anti-dumping duties.
An example of a successful move of this type is Kobe Steel's two joint
ventures in the US with USS, the largest US steelmaker.
Mr Ryuji Higashi, director of Kobe's steel sales group, expresses regret
over the persistent trade friction between the US and Japan - which he
blames in part on the politicians and bureaucrats - but says that between
businesses on both sides, and particularly between Kobe and USX, 'things are
going very well'.
USS/Kobe Steel is an equal partnership joint venture with USX, the parent
company of USS, which produces steel bars and pipes for the automotive,
petrochemical and aerospace industries.
The company has been profitable in each of its five years in operation, with
profits of Y190bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the fiscal year to end-March. Its
success has enabled it to finance substantial capital investments.
Pro-Tec, the second joint venture between Kobe and USX, which makes coated
steel sheet for the car, electronics and construction industries, did not
make a profit in its first year of operation.
But Kobe is pleased that the company, which began operations in January last
year, is already running at 70 per cent capacity and turned profitable in
the fourth quarter of its first year.
'Whether a joint venture succeeds depends on whether the partners can trust
each other and in that sense, Kobe and USX have been a great success,' says
Mr Higashi.
From the start, the partnership seemed like a perfect match. At the time,
USX's Lorain Works in Ohio needed equipment and technology if it was to
remain competitive.
Kobe Steel needed a facility in the US and an experienced workforce to help
it supply that market, including the growing number of Japanese 'transplant'
motor vehicle manufacturers, free from the risk of anti-dumping charges.
There are obvious differences in management style. 'The culture is
different, the history is different, the language is different,' Mr Higashi
says.
However, the two sides have been careful to respect each other's strengths
and capitalise on them. On technology, for example, the US company generally
heeds the advice of its Japanese partner whose technological expertise
helped transform Lorain into a world class facility. Kobe leaves production
matters largely to the Americans.
The partnership has also been able to take advantage of the US company's
marketing skills and of Kobe's connections with Japanese companies which
have set up manufacturing operations in the US.
Kobe is also pleased that it is able to avoid the worst impact of the yen's
recent rise against the dollar. If the company had still been exporting
coated steel sheet to the US, for example, the yen's rise would have meant
loss of the business, Mr Higashi says.
Kobe's US experience will provide useful lessons as the company faces
pressure to look outside Japan for future growth.
Given the long history and pride of the European steel industry, Europe is
unlikely to provide opportunities for similar ventures. But Mr Higashi
believes that eventually the company will have to consider manufacturing
elsewhere in Asia to supply the growing south-east Asian and Chinese
markets.
'One day we will no longer be able to export to these regions,' Mr Higashi
says.
Although setting up manufacturing facilities overseas is a risky move for
capital intensive steel companies, and there are no large steel companies
such as USX in the region to smooth the process, Kobe's happy experience
with its American partner bodes well for such ventures in Asia.

<TEXT>
Du Pont, the US chemicals company, is holding talks with Indian partners to
set up five separate ventures in core sectors such as agrochemicals,
engineering polymers, pigments, automotive safety products and nylon and
Teflon.
Du Pont plans to expand into the Indian market through its subsidiaries and
branded products, a departure from its current emphasis on selling advanced
technology to Indian companies such as Reliance, India's largest private
sector company.
Du Pont Far East, through which the US conglomerate operates in India, has
two Indian joint venture partners, the Delhi-based Thapar group and the
Madras-based TVS group.
It may collaborate with both in engineering polymers for the power and
telecom industries, white pigments, nylon for tyres, and tyre-dipping
facilities, Tynex nylon for toothbrushes and health-care products,
agrochemicals for crop protection, and polyester for textiles and imaging
films.
The subsidiary will entrust the marketing of its nylon products to the
Thapar group, its joint venture partner for a nylon plant in Goa. Several
new projects are also being discussed with the TVS group, which is producing
Tynex bristles for toothbrushes.
The company is exploring the possibility of setting up wholly owned
subsidiaries, and would prefer to hold a majority stake and operational
control. 'But we will go ahead even without a dominant equity-holding, if we
find the right partner,' a spokesman said.
The multinational is negotiating with Reliance to manufacture Dacron, a
specialised polyester staple fibre (PSF). The Indian petrochemicals
conglomerate hopes to become one of Asia's top five PSF producers in Asia
after its new plant at Hazira in Gujarat goes into production by late 1995.
Analysts expect the Indian PSF market to grow by 20 per cent by 1997,
because of cotton and viscose price increases.

Japanese steelmakers plan to by-pass a Chinese government agency and export
5,000 tonnes of steel directly to two Chinese companies next month, agencies
report from Tokyo.
The emergency measure follows the collapse of bilateral talks on prices and
export levels, Kawasaki Steel said. It said the exports involved hot-rolled
steel plate produced by Kawasaki and five other blast furnace operators,
adding that prices would be about Dollars 20 a tonne higher than in the
first six months of this year. The other five companies are Nippon Steel,
NKK, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Kobe Steel and Nisshin Steel.

FT  21 JUL 94 / China ends phone monopoly: Beijing aims to boost lines from
30m to 120m by year 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China has abolished its telephone monopoly, in a step towards allowing
western companies to participate in operating networks in the world's
largest telecoms market.
The state council has allowed a consortium of three other ministries to
build a national telecoms network in competition with the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications, despite strong efforts by the MPT to preserve its
monopoly.
The liberalisation is being driven by the government's ambitious aim of
increasing the number of phone lines in China from about 30m to 120m by
2000. Barely two in 100 Chinese have a phone line, compared with 49 per 100
in Hong Kong.
The three ministries - railways, electronic industries and electrical power
 -this week launched a joint venture called China United Telecommunications
(Unicom), backed by leading domestic investment groups. Unicom is licensed
to provide long-distance telecoms links, and may also have its own local
connections.
Nynex, the US regional Bell operator, has signed a memorandum of
understanding with one of the ministries, which may lead to a joint venture.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Salomon Brothers Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst, said:
'This signals an acceleration of the liberalisation process in China. It
could be only months before they allow western companies to form joint
ventures to operate networks.'
Unicom's launch follows three notable steps towards liberalisation in the
past year. In January the ministry of electronic industries was allowed to
compete with the MPT in data telecoms services. It set up an operation
called Ji Tong, which has formed a joint venture with Bell South, another US
regional operator.
Earlier this year the operating and regulatory divisions of the MPT were
separated, making it easier for new operators to establish themselves.
Last September the People's Liberation Army was allowed to use its radio
networks for commercial purposes after a protracted battle with MPT.
The market for telecommunications equipment has long been liberalised and
most leading western suppliers have production facilities in China.
In addition to rival ministries, local and regional leaders have also been
seeking to break the MPT's stranglehold on telecoms development. Last autumn
Mr Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, called for joint ventures with western
operators to accelerate the building of new lines.
Many of the leading western operators are anxious to exploit investment
opportunities in China. In addition to Nynex and Bell South, AT&amp;T - the
largest US operator - is active in Beijing, while Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK
group which holds a majority share of Hongkong Telecom, has been nominated
'preferred partner' by the MPT for future collaboration.
Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, held talks in Beijing in March with telecoms
officials and with Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president. He said C&amp;W's first
Chinese joint ventures could be agreed by the end of the year.

FT  21 JUL 94 / BoJ Quarterly Economic Report: Japan heads for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese economy is at last headed for recovery, the Bank of Japan said
in its quarterly economic report published yesterday.
Buoyed by rising consumption, fiscal and monetary policy stimuli and
expansion in overseas markets, Japanese business was emerging from the long
recession, the central bank said. But it warned that the pace of recovery
would be slow as private sector investment remained weak and unemployment
drifted upward.
In its last report issued in April, the Bank said only that the economy had
'stopped declining', but in recent months it has become much more optimistic
about the prospects for recovery. Yesterday's report underlined its sanguine
view. It said the recent sharp rise of the yen against the dollar might not
be as damaging as some industrialists have feared, since it could be offset
by world economic recovery and cost-cutting in Japanese businesses.
Most components of aggregate demand would support recovery in the current
year, according to the Bank. Income tax cuts and price stability would
bolster personal consumption. Public sector investment was rising, and even
private sector investment, which has been particularly sluggish in the last
three years, was expected to stop declining in the latter part of the year.
Only exports were expected to show a decline as manufacturing production
continued to shift overseas.
The risks to the recovery remained strong, however. Corporate indebtedness
continued to act as a brake on private investment, and import penetration of
Japanese markets posed a threat to companies' prospects.
In a separate report yesterday, the research institute at the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan said it was raising its forecast for growth in the
current year to 0.7 per cent from minus 0.2 per cent in its last forecast in
January. The institute said the improved prospects were due to unexpectedly
strong recovery in personal consumption and robust private housing
investment.

</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government said yesterday it plans next year to introduce
comprehensive legislation to outlaw discrimination against people with
disabilities.
Mrs Elizabeth Wong, the colony's secretary for health and welfare, said that
harassment and vilification of the disabled would also be outlawed. Disabled
people will have recourse to an Equal Opportunities Commission which is to
be established, if they believe they are the target of discriminatory
practices.
The legislation will also cover those who are HIV positive or have Aids  - a
provision which goes further than the UK, where workers sacked for having
the HIV virus have recourse only to the general law on employment
protection.
A week ago the government published a discussion paper that advocated the
introduction of an old-age pension. This drew a hostile reaction from
business, which countered by suggesting expanding existing benefits rather
than creating a new one.
The latest announcement is bound to raise concerns among the more
conservative elements in Hong Kong who think the government is going too far
in its welfare policy.
Mrs Wong said the legislation would enshrine in law 'the standards to which
we believe Hong Kong, as a civilised community, should adhere'. She said
'disability' was any physical or mental impairment that limited a person's
life activities.
The proposed legislation will contain provisions to cover discrimination at
work, in recreation and education, as well as in housing, and access to and
use of buildings.
The law will not impose general requirements on employers to provide more
jobs or better facilities to persons with disabilities.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Reclusive Kim acclaimed leader: Some fear eruption of power
struggle in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Jong-il was proclaimed as North Korea's new leader yesterday at a
memorial ceremony in Pyongyang for his father, the late president Kim
Il-sung.
The reclusive Mr Kim did not speak to the hundreds of thousands of people
that crowded into Kim Il-sung square, but Mr Kim Yong-nam, foreign minister,
led a group of officials who vowed support for the 52-year-old Dear Leader
and referred to him as 'head of state'.
Mr Kim is expected to assume the positions of general secretary of the
Korean Workers' Party and president after the party and parliament hold
formal sessions.
The new North Korean leader, dressed in a black suit and wearing a mourning
armband, looked haggard in the sweltering heat of Pyongyang as he gazed at
the grim-faced and weeping crowd.
The foreign minister refrained from criticising the US, in an indication
that the new leadership will continue the policy of reconciliation recently
pursued by the late president. The US hopes to resume talks with North Korea
in Geneva at the beginning of August in an attempt to resolve the dispute
over Pyongyang's nuclear programme, according to US officials.
The 75-minute ceremony, broadcast live to foreign countries, 'was meant to
send a message to the world that the situation in North Korea is stable and
that there will be no sudden changes in policy,' said Mr Michael Breen, an
analyst on North Korea for Seoul-based Merit Consultancy.
Nonetheless, other analysts suggest a power struggle is looming in
Pyongyang. They note that Ms Kim Song-ae, the president's widow who is
believed to oppose her stepson's assumption of power, had a prominent place
in the funeral services on Tuesday.
She advanced to 14th in the hierarchy at the funeral from a ranking of 104th
on the state funeral committee, which was announced last week. This could
indicate that her influence and that of the conservative old guard is
growing.
But Mr Kim Pyong-il, her natural son and a potential rival to his
stepbrother, was not mentioned as being present at the funeral.
The body of Mr Kim Il-sung is expected to be laid to rest temporarily at the
presidential palace to await completion of the Kim Il-sung memorial hall,
where he will go on permanent display in a glass coffin.
Meanwhile, South Korean President Kim Young-sam warned that radical students
who have held mourning ceremonies for the North Korean leader will face
harsh punishment.
'The government cannot continue to be so tolerant. The government will never
tolerate those students who blindly follow communism and indiscriminate
violence,' he said.
The South Korean government has claimed that leftist radicals are formenting
student and trade union unrest on instructions from Pyongyang.
The students can be prosecuted under the national security law, which
prohibits contacts with North Korea or expressions of sympathy for its
government. Mr Jose Ayala-Lasso, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, yesterday criticised the law after meeting officials in Seoul.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Japanese frugality comes under threat: Finance ministry
officials are trying to prevent an explosion of state debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's finance ministry is struggling to prevent the new government from
detonating what officials fear may become an explosion of state debt.
The new three-party coalition's populist plan to cut income taxes and
further drive up spending has created alarm among the finance ministry's
mandarins, reluctant to abandon the fiscal frugality which they see as a
vital feature of Japan's economic strength.
After strenuous persuasion by the ministry, the previous coalition had
agreed that an income tax cut must be decided at the same time as a
subsequent rise in the 3 per cent sales tax, possibly to 7 per cent. A
decision was being prepared for late June, until the new government, with
its lax tax policy, staged its parliamentary coup three weeks ago.
The sales tax rise would not only fund the income tax cut, but also start to
compensate for a decline in the income tax base which will be caused by a
sharp growth in the number of pensioners. This is needed because Japan's
present tax structure prepares it badly for the coming grey wave. A fifth of
government income comes from sales tax, well below the average of 30 per
cent for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries,
and around two-thirds of state revenue is derived from income tax, with the
balance from property and capital gains taxes.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the socialist prime minister, and his Liberal
Democratic party partners now wish to leave any planned rise in the
politically unpopular sales tax vague. Finance ministry officials now have
no idea when or whether they will obtain their cherished tax reform, a
poison chalice that may be passed to a future government.
In the meantime, coalition leaders want to fund the tax cuts they plan to
make - around Y6,000bn (Pounds 38bn) annually - with a mixture of cuts in
government spending and the issuance of deficit bonds. This is heresy to a
finance ministry deeply scarred by its mid-1970s experience of struggling to
control a rising budget deficit, a consequence of a rise in public spending
to stimulate the economy after the first oil shock.
Most Japanese state debt is in the form of construction bonds, so called
because they finance infrastructure projects, so adding to the nation's
physical wealth. The finance ministry has no objection to these, but does
object to increasing its dependence on deficit bonds to cover future
pensions and other non-infrastructure spending.
The ministry agreed to four economic stimulus packages, totalling Y45,000bn
over the past two years, only on condition that it would not have to issue
deficit bonds to fund them. In the event, it was forced this year to issue
deficit bonds for the first time since 1989, to cover just over 4 per cent
of spending. Officials fear it will be hard to resist issuing more.
This may be 'unavoidable', warns Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the
LDP.
Just as worrying, the new government has pledged abundant cash hand-outs
during its short time in office, to do more to stimulate the economy, but
also to satisfy politically important groups such as farmers.
The latest government largesse includes a Y40,000bn plan to install a
national fibre optic cable network next year, and there is talk of adding
Y170,000bn to an existing Y430,000bn public works programme, covering the
decade to 2000. This week's cabinet meeting was deluged with ministerial
requests for 'exceptional treatment' for pet projects in next year's budget.
Government finances are far weaker than politicians realise, argues the
ministry. Applying the standard international measure, Japan's general
government deficit stands at 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product,
apparently far healthier than the US, at 2.6 per cent, according to the
OECD.
This is a misleading guide, say the bureaucrats. Japan's budget deficit
includes a 3.8 per cent of GDP surplus on its social security budget, more
than three times the average social security surplus for the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations. Exclude social security, and the government
deficit shoots up to a worrisome 5.7 per cent of GDP, well ahead of the US
at 3.5 per cent.
Japan's social security surplus is artificially large because its social
security system is much younger than those of its partners. That means it is
flush with contributions but not yet depleted by pay-outs. It will quickly
turn into a deficit as the proportion of people aged over 65 climbs from
around 12 per cent - among the lowest in the OECD - in 1990, to 25.5 per
cent, expected to be among the highest in the industrialised world, by 2020.
The finance ministry is unwilling to plunder the social security budget for
general spending on the grounds that the cash belongs to future pensioners
and may in any case be inadequate to meet obligations. It does already lend
from the social security budget to other state bodies, such as the Japan
Development Bank, to fund their own projects, so the surplus is not idle.
Japan looks surprisingly indebted by another measure - its interest bill.
The cost of servicing its accumulated Y200,000bn debt reached 15.7 per cent
of GDP last year, the highest among the world's five top economies,
according to the OECD. That will rise. The government borrowed to finance 14
per cent of its spending last year, climbing to nearly 19 per cent this
year.
The mandarins believe they can probably count on the support of former
finance ministers in the LDP, the largest member of the coalition, as well
as centre-right opposition parties. But for the time being, the provident
are in a minority. Japan's new government is in a mood to ignore the finance
ministry and borrow its way out of trouble.

The Philippines has concluded an agreement for the rescheduling of Dollars
469m (Pounds 308m) worth of debts from its Paris Club of official creditors,
the government announced yesterday.
The rescheduling, agreed in Paris, follows the approval on June 24 by the

It also precedes a meeting today, also in Paris, of the consultative group
that co-ordinates a World Bank-led multilateral assistance programme for the
Philippines.
Pledges of some Dollars 2bn concessional loans and grants are expected at
the meeting.
With these financial packages, the Philippines now stands 'on the threshold
of a full and dramatic recovery,' Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance
secretary, said.
The rescheduling, Mr de Ocampo said, supports 'the soft-landing approach to
the country's exit from exceptional financing. . .to achieve growth
consistent with sustainable external accounts primarily supported by
voluntary flows.'
The economy grew by 4.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year, a big
jump from 0.3 per cent in the same period last year.
This has led to expectations that the 4.5 per cent growth targeted for the
full-year will be exceeded.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new socialist prime minister yesterday formally declared the
military to be constitutional, an historic retreat from his party's deep
pacifism.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama was greeted by shouts and applause in parliament, where
he announced his political about-turn. It came in response to a question
from Mr Tsutomu Hata, his predecessor, who was needling him for forcing Mr
Hata's resignation three weeks ago. Mr Hata, a firm supporter of the
self-defence forces, stepped down rather than face a no-confidence vote from
Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party and the conservative Liberal
Democratic party.
'Please listen to this carefully,' Mr Murayama told the chamber. 'As long as
we keep the defence-only posture and as long as they are kept at a minimum,
the Self-Defence Forces are constitutional.'
Mr Murayama's remarks will be greeted with relief by the armed forces, of
which he automatically became commander in chief on taking the prime
ministership.
Under nearly four decades of LDP rule, Japan grew to become the world's
largest defence spender after the US, if military pensions are included.
This is despite article nine of Japan's 1946 constitution, which says 'land,
sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be
maintained.'
Officially, the SDP takes the constitution literally, though its moderate
leadership has long admitted that the party's anti-military stance is
unrealistic.
This is the latest sign of SDP leaders' willingness to abandon party
principles in the interests of staying in the government coalition with the
LDP, which brought Mr Murayama to power as the first socialist prime
minister in 47 years.

Nepali police yesterday detained 252 people who were enforcing a
communist-sponsored nationwide strike that paralysed the capital Kathmandu
and most of the country, agencies report from Kathmandu.
An interior ministry spokesman said demonstrators demanding that Mr Girija
Prasad Koirala, caretaker prime minister, leave office damaged 15
state-owned commuter buses, a police van and a car with Indian licence
plates in the capital. The strike brought Kathmandu to a standstill.
Mr Koirala, 70, Nepal's first democratically-elected leader in three
decades, resigned on July 10 after losing a policy vote in parliament, but
was asked by King Birendra to stay on as caretaker.
The communist-led opposition demanded that Mr Koirala leave office so that
he cannot influence the outcome of the general election scheduled for
November 13. At least 20,000 people gathered near the royal palace to back
the call.
Mr Koirala's government collapsed because of infighting in his Nepali
Congress party, but many Nepalis are also frustrated that democracy has not
done more to alleviate the country's poverty.
The opposition demands that King Birendra, who gave up his absolute powers
to become a constitutional monarch in 1990 after a bloody pro-democracy
campaign, appoint a government of national unity to oversee the elections.

Another taboo in Middle Eastern politics was broken yesterday when Mr Shimon
Peres, Israel's foreign minister, crossed the border from Israel to Jordan
to hold peace talks with Mr Abdul-Salamal-Majali, the Jordanian prime
minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, on the shores of
the Dead Sea.
Mr Peres flew in from Jerusalem in a military helicopter to become the first
Israeli cabinet minister to be received openly in the kingdom. 'It took us
15 minutes to fly over but 46 years to arrive to this place of peace and
promise,' he said on arrival.
The talks are the fifth in a series of trilateral negotiations which began
last October to focus on areas of economic and infrastructural co-operation
between Jordan and Israel.
They come a day after the close of bilateral border talks on land and water
rights and less than a week before Jordan's King Hussein is due to meet Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in Washington.
All three parties emphasised the historical importance of the meeting,
saying it was a critical step on the path towards peace between the two
countries. Mr Peres said that a similar meeting had been suggested six
months ago but 'at the time seemed an impossibility'.
Mr Christopher said that now the ice had been broken, 'high-level
negotiations could take place regularly.'
But having just arrived from Damascus he was careful to stress that progress
on the Jordanian track would not be to the exclusion of Syria, where he is
due to return tomorrow.
Mr Peres described the planned summit between the Jordanian king and Israeli
premier as 'the start of a new era' in Jordanian-Israeli relations, and Mr
Majali, who was acting in his role as foreign minister, did not rule out the
signing of some kind of agreement or declaration in Washington.
However, he warned against optimism that a full peace treaty between the two
sides would be signed soon.
Instead, peace would come in stages: 'Like a book, the peace will come in
chapters. Only when all the chapters have been written can a full peace
treaty be signed. Although this is not to say that along the way each
chapter can be put into practice,' he said.
Earlier in the day, King Hussein said: 'I hope to sign as soon as it is
possible. But not next week.'
Concrete agreements at the end of the talks were limited to further studies
on future projects and economic co-operation, including:
A master plan to develop the Jordan Valley into a joint national heritage
park.
A study of aviation routes to benefit both countries.
A commission to promote tourism which will include opening a crossing-point
between Aqaba and Eilat, on the Red Sea, for third-country nationals.
A site survey for a road linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt along the Gulf of
Aqaba.
Mr Peres spoke optimistically of open borders, trade and skies in the future
where 'farms replace soldiers and greenhouses replace army barracks.'
He said that the border dispute in which Israel occupies around 380 square
kilometres of Jordanian land was near resolution; 'We can mark out (the
border) now while respecting the sovereignty of both sides,' he said.

FT  21 JUL 94 / US denies setting deadline for Haiti rulers

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday increased the war of words on Haiti's military leaders but
denied that any deadline had been set for them voluntarily to relinquish
power.
President Bill Clinton, who had been quoted as saying he was 'more
determined than ever' to bring about a change in Haiti's leadership, denied
the existence of a deadline.
So did his special envoy, Mr Bill Gray, whose comments in another interview
had been interpreted as pointing to an October 1 target date. Asked by USA
Today what would happen when the treaty enabling the US to repatriate
Haitians expired in October, he replied, 'Our expectations are that the
'three stooges' will not be in power' by that date. He was referring to Lt
Gen Raoul Cedras, the army chief, Brig Gen Philippe Biamby, army chief of
staff, and Lt Col Michel Francois, who heads the police.
The administration has, meanwhile, begun a new round of talks at the United
Nations that could lead to the authorisation of a UN peacekeeping force in
Haiti, and even UN endorsement of a US-led invasion by a multinational
force.
However, Congressman Bill Richardson returned from Haiti on Tuesday saying
that Lt Gen Cedras might be ready 'to make a move' to avoid a US invasion.
After talks with Mr Clinton yesterday, Mr Richardson said he thought
invasion should be 'a last resort'. Current US policy, he said, 'is working,
economic sanctions are biting, the refugee policy is also working. I think
it's important we be patient.' Other congressmen at the meeting reported no
sense of an imminent US invasion.
But Mr Gray ruled out protracted discussions with the junta. 'We are only
open to one negotiation; when are you leaving?' he said. He was dismissive
about popular US opposition to an invasion: 'You don't make foreign policy
by polls.'

FT  21 JUL 94 / Fed chief sees moderate economic growth rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is settling into a pattern of more moderate growth, Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday in his half-yearly
report to Congress.
The Fed forecast real GDP growth of 3-3.25 per cent over this year,
unchanged from its February forecast, and 2.5-2.75 next year. This compares
with growth at an annual rate of 7 per cent in the last quarter of 1993 and
3.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
'The favourable performance of the economy continued in the first half of
1994,' Mr Greenspan said in his generally upbeat prepared testimony to the
Senate banking committee. 'Economic growth was strong, unemployment fell
appreciably, and inflation remained subdued.'
Growth should continue at a moderate rate over the next six quarters while
inflation should remain subdued, provided 'appropriate' monetary policies
were pursued, he said.
Inflation is projected at 2.75-3 per cent this year, and little changed or
only slightly higher next year.
Accompanying those projections, however, Mr Greenspan gave a detailed
rationale for the Fed's succession of monetary tightening moves so far this
year and foreshadowed further possible rate rises should the inflation
picture show signs of deterioration.
'It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to
head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favourable trends in the
economy,' he said.
Reviewing possible danger signals on inflation, Mr Greenspan noted that
labour markets had tightened considerably in recent months, while costs of
commodities and materials had climbed, partly reflecting tighter capacity
utilisation. Improving economic conditions among the US's trading partners
should further boost demand, he said.
However, on the positive side wage rates had not shown 'persuasive' signs of
acceleration so far and consumer price rises excluding food and energy had
remained near last year's pace.
In such circumstances the Fed would maintain its vigilance over price
acceleration. 'An increase in inflation would come at considerable cost,' he
warned. 'We would lose hard-won ground in the fight against inflation
expectations - ground that would be difficult to recapture later. . . and
harsher actions would eventually be necessary to reverse the upsurge in
inflationary instabilities.'
Much of Mr Greenspan's testimony was devoted to recent market volatility.
The financial markets were not fully prepared for the Fed's shift from its
accommodative stance on interest rates in February, he acknowledged.
This lay behind the Fed's gradualist policy in raising rates. Nonetheless,
there was a sharp market reaction to the Fed's first  1/4 -point rate rise.
Evidence of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the US and abroad,
combined with the changing expectations of Fed moves, prompted sharp rises
in long-term interest rates over the first half.
On the recent dollar weakness, the Fed chairman said appropriate monetary
and economic policy would achieve the goals of solid economic growth and
price stability, and ensure that dollar-denominated assets remained
attractive to global investors.
Rising interest rates and financial market volatility did not seem to have
slowed overall credit flows this year, Mr Greenspan said. Domestic
non-fiancial sector debt had grown at an annual rate of 5.25 per cent up
till May, well within its 4-8 per cent monitoring range.
However, the composition of debt growth was changing, Mr Greenspan said.
Expansion of federal debt had slowed as a result of efforts to cut the
budget deficit. Business, household, state and local government debt had
been growing faster. This indicated that private borrowers had become less
cautious about taking on debt and lenders were more comfortable lending.
Nonetheless, the expansion of monetary aggregates remained subdued this
year. Looking ahead, the Fed's provisional forecasts for broad money growth
show M2 within a 1-5 per cent range for 1995, unchanged from this year, with
M3 within an unchanged 0-4 per cent range.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Study gives boost to Clinton healthcare plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury yesterday provided ammunition for the administration's
healthcare reform initiative, with a report that 84 per cent of the 37m
Americans without health insurance were from working families.
The Treasury defined working families as those in which at least one spouse
had a permanent full-time job.
'The bottom line: the uninsured are your middle-income working neighbours,'
said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, as he announced the results of
the Treasury study.
Mr Bentsen said the administration hoped these findings would dispel the
myth that the 'uninsured are poor, or disabled, or elderly'.
The average uninsured family has an income of Dollars 30,000 (Pounds
19,700), well above the federal definition of poverty, says the report,
which also finds that close to 25 per cent of uninsured Americans are
children.
'Millions of children across
this country have no insurance,' Mr Bentsen said. 'Children don't hire
lobbyists. They don't have anyone to speak for them in this debate, but they
are the ones most vulnerable.'
As Congress nears the legislative phase of healthcare reform, Mr Bentsen and
President Bill Clinton moved to clarify statements made by Mr Clinton
yesterday. Mr Clinton had said that while his goal was for 'universal
coverage' he would accept a reform package that 'moved towards' universal
coverage.
'I don't see the president backing down,' Mr Bentsen said. 'I think
universal coverage, when you define what we are talking about, is
guaranteeing the right to every American of insurance.'
Mr Bentsen also said that the administration 'preferred' to achieve such
coverage by making it mandatory for employers to pay to insure their
workers, but the president would accept an alternative proposal if it still
covered all Americans.
Mr Bentsen was confident congressional leaders could be convinced to pass
healthcare reform this year, but he refused to comment on whether the
administration's initiative could be passed.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Judge arrests drug company chiefs: Venezuelan probe into
medicine pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Venezuelan criminal court judge investigating alleged overpricing of
medicines has issued 16 arrest warrants against executives of pharmaceutical
companies operating in Venezuela, including the subsidiaries of several
multinationals.
The warrants, issued by Judge Cristobal Ramirez in Caracas, are against
executives from companies, including units of Ciba-Geigy, Eli Lilly, Merck,
Rhone-Poulenc, Roche, Sandoz and Servier. Most of the executives cited are
reported to have turned themselves in to the judge and have been released on
bail.
Judge Ramirez, who has said his investigation will affect more
pharmaceutical companies, claims that lists of products submitted to the
government at the beginning of this year by drug companies contained prices
that were inflated in comparison to prices listed a month earlier. At the
time, the outgoing government, replaced by the administration of President
Rafael Caldera on February 2, was getting ready to order wide-ranging price
controls on medicines.
Representatives of drug companies have said the prices submitted before the
imposition of price controls contained increases covering a new value added
tax (which was later eliminated) and other legitimate cost increases.
Mr Francisco Allende, executive director of Caveme, an industry association
that includes the 36 international drug companies operating in Venezuela,
said the steady devaluation of Venezuela's currency had hit retail drug
prices, since over 70 per cent of the value of products sold in Venezuela
are imported.
'We can't live with prices frozen at the level of December 1993, with the
dollar reaching as high as 200 bolivars,' he said. The dollar cost of
imports has risen sharply. Before exchange controls announced on June 27,
the bolivar had fallen to 200 to the dollar, representing a 47 per cent
devaluation from the end of 1993.
'Prices of medicines are frozen, but the industry still has to deal with
increasing costs for imported raw materials and other inputs, as well as
costlier labour,' Mr Allende added.
One pharmaceutical company executive said: 'These charges are seen by many
as a witch hunt against the pharmaceutical industry, since they've come at a
time when the government is blaming the business sector for high prices and
is trying to bully us into price stability.'
Many managers believe the government has helped to create a general
anti-business environment in recent weeks, accusing shopkeepers of
profiteering, speculation and hoarding, in an effort to divert blame for the
failure of earlier anti-inflation policies.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Balladur puts the squeeze on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday ordered ministers
to curb their spending requests for 1995 and said that the rise in total
government expenditure had to be limited to the expected inflation rate of
1.7 per cent.
His demand, made during meetings with government ministers, represents an
attempt to reassure financial markets that the government's plans to cut the
budget deficit will not be compromised by political pressures ahead of next
year's presidential election.
Mr Balladur warned that failure to stick to the government's five year
budget deficit reduction plan could threaten economic growth by putting
upward pressure on interest rates. Under the plan, the deficit is targeted
at FFr301bn (Dollars 56bn) this year and FFr275bn in 1995, compared to
FFr315bn last year.
Details of ministerial spending requests for next year have not been
revealed, but are thought to be substantially higher than the funds
available. Debt repayments and pay increases for civil servants mean that
most ministries will face spending cuts this year. The most difficult
ministries are thought to be defence and social security.
Political opponents, however, were unimpressed by Mr Balladur's statements.
The Socialist party attacked the rise in public sector debt. 'There has been
a significant deterioration which does not appear to have achieved
anything,' the Socialists said in a statement.
'Unemployment has grown in worrying proportions and the spending commitments
of the government are only met with difficulty through exceptional
receipts,' the statement said, in a reference to the centre-right
government's privatisation programme.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, said that letters would now be sent
to the various ministries outlining the ceiling for expenditure for next
year. The finalisation of the 1995 budget would then be negotiated in the
autumn of this year.
'There was unanimous agreement on the need to bring public finances under
control,' Mr Sarkozy said.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Reformist Belarus cabinet named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new president of Belarus has named a cabinet chosen from among the most
reformist figures in the country's political class - in contradiction to his
campaign promises and his comments immediately after the election.
Mr Alexander Lukashenko was inaugurated as president of the former Soviet
state yesterday after a campaign promising closer union with Russia and an
end to the privatisation programme as well as to corruption.
Mr Lukashenko appointed a banker Mr Michael Chigir as his prime minister. In
his first news conference, Mr Chigir said: 'I stand for market reforms.
Belarus cannot be an island among states moving towards market reforms. For
the moment I am for state regulated prices, but that is only temporary. I
will pursue reforms.'
Further, Mr Lukashenko has asked Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, head of the
central bank and the strongest opponent in the previous government of a
merger of the Russian and Belarus currencies, to continue in his post.
Mr Bogdankevich, previously regarded by Mr Lukashenko as one of a number of
corrupt officials he would sack, is also identified with the small and so
far weak group of market reformers in the Belarus government.
'Lukashenko's programme will be pro-market,' he said. 'There is simply no
other way to go.'
These moves appear to show that Mr Lukashenko, even more than Mr Leonid
Kuchma, the new president of Ukraine elected at the same time, is
positioning himself to bring in a quite different policy in government than
that laid out to his electors. Mr Kuchma, generally seen as pro-Russian and
elected with the support of the Communist and Socialist groups, has since
also revealed himself as pro-reform and for the retention of full
independence.
However, the plight of both Belarus and Ukraine remains perilous. The two
states were heavily dependent on the Soviet military for the purchase of
their industrial output and on the supply of cheap energy from Russia for
the continued profitability of their plants. The collapse of defence orders
and the rise of energy prices to near world market levels have decimated
their industries and living standards.
It now seems likely that they will seek to negotiate an economic agreement
with Russia aimed at ending tariff and customs barriers between them and
re-establishing links between their enterprises.

FT  21 JUL 94 / 'Semi-detached' called back home: A look at an ultimatum to
civil servants in private industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is quietly rolling back the frontier of state
involvement in the private sector. It is giving senior civil servants in
privatised companies six months to rejoin the civil service or leave it
definitively.
The ultimatum yesterday by Mr Andre Rossinot, the civil service minister,
means that top flight civil servants, or members of the so-called grands
corps of state financial inspectors, auditors and lawyers, will no longer be
able to choose to work for years on 'detachment' in newly private companies
while retaining the option to return to the civil service without missing
anything in pay or rank.
In contrast to other countries which draw their elite from universities,
France has traditionally trained its elite in administrative schools.
Typical is the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) whose top graduates
pass into the grands corps of the Inspectorat des Finances, the Cour des
Comptes (the public audit body) and the Conseil d'Etat (which acts as the
government's adviser on legislation and top administrative tribunal).
After four years' service in these grands corps, these bureaucrats can seek
'detachment' to do whatever they want, but with an indefinite return ticket.
If for instance, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, should decide to
give up politics, he can always return to the Conseil d'Etat, as Mr Jacques
Attali did last year when he resigned as head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
'By removing this safety net for fonctionnaires in privatised companies,'
said an aide to Mr Rossinot yesterday, 'we may be moving towards a more
Anglo-Saxon system, perhaps with golden parachutes' - large pay-offs to
tempt senior civil servants into business.
Mr Rossinot has given civil servants working for companies already
privatised until the end of the year to make their choice, though those of
10 years' or more standing in the civil service can remain 'at the
disposition' of the state with fewer privileges for a further six years.
This will affect those at Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Banque
Nationale de Paris, and the UAP insurance group - all now in the private
sector.
Mr Rossinot's circular is moot in the case of the privatised oil group
Elf-Aquitaine, whose president, Mr Philippe Jaffre, has already resigned as
an inspecteur des finances and given his 60 colleagues in the same position
until May 30 to make their choice.
All but 10 have resigned from the civil service. Mr Jaffre argued it was
unfair for many top Elf directors not to share the same career risks as the
rest of the company's staff.

FT  21 JUL 94 / If not vindicated, certainly a little wiser: The
Bundesbank's totems are set to emerge intact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's credibility has been called into question and its monetary
management methods have been mocked. But both of these totems, counted among
its most prized assets, appear likely to emerge intact from the travails of
the past few months.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the German central bank's president, may even come
through with his reputation as a pragmatic monetarist enhanced. The record
of Mr Otmar Issing, the bank's high priest of monetary orthodoxy, may be
similarly embellished.
Both, together with their fellows on the bank's central council, are already
a little wiser, and keen on learning more.
No one wants a repetition of this year's experiences with the bank's main
policy guidance system, the M3 monetary aggregate, which went haywire at the
turn of the year and is only now settling down. And while the bank's
policy-makers seem to enjoy springing surprises with the timing of their
interest rate changes, the markets' bewilderment at their last discount rate
cut in mid-May is not an experience they want to repeat.
Some signs of new thinking may emerge today after the council's mid-year
review of M3 performance. But it is already plain the over-riding message
will be a re-affirmation of faith in monetary targeting. Even though the
concept has been dropped in all other leading industrial countries, the
Bundesbank insists it is the most reliable indicator of possible inflation.
The M3 components of cash or short-term, easily-accessible savings not
safely locked up in long-term bonds or other instruments - so-called
monetary capital - are a potential threat to monetary stability, it says.
Accordingly, the idea that the bank should welcome news that money supply is
expanding at double its intended rate would in normal circumstances be
beyond belief. But that was the case on Tuesday this week, when it announced
M3 grew in June at an annualised, seasonally-adjusted 11.3 per cent,
compared with the target range of 4-6 per cent.
The fact that the result was better than Bundesbank watchers had expected
was one reason for satisfaction. But more important, the fact that the
figures showed 'special factors' that bloated the measure were starting to
unwind, tended to support Mr Otmar Issing's fundamental belief in the
underlying virtues of M3.
But the council will today examine a wider horizon than the two percentage
point span of this year's target range. Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday the bank
was studying new factors which could influence M3 - 'new phenomena stemming
from the internationalisation of capital movements'.
In the light of widespread scepticism about the usefulness of the measure,
it may also contemplate ways of sharpening assessment of the apparently
endless flow of the distorting 'special factors'.
The effects of German unification, tax changes and currency market
interventions, for example, have conspired to keep M3 off track for the past
three years. As Mr Tietmeyer suggested, future shocks are more likely than
not as Germany becomes increasingly enmeshed in fast-moving global markets.
One aim of the central council debate will be to sharpen the efficiency of
the bank's long-range radar. Another will be to improve internal and
external communications. Failings in both departments appeared to catch the
bank napping earlier this year, when January's M3 growth figure, a
thundering 21.2 per cent, came in accompanied by a bland statement blaming
special factors. A sell-off followed in international markets already
rattled by fears of rising US inflation. It was not, as Mr Tietmeyer
acknowledged, 'a championship performance'.
But conflicting statements and apparently contradictory actions by the bank
were later to compound suspicions that it did not really know what was
happening to M3. The liquidity log-jam was refusing to break up. Meanwhile -
and contrary to its established practice of raising rates to choke off
monetary growth and potential inflation - the bank was seen to be cutting
them on the basis of a bright short-term inflationary outlook.
The mid-May cut in the discount rate was widely seen as an uncharacteristic
gamble by a notoriously conservative institution. That view has moderated
now that funds stuck in short-term deposits seem to be moving outside the
scope of M3. An emboldened Mr Issing said earlier this week it was now not
beyond the bounds of possibility for M3 to end the year at or close to
target.
Similarly encouraged, Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday the bank believed there
were, so far, no inflationary dangers associated with the latest bout of
money supply distortions.
Such comforting comments will no doubt go down well in still-jittery
markets. More comforting still would be a continuing series of declining M3
numbers for the rest of the year. Even better, and despite recent
controversy, another discount rate cut in the interim would be the strongest
possible indicator that the Bundesbank had regained its full confidence in
M3, and, crucially, in its ability to interpret and control it.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Jail looms again for released Italians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government's abrupt about-turn on the controversial issue of
preventive detention has left more than 2,000 people wondering whether they
will be obliged to return to jail.
Yesterday, the jails were still releasing people in line with the terms of
the decree approved by the cabinet last Wednesday that restricted the
judiciary's right to arrest and imprison. But this decree is now due to be
dropped by mid-August - as soon a new text is endorsed in cabinet and passed
through parliament.
Since last Thursday, when the decree came into force 2,137 people have been
freed from jails all over Italy. Of these 929 have been confined to house
arrest. According to Ansa, the national news agency, 189 had been held in
preventive detention on various charges of corruption and only 125 of these
were under house arrest.
The main public outcry has centred on the release from prison of those held
on charges linked to the nationwide investigations into corruption. But
magistrates said yesterday they were concerned that some known drug-dealers
and criminals had been able to secure release under the decree.
These included a man held on fraud charges, but alleged to be the personal
doctor of Mr Toto Riina, acknowledged head of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella
organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
'Each individual public prosecutor's office will be able to decide on an
individual basis whether or not those released will have to go back to
prison,' Ms Elena Pacciotti, chairman of the national
magistrates'association, was quoted as saying. But she insisted that this
case-by-case approach would have to wait until the new law had been
approved. The revised law will reinstate cases of corruption involving the
public administration as a serious crime; but it is not clear what other
crimes will be reclassified as serious.
Lawyers were also divided on whether time now spent under house arrest could
be included as part of the time served in prison. Magistrates can hold
people in preventive detention for a maximum of three months, unless
exceptional proof for renewing the imprisonment is accepted by a special
civil liberties tribunal.
Yesterday, the team of Milan anti-corruption magistrates, who resigned in
protest over the introduction of the decree, were working normally. However,
they indicated that they were reserving their judgment until the text of the
new law was known. Although they were the only ones to resign, their stance
was backed by colleagues in other prosecutor's offices all over Italy.
Italy's media, meanwhile, were unanimous in the view that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, had suffered a serious setback with such
headlines as 'Berlusconi surrenders and withdraws decree' and 'Isolated and
defeated'. In a withering front-page commentary. Mr Eugenio Scalfari, editor
of La Repubblica and a declared adversary of the prime minister, said: 'What
happened yesterday was the lowest point ever touched (in the Republic).'

Fighting erupted in the breakaway southern Russian region of Chechnya
yesterday after opposition forces blew up a highway bridge leading into the
capital, Interfax news agency reported. The battle pitted gunmen loyal to
President Dzhokar Dudayev against fighters loyal to opposition leader Ruslan
Labazanov. A clash between the same two groups last month claimed at least
140 lives, including those of nearly 100 non-combatants, Interfax said. Also
killed in the June fighting was Mr Labazanov's brother. According to
Interfax, the opposition leader has sworn to avenge his brother's death.
Chechnya is famed for its gun-toting clans and has a long history of blood
feuds and revenge killings. It has severed most economic ties with Russia,
and the resulting lawlessness and economic hardship have helped swell
opposition ranks. Mr Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, was elected
president of Chechnya in 1991 and immediately declared the independence of
the tiny, mountainous region in southern Russia. Since then, the opposition
has repeatedly tried to topple him.

Hungarian President Arpad Goncz has appointed new heads of state television
and radio after years of political controversy over broadcasting, his office
said yesterday. He accepted nominations made by new Socialist Prime Minister
Gyula Horn and appointed Adam Horvath president of state television and
Janos Sziranyi president of state radio, after consultations with opposition
parties broke down. The opposition parties and a group of journalists had
appealed to Mr Goncz to delay the appointments. Trade unions and
broadcasters' professional groups urged him to go ahead. Many journalist
groups in Hungary and abroad have accused the former centre-right
government, which was replaced by a socialist-liberal coalition last Friday,
of using electronic media to promote itself and attack its adversaries. The
new government has proposed that parliament pass a long-stalled media law
that would enshrine guarantees of editorial independence for broadcasters
and pave the way for partially privatising electronic media, over which the
state has a virtual monopoly.

<TEXT>
The Association of Danish Shipbuilders yesterday sent a writ against the
European Commission to the European Court in Luxembourg alleging that the
Commission exceeded the terms of an EU directive when it approved German
subsidies to shipyards in the former East Germany. The association took
action when the Danish government itself decided last Friday not to bring a
case. As the writ, challenging a Commission decision of May 11 this year,
had to be lodged by midnight last night, the association's writ was sent by
courier. The EU's 7th shipbuilding directive approved German subsidies to
the eastern shipyards for a total of DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.32bn), but only on
certain conditions: the capacity of the yards had to be reduced and
operating subsidies were not to exceed 36 per cent of 'normal turnover'. The
association claims that the capacity of the yards will in fact be expanded
very substantially and that the operating subsidies to the MTW shipyard at
Wismar, owned by the Bremer Vulkan group, will be 70 per cent of turnover.

<TEXT>
The French navy yesterday stopped a Spanish trawler in the gulf of Gascony
on France's southwest coast, and directed it to a military port, in the
latest incident in the 'tuna war' between French and Spanish fishermen.
French inspectors said they found fish in a concealed hold below the size
allowed by European Union rules. Earlier, Spanish fishermen who had captured
a French trawler surrendered the boat to marine authorities after alleging
that it carried oversized drift nets. The boat's fate had fired passions
among fishermen in both France and Spain. France has been pressing since the
start of the week for the return of the boat. Mr Edouard Balladur, French
prime minister, stepped up the diplomatic pressure by calling at yesterday's
cabinet meeting for the 'immediate return' of the vessel and stressing that
his government would press for 'compensation' for its owners.

FT  21 JUL 94 / US deplores Bosnian Serb peace stance
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Redman, the US negotiator on Bosnia, said last night that a
serious situation had developed because of the Bosnian Serbs' failure to
agree unequivocally to an internationally sponsored peace plan. Earlier Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told Mr Redman and negotiators
from Russia, Britain, France and Germany that the plan was a 'good basis for
negotiation'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said in
Moscow that further negotiations were possible because the Bosnian Serbs had
neither accepted nor rejected the latest peace proposal. Interfax news
agency quoted Mr Kozyrev as saying the Bosnian Serbs were taking a positive
attitude to the proposed map, but they also wanted to know all aspects of
the plan. 'That is their legitimate wish,' the minister said. Mr Redman,
however, said he was disappointed that the Serbs had failed to endorse a
plan which had been presented to them on a 'take it or leave it' basis.
Asked if the Serb reply, delivered by Mr Karadzic behind closed doors, had
amounted to acceptance, the US mediator replied: 'Unfortunately, no. We were
all disappointed that the answer was not what we expected.'
In Brussels, prospects for intensified use of western air power against the
Serbs in Bosnia were clouded after some Nato members said a fresh UN mandate
would be needed to establish new 'exclusion zones'. Existing UN resolutions
have been used to justify establishment of exclusion zones, where heavy
weapons are subject to air strikes, in Sarajevo and Gorazde. Some Nato
ambassadors meeting in Brussels yesterday said existing UN mandates did not
go far enough to justify more draconian use of air power or extension of the
'exclusion zone' principle.

<TEXT>
Western Germany's producer price index eased in June by 0.1 per cent from
May, but rose 0.4 per cent from June 1993, the federal statistics office
reported. Analysts had predicted a 0.2 per cent increase from May and 0.7
per cent from a year earlier. In May, producer prices rose 0.2 per cent from
April and were up 0.4 per cent from a year earlier. Western Germany's
seasonally adjusted and annualised inflation rate rose by 2.5 points both in
the second quarter and first half of this year, the Bundesbank said in its
July report. The data are based on cost of living indices, excluding the oil
tax rise at the beginning of the year. The bank said the 'moderate
development' of western German consumer prices in June was an extension of a
trend seen in recent months.
Italy's public sector deficit narrowed to a provisional L77,000bn (Pounds
32bn) in the first five months of this year from L88,665bn in the
corresponding period of 1993, the treasury announced yesterday. Tax revenue
amounted to L173,996bn in the period, public sector spending totalled
L210,447bn, while treasury operations resulted in a deficit of L36,451bn.

The Spanish government yesterday evening defused a political row with France
by handing over La Gabrielle, the hijacked tuna trawler, to the French
authorities. La Gabrielle had been held since last weekend by Spanish
fishermen after violent clashes with their French counterparts over the size
of the French trawler's tuna nets. France has since the start of the week
been pressing for the return of La Gabrielle. Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, stepped up the diplomatic pressure by calling at
yesterday's cabinet meeting for the 'immediate return' of the vessel and
stressing that his government would press for 'compensation' for its owners.
However a Spanish official, who boarded La Gabrielle on Tuesday, reported
that its tuna nets were twice the maximum size of 2.5km permitted under
European Union regulations. The Spanish authorities yesterday afternoon
persuaded the hijackers to surrender La Gabrielle to them, but stressed that
Spain would continue to lobby for the application of EU fishing regulations
even after returning the trawler to French hands.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Berlusconi faces another minefield: Plans to cut pension
benefits will put further strain on shaky cabinet unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bruised unity of Italy's right-wing coalition government faces another
tough challenge over plans to cut pension benefits in the 1995 budget.
At a cabinet meeting today Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, will have
to negotiate a delicate compromise on an issue which has caused serious
divisions. The three-minister economic team has argued that a large cut in
pension benefits will give an essential signal to the financial markets of
Italy's determination to tackle the budget deficit.
But others like Mr Clemente Mastella, labour minister, fear a sharp attack
on pensions would risk a serious confrontation with the unions.
The problem of finding the right formula on pensions, plus other cuts in
social and health spending, has been one of the main causes of the long
delay in formulating the 1995 budget and a three-year macro-economic
programme. This delay, in turn, has worried the financial markets and has
been a factor in the weakness of the lira over the past three weeks.
The prime minister's office announced yesterday a second cabinet meeting was
scheduled for tomorrow. This could mean that all the long-awaited economic
policy decisions may not be made known until then.
The economic ministers have already warned that if sufficient cuts cannot be
found in public spending, there would be little option but to raise taxes.
Last week, the government said it would be building the 1995 budget round a
benchmark deficit of L144,000bn (Pounds 59.7bn), just below 9 per cent of
gross national product.
This would mean finding an extra L40,000bn either in taxes or spending cuts.
Otherwise they said, the deficit would move inexorably upwards to
L184,000bn. Both Mr Lamberto Dini, treasury minister, and Mr Giulio
Tremonti, finance minister, promised last week that fiscal pressure would
not rise above the 1993/1994 levels. Instead, they would be relying on
spending cuts plus a reorganisation of the tax system to make it more
efficient.
They also plan to raise extra funds through a form of tax amnesty by
clearing up a backlog of 3.2m contested tax assessment cases. Another source
of revenue is expected to be a pardon on illegal property development. The
precise terms of the latter are still being disputed.
But the real source of conflict in recent days has been over pensions. The
economic team believes Italy must accelerate the pace at which the
retirement age is moved from 55 to to 60 for women and 60 to 65 for men.
This could even mean women being retired at the same age as men. The deficit
in the state pensions scheme this year is likely to be more than L80,000bn,
or half the total budget deficit.
The unions, who now have more members who are pensioners than active
workers, have warned against tampering with benefits. The only evidence of a
softening of their stance has been to propose the issue be put aside until
autumn. This view has had considerable sympathy from the labour minister,
whose portfolio embraces pensions.
Mr Berlusconi for his part may not wish to follow a path that causes a
confrontation with the unions. But the sole alternative acceptable to the
nervous financial markets would be higher taxes. His most popular election
pledge was lowering taxes and creating a million new jobs.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Hanley at centre of reshuffle: Four ministers go as Major
shapes cabinet for next general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday made the surprise promotion to the Tory party
chairmanship of Mr Jeremy Hanley the centrepiece of the most extensive
ministerial shake-up of his premiership.
The elevation of 48-year-old Mr Hanley, formerly the armed forces minister,
to the pivotal role in planning the Conservatives' general election strategy
was part of a mid-term reconstruction of the government which saw the
departure of four cabinet ministers.
The shake-up came on the eve of the certain choice by the Labour party of Mr
Tony Blair as its new leader. Mr Blair, whose election will foreshadow a
drive to shift Labour further into the political centre ground, is expected
to be joined by Mr John Prescott as deputy leader.
Mr Major's reshuffle was intended to put in place most of the team which
will fight the election, due by mid-1997. But it left scope for further
changes. Mr Douglas Hurd, who remained as foreign secretary, is widely
expected to step down within the next two years.
Overall the changes pointed to a shift to the right by Mr Major with Mr
Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite standard-bearer, promoted from the
Treasury to the post of employment secretary, and Mr Jonathan Aitken,
another right-winger, entering the cabinet as chief secretary.
Some Tory MPs were suggesting that this combination - with Mr Peter Lilley
at social security - could herald the start of another sharp squeeze on
spending on the welfare state. The number of right-wingers in the cabinet -
dubbed the 'bastards' by Mr Major - has now risen from four to five.
But the elevation of Mr Hanley, widely regarded as on the centre-left of the
party and as a protege of Mr Chris Patten, former party chairman and
governor of Hong Kong, surprised and irritated Tory Eurosceptics. Mr Hanley,
a pro-European and a liberal on social issues, will sit in the cabinet as
minister without portfolio. He will be joined at Central Office by a new
team of deputies led by Mr John Maples, a former Treasury minister and now a
senior executive at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Among the other main promotions, the
left-leaning Mr Stephen Dorrell entered the cabinet as heritage secretary
and Dr Brian Mawhinney as transport secretary. Viscount Cranborne also
joined the cabinet as leader of the House of Lords.
The principal casualty of the reshuffle was Mr John Patten who was
unceremoniously sacked as education secretary. In a terse letter to the
prime minister, Mr Patten did little to disguise his anger at the decision.
Mr Peter Brooke resigned from the heritage department while Mr John
MacGregor and Lord Wakeham had expected to be asked to leave the cabinet.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, who replaced Mr Patten, is a close political ally of
Mr Major and will be expected to improve relations between the government
and teachers in the run-up to the next general election.
Mr David Hunt, the former employment secretary and the most widely-tipped
candidate for the party chairmanship, took over as public services minister
from Mr William Waldegrave who becomes agriculture minister. But Mr Hunt was
also given the chairmanship of a number of key cabinet committees previously
run by Lord Wakeham. Downing Street said Mr Hunt would have an important
role in resolving disputes between Whitehall departments and improving the
presentation of government policy.
A more extensive shake-up lower down the ministerial ladder saw the
departure of five ministers of state and the promotion of a number of
juniors such as Mr David Davis, Mr Gerald Malone and Mr William Hague.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Greenspan indicates US rates may have to increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, signalled yesterday that
further rises in US short-term interest rates may be needed to restrain
inflation. But he did not give the impression that the Fed would tighten
monetary policy in the near future.
He said the dollar had been weaker than he expected in the past six months
and that was 'bad for the economy'. However, he indicated the Fed would not
let exchange rate considerations determine US monetary policy.
The Fed would continue to focus on domestic goals of solid economic growth
and price stability. He said progress on these fronts would 'ensure that
dollar-denominated assets remain attractive to global investors.
'It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to
head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favourable trends in the
economy,' he told the Senate banking committee. 'We are monitoring economic
and financial data carefully to assess whether additional adjustments are
appropriate.'
His remarks initially boosted the dollar, but it later fell back on the view
that, even if US rates were increased again, that might depress bond and
stock prices, reducing overseas demand for US financial assets. In New York
last night the dollar was down slightly at DM1.56385 and Y98.675.
Mr Greenspan spoke after the release of figures showing that housing starts
fell 10 per cent in June from May, a much bigger fall than expected. Data on
starts are volatile on a monthly basis, but this was seen as another sign
that higher long-term interest rates are beginning to depress demand for
housing.
While giving the Fed scope to raise rates again, Mr Greenspan made no effort
to prepare the ground for a tightening of policy, as he did at the end of
January before the Fed embarked on a series of tightening moves that lifted
short-term rates from 3 per cent to 4 1/4 per cent by late May.
He gave the impression instead that the Fed would tighten only if growth
failed to moderate or if the inflation outlook deteriorated. The Fed had not
raised rates at its policy meeting in early July as there was 'considerable
uncertainty about the pace of expansion and the pressures on prices going
forward'. It saw some recent 'hints of moderation in the growth of domestic
final demand'. But the balance of evidence indicated that 'growth remained
above its long-run trend' in the second quarter.
Mr Greenspan was delivering his twice-yearly Humphrey Hawkins monetary
testimony on Capitol Hill.
US share and bond prices were unsettled by Mr Greenspan's comments. The
30-year government bond fell almost a full point, pushing up its yield to
7.540 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 21.04 lower at
3,727.27.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Malaysia to lift trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government is poised to announce a lifting of the ban on UK
participation in government contracts, Robert Peston writes. The ban was
imposed in February partly because of Malaysian government fury with British
press coverage of the Pergau dam affair.
'We believe the embargo could be lifted tomorrow,' said a banker close to
the Malaysian government. UK businessmen with Malaysian interests are
convinced the embargo will be removed by the end of July. The Malaysian
government yesterday refused to comment.

Cholera has already claimed its first victims among the million Rwandan
refugees crowded into the Zairean town of Goma, western doctors believe.
Jacques de Milliano, head of medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, said
his medical teams had reported around 120 cases of suspected cholera. If
tests confirm the presence of the disease, between 5,000 and 10,000 of the
refugees are expected to die of it. Editorial Comment, Page 21

FT  21 JUL 94 / MPs condemn Younger's conduct over Pergau aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Younger, former defence secretary, was yesterday condemned by a
prominent committee of MPs for 'reprehensible' and 'wholly inappropriate'
conduct when making an offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam in the late
1980s.
In one of the toughest official criticisms of government policy in recent
times, the all-party Commons foreign affairs committee accused ministers of
a 'serious failure' in the co-ordination of policy over the Pergau dam in
the late 1980s.
The report on Britain's offer of Pounds 234m of aid for Pergau, which has
taken six months to complete, did not entirely spare Lady Thatcher, the
former prime minister, who refused to give evidence to the committee earlier
this year.
It says that ministerial replies - several of which were made by the former
prime minister - were 'literally true, though less open and less informative
than the House has a right to expect'.
In one instance, a written parliamentary answer from Lady Thatcher's office
was judged as 'not fully answering the questions' raised by MPs on funding
for the dam.
There was strong criticism, too, of the tactics used by a consortium of
companies - including Balfour Beatty and General Electric Company - when
they tried to win a contract for the dam in March 1989. The report says the
consortium put pressure on Lady Thatcher to make a firm offer to the
Malaysians to build the dam 'on the basis of information which was
incomplete'. Within days, the government found that the consortium's costs
had jumped, requiring substantial additional expenditure for the Overseas
Development Administration's budget.
At the heart of the committee's inquiry was the issue of whether the British
government had offered aid on condition that Malaysia bought Pounds 1.5bn of
British defence equipment. Such a link would be contrary to British
government guidelines.
The committee agreed that a protocol signed by Lord Younger linking the two
deals 'was the only instance of which we are aware where the policy
proscribing conditional linkage . . . has been breached'.
The MPs judged it 'reprehensible' that the Ministry of Defence had conducted
negotiations on the protocol which were within the remit of the Foreign
Office without informing Lord Howe, then foreign secretary.
It was 'very regrettable' Lord Younger did not feel it 'appropriate to
consult, even to inform, London before concluding the agreement with
Malaysia'.
According to the MPs, Lady Thatcher and Lord Howe successfully disentangled
the link between aid and the arms deal after Lord Younger's return.
But, surprisingly, the committee did agree that a mathematical formula
linking the size of the two deals was an enduring feature of all the
contracts signed between the two governments between 1988 and 1991.
The committee welcomed reforms made to Aid and Trade Provision since the
Pergau episode, but said difficulties remained.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Brussels set to back state aid for ailing Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is likely to win European Commission approval next
week to grant Air France, the lossmaking national carrier, a capital
injection of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.36bn) in return for relatively mild
concessions.
The state aid package, expected to be approved by the Commission on
Wednesday, will provide a welcome boost to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's
unpopular government.
However, it is expected to provoke protests and legal action from the UK
government and non-subsidised European Union airlines such as British
Airways and the Dutch carrier KLM.
A Brussels decision to allow the aid to be paid will be seen as a test case
in EU efforts to liberalise the air transport market, and the politically
sensitive issue of state aid.
The conditions attached to the rescue package were discussed yesterday ahead
of next Wednesday's vote at which it needs the support of nine of the 17
commissioners. The political balance appears to be in its favour.
In spite of a softer line recently adopted by the UK towards Europe, the
case is likely to set Mr John Major's government on another collision course
with Brussels. It has indicated it will take the commission to the European
Court of Justice if the aid is approved. 'We do not believe that the aid is
compatible withthe Treaty of Rome,' the UK Department of Transport said
yesterday. 'If it is authorised it will distort competition within the
European Union.'
But the commission is likely to argue that the conditions are tough enough
to justify the so-called 'one-time last-time' capital injection to the
ailing airline. The conditions include:
All of the aid must go only to Air France. Air Inter, a subsidiary of Air
France must become a holding company, at arm's length from the main
operation.
The restructuring of the company should be followed by privatisation. Air
France must sell the hotel chain Meridien, a move which is already on the
cards.
BA is likely to protest that while the conditions stipulate that Air France
must not increase the size of its fleet, there is nothing to prevent the
carrier leasing aircraft from other airlines. Another main grievance is that
Air France has not divested itself of other assets such as property and
stakes in other airlines as much as it could.
Air France said it expects the first tranche of FFr10bn as soon as Brussels
gives the go-ahead.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers were hit as Smith New Court featured the
tabloid newspaper group as its key sell in a hefty review of the sector's
potential in the harsh light of the newspaper price war. The shares fell a
net 5 1/2 to 138 1/2 p with 4.1m traded.
The media team reduced its 1995 profits forecast for Mirror by Pounds 13.5m
to Pounds 77.5m. Analyst Mr David Forster commented: 'Irrespective of
whether there are further cover price cuts, the outlook for the profits of
the national newspapers has changed.' The house also cut forecasts for
Telegraph by Pounds 5m to Pounds 44m, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust by Pounds
8m to Pounds 92m and United Newspapers by Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 151m.
Telegraph and Daily Mail were steady at 367p and 1035p and United, which
remains on Smith's buy list, added 4 at 537p.
Shell Transport was a healthy market, the shares boosted 6 1/2 to 722p on
turnover of 4.1m by a recommendation from Nomura, the Japanese-owned
investment house. The house oils team said: 'The market is seriously
underestimating the scale of recovery in profits which will take place over
the next five years.'
Nomura has increased its 1995 profits forecast by Pounds 325m to Pounds
4.61bn and its 1996 fig-ure by Pounds 420m to Pounds 5.32bn.
Chemicals leader ICI firmed a penny to 811p as the impact of an upgrade and
change of stance by one leading investment bank filtered through into the
market. BZW raised its 1995 profits forecast by Pounds 80m to Pounds 700m
and put the stock back on its buy list. Courtaulds bounced 7 to 516p on
enthusiasm for the stock following Tuesday's annual meeting.
Profit-taking ahead of figures due today saw Wellcome tumble 16 to 615p.
One of the food industry's oldest bid rumours was rehashed yesterday as
United Biscuits raced forward under the seemingly watchful eye of Cadbury
Schweppes. The latter was said to be considering dumping its 25 per cent
stake in US group Dr Pepper, having been denied a board seat and facing a
bitter poison pill should it decide to opt for a full bid, and instead
consider a UK alternative. UB shares rose 10 to 316p, while Cadbury slipped
3 1/2 to 444p.
Optimism that J. Sainsbury will enter the bidding for William Low saw the
latter's shares move forward 5 to 261p. Kwik Save was again in the frame in
the guise of its largest shareholder Dairy Farm, and climbed 20 to 557p.
Sainsbury eased 2 to 398p and Tesco a half-penny to 238p. Argyll's bullish
trading statement on Tuesday saw the shares advance 8 to 259p.
Industrial conglomerate BTR was busy as Tuesday's cautious note from UBS
continued to exact a toll. The shares shed 2 to 368p with volume, at 8.9m,
once again heavy.
Shipbuilder VSEL raced 34 ahead to 908p at the prospect of diminished
competition with the near certain closure of rival Swan Hunter. One analyst
said: 'With Swan Hunter out of the picture, VSEL is left with a near
monopoly in the surface war ships market.' There was some talk in the market
that the company may announce defence orders at today's annual meeting.
Defence electronics group GEC eased a fraction to 272 1/2 p, after it
launched a Pounds 100m 8 per cent bond, maturing in five years. The issue is
being lead managed by Goldman Sachs.
Favourable comment on Tuesday's announcement from British Aerospace of the
sale of its Space Systems unit to Matra Marconi helped the shares gain 4 at
494p. Shares in engineering group Bullough were in demand ahead of next
week's interim figures and put on 3 at 141p.
Paper and packaging group David S. Smith added 22 at 550p following a well
received set of figures that saw full-year profits rise Pounds 15.1m to
Pounds 42.2m, prompting a rash of upgrades.
Vodafone advanced 9 to 553p, with Hoare Govett positive following the annual
meeting.
US debt agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded part of Forte's debt portfolio.
The shares lost 5 1/2 at 221p.
British Airways rose 5 to 434p in strong trade of 7.6m following a positive
trading statement from USAir, in which it holds a stake.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jitters in the DIY sector - following news earlier this week that US
giant Home Depot is poised to enter the UK market - continued unabated, with
B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher bearing the brunt of investor concern. The company was
yesterday said to be talking up its own trading strategy to institutional
investors and analysts in advance of an imminent announcement over the US
group's European expansion plans.
However, sector specialists said that they did not expect Home Depot's
announcement to contain much detail above their perceived objectives. But
underpinning analysts' concerns over the already overcrowded UK DIY market
is Home Depot's hiring of a former B&amp;Q executive and the possibility of
further defections. Kingfisher shares tumbled 13 to 502p on 2.7m traded.
There were also renewed suggestions of Darty shareholders exercising share
options and making ready to exit Kingfisher in large numbers. Elsewhere,
Texas parent Ladbroke slipped a penny to 167p, while Do It All owners Boots
retreated 3 1/2 to 535 1/2 p and WH Smith 5 to 480p.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rate war fears hit banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street bank shares fell sharply in late trade as disappointment over
the latest bank lending figures was compounded by reports of a customer
lending rate cut by Midland Bank which prompted fears of a price war in the
sector.
Bank and building society lending grew by Pounds 2.9bn in May, against
forecasts of a Pounds 1.3bn increase, but the bias was towards credit card
and mortgage loans, and corporate lending was weak. Then Midland, the high
street arm of HSBC, cut its personal lending rate by 2 percentage points.
Prices in the sector were immediately chopped back as speculation ran
through the City that Credit Lyonnais Laing was poised to respond with a
significant downgrading of banks.
But Laing was phlegmatic, saying it had recommended an underweight stance
since the start of the year and was unlikely to change its views ahead of
Lloyds Bank's interim results on July 29. HSBC, buoyed by a firm Hong Kong
market, lost only 3 at 735p, but Barclays slid 8 to 546p, Lloyds 14 to 556p
and National Westminster 16 to 458p.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed at the lowest level of the day as renewed fears
of higher US interest rates to combat inflation caused jitters in the London
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Traders in the derivatives were unnerved during the afternoon by comments
from Mr Greenspan suggesting that the recent slide in the US dollar could
raise inflation.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 had opened at 3,100, just ahead of
cash, and traded sideways for the next few hours, with the mid-morning
release of economic data on the UK money supply and retail sales making no
impact on trading.
The contract drifted lower just ahead of lunchtime on the back of a
weakening gilts sector, before Mr Greenspan's testimony brought about
concerted selling in the last hour, as dealers also reacted to a poor
opening on Wall Street.
September closed at 3,076, down 22 from its previous finish and at a 7-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume
improved to 14,322 lots.
There was also better turnover in the traded options sector. Closing volume
was 27,216 contracts, with 10,312 dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. BT led the
league table among the stock options, with a trade in the August 420 puts
being the biggest contributor to the day's total of 1,702.

FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate concerns return to
unsettle shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early challenge to the Footsie 3,100 mark ran into a setback in the
London market yesterday following a fresh warning on US interest rates from
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. The stock market had
already been unsettled by the disclosure that the UK chancellor of the
exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England had agreed last month that
domestic interest rates would be raised if inflation threatens. However,
early losses had been recovered and the downturn was resumed only as reports
of Mr Greenspan's testimony to Congress appeared on the trading screens.
The opening minutes of official trading saw the Footsie touch 3,099.6 before
turning back as traders reacted to publication of the minutes of the meeting
in June between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie
George, Governor of the Bank of England.
But by the end of the session, the FT-SE 100 Index had fallen to a day's low
of 3,077.2, a net loss of 14.1 points. Once again, the setback was
spearheaded by falls in stock index futures. However, traders believed that
an increase in trading volume in equities did not indicate increased selling
pressure and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which is less affected by the futures
markets, remained firm, closing 12.6 up at 3,587.
In the first half of the session, the stock market made a fairly neutral
response to the latest data on the domestic economy. A rise of 0.2 per cent
in June retail sales for an annualised gain of 3.3 per cent and M4 bank
lending of Pounds 2.9bn, while at the high end of expectations, were
overshadowed by caution ahead of Mr Greenspan's speech.
Confidence in London that the recent steadier trend in the dollar and bond
markets might bring a favourable review from Mr Greenspan inspired a further
move towards Footsie 3,100 in the early afternoon.
The market, however, went speedily into reverse as the speech from the Fed
chairman was followed by falls in bond prices and in other European equity
markets. The downturn was emphasised by a decline of 22 points on the Dow
Average in UK trading hours.
Trading volume rose sharply, but at the end of the session, the day's Seaq
total of 679.7m shares still compared with 691.4m in the previous session.
Retail business was worth Pounds 1.57bn on Tuesday, well up to the best
daily averages of the past twelve months.
Fund management buyers from continental Europe, who have been providing the
driving force behind the recovery in the London stock market, backed away in
the second half of the session when their own domestic markets reacted
negatively to the latest developments.
Several leading securities houses said their trading books were fairly
evenly spread between buyers and sellers. The renewed uncertainty over US
rates puts increased emphasis on this morning's meeting of the Bundesbank
policy council, and revives the question of whether European markets and
economies have decoupled from the US.
The setback took toll of share prices across the financial and retail
sectors, which have been moving ahead confidently over the past week. Store
shares, in particular, proved themselves more fearful of higher interest
rates than encouraged by retail sales growth in June reported earlier in the
day.
The blue chip dollar-earning stocks moved narrowly as these sectors waited
to see how the US currency would settle down in response to the comments
from Mr Greenspan. But turnover in these market leaders was not heavy.
London market strategists said that much will depend on the reaction from
bond markets across Europe, and on the actions and comments of the
Bundesbank.

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow turns lower in response
to Greenspan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks suffered a setback yesterday when the chairman of the Federal
Reserve said he could not rule out an early move to tighter money, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.04 lower at 3,727.27 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.26 at 451.60. NYSE volume was a moderate 268m
shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped a scant
0.90 to 433.00, but the Nasdaq composite buckled 6.55 to 712.77 under the
weight of depressed technology issues.
For at least a week the market had anticipated yesterday's congressional
testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chief. When he finally delivered his
twice-annual Humphrey-Hawkins briefing half an hour after trading began, the
tone and substance of his remarks were a surprise.
He said the central bank was still uncertain whether credit conditions were
sufficiently tight to snuff out inflationary pressures in the economy. He
added that a further lifting of interest rates was still 'an open question'.
With the prospect of a fresh period of uncertainty over monetary policy, the
bond market went into decline. The price of the benchmark 30-year government
issue was down nearly a point, even though the Commerce Department released
data suggesting a cooling of the housing sector.
Share prices followed bonds to sharply lower levels, managed to recover
somewhat in the late morning but fell again in the afternoon. The overall
weakness was complicated by the flood of corporate results which continued
to pour into Wall Street. In general, investors were unimpressed by good
performances and unforgiving to underachievers.
Sears Roebuck, for one, handily beat the consensus forecast by posting net
income of Dollars 1.27 a share in the second quarter, but its share price
declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46. Compaq Computer failed to please even
though its quarterly net income was a little better than forecast. The stock
shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 on heavy volume of 7.9m amid concern
over the company's high inventory levels.
Similarly, McDonnell Douglas, the defence contractor, disappointed investors
even though it matched expectations. Its share price was marked down Dollars
4 1/8 to Dollars 114 3/8 .
Bearishness claimed Pfizer as a victim, too. The pharmaceuticals house
warned that its full-year results could fall short of early estimates. In
response, the stock dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 60 1/8 . International Game
Technology was a big loser after posting net income of 30 cents a share, an
unpleasant surprise to most analysts. The issue gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 19 7/8 .
Cadence Design Systems, a computer software concern, plunged 23 per cent, or
Dollars 4 1/8 , to Dollars 13 1/4 amid concern about its growth prospects.
On the Nasdaq, a downturn in technology shares triggered earlier in the week
showed no signs of abating. Shares in Microsoft, which released its results
at the session's close, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 . Canada
Toronto finished lower following moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite
index retreated 18.4 to 4,181.7 and declines led advances by 403 to 340
after volume of 56.3m shares.
Banking stocks recorded the day's biggest loss, the index falling 1.73 per
cent.
Argentina
Share prices on the Buenos Aires stock exchange fell yesterday as several
bomb scares, coming two days after an explosion levelled a Jewish community
centre, unnerved local investors, reports AP-DJ.
'There was a delayed reaction' to Monday's blast, said one Buenos Aires
trader. He added that reports of bomb scares at several sites around Buenos
Aires prompted the sort of sell-off that had been expected earlier in the
week.
The blast early on Monday at a building housing two Jewish organisations
killed at least 33 people and injured 157. More than 70 others were reported
missing.
Renewed concern that the US Federal Reserve will lift interest rates also
weighed down local equities.
The broad General index closed 369.40, or 1.9 per cent, off at 18,614.53,
while the Merval index of leading shares dropped 17.69, or 3.3 per cent, to
517.49. Falls outnumbered rises by 37 to 2.
Brazil
Stocks in Sao Paulo climbed sharply as a new opinion poll favoured Senator
Fernando Henrique Cardoso for the October 3 presidential race and the
government resolved a pay dispute with public employees and the military.
The Bovespa index ended 1,640, or 4.2 per cent, up at 40,386.

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei little changed
despite yen's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Selling by corporate investors eroded morning gains, and the Nikkei index
closed almost flat in spite of the yen's decline against the dollar, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was finally a slight 5.60 up at 20,780.76 after
setting a day's high of 20,872.37 in the morning and a low of 20,736.95 in
the afternoon.
Arbitrage buying led by strength in the futures market and purchases by
public funds supported shares in early trading, but most investors failed to
participate and the index moved in a narrow range after receding on
profit-taking.
Volume was 310m shares, against 260m. Domestic financial institutions were
buying in the morning for public pension funds, while overseas investors
were largely inactive.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.19 at 1,665.49 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 0.13 at 302.22. Rising issues narrowly outscored declines
by 484 to 473, with 227 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
ended 2.12 firmer at 1,354.59.
Some investors selected smaller shares backed by individual news, or those
seen as laggards. The second section climbed 12.17 to 2,531.55 in volume of
21m shares, a three-week high. Many brokers do not expect equity prices to
move over the summer months. 'There will not be any significant earnings
news now until September, or until Toyota's results are announced in
August,' reported James Capel in Tokyo.
Nihon Nosan Kogyo, the agro-feed maker, advanced Y17 to Y549 on reports that
the company had developed a product which could lower blood sugar levels.
Telecommunication linked stocks were higher on hopes of profits from the
next-generation portable telephone. DDI, the long distance telecom operator,
rose Y110,000 to Y9.6m on the second section. The company was also supported
by hopes of increased buying following its 10-for-one stock split on August
2.
Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, moved ahead Y70 to Y7,500, while Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone added Y4,000 at Y854,000.
Fuji Electric appreciated Y10 to Y598 on buying by foreign brokers, while
Kumagai Gumi, the contractor, firmed a marginal Y1 to Y527.
Large-capital issues were lower on profit-taking, with Nippon Steel, the
day's most active stock, easing Y1 to Y341 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
dipping Y8 to Y796.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged forward 1.97 to 23,205.81 in volume of 32.3m
shares.
Roundup
Foreign demand helped some Pacific Rim markets ahead.
HONG KONG finished modestly higher after profit-taking had pulled the market
back from its best level of the day. The Hang Seng index gained a net 43.81
at 9,188.82, having earlier touched 9,322.72.
Further foreign institutional demand was reported for blue chips, but local
funds and retail investors continued to take profits and unwind long
positions.
SYDNEY rebounded from lows to finish fractionally ahead as investors awaited
Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony before the US Congress.
Volatile futures and lacklustre performances in some other markets dragged
the All Ordinaries index to an intraday low of 2,060.7, but it later
recovered to end 1.3 firmer at 2,078.6 in cautious trade.
WELLINGTON was spurred 1.3 per cent ahead in high volume which indicated
active investment from overseas. The NZSE-40 Capital index climbed 27.23 to
2,054.94 in NZDollars 75.5m turnover.
SINGAPORE regained some momentum, after two slack days, on the back of
renewed orders for blue chips by institutional funds in Hong Kong, the US
and Britain. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 26.45 to 2,231.37.
KUALA LUMPUR saw foreign demand for blue chips which took the composite
index up 10.52 to 1,009.72. Gains were led by Genting, which firmed MDollars
1 to MDollars 33 ahead of the ex-date for its one-for-two bonus issue on
July 28.
BANGKOK rose in active trade, mainly on expectations of healthy first-half
results but also on optimism over dollar stability and the possible
extension of trading hours from November. The SET index put on 14.65 at
1,363.59 in active turnover of Bt13.8bn.
TAIPEI ended lower on late, heavy profit-taking as investors turned cautious
ahead of a central bank board meeting today which raised worries about
tighter monetary policy.
The weighted index lost 52.09 at 6,474.30, off a 6,590.67 day's high.
Turnover declined to TDollars 105.95bn from TDollars 119.02bn.
MANILA finished easier after profit-taking in blue chips ended a four-day
rally. The composite index shed 5.60 points to 2,663.46, off the day's low
of 2,647. Heavy foreign buying in SM Prime Holdings broke the fall at
midsession and the retail group jumped 1.7 per cent to 6 pesos.
SEOUL declined for the sixth session in a row as a lack of institutional
activity took its toll. The composite index lost 2.38 at 936.67.

South African shares found late support to lift industrials off their lows,
but most investors remained wary about short term prospects, Reuter reports.
The overall index added 31 at 5,579 as it found support from De Beers and
Anglos. The industrial index finished 2 firmer at 6,359 and the gold shares
index retrieved 18 at 2,113 following Tuesday's 61-point fall.
De Beers advanced R1.75 to R109.75 and Anglos R6 to R239 amid steady demand.
Minorco slipped 50 cents to R106.50 and Richemont managed a R1 gain to R38.
SAB climbed off a mid-afternoon low to close a net 25 cents down at R85.75
and Barlows firmed 25 cents to R31.75. Iscor continued to tread water at R4
after recent hefty gains, and Sasol improved 25 cents to R27.50.

FT  21 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses ease after Fed chief's
comments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The testimony given by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, had a negative impact on the afternoon performance of continental
European markets.
FRANKFURT was a case in point. After a modest rise in the Dax index of 9.82
to 2,138.65, post-bourse trading brought the level down to 2,120.97.
Attention was also being concentrated on today's meeting of the Bundesbank -
the last before a four-week summer recess. James Capel thought that a cut
was unlikely, in spite of the encouraging M3 data which was released earlier
in the week.
This view was supported by UBS which, in a comment put out before the M3
data was available, remarked that while further headline cuts were imminent,
this week was probably too early, and suggested instead that it expected the
discount rate to be down to 4 per cent by September. James Capel went one
step further - the discount, it thought, would be down to 3.75 per cent by
the first quarter of 1995.
The chemicals sector again made forward strides: BASF rose DM4.70 to
DM308.50 and Bayer by DM2.50 to DM356.
ZURICH was spurred ahead by Nestle's better than expected half-year sales,
and the SMI index finished 40.7, or 1.6 per cent, higher at 2,562.3 after
some late weakness in the dollar had pulled the market back from its best
levels.
Nestle moved ahead SFr41 to SFr1,144 in response to news of its flat
first-half sales which came after the market closed on Tuesday: some
analysts had been expecting a 1 to 2 per cent fall.
Roche certificates, which weighed on the market last week, continued to
regain ground, adding SFr110 at SFr5,410. Elsewhere in the sector, Ciba
bearers rose SFr21 to SFr760 and Sandoz bearers put on SFr20 at SFr688.
Ascom, the telecommunications concern, appreciated SFr60 to SFr1,650,
although traders commented that the rise was exaggerated by relatively thin
volume.
PARIS was slightly easier, although it recovered from the lows of the
session. The CAC-40 index was 8.61 softer at 2,043.72 after touching
2,027.26. Turnover was FFr4.3bn.
A substantial rise, nearly 11 per cent, was noted in Moulinex, the consumer
electricals group, following a number of brokers' recommendations, and on
hopes of an earnings recovery next year.
In contrast, Thomson CSF dipped FFr6.10 to FFr162.50 as it suffered a
downgrade from one US house.
AMSTERDAM attained the 400 level for a brief moment, before sliding back
later, and the AEX index finished the session down 1.82 at 397.80.
While the overall tone was weaker, some good gains were evident. Philips,
for example, firmed Fl 1.00 to Fl 76.70, with investors noting that a Taiwan
group in which it has a 40 per cent stake had announced that it was to float
stock.
Among other good gainers, Unilever went Fl 2.00 ahead to Fl 187.20 and Royal
Dutch Fl 1.90 up to Fl 195.50.
MADRID dipped late in the day as profit-takers used Mr Greenspan's comments
to cash in on nine days of rising prices in the market. The General index
slipped 1.52 to 304.40 in volume of about Pta 32bn.
Asturiana del Zinc fell Pta 20 to Pta 1,310 after Banesto placed 2.98m
shares, 9.67 per cent of the share capital, at Pta 1,350.
Telefonica slid Pta 55, or 3 per cent, to Pta 1,790. Merrill Lynch has
reduced its profits estimates for this year and 1995 in response to
proposals for rebalancing tarriffs, which are expected to be confirmed by
parliament tomorrow.
MILAN continued its recovery as the political clouds cleared, and the Comit
index advanced 11.67, or 1.7 per cent, to 716.50.
Telecommunications issues continued to draw attention. Sip rose L90 to
L4,495 and Stet was L10 higher at L5,476. Robert Fleming Securities, which
maintains a positive view of the stocks, commented that both were 10 to 15
per cent undervalued and added that the forthcoming Telecom Italia could
look forward to rapid profits growth on a moderate growth in sales.
Among industrials, Fiat rose L126 to L6,810 and Olivetti was L42 higher at
L2,516.
Banking stocks remained at the centre of attention in the wake of BCI's
announcement on Tuesday that it planned to launch a L2,360bn cash call on
August 18, which prompted expectations that Credito Italiano would follow
suit.
BCI rose L85 to L4,728 and Credito put on L47 at L2,269.
WARSAW tumbled 9.1 per cent, giving up all the sharp gains of the previous
two sessions, as profits were taken, although fresh buying interest during
the order matching session was seen to signal a prompt rebound.
The Wig index dropped 1,056.6 to 10,608.5.

Greece remains a problem, in spite of a below average decline in dollar
terms over the year to date. James Capel, commenting on the market in its
latest quarterly survey, notes that with modest economic growth projected
for 1994 and 1995, and high real interest rates, the prospects for corporate
earnings, excluding the banking sector, 'do not augur well'.
The broker is forecasting earnings per share growth of 9.5 per cent for
1994, rising to 11 per cent in the year following, 'but much will depend
upon the government's ability to tackle basic economic issues which, quite
apparently, it is not doing at the moment'. For these reasons they
recommended a 'generally underweight position' in Greece, while highlighting
the construction sector as having the ability to go against the trend.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Greenspan scares dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hawkish comments about inflation from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, yesterday put the skids under the dollar's recent revival, writes
Philip Gawith.
In the course of his Humphrey Hawkins testimony to Congress, Mr Greenspan
struck a more cautious note than anticipated. This led to a sell-off in the
US bond market, and this spilled over into dollar weakness.
After touching a high in Europe of DM1.5781 the US currency finished in
London at DM1.5662. Against the yen it slipped back from a high of Y99.55 to
close at Y98.76. This compared to lows last week of around DM1.52 and Y97.
The Fed chairman's later comments, that a weak dollar was bad for the
economy, prompted a recovery during US trading. But by the close of the New
York session it had further declined to DM1.5638 and Y98.685.
In the UK, the pound paid little attention to the cabinet reshuffle, or to
retail sales and money supply figures. The sterling index finished at 79.3
from 79.5.
The D-Mark showed little change ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting,
the last before the four-week summer recess. The balance of opinion in the
market is against a cut in the discount rate. Yesterday the Bank allowed the
repo rate to fall by three basis points to 4.88 per cent.
The lira managed to firm above the L1,000 level against the D-Mark, closing
at L996.3 from L1,001.
The market was surprised by Mr Greenspan's caution when he noted that it was
an 'open question' whether the Fed had done enough to head off inflation.
This was taken to mean that the Fed might not yet have reached the end of
the monetary tightening phase, and the dollar was initially bought on this
news. When bond prices started to fall, however, the dollar soon followed
suit, ending the day lower.
The other feature of the Fed chairman's testimony was his comment that the
'substantial' drop in the dollar was likely to fuel inflation, if not
reversed. This is the closest Mr Greenspan has come in recent months to
acknowledging that the weakness of the dollar might be a concern. He
appeared to be saying that the Fed would act to stop the currency falling
too low.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, commented: 'This is not the
right time to sell the dollar on anything more than a one to two-month
horizon. Mr Greenspan has identified the dollar as a major factor in Fed
thinking.'
He said the dollar was probably now close to bottoming against the D-Mark,
but was vulnerable to falling further against the yen. If the month-end
deadline for progress in trade talks with Japan is not met, there is a
possibility that the US might resort to sanctions.
These views were echoed by Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ
International in London. He added that the pattern of the dollar following
the bond market, though understandable in the short term, would not
necessarily persist. 'The danger to the dollar from a Fed tightening in
terms of it upsetting the bond market is fairly small.'
The December Eurodollar future traded at 94.24, sugg-esting that the market
is pricing three-month money at 5.76 per cent by the end of the year,
compared to 4.68 per cent currently.
The D-Mark had a steady day ahead of the council meeting. The repo rate cut
was in line with market expectations. Analysts are divided about what to
expect today, though only three out of 20 sampled by Reuters predicted that
the discount rate would be cut from its current 4 1/2 per cent level.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets,
described the Bundesbank's dilemma: 'At only a couple of basis points off
the repo a week, the Bundesbank will finish its recess (August 18) at a
spread of 30 basis points to the discount rate - very close to its 25
basis-point 'margin of tolerance', and hence boxed into a corner by rate cut
speculation.'
She added: 'A pre-emptive discount rate cut, with no acceleration in the
pace of repo rate cuts, would make money management a lot easier.'
The problem with this theory is that when faced with a similar choice last
December, the Bundesbank chose to fix the repo rate for a few months.
Volumes in the short sterling market were low, but the December contract
lost ground to end at 93.92 from 93.97. Analysts said the market was in a
profit-taking mode following the sharp rise last week.
The market appeared to be slightly unnerved by the larger than expected M4
money supply growth, and later by the bearish implications of Mr Greenspan's
comments for interest rate policy. Euromarks were also weaker, with the
December contract closing at 95.12 from 95.17.
The Bank of England said it will today provide UK money markets with Pounds
2.454bn by way of repo and secured loan fac-ilities. In its daily operations
it provided the market with Pounds 639m assistance afer declaring a Pounds
650m shortage.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Monsanto seeks to allay
European fears about its milk yield-boosting hormone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monsanto, manufacturer of the milk-boosting dairy hormone BST, yesterday
sought to counter fears about its use, saying it had not cut milk
consumption and was reaping dividends for farmers.
BST, or bovine somatotrophin, is a manufactured version of a hormone that
occurs naturally in cows. Monsanto, which is reported to have spent about
Dollars 500m developing BST, began selling it in the US in February after
receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to consider in December whether
to lift a moratorium on its use in Europe. The European Commission, while
accepting BST is safe for humans, argues that artificially boosting milk
supplies runs counter to EU policy of cutting production.
In Britain, the government's adviser on animal welfare, the Farm Animal
Welfare Council, last week recommended that the hormone should not be
licensed until data were available on a wide range of issues relating to the
welfare of cows.
It said dairy cows treated with BST to induce a high yield were more prone
to mastitis, although it was not known whether the cause was BST or the milk
yield itself.
Ms Lisa Watson, Monsanto's health and consumer affairs manager, said a study
to be published in the US Journal of Dairy Science concludes that 'BST
doesn't affect the relationship between milk yield and the risk of
mastitis.'
During a visit to the UK to promote the hormone, she agreed there was a link
between high milk yield and mastitis but said other factors such as wet
weather and the stage of a cow's lactation had a 'five to 10 times greater
impact on whether a cow gets mastitis.'
Ms Watson also pointed to figures from the US Department of Agriculture
showing consumption of liquid milk was unchanged between February and April
compared with the same period last year.
This was despite the fact that 70 per cent of consumers were aware of BST,
up from around 28 per cent last November. However, only a tiny proportion of
milk is labelled as being produced without BST, so most consumers are
unlikely to have a choice about whether to buy BST-produced milk.
Conscious of milk quotas in Europe, Monsanto was anxious to sell the hormone
as 'a management tool' to help farmers meet their quotas despite output
problems caused by weather or illness, rather than as a way of increasing
milk supplies.
Monsanto's BST customers control about 20 per cent of milk production in the
US, the company says. Contrary to fears that BST could serve large,
efficient farmers to the detriment of smaller ones, the company says more
than half its customers are farmers with 100 or fewer cows.
Mr Jerry Steiner, marketing director, said farmers were getting a return of
Dollars 2 for every Dollars 1 they invested in BST, although some of that
would be absorbed by increased feed costs. 'We have a better than 90 per
cent satisfaction and repurchase rating from our customers,' he said.
Monsanto expects cows injected with BST to produce 10-15 per cent more milk
during their 300-day lactation, although the hormone is used only when
lactation is starting to decline.
The USDA has forecast that about 40 per cent of cows in the US would be
treated with BST by 2000. 'US farmers have a significant advantage in
reducing the cost of producing milk,' said Mr Steiner. 'Farmers in the UK
should have the opportunity for that same advantage.'

FT  21 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper climbs to two-year peak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US investment fund buying came out of the blue to propel copper's price to a
two-year peak on the London Metal Exchange yesterday.
There was no particular reason for the sudden renewed interest of the funds.
Some dealers suggested that, having 'played' in the palladium market in
recent days, the funds decided to turn their attention to another metal
likely to benefit from increased international economic activity.
The weight of buying forced those who had sold short in the hope of being
able to buy back later at a lower price to run for cover. Also 'buy' signals
were triggered on the computers used for trading by some speculative funds.
Copper for delivery in three months reached Dollars 2,557 a tonne, its
highest since July 1992, on the LME early yesterday after the funds first
prompted a rise on the New York Commodity Exchange late on Tuesday.
Profit-taking later saw it ease back to close at Dollars 2,538.50 a tonne,
up Dollars 65.
Many analysts were expecting the copper market to consolidate and for there
to be some profit-taking during the mid-year months when demand slows.
However, the London-based consultancy, Bloomsbury Mineral Economics in its
latest Copper Briefing Service, pointed out that, when the copper market
rose strongly in 1987-88, prices increased steadily each month for more than
one year, shrugging off the usual seasonal influences. 'It will be a crucial
test of the strength of the present market to see whether or not copper
prices simply carry on rising through the northern hemisphere vacation
shut-downs,' it said.
Nevertheless, the market faced a number of bearish factors in the second
half, according to BME. Exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States
might increase from 15,000 to 25,000 tonnes a month; some mines on standby
could reopen, encouraged by recent high prices; and the first of the new
generation of big green field mining projects in Chile and Canada could come
on stream. This might cause the copper price to pause in its rise for some
time but BME remained confident that an underlying supply deficit would
cause prices to strengthen further in 1995.
Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, said it would spend BFr2.8bn
(Pounds 56m) on a new 200,000-tonnes-a-year copper smelter at Olen, northern
Belgium, to replace an existing refinery, Reuter reports from Brussels.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Black gold draws investors to a
Balkan backwater - As Albania rejoins the international community after 70
years of isolation Anthony Robinson and Robert Corzine assess the state of
its oil sector, once thought more promising than Saudi Arabia's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil fields are usually a symbol of national wealth and prestige. But in
Albania, the Balkan state which for 50 years was one of the most isolated
countries in the world, their shabby state symbolises decades of
under-investment and near total disregard for the environment.
Large tracts of central-coastal Albania above the main onshore oil reserves
are covered with spindly rigs and ever-so-slowly nodding donkeys sucking out
thick bituminous oil. The crude then runs in rusting and often exposed pipes
or shallow trenches to leaking storage tanks.
The foul stench of crude is all-pervasive. Black pools of oil lie on the
surface around the rigs and the rivers run with tell-tale rainbow coloured
oil slicks.
Hundreds of wells are simply abandoned, with rusting metal, broken pipes and
chunks of machinery littering the ground around them. The cost of clearing
up over 70 years of environmental damage to acceptable western standards
will be enormous; and it is unlikely to be shouldered by any future western
partner.
On the other hand western oilmen believe that spectacular productivity gains
could be achievable from the introduction of modern production techniques.
The Albanian oil industry may never live up to its initial promise in the
1920s, when a director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the predecessor of
British Petroleum, recommended that the company end its exploration efforts
in Saudi Arabia in favour of Albania. But a successful rehabilitation and
exploration programme over the next few years could make it a net oil
exporter.
Premier Consolidated Oil Fields, a UK-based independent exploration and
production company, has been negotiating with the Tirana government for more
than a year to rehabilitate Albania's largest oil field, Patos Marinza, near
the town of Fier.
About 1,500 wells, each topped with a rusting derrick, have been drilled in
an area of about 16km by 35km. But output from the field, which could
contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil, is only about 3,000 barrels a day.
Premier is close to signing a 25-year production sharing contract that could
result in output being boosted to 20,000 b/d or more. But Mr Gerry Orbell,
Premier's head of exploration, says negotiating the deal has been a complex
and at times frustrating exercise.
As in many other former communist countries, few ministers or officials are
accustomed to taking decisions. This meant that many of the issues raised
during negotiations had to be settled by President Sali Berisha himself.
Unfamiliarity with western legal concepts meant that even after seven months
of discussions, the Albanian-authored first draft of a production sharing
contract was 'riddled with so many ambiguities that it wouldn't stand up in
any international court', according to Mr Orbell.
Premier brought in lawyers with experience in Russia to re-draft the
contract. Mr David Davies, Premier's commercial manager, said the final
version was more in line with western norms, but 'it still had to go some
way way towards their way of doing things'.
Albanian expectations that millions of pounds of investment would
materialise immediately following an agreement had to be dispelled.
Instead the field will be developed in stages. Although Premier will put up
some cash to 'kick-start' higher production, the company plans to use
revenues earned from gradual increases in output to fund additional
expansion.
The first phase will include tests of the reservoir and evaluation of steam
injection and other techniques to increase the flow of the field's heavy
oil.
It will also include an environmental audit to determine the extent of the
pollution problem.
Once they are confident about the production potential of the reservoir,
Premier and its Albanian partners will probably approach the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development for help in funding the power and water
projects that would be needed to bring the field to its full potential of
20,000 b/d. The EBRD has said that it wants to see the field working
properly before it makes any significant commitments.
Premier hopes to export its share of the field's production to neighbouring
countries. But the absence of an established market for Albanian crude means
it might have to sell some to Albanian refineries for US dollars.
The refineries, however, are in an equally dilapidated state. The main
working refinery, just outside the dusty town of Ballsh, spews flame from
waste stacks and plumes of dark smoke over the surrounding hills.
Some western oil executives believe that it would be cheaper and more
environmentally sound for Albania to export its crude to modern refineries
in neighbouring countries and import products. But the politically-sensitive
employment implications of refinery closures could keep the obsolete
facilities going for some time.
The only signs of relatively new investment in Albania's oil sector are
fleets of second or third hand road tankers and private petrol stations.
The latter are now springing up like mushrooms alongside the main roads as
private entrepreneurs seek a profitable outlet for the small fortunes made
over the last three years following the liberalisation of trade and foreign
exchange transactions.
The road tanker fleets that have replaced lumbering old Chinese-built trucks
are now privatised; but they still ply the narrow and tortuous roads from
collection points to the refinery and service stations with their former
Italian or Greek owners names stencilled on their sides.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (7): Land of stunning beauty - A look at
the prospects for high class tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next five years should see Albania emerge as a significant factor in
European tourism, but not just yet. At present Albania is a country for the
hardy backpacker, the well-heeled business visitor willing to hire both car
and driver or, most attractive of all, the yacht-borne visitor now able at
last to anchor off Albania's virtually pristine coasts without being fired
on or arrested.
Five decades of total isolation from the outside world preserved Albania
from the destructive impact of mass tourism, but not from environmental
pollution or a countryside littered with hundreds of thousands of concrete
pillboxes, or from burning rubbish tips and rivers filthy with raw sewage -
or oil spills in the extensive oil regions of the centre and south. There
are none of the picturesque seaside towns and villages which dot the
Croatian coast or the Greek islands.
An autarkic economy with no private vehicles also left Albania with the sort
of infrastructure which existed in the rest of southern Europe 50 years ago.
The roads are pockmarked, narrow, and usually steep and winding, reflecting
the mountainous terrain, much of it virtually inaccessible except on foot or
donkey. Around 70 per cent of the country comes into this category.
There are very few hotels and restaurants and only now are service stations
being put up by private investors along the main roads. Albania is not a
place to be in a car which breaks down.
The coastal plains, now covered by virtually medieval strip farms, are
easier to traverse, but even here the roads are now full of horse and
ox-drawn carts. What is more, where traffic was once limited mainly to a
handful of official cars and old Chinese trucks, an avalanche of second hand
cars and trucks has appeared over the last two years.
City streets and country roads alike are now infested by wild,
klaxon-blowing novices unskilled in the finer arts of driving - like lane
discipline, keeping to the correct side of the road or not overtaking on
blind curves or into oncoming traffic. It is also full of traffic policemen
with a blind eye for their pals and a keen eye for foreigners to fleece.
All this, and inadequate ports and primitive airports, ensures that Albania
should remain off the mass tourism agenda for some time - some advisers
suggest for ever. But the country is definitely now on the move, has a
wealth of stunning scenery, virgin beaches and historic monuments and the
development of tourism, under Mr Edmond Spaho, the minister for tourism, is
seen by the government and foreign advisers as a priority, both to create
new jobs and to bring in hard currency.
At present, Tirana, the capital, boasts only one business-class hotel, the
Dajti, which was built by the Italians, like most of the city centre, about
60 years ago. It is an oasis for those who hate modern hotels, prefer high
ceilings to air conditioning and do not mind indifferent food when it is
served on a verandah overlooking a garden with palms. But the Dajti will be
closed for refurbishing as soon as two new first class hotels are completed.
The most impressive will be the Dollars 23m Dea hotel and office complex
complete with swimming pool and underground parking being built for the
Rogner group of Austria 200 metres down the main boulevard from the Dajti.
It is due to open by the autumn of 1995.
The 1960s style skyscraper of the Tirana Hotel just off the central
Skanderbeg Square is being refurbished by an Italo-Albanian venture and will
be managed by THI of Turin when it opens. But work has stopped at present so
the December 1994 opening date is uncertain.
Other projects in Tirana include a 200 room hotel and 10 residential villas
being constructed for Al Karafi, a Kuwaiti company, while MacRae
International, a UK company, is building up to 1,200 western-style homes and
working on plans for a tourist village at Lalzi Bay north of Durres.
Italian companies are particularly interested in building tourist villages
and associated infrastructure along the coast. Babini is planning a small
village in the Kavaja area while SICS, Torcelo and AX Holdings of Malta are
all planning to build tourist villages near Ksamil in southern Albania, just
across the straits from Corfu. The southern coastal strip between the port
of Vlore and the Greek frontier, and including towns such as Sarande and
Butrint with substantial Roman and Greek remains, is earmarked for the first
round of serious development because of proximity to Corfu and relative ease
of access. This is the area where pine forests slope down to a 100km stretch
of hitherto inaccessible virgin beaches. The aim is to develop this area
with the minimum of environmental destruction. The entire tourism
infrastructure will have to be built from nothing.
The EBRD is partially financing a scheme to promote the growth of small
restaurants and provide small scale finance for families to rent out rooms
and build small extensions. But development generally will require sizeable
investments.
With this in mind the Special Law on Investments in Priority Tourism
Development Zones has been drawn up along with a long term strategy based
largely on a report prepared by consultants Touche Ross and Euro Principals.
Tourism investments are exempt from profits tax entirely over the first five
years and enjoy a 50 per cent exemption over the next five years of
operation. Losses over the first five years can also be offset against
profits over the next five years.
As a further incentive all machinery, spare parts and raw materials are
exempt from customs duty for three years. Foreigners can be employed and
profits freely repatriated.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (8): Hard lessons in capitalism -
Investors must expect some surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Selami Xhepa has an awesome task - to promote foreign investment in
Albania on an annual budget of Dollars 32,000. From his office in what was
once the Albania Today exhibition hall he frets that his shoulders are not
broad enough to bear the burden of bringing his country into the future.
'Albanians have a lot to learn after 50 years of isolation from the outside
world, but step-by-step, their mentality will change,' he says. It already
has. Until four years ago, foreign investment was a crime.
Albania now has more than 200 foreign investment projects, ranging from
kiosk cafes to oil exploration in the Adriatic Sea. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is financing nearly Dollars 100m worth
of projects, and playing an important role in providing 'comfort' to would
be investors.
The most conspicuous and symbolically important is a new Coca-Cola bottling
plant, just outside Tirana, which will start full operations this month. It
is a joint venture between Aziende Commerciali Industriali Estero; a wholly
owned Italian subsidiary of Coca-Cola, and a state-owned Albanian investment
company, with EBRD financing.
The EBRD is also co-financing construction of the Hotel Dea, by the Austrian
company Rogner and the Slovene firm Smelt, and the renovation of the Hotel
Tirana. Together these should cover the shortage of hotel rooms in the
Albanian capital, as well as enhancing telecommunications and other
technical aid projects.
While foreign equity capital has flowed in - Dollars 80m so far - it is
hardly the deluge that many Albanians were expecting when their country
began to open up in 1991. 'At first, Albanians believed that investors would
run to them with their pockets lined with money,' says Mr Xhepa. Over
Dollars 200m of foreign capital is committed to projects  - Italian
companies accounting for 53 per cent followed by Greek investors with 20 per
cent.
Mr Wei Ding, the Shanghai-born IMF representative in Albania, believes that
Albania's main hope for rapid economic growth is to attract foreign
investment. But he cautions that 'Albania is a small market and the
government has to do more than the neighbouring countries to attract
investors'.
Mr Xhepa agrees. He is only 28 years old and does not believe in overnight
miracles. 'The most important thing is that foreign investments are
guaranteed. Albania has signed agreements with some 15 countries on the
protection of foreign capital,' he adds.
Under new laws, profits can be repatriated freely and Albanians hope that
their comparative advantages will lure foreign investors. 'The cost of
labour is two dollars per hour compared with four in Taiwan,' Mr Xhepa says.
Several large Italian shoe and garment companies have already transferred
assembly operations to Albania from the Far East, saving on both wages and
transport costs.
As rising competition reduces profits from hawking imported goods in the
fast mushrooming sales kiosks all over the country he expects to sees a
re-investment of trading profits into manufacturing and construction
projects, including those linked to foreign financed infrastructure
developments.
Mr Xhepa, 28, is an assistant professor of economics at Tirana University
and speaks Italian and several other foreign languages. But a fairly
widespread knowledge of foreign languages among the young policy makers and
businessmen has not broken down all the barriers thrown up by half a century
spent in a socialist cocoon which spawned suspicion and fear. Xenophobia was
institutionally enforced under Mr Hoxha and his successor, Mr Ramiz Alia,
and unofficial contacts with foreigners were illegal.
Some of these suspicions were reinforced by a flood of carpet baggers who
hit town when the regime collapsed, many of them ethnic Albanians from
neighbouring Kosovo. Mr Bashkim Kopliku, deputy prime minister, says 'many
foreigners came here with the hope that they would find savages who knew
nothing about finance or doing business'.
Mr Kopliku complains that a handful of companies still want what he calls
'more than their fair share of the profit'. But his criticisms of investors
are matched by counter charges from investors who have fallen foul of
officialdom and complain of an ignorant and sometimes corrupt bureaucracy
and absence of clear laws and rules.
Mr Julien Roche is a prominent French businessman, who first started trading
with Albania in 1982 and is now trying to recoup losses which he says were
caused by trying to work strictly to laws when many of his competitors were
operating clandestinely and dealing in contraband goods.
The co-owner of a string of shops and an aviation company, the businessman
is viewed with suspicion partly because he began trading with the former
regime a decade ago. He is now fighting to secure the release of his
Albanian partner from jail, months after a court rescinded his sentence on
appeal.
The outcome of his fight to defend his business interests and his partner by
legal process is being closely watched by diplomats and the foreign business
community.
But suspicion of foreign business has been heightened by several bad
experiences with foreign investors. The worst, almost legendary exploit
happened two years ago when a Kosovar businessman collected tens of millions
of dollars from citizens and Albanian workers abroad to build a
'Sheraton-like' hotel, which was touted as the new land-mark for Tirana's
centre.
With no warning he absconded to Switzerland with all the money, leaving a
deep hole and nothing else. Another investor claimed to be a close relative
of Baron de Rothschild even though he was Chinese. After these incidents
many Albanians are wary about investors pulling out of projects, creating
uncertainty in an environment striving for stability.
On the other hand Albanians suffer from their lack of knowledge about
foreign markets and most businessmen are deeply aware of their lack of
experience after decades under a paranoid regime when only hand-picked
favourites could travel abroad.
'Even now if they can afford to go abroad they often have to wait for months
to get a visa,' says Mr Xhepa, who picked up some of his expertise on a
training course in Verona, Italy.
Unfamiliarity with the outside world sometimes causes hilarious
misunderstandings. A resident European businessman recalls how a senior
government official told him that 'Albania did not need to introduce the
Diner's Card because we already have the Rotary Club.' In the future says Mr
Xhepa, such snags and misunderstandings will be avoided because the rules of
the games are now set. The emphasis has moved from joint ventures with the
state, which were open to abuse, to direct investment or private
partnerships.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (9): The fever of liberation - Peasants
sweep away collectivised farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eye is a better guide to the new reality of rural life in
post-collectivisation Albania than dry and inadequate statistics. But, for
the record, the IMF estimates that agricultural output rose by 14 per cent
last year and forecasts another 8 per cent gain this year.
The ministry of agriculture offers a 15 per cent overall increase, according
to its own statistics, or at least 30 per cent according to satellite
photographs.
A sceptical attitude to the statistics is merited above all by the sheer
scale of the changes which have taken place following the decrees abolishing
collective farms three years ago and the redistribution of their lands to
nearly half a million peasant farmers with an average holding of around 1.4
hectares.
Decollectivisation was followed by an orgy of looting and destruction as
farm and machine tractor station buildings, irrigation systems, greenhouses
and other collective properties were torn down brick by brick and pane by
pane in many areas. Orchards and forests, and even tall roadside poplars
were also cut down, as an angry and distrustful peasantry showed its bottled
up hatred for the regimented farming of old.
But the destruction also had a more practical side as the new landowners
scavenged for the materials with which to build primitive hen-coops, pig
sties and storage space and where possible to acquire a tractor or combine
harvester.
'A neighbour tore down a piece of the irrigation system, broke it into
pieces and laid a solid floor in place of the mud in his yard. The rest of
us waited to see if he was punished. He wasn't, so we all took what we
could,' a farmer explained beside a pool of water from the broken irrigation
canal used as an al fresco car wash by enterprising youngsters.
The avidity of the search for building materials coincided with relief at
the end of an absurd agricultural system. The former regime drove an entire
nation to near starvation by banning private rearing of animals of any kind,
from draught animals to the humble chicken.
Three years later rural Albania, where 65 per cent of the population still
lives and works, is still poor relative to the rest of Europe, especially in
the mountainous areas which cover two thirds of the country. But the rural
towns and villages have taken on a new liveliness.
On the fertile coastal plains which stretch south for 150kms from the
capital Tirana and the country's main port of Durres, the fields sub-divided
into small strips are full of hard working women cropping wheat and alfalfa
with scythes. On the reclaimed marshland closer to the sea many of the
fields of the former state farms remain large and wheat is being cut by
Fortschritt model combine harvesters made in former East Germany and
'appropriated' from the former centralised pool of agricultural equipment.
Roads for so long virtually empty of traffic are now clogged by hay wagons
pulled by donkeys or oxen while children and old women lead cows along mud
tracks or lie with them under make-shift straw sun shelters.
Outside village houses, or glimpsed inside courtyard interiors, mounds of
wheat are piled up to dry in the sun after winnowing, while children and old
people shoo chickens, gaggles of geese and flocks of turkeys away from the
inviting grains.
With unseasonable rain compensating for broken irrigation systems and bread
prices at world market levels following the removal of subsidies last July,
farmers are getting ready to sell surplus grain to the state or private
traders.
Politically and economically, fulfilment of the never honoured Leninist
slogan 'land to the peasants, bread to the workers' has been a determining
factor in the success of post-communist stabilisation policies.
Allowing peasants to grow their own corn, bake their own bread, raise
livestock and grow crops for own consumption and sale has relieved the
government of its inherited obligation to provide bread and basic foods.
On the demand side, the elimination of food subsidies, compensated for by
higher wages, has drastically reduced the demand for bread which was often
simply thrown away or, latterly, fed to animals when sold at the old
subsidised price.
Now, hobbled live sheep and freshly skinned sheep carcasses are offered for
sale by the roadside outside many villages and the increased supply of meat
and the influx of a wide range of imported foodstuffs, including luxury
items, has further reduced the demand for bread and added variety to a once
monotonous and rationed diet.
The last three years have proved that a return to virtually medieval strip
farming and free markets is more productive than enforced collectivisation.
But not all are enamoured by what Marx once called 'the idiocy of rural
life'.
The government and aid agencies expect a big exodus from rural areas into
towns and into new service industries like tourism as the Albanian economy
moves towards a more conventional pattern. The future of agriculture lies in
a consolidation of strips into larger units once peasants are permitted to
buy and sell their land. This was denied for the first two years.
Meanwhile, a Dollars 42m agricultural sector adjustment credit funded by a
Dollars 20m loan from the World Bank, Dollars 20m from Japan and Dollars 2m
from the Dutch government, is helping to finance priority projects.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (3): Youth takes the helm - Banking and
finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the collapse of the old regime the new democratically elected
government urgently needed to find young Albanians capable of understanding
and working with foreign governments and the international institutions
willing to help to rebuild the state apparatus, banks and other bodies.
A prime example of this new technocratic elite is Mr Kris Luniku, the 32
year old deputy governor of the National Bank of Albania with overall
responsibility for monetary policy. (The bank itself enjoys formal
independence modelled on that of the German Bundesbank.)
After graduating in economy and finance from Tirana University in 1986, Mr
Luniku joined the state bank three years later, starting with a stint in the
mountainous north east. There followed several months secondment to German
banks where he received training in government securities and stock exchange
practice before going to the IMF in 1991 for a crash course in financial
programming and medium term adjustment processes.
The courteous and slightly shy young banker recalls the first awesome days
in 1992 when he and two colleagues took responsibility for introducing
monetary policy to the bank. 'Nobody really knew what the relationship was
between interest rates and inflation, what the instruments of monetary
policy were, or how a central bank functioned,' he confesses.
'We had to be cautious, define our goals and then monitor our progress. We
knew we just could not afford to make mistakes.' After its modest start,
however, the new team quickly expanded with the recruitment of young,
multilingual people with an academic grasp of macro-economics who were eager
to learn more.
Under the overall supervision of the governor, Mr Dylber Vrioni, a former
engineer and erstwhile chairman of the ruling Democratic Party, the young
technocrats spread out to apply their skills in six new divisions of the
bank dealing with the budget, monetary policy, balance of payments,
macro-economic analysis, statistics and financial operations and
instruments.
In July, the bank took responsibility for controlling liquidity through open
market operations connected with the first issue of treasury bills. 'We are
trying to become more efficient by switching to indirect instruments with
credit ceilings for the private and government sectors and reserve and
liquidity requirements for the banking system,' Mr Luniku says.
Until now the central bank has financed the government deficit. But the
treasury bill auctions in July will be open to individuals and private
companies. The aim is to spread the load and control the excess reserves of
the banking system. Interest rates on deposits are now positive after the
recent slide in inflation.
Reform of the financial system really began with liberalisation of the
foreign exchange market, at a time when reserves were practically
non-existent. It proved a great success and the Lek appreciated against a
basket of foreign currencies by around 25 per cent last year thanks to
emigre remittances and foreign aid.
Proof of the free exchange market can be seen in the hordes of licensed
money changers with wads of notes in hand who congregate perfectly legally
in front of the central bank building offering a slight discount on
officially announced rates.
Development of an inter-bank money market is now the main element in the
drive to make the banking system an efficient conduit for investment.
The task of reform began two years ago when a two tier banking system was
created by the new Central Bank Law, which established a Bundesbank-type
independent central bank, and the Commercial Banking Law of April 1992 which
hived off three commercial banks from the formerly monolithic state bank.
The balance sheets of the three state owned commercial banks, the National
Commercial Bank of Albania (NCBA), the Savings Bank and the Rural Commercial
Bank, have been partially cleared of their nearly Lek5bn bad debt after the
government issued Lek2.7bn in interest bearing bonds, which are negotiable
and tradeable.
But the banking system remains weak and slow. The key to future development
lies in creating new bankers. The World Bank and the EBRD are funding a 25
week course at Tirana university to train bankers in risk analysis and the
like. Two joint venture banks with full banking licences have been set up in
the capital.
These are the Italian-Albanian bank, a joint venture of the NCBA and Banca
di Roma, and the Arab Albanian Islamic bank whose shareholders are the NCBA
and the Arab Islamic Bank of Bahrain. One fully foreign-owned bank, the
Dardania bank, has been formed with capital from Kosovo and Albanians
abroad.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (5): On the mend, despite the hospital
rats - How foreign aid and reform are helping to shake up the nation's
archaic health service / Medical care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades the Albanian health service, starved of funds and equipment,
coped as best it could with the medical consequences of poverty, dirt,
pollution and ignorance.
The situation has improved substantially over the last three years with the
delivery of substantial medical aid and equipment. Over the next three years
Lek12.8bn, nearly 18 per cent of total public investment, will be devoted to
'human resource development' - including health, education, building a
social safety net and labour market services, such as employment exchanges
and re-skilling.
The changes can best be seen at Tirana's University Hospital, the country's
premier teaching hospital, where doctors have received new equipment and
have also noted a marked change in the pattern of disease over the last
three years.
'Malnutrition used to be a big problem. But since land was redistributed and
people have been allowed to have their own cows, sheep and chickens again
malnutrition is now rare.' says Dr Mehdi Alimehmeti, the hospital's deputy
director. Deterioration of the country's infrastructure, however, has
created new problems, such as a serious outbreak of hepatitis due to the
contamination of fresh water with sewage from pipes laid over 50 years ago.
But Dr Heta Hyseh, who heads the child surgical unit, has noted a decline in
bronchial infections and abnormalities in the digestive tract.
At the same time, however, the trauma department has seen a sharp rise in
car accident victims following the simultaneous appearance of thousands of
inexperienced drivers. The influx of western cigarettes has also done
nothing to moderate the high incidence of lung and other smoking-related
cancers.
Dr Alimehmeti also notes subtle changes in the behaviour of patients and
their families since the emergence of a more consumerist society.
Traditionally villagers from even the remotest parts of the mountainous
north east and other obscure parts of this mountainous country of poor roads
and inadequate public transport brought their children or relations to the
University hospital for treatment. Once inside they squatted down there
until the patient recovered or died. This continues. Compared with the
situation three years ago, however, Dr Alimehmeti notes that 'people have
become quieter, more respectful'.
Meanwhile, the morale of hospital staff has improved with the delivery of
new beds and new ambulances, mostly donated by foreign governments and
charities. New equipment includes a Dollars 500,000 laser kidney-stone
smashing machine from Germany, brain scanners and a cardiac scanner from
Kuwait.
'Two years ago we had no sheets or blankets and only ancient beds. The lifts
did not work and we often ran out of oxygen and other essential items for
operations. At the same time, the hospital was surrounded by piles of
garbage and it was impossible to keep the hospital clean. Now the garbage
has been cleared, the wards are much cleaner and we intend to privatise the
laundry, catering and other services,' he adds.
Even so, much remains to be done. Rats scurry in broad daylight over garbage
piled up against a perimeter fence which abuts one of the city's biggest
markets. The oldest wards are still dank, airless rooms packed with 10 beds
and lit by a bare bulb shaded by an old newspaper. Sheets are hand washed
and hung on hedges to dry.
Standards in provincial hospitals reportedly remain low. But here at the
University hospital, where six formerly separate hospitals are being
re-organised into one coherent whole, the level of service and dedication
seem higher.
A new neurological unit and a new 'resource centre for health' partially
financed by a Dollars 120,000 grant from the Soros foundation, will further
upgrade the facilities.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (4): We have lift-off - Economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albania's transformation from a closed economy of the absurd to an open
economy of frenetic consumerism within three years has taken everybody by
surprise, writes ANTHONY ROBINSON.
The International Monetary Fund, no stranger to economic turnarounds,
eulogises an 'economic miracle' which gave Albania an estimated 11 per cent
GDP growth last year, the sort of dynamic usually seen only in Asia and
Albania's old mentor, China.
Mr Gramoz Pashko, one of Albania's most prominent academic economists and
deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform in the interim 'stability
government' of 1991, puts events in proportion with the observation that
'even a clod of earth looks like a mountain on a flat plain'.
His remark is not a denial of Albania's leap forward over the last two years
but a reminder that between 1989 and 1992 liberalisation of the economy and
the shift to tight IMF-monitored monetary and fiscal policies was preceded
by an unprecedently drastic elimination of big loss making enterprises and
dramatic falls in industrial output.
All the post-communist countries have undergone some degree of 'constructive
destruction' following the collapse of Comecon trade and the shift to market
prices. But none matched Albania's purge of an industrial economy which was
obsolete even when it was being built with Soviet and then Chinese aid and
technology in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the Hoxha-era industrial and
mining complexes which formerly employed tens of thousands of workers, like
the Elbasan steel works or the Tirana tractor factory and spare parts
engineering facilities, as well as many of the coal, chrome and nickel mines
worked for decades with prison labour, have been closed down.
Economic reform was begun by the transitional government in the fraught
months before the March 1992 elections. But difficult decisions were also
taken by the Democratic Party-led coalition government which emerged from
those elections. Perhaps the toughest was to end the 80 per cent
unemployment pay given by the last communist government to workers sent home
by factory closures.
The closure of loss-making plants led to a cumulative 60 per cent decline in
industrial output in the three years to the end of 1992, but eliminated a
double drain on the exchequer and provided a sharp incentive for workers to
seek other sources of income either in agriculture or self-employment.
More than 300,000 Albanians, or 10 per cent of the population, took the
opportunity presented by the chaotic opening of frontiers to emigrate
instead, mainly to Italy, Greece and Germany. This exodus eased the
political costs of transition, although official unemployment in 1993 still
hovered around 30 per cent of the remaining non-agricultural labour force.
Emigration, by leading to a rapid boost in remittances to relatives still at
home, became within a few months a crucial element in underpinning the
domestic economic recovery. For the last two years remittances and foreign
aid have been Albania's principal sources of income.
From practically zero, remittances rose to Dollars 150m in 1992 and doubled
to Dollars 334m last year. This was 10 per cent higher than the total inflow
of official foreign aid which dropped to Dollars 303m last year from a peak
of Dollars 374m in 1992 when the Italian-run emergency food aid programme,
Operation Pellicano, was at its height.
Without the remittances Albania would not have been able to finance the
large imports of consumer goods and second hand vehicles which have given
the country an unprecedented air of prosperity. Aid alone would have been
insufficient to finance last year's Dollars 509m trade deficit.
Remittances raised disposable incomes and the demand for food and imported
consumer goods. This in turn has stimulated a rapid rise in small scale
trade and investment projects, principally cafes, small food kiosks,
informal markets and, increasingly, petrol stations. The latter are busy
servicing more than 40,000 mainly second hand cars and thousands of trucks
and vans imported over the past year. Many of the new vehicles are of
dubious provenance, but the thousands of hooting cars roaming the streets
contrast sharply with the empty roads of the past.
Meanwhile, the return of land to the peasants in a country where 65 per cent
of the population still lives off the land or in villages has led to an
extraordinary growth in food production and higher rural incomes as
livestock, eggs, fruit and grain are traded in increasing amounts.
Higher domestic food output has reduced the need for basic food imports to
cooking oil and sugar and provides the basis for the future growth of a
domestic food processing industry and the export of early vegetables and
fruit.
In this way, an artificial economy of inefficient industrial plants and
collectivised agriculture has been replaced within three years by an economy
of small farmers, traders and businessmen.
The era of constructive destruction propped up by emergency aid is now over.
The dynamic growth of trade has permitted the rapid accumulation of capital
and the economy is entering the crucial second phase of infrastructure and
industrial investment, banking modernisation and institution building.
A largely aid-financed investment programme is getting under way which
requires additional foreign equity investment to redevelop the dilapidated
but capital and technology intensive oil and mining sectors and help develop
the tourism industry.
The first foreign investments are starting to come on stream, such as the
new Coca-Cola bottling plant on the road from Tirana airport, partially
financed by the EBRD which is also helping other foreign-financed
construction and infrastructure projects.
The most eye-catching is the Dollars 23m hotel and business centre complex
now being built by Smelt, a Slovene building company, for Rogner, the
Austrian hotel and resort group. The new Hotel Dea, is rising from a prime
site on Tirana's main boulevard between the prime minister's office and the
exhibition centre originally built to hold the body of Enver Hoxha.
There are early signs that an incipient boom in construction is leading to
rising investment in local building materials. Meanwhile, low wages of
around Dollars 60-Dollars 70 a month are starting to attract Italian and
Greek shoe, textile and other companies seeking Asian level production costs
combined with lower transport costs.
To maintain the growth and further raise the level of economic development,
the authorities know they must also eliminate the frustrations to would-be
foreign equity investors caused by an inexperienced and sometimes corrupt
administration and clarify key legal issues, including land ownership
rights.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (6): Rush for 'western' homes - Laura
Silber meets a UK participant in the Tirana building boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albania's dilapidated buildings and run-down blocks of flats epitomise a
housing shortage which is expected to get much worse as people flock from
the countryside to the towns over the next few years. But the housing
shortage spells a big business opportunity for builders and architects such
as Mr Martin Stent, who left London to build western-style houses in Tirana.
When he arrived at his new 'office' there were no windows, doors, or phone.
'But we took it and agreed to redo it, after all I am an architect,' he adds
in what is now a modern office overlooking the site.
Fifteen months later, he is a happy man after a state commission awarded his
company a licence to build 1,200 'traditional' western-style houses in the
southwest of Tirana, the capital city in which little has been built since
the Italians left 50 years ago but which is now expected to double its
240,000 population within a decade.
Mr Stent admits a few misconceptions have been set right since he set up
shop. Above all, he underestimated the purchasing power and potential demand
for western style housing.
'When I first came here, I thought we would be building flats at Dollars
10,000 a piece. It turned out to be 10 times that,' he says, pointing to the
picturesque building site nestling on the shores of a reservoir and framed
by the slopes of Mount Dajti which rise above the city. Cows and sheep
meander through the pastures, unaware that Albania's first joint venture in
private housing is about to leave them homeless.
He also learnt that building houses in Albania means thatMacRae
International, his London-based development company, will also have to put
in the entire infrastructure, from sewerage to power lines, even though,
under the current agreement, Mr Stent's company does not own the land.
Instead it has received power of attorney to sell or lease it on behalf of
the state at an agreed price.
Mr Stent's team christened the housing complex Green Valleys. 'But Albania
is not like England where everyone likes to live somewhere named after a
village.' Albanians don't want anything sounding too rural, he says, mainly
because most urban dwellers are recent immigrants from the countryside and
the two-thirds of Albania's population who remain in the countryside have no
romantic ideas about doing so.
Social habits in Albania, with its history of clans and extended families,
are also different from what he is used to. 'Several families want to live
in adjoining houses or neighbouring flats - envisioning common rooms between
them, not just now but for generations to come.'
Meanwhile, changing times have created a booming market. 'In the old system
people were not free to choose where they lived. Now they will naturally
gravitate to Tirana, What is more 'Albanians want a huge house for the whole
family. Some shared houses will have up to nine bedrooms,' he says.
Another characteristic of the current Albanian market is that potential
buyers, after 50 years of economic privation under the Hoxha dictatorship,
are anxious to pay in advance, afraid that there will not be any houses left
to buy a year from now.
Mr Stent turns them away, until the building gets underway. 'Many Albanians
were burned by foreign bandits at the beginning. Everyone paid cash and they
lost all their money,' he says.
At present, the new rich speed, horns blaring, down Tirana's wide boulevards
in their shiny new Mercedes. But Mr Stent believes that their tastes will
change quickly. 'Once they have tasted privacy, they will want more of it,'
he says, adding that many future buyers are currently living in one-room
flats with their families.
Local construction officials now realise that Mr Stent can offer them a
badly needed product to cope with rising population and incomes. 'But it did
take a while to get them to understand that I was here to make money, not to
do good,' he says of Tirana officials whose mentality was shaped under the
old communist regime.
Now, relieved that the project at last is officially underway, Mr Stent
frets about what lies ahead. 'There are 101 things to do. They do not make
plywood here and they do not know about different colours of bricks - they
used to have no choice.' But that is about to change, and MacRae
International will be part of the reason.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Survey of Albania (2): A navigator in the stormy Balkans -
Interview with President Sali Berisha
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For President Sali Berisha, the cardiologist who led his Democratic Party to
a landslide victory in March 1992, the end of isolation coupled with price,
foreign exchange and trade liberalisation and the abolition of collective
farms, has transformed Albania's prospects.
'Isolating Albania was the greatest crime committed by Enver Hoxha, the
former dictator. At least the other communist countries had more or less
open borders with each other and trade and diplomatic relations with the
outside world. Albania had virtually nothing. Hoxha was the only European
leader who did not even sign the Helsinki Final Acts (the east-west European
security pact),' he says.
But after decades under a brutal and obscurantist regime Albania is now in
the hands of a younger generation determined to integrate the country into
the European mainstream. 'We are having to learn, apply new ideas and
implement them all at the same time,' he says.
The experience of the last two years has made him an impassioned supporter
of the fast-track approach to economic reform. 'Shock therapy is a bitter
pill, but it is a brilliant invention. We have been prepared to sacrifice
popularity by pressing ahead with reforms. The hardest of all was the
decision in July last year to liberalise bread prices three days before
local elections. We lost votes, but since then we have not had to worry
about the arrival of grain shipments from abroad and the granaries are
full,' he says.
'We are still the poorest country in Europe, but GDP grew by over 10 per
cent last year, personal consumption has doubled, inflation has dropped from
400 per cent to around 30 per cent and savings have risen too,' he adds.
His figures may be a bit rough and ready. But the evidence of well stocked
markets, busy fields, bustling streets and new cafes backs up the
president's claim of sharply rising living standards after decades of hunger
and poverty.
The state of contemporary Albania is a far cry from the desperate days of
1990 when the feared Sigurimi secret police are believed to have encouraged
an orgy of looting and destruction and thousands of would-be refugees
invaded embassies and clambered on to ships leaving the country.
But critics of Mr Berisha and the government he closely controls accuse him
of gathering too much power in his own hands and of building a new security
force to replace the Sigurimi. He is also accused of mounting political
trials against leaders of the former regime. Critics cite the case of Mr
Fatos Nano, the former prime minister and probably the most competent
politician in the opposition socialist party who is now serving a nine year
sentence on charges of embezzlement of Italian aid funds.
There is a greater consensus about the trials of other former regime
figures. Mr Ramiz Alia, the handpicked successor to Mr Hoxha, received a
nine year jail sentence earlier this month after he and eight other former
senior politicians were judged guilty of violating their own laws and
shooting dead Albanian citizens trying to flee the country.
'I don't like trials but I'm certainly following the Alia trial,' Berisha
said two weeks before the verdict was announced. 'More than 100 people were
shot and killed during the transition period alone. I see these trials as
necessary to prevent a wave of revenge sweeping the country.
'What has impressed me most is that none of the old regime leaders on trial
has ever uttered a word of regret. Even if you exclude all their other
crimes they were responsible for burying half of Albania under thousands of
concrete pill-boxes that consumed the sweat and resources of Albanians,' the
president added.
Mr Berisha is a Moslem from the mountainous north east of a country, a
region with a long history of blood feuds and intense personal rivalries.
After two years as the first post-communist president of Albania, he retains
substantial political support. A tall, imposing figure he has gained in
experience and confidence both domestically and on his foreign travels.
Diplomats concerned with stability in the volatile Balkan region appreciate
what they see as his growing understanding of the need for cautious
diplomacy.
Domestic political critics, however, including some who launched the
opposition movement with him but split from the Democratic Party shortly
after the March 1992 elections, criticise what they see as autocratic
tendencies and a desire to control all aspects of government. Foreign
investors, frustrated by delays and corruption in a still largely inherited
administration, tend to seek an audience at the presidential palace when
they need to cut through bureaucratic knots.
Mr Berisha rejects charges that he runs an essentially authoritarian system
and is seeking to establish a presidential republic. 'We had a one man
system for 50 years. We need time to promote and develop a parliamentary
tradition here,' he says, blaming opposition parties for delays in
introducing a new constitution with copious civil rights protection written
into it.
But navigating successfully through the treacherous shoals of Balkan foreign
politics is as important for the new democracy as defusing internal
tensions. With almost as many ethnic Albanians living in neighbouring
Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro as within the borders of Albania itself,
many Albanians are torn between the desire to support their kith and kin and
a growing awareness that borders cannot be changed without war. This
realisation has been heightened by the war in Bosnia and the pro-consular
advice of western embassies.
The president dismisses accusations that Albania is seeking to create a
'greater Albania' similar to the efforts of Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic to
create a greater Serbia. 'Albania's concept is very clear. All we are
seeking is a democratic space for Albanians wherever they are. That means
democratic institutions and elections. A solution cannot be achieved by
forcibly changing borders. But better trade and economic co-operation could
be a big element in improving relations,' says the president.
He recently returned from a successful visit to Macedonia where he and
president Kiro Gligorov discussed improved rail and road links to help
Macedonia overcome the embargo imposed by Greece on its southern borders.
After months of bad-tempered exchanges with Greece over a border incident in
which two Albanian soldiers were killed in April, President Berisha is
looking forward to closer relations with Europe and progress on the
country's desired EU association agreement now that Germany rather than
Greece occupies the EU presidential chair.
'Albanians are growing in self-confidence and a sense of responsibility. We
know that our future lies in Europe, with European style laws and democracy
and a dynamic market economy,' he concludes.

After the collapse of Europe's most repressive Stalinist regime, Anthony
Robinson and Laura Silber examine Albania's first steps in freedom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After 50 lost years as one of the most isolated countries in the world,
Albania has re-emerged over the last three years with a strong desire to
rebuild its economy and shattered society.
Like other post-communist states it also seeks to re-integrate into Europe
while playing a more active role in the volatile Balkan region where
millions of ethnic Albanian live across the border in Kosovo, Macedonia and
Montenegro.
Much progress has been made since 1990-91 when this small, mainly
mountainous country of 3.2m people was on the verge of anarchy while the
hated secret police of the dying communist regime installed by Enver Hoxha
in 1945 sought vainly to forestall its collapse.
Wild rumours swept the country as thousands of desperate young people
clambered on to ancient boats or slipped across the frontiers by mountain
tracks to seek a new life in a wider world known only by listening to
forbidden foreign radio and TV programmes.
Italy, just across the Adriatic, was most fearful of incipient civil war and
of destabilising waves of immigrants and hastily put together an emergency
relief programme. For 18 months the Italian army delivered food and other
aid throughout a country whose invasion by Mussolini's troops in 1939 marked
one of the least glorious chapters in Italo-Albanian relations.
It was a great success. The exodus was halted, but not before more than
300,000 people, mainly young work seekers, had found some form of refuge and
employment abroad.
Three years later these emigrants have become the mainstay of an economy
kept afloat by a cocktail of remittances and foreign aid.
Emigrant remittances totalled Dollars 330m last year, compared with the
Dollars 300m received in foreign aid, although Albania would have been in
dire straits without the nearly Dollars 1.5bn in food aid, grants and low
interest loans which governments and international institutions poured in
over the last three years, and which they have pledged to continue at a rate
of around Dollars 300m annually until 1996.
Stability started to return after the general elections of March 1992.
Western governments, the EU Phare programme, international financial and
other institutions moved in with technical assistance and financial support
for President Sali Berisha and the Democratic Party-led coalition
government. The coalition emerged from elections with an absolute majority
and a programme for completing free market reforms begun by the interim
government under the aegis of economists Mr Gramoz Pashko and Mr Genc Ruli,
both of whom are now out of government.
The army and secret police were purged but the inherited administrative
organs remain ill-equipped to provide the services demanded of a modern
state.
The democratic credentials of Albania, meanwhile, will not be fully
recognised until a new constitution and new civil and legal codes are
introduced to replace the amended versions of the old Hoxha-era documents
still in force.
All three are expected to be finalised this year although the constitution
requires a two thirds majority in the parliament which currently eludes the
government led by prime minister Alexander Meksi.
Albania, which achieved independence from Turkey after the third Balkan War
in 1912, has no real democratic tradition and the 50 year totalitarian
dictatorship established by Enver Hoxha destroyed the economic and social
basis which would normally have given rise to a middle class. Under these
circumstances, politics tend to be highly personalised while institutional
and legal guarantees are weak and often unenforceable.
Strengthening the social, economic and above all legal underpinnings of
Albania's fledgling democracy will take time and imposes a steep learning
curve on both the government parties and the opposition. The latter is
headed by the socialist party successor to the communists whose most capable
leader, Mr Fatos Nano, is in jail.
Albanians, from the president down, constantly repeat that 'changing the
mentality of people is the hardest task' and seem aware that democracy and
stability will best be guaranteed by sustained economic growth and the
avoidance of conflict over the status of ethnic Albanians in the
neighbouring former Yugoslav states and tension with Greece over the status
of ethnic Greeks in the southern part of Albania.
Western embassies in particular stress that Albania's continuing access to
western credits and investment reflect its strategic importance and require
Tirana to play a constructive and cautious role in support of regional
stability.
The over-riding imperative of the US and EU governments is to prevent
conflict between the two regional Nato states - Greece and Turkey.
Albanian politicians can help by calling on the Albanian diaspora to show
patience and moderation, especially in Kosovo and Macedonia which has ethnic
Greek as well as Albanian and other minorities and where Bulgaria, Greece
and Turkey all have competing historical claims.
Diverting Albanian energies into economic reconstruction and the acquisition
of modest wealth is seen by western embassies and institutions as a key to
national and regional stability.
Progress to date is encouraging. The first economic reforms were dictated by
necessity. Most of the large, heavily polluting and loss making factories
built with obsolete technology by Soviet and later Chinese technicians in
the 1960s and 1970s have been closed and the hated collective and state
farms have been abolished.
At first unemployment soared in urban areas while in country districts,
where 65 per cent of the population live, collective farm buildings were
looted, machinery was broken and trees were cut down for fuel. Unemployment
is still officially around 30 per cent of the non-farm workforce and
poverty, although not hunger, remains widespread.
But the abolition in May 1992 of unemployment pay at 80 per cent of previous
salary, introduced by the last communist regime to ease the pain of plant
closures, forced the jobless to find new employment. Thanks mainly to
emigrant remittances and the abolition of all restrictions on foreign
exchange dealing and foreign trade, thousands rapidly found employment in a
fast growing private trading sector.
The service sector as a whole provided only 12 per cent of employment under
the old regime with its heavy bias towards heavy industry and collectivised
agriculture. It is now expanding fast as deregulation, privatisation and the
abolition of subsidies have combined with emigrant remittances to create
fast rising disposal incomes.
The highly visible result is a frenetic demand for all sorts of consumer
imports - from luxury foods to televisions, satellite dishes and second hand
cars. This demand-led economy has created new jobs in retailing, storage,
transport and other services.
At the same time de-collectivisation created 400,000 new peasant farmers
able to feed themselves and freed from the onerous restrictions which for
decades had prevented private citizens from even raising chickens or other
livestock. Last year food output rose by at least 15 per cent and food
imports plummeted 50 per cent.
With macro-economic stabilisation achieved by 1993, policy makers are now
moving ahead to tackle the structural deficiencies which must be removed if
the state as a whole is to be modernised and Albania's resources fully used.
These resources are substantial. Albania boasts the third largest deposits
of chromium in the world after South Africa and Kazakhstan, and related
deposits of copper and other non-ferrous metals. Most of the mines, operated
for decades by prison labour, are currently moribund.
The country also has extensive onshore and offshore oil and gas deposits,
although the former have been badly exploited by ancient technology for over
half a century and the latter are not yet proven in commercial quantities.
Canadian Occidental, Agip of Italy and Premier Oil of the UK are among
foreign oil companies currently searching for viable deposits.
Above all, decades of enforced isolation have left Albania with more than
320 kms of virgin coastline suitable for the development of high quality
tourism, and a wealth of hardly visited Greek, Roman and Byzantine
archeological sites and 'museum cities' such as Gjirokastro.
Exploiting these resources in a profitable and ecologically satisfactory way
will require heavy investment over many years, not just in specific projects
but above all in the associated infrastructure required to underpin the
modern, market-oriented economy on which Albanians are setting their sights
by the end of the century.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT and Liffe consider
linking after-hours trade - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pattern of alliances between the world's futures exchanges shifted once
again yesterday. The Chicago Board of Trade and the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, largest and third-largest exchanges,
said they would explore the feasibility of linking their after-hours
electronic trading systems.
The two exchanges were known to be looking at ways to join forces, after
both turned their backs on Globex, the electronic trading system developed
by Reuters.
Although Globex has achieved disappointing volume, relying mainly on
after-hours trading the Matif French futures exchange, it does command an
impressive grouping of bond contracts.
Since Liffe decided not to join the system, mainly because of concerns about
restrictions on other commercial links, and the CBoT, one of the original
backers of the project, pulled out earlier this year, Globex has attracted
Germany's Deutsche Terminborse to join the Matif and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The Matif and the DTB have agreed to link their day-time trading.
The CBoT has an agreement in principle with Bloomberg which would give users
with Bloomberg terminals access to its products.
The growing number of strategic alliances between futures exchanges has
raised the stakes for Liffe and the CBoT - both have a number of failed
efforts behind them. But the technical feasibility still has to be explored.
It involves linking two after-hours systems, Liffe's APT and the CBoT's
Project A, which have certain similarities - both are open workstation-based
systems - but some important differences.
Users would have to be trained on both systems, which could be accessed on
the same workstation, but through different windows. The APT system
replicates trading in the futures pits, while Project A is a trade-matching
system.
'We are optimistic that it can be done,' said Mr Phil Bruce, director of
strategic business development at Liffe. He hopes the technical study will
be concluded by the end of this year, and a live system would be implemented
in 1995.
Unlike Globex, the agreement would allow each exchange to retain 'complete
control of its own contracts', according to the CBoT. Clearing would be
provided by the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation for CBoT contracts and
the London Clearing House for Liffe products.
While the Liffe/CBoT link and Globex are part of the same trend, the
potential rivalry between the two systems should not be exaggerated. For the
most part, they will trade different products. The only direct competition
would be for business in bund futures, and perhaps short-term German
interest rate futures, listed on both the DTB and Liffe.
Nevertheless, the move is not good news for Globex, which is left with a
smaller array of products than it might have hoped for, in a market which is
cynical about the scope for global trading.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries nosedive after Greenspan's
testimony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bond prices tumbled yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman told a
Senate committee that a further tightening of monetary policy was still 'an
open question'.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  27/32 lower
at 84 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.54 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/16 at 99 23/32 , to yield 5.998 per cent.
In early activity, bond prices showed modest declines as traders adjusted
their positions ahead of congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chief.
The initial erosion came after several strong sessions in which the market
had anticipated a signal from the central banker that an early move to
higher interest rates was unnecessary in view of a cooling economy.
Instead, Mr Greenspan was non-committal and bonds went into a tailspin as a
result. In his biannual Humphrey-Hawkins briefing, he said he was uncertain
whether the four increases in short-term rates sanctioned by the Fed so far
this year had been sufficient to dispel inflationary pressures in the
economy.
The central banker's comments left no doubt in the minds of bond traders
that the Fed may move to a tighter monetary policy in the run-up to the next
meeting of its policy-making arm on August 16.
That prospect overwhelmed a smattering of favourable economic data released
earlier in the morning.
The Commerce Department said housing starts last month had dropped 9.8 per
cent while building permits had fallen 3.0 per cent.
A welcome drop in commodity prices did not help as the development was
overshadowed by a fresh decline in the value of the dollar against other
leading currencies.
European government bonds ended a volatile session lower across the board.
Traders said the correction would test the durability of the recent rally,
which has seen 10-year bund yields move more than 50 basis points in two
weeks.
'We've had quite a powerful move, so I'm not surprised to see a bit of
profit-taking,' said a Franfurt bund dealer. He expected the retracement to
continue in the short-term, but did not expect prices to return to recent
lows.
Some traders said the largely technical correction could represent an
important test for bond markets.
'Will investors use these cheaper levels to put some cash to work? And will
those who participated in the early stages of the rally be comfortable
holding on to their positions?' asked Mr Stephen Dulake, international bond
strategist at Paine Webber.
German bonds underperformed many of their neighbours and fell by more than
half a point at the long end with DM7.7bn of new 10-year government bonds
weighing on prices. Although yesterday's DM4.7bn auction of the second
tranche of the new 6.75 per cent bund issue was deemed a success, traders
said most of it went on bank's books rather than into firm retail hands.
The Bundesbank's repo rate fell another three basis points to 4.88 per cent,
as expected, giving away little ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting.
Most market participants said they expected the central bank to leave key
lending rates unchanged.
French bonds tracked bunds lower as dealers took profits after the recent
days' sharp gains.
The French Treasury today is to auction FFr19bn-FFr21bn of new two- and
five-year Btans. According to one dealer, the possibility of another
10-basis-point cut in the Bank of France's intervention rate could underpin
the auction.
Weakness in other markets put pressure on UK gilts, triggering some
stop-loss selling in the futures market. Dealers said most of the activity
took place in the futures pits, and did not report strong selling by cash
investors.
'If anything, many investors would like to see the market work its way a bit
lower so they can buy more cheaply at next week's auction,' a dealer said.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) will
begin trading long gilt futures and options contracts a half hour earlier
starting August 1. The futures contract will open at 0700 GMT and the
options contract at 0702 GMT in line with the cash market.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Lukewarm reception for US bank's
Dollars 1bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) failed to set the international bond market
alight yesterday with the launch of its anticipated inaugural Dollars 1bn
offering of global bonds. The indicated price range on the two-year bonds
was 9 to 11 basis points over five-year Treasuries, in line with market
expectations.
Syndicate managers said although FHLB had worked hard to raise its profile
with investors outside the US, demand from Europe and Asia was muted and
they expected most of the bonds to flow back into the US. However, joint
lead managers Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley said placement was evenly
split between the regions.
The bonds are likely to be priced this afternoon to yield 10 basis points
over Treasuries. Yesterday's sudden sell-off in the US bond market was not
expected to hamper the deal, indeed a potential coupon of close on 6 1/8 per
cent as a result of the weakness was likely to attract more buyers.
With FHLB's deal out of the way, the calendar of new eurobond issues is
looking thin, though the European Community is expected to invite bids for
its seven-year Ecu300m issue early next week.
Syndicate managers welcomed the slowdown in new issues business which would
give the market time to digest the recent flood of supply.
Among yesterday's other offerings, General Electric Capital followed hard on
British Telecom's heels raising Pounds 100m through an offering of five-year
eurobonds, taking advantage of improved conditions in the sterling bond
market and the greater demand from European investors.
The bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 6 per cent UK
government bond (gilt) due 1999, which dulled their appeal to institutions
somewhat. Indeed, some syndicate managers said when compared with a gilt
with a more comparable maturity, the spread on the bonds was closer to 14
basis points.
However, European retail investors were strong buyers. The funds raised were
swapped to floating-rate sterling.
Nestle Holdings followed up on the success of its Dollars 200m eurobond
issue in June when it increased the three-year offering by a further Dollars
100m yesterday. Lead manager CS First Boston said the bonds were aimed
mainly at Swiss retail investors. The new tranche was priced to yield 5
basis points over the yield on the 6 1/2 per cent Treasury due 1997.
Given Nestle's high standing among investors, the spread is expected to
tighten further and eventually trade below Treasuries. Late yesterday, the
spread was unchanged.

half-year rise

<TEXT>
Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation, the 70 per cent state-owned
industrial and petrochemicals group, has reported a 57 per cent rise in
earnings for the first half to SR1.35bn (Dollars 360m), consolidating a
strong turnround in profits which began in the last quarter of 1993.
Sabic attributed the growth to a combination of improved world prices for
its products, which include petrochemicals, plastics, fertilisers and steel,
and a substantial rise in gross output as new projects came on stream.
Total second-quarter revenues were SR6.28bn against SR4.88bn for the
corresponding quarter last year, according to Mr Ibrahim Ibn Salameh,
Sabic's vice-chairman and managing director.
The group's gross output for the first six months reached 7.95m tonnes, a
rise of 36 per cent over 1993. Sabic said output was on target to reach
total capacity of 20m tonnes a year by the end of 1994.
Sabic is well into an ambitious expansion scheme which, at an estimated cost
by the end of this year of Dollars 4bn, will have seen expansion at 12 of
the holding company's 18 subsidiaries or affiliates.
The first-half turnround follows growth of about 10 per cent in earnings
during the last quarter of 1993 following falls in earnings in both 1991 and
1992 - largely attributed to soft world petrochemical prices.
Sabic, with total assets up 6 per cent at SR37.5bn, claims to command 5 per
cent of global petrochemical markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pohang Iron and Steel, South Korea's dominant steel company, yesterday
announced plans to expand its production capacity in an attempt to block the
Hyundai group from entering the steel sector.
The increase in Posco's annual production capacity by 5.9m tonnes to 28m
tonnes would cover any predicted shortfall in steel supplies in the next
decade and deprive Hyundai of its justification for starting the production
of cold-rolled coils.
The expansion of Posco's facilities would be completed by 1999 at a cost of
Won15,000bn (Dollars 18bn).
Hyundai this week announced its long-term plans to build, by the year 2001
at a cost of Won7,700bn, steel facilities to produce 9.3m tonnes a year.
The government and state-owned Posco oppose the move, saying that the
Hyundai facilities would result in a glut in steel supplies. However,
Hyundai believes South Korea will face a significant shortage of steel in
the next decade.
Posco fears that Hyundai's steel production would cause a price war.

Alcan Aluminium, of Canada, has sold its 73.3 per cent shareholding in Alcan
Australia via an international secondary offering worth USDollars 245m.
Alcan had already said that it planned to dispose of its controlling stake.
CS First Boston, the investment bankers and underwriter for the issue,
placed the Alcan Australia shares with institutional investors in Australia,
Europe, North America and Asia.
The placement totalled 130.8m shares at ADollars 2.55 (USDollars 1.87) a
share.
Meanwhile, Alcan Australia yesterday announced a return to the black for the
June half year in spite of major production cuts affecting the worldwide
aluminium industry.
The company turned a ADollars 2.9m loss into a ADollars 9.4m net profit in
the period on a marginal increase in sales revenue from ADollars 301.9m to
ADollars 307.5m.
The result followed a total tax provision of ADollars 7.5m, compared with
ADollars 8.4m previously, and interest expense of ADollars 5.4m, compared to
ADollars 6.6m.

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, announced strong
growth in sales and earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter. The results were
boosted by a surge in sales of personal computer operating systems programs.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.29bn, up 24 per cent over the
Dollars 1.04bn for the same period in 1993. Net income was Dollars 362m, or
59 cents a share (restated to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split
in May), compared with Dollars 265m, or 43 cents.
Income includes a Dollars 30m reversal of part of a third-quarter Dollars
120m charge, relating to a Los Angeles court order that Microsoft pay
damages to Stac Electronics for patent infringement. Last month, Microsoft
reached a settlement agreement with Stac. Net income for the fourth quarter
would have been Dollars 342m, or 56 cents, without the gain.
For the year, revenues were Dollars 4.65bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars
3.75bn in fiscal 1993. Net income rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.15bn from
Dollars 953m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.88, compared with Dollars
1.57 last year after the stock split.
Excluding the litigation charge and the settlement, net income for the year
was Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.98.
'We've completed our 19th consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth,'
said Mike Brown, vice-president of finance.
Microsoft's sales of operating systems programs to PC manufacturers reached
an all-time high, up 61 per cent over the preceding 12 months. Sales of
Windows, the widely used PC operating system, were particularly strong.
On Saturday, Microsoft settled anti-trust complaints by reaching an
agreement with the US Justice Department and European competition
authorities to modify the terms on which it sells operating system licences
to PC makers. It said the settlement would have no material impact on
earnings.

CS First Boston, the investment bankers and underwriter for the issue,
placed the Alcan Australia shares with institutional investors in Australia,
Europe, North America and Asia.
The placement totalled 130.8m shares at ADollars 2.55 (USDollars 1.87) a
share.
Alcan Australia employs 2,400 at seven plants and at distribution centres in
Australia and New Zealand. But it is the smallest of Australia's integrated
producers, with sales only one-third of rivals Alcoa Australia and Comalco.
Alcan Australia's primary capacity is 155,000 tonnes per year at its New
South Wales smelter against 400,000 tonnes each for its competitors.
Alcan Australia has a larger proportion of its business in downstream
activities. It represents 9 per cent of Alcan Aluminium's total world
primary metal capacity.
Alcan Aluminium retains its bauxite mining interests in Australia and a 21.4
per cent stake in Queensland Alumina. It will continue to supply alumina and
technology to the independent Alcan Australia and will market the latter's
primary metal in Asia.
Also, Alcan Australia will market Alcan products in Australia and New
Zealand using the Alcan name until the end of 1995.
The 26.7 per cent of Alcan Australia not under Canadian control has been
held by various Australian institutions.
Meanwhile, Alcan Australia yesterday announced a return to the black for the
June half despite major production cuts affecting the worldwide aluminium
industry.
The company turned a ADollars 2.9m loss into a ADollars 9.4m net profit in
the period on a marginal increase in sales revenue from ADollars 301.9m to
ADollars 307.5m.
Directors said the profit was 'still modest' and the company would not pay
an interim dividend.
The earnings improvement came despite a 10 per cent cut in primary aluminium
output, beginning this year, following an agreement among the world's major
aluminium producers to reduce oversupply.
The result followed total tax provision of ADollars 7.5m , compared to
ADollars 8.4m previously, and interest expense of ADollars 5.4m, compared to
ADollars 6.6m.

Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire, is to
spin off its China interests - which include property, hotel and
infrastructure projects - in a separate listing within the next three and a
half years.
To finance its China interests, which were recently brought together under
the umbrella of Cheung Kong Holdings (China), Cheung Kong plans to issue
USDollars 300m worth of five-year exchangeable floating-rate notes.
The notes, which will pay 50 basis points above the three-month US dollar
London interbank offered rate, may be redeemed for shares in Cheung Kong
(Holdings) China, once the initial public offer takes place, on an assured
allotment basis, or for cash.
Holders of the notes may convert them into shares within one year of the
IPO. After this, the notes become similar to a convertible note with an
initial conversion premium of 10 per cent. Investors are also being offered
a put option after three years, or on the first anniversary, enabling them
to redeem the notes for the principal amount plus accrued interest.
Cheung Kong (Holdings) China 's projects include 11 property developments,
five government-supported housing schemes and two hotels in Beijing and
Guangzhou.

<TEXT>
South African gold producer Gengold has posted a 16.9 per cent decline in
after-tax profit for the June quarter to R9.8m (Dollars 2.6m) from R11.8m in
the previous three months. The drop was largely due to lower productivity
and a higher tax rate which counteracted the effects of the improved gold
price.
Widespread election-related labour unrest across the group's mines, combined
with the large number of public holidays in the quarter, led to a 4 per cent
drop in tons milled to 2,602 from 2,711. This in turn caused overall gold
production to drop 3.9 per cent to 1,694kg from 1,763kg in the previous
quarter and is well down on the 1,839kg mined in the June quarter last year.
At the same time, overall taxation rose 30.6 per cent to R66.34m from
R50.81m, and the payment of a further R25.39m to cover the one-off, 5 per
cent transitional levy, announced in the June budget to help cover the cost
of the election, further dented the bottom line.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, admitted that labour unrest had been a
significant problem and was continuing, but said he expected the current
wave to subside gradually.
Mr Maude also noted that the group had now unwound all its forward hedging
with the exception of a small amount outstanding on the marginal Stilfontein
mine and so was poised to take full advantage of the improved spot gold
price in the next quarter.
Of the group's big mines Beatrix was least affected by the labour problems
and was able to use stockpiles to increase overall production slightly to
3,224kg from 3,220 in March. However, production at Kinross dropped from
3,030kg to 2,850kg while at Buffelsfontein it fell to 2,852 from 3,080kg.
Labour problems and the costs of the transitional levy also hit the gold
mines in the Anglovaal group as overall after-tax profit for the June
quarter fell to R45m from R70m. The total cost of the levy was R20.3m.
A combination of lower grade achieved and lower tonnage milled led
Hartebeestfontein, the group's flagship mine, to record a drop in after tax
profit to R40.2m, down from R62.6m in March. Gold production dipped to
6,550kg from 6,965kg.

Continued sluggish trading in Japan's equity markets is likely to force a
reorganisation of Japan's brokerage industry, an industry official said
yesterday.
Mr Sadakane Doi, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, told
a press conference that all brokers, including the Big Four - Nomura,
Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko - were facing 'extremely severe' conditions as
they approached the halfway point in the fiscal year at the end of
September. 'I think this could prompt mergers and acquisitions among
industry members,' he said.
Mr Doi also expressed concern about the entry into the securities market of
subsidiaries of banks, a development allowed under a programme of financial
deregulation.

further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cummins Engine, the US diesel engine manufacturer, yesterday announced a 37
per cent increase in second-quarter net earnings. It was helped by strong
demand in the US and signs that other economies were recovering.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 66.2m, or Dollars 1.58 a share,
compared to Dollars 48.2m, or Dollars 1.32, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
Sales to the heavy duty truck market totalled Dollars 354m, up from Dollars
336m a year ago. Sales in power generation were Dollars 268m, up from
Dollars 237m, which the company said reflected strong demand for industrial
generator sets.
Mr Jim Henderson, chief executive, said the company expected third-quarter
earnings would substantially exceed the same period of 1993.
For the six months, Cummins earned Dollars 120.8m, or Dollars 2.94 a share,
compared to Dollars 89.3m, or Dollars 2.44 a share in 1993.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier,
reported net profits of Dollars 153m for the second quarter, up from Dollars
47m last time. However, the company said they were far from satisfactory.
The latest figure included a favourable adjustment of Dollars 22m relating
to a change in the cost of redeeming frequent flier points, while the
previous year's net profit would have been Dollars 59m without adjustments
for unusual items.
AMR comprises three divisions: air transportation, the Sabre information
technology businesses, and management services. The biggest profit
improvement came from air transportation, which contributed Dollars 149m
before tax compared with a pre-tax loss of Dollars 6m last time.
Sabre increased its pre-tax contribution to Dollars 95m from Dollars 80m,
and management services reduced its pre-tax contribution to Dollars 4m from
Dollars 5m.
AMR's turnround from a loss of Dollars 7m in the first quarter was expected
because airlines make more money in the summer than in the winter. The
airline was also helped by reducing capacity on unprofitable routes.
The shrinkage resulted in a 7.8 per cent decline in the number of available
seat miles flown. Group revenues also fell, by 2.6 per cent to Dollars
4.1bn. But passenger load factor (the percentage of seats filled by
passengers) rose to 64.4 per cent from 61.5 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.68 from 39 cents fully diluted. Net
income for the first six months rose to Dollars 146m from Dollars 25m.

Tech
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Technologies, the diversified US technology group, yesterday reported
a 32 per cent increase in net income for the second quarter, helped by
higher operating profits at most of its divisions and an Dollars 87m pre-tax
gain from the sale of its interest in Westland, the UK aerospace business.
UTC made profits of Dollars 172m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with
Dollars 130m, or 89 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues
totalled Dollars 5.49bn, compared with Dollars 5.57bn.
The company took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 50m at its Pratt &amp; Whitney
aero-engine unit and one of Dollars 35m at its Hamilton Standard aerospace
business.
Pratt reported operating income of Dollars 103m before the charge compared
with Dollars 22m in the same period of last year. Revenues dipped to Dollars
1.48bn from Dollars 1.77bn.
The improved profits were attributed to higher commercial spare parts sales,
reduced research and development spending, and the sale of participation
interests in its PW4000 engine programme.
The flight systems segment, which includes the Sikorsky helicopter unit, had
operating income of Dollars 47m, down from Dollars 80m last year.
For the six months, UTC made Dollars 278m, or Dollars 1.98 a share, compared
with Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.38, in 1993.

<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, reported a fall in
net earnings to Dollars 138m from Dollars 170m in its second quarter.
However, the figure represented a 22 per increase from Dollars 113m if
unusual items were stripped out of the previous year's figure.
The improvement was achieved in spite of a downturn in revenues caused by
poor demand for commercial aircraft and reduced activity in the missiles,
space and electronic systems segment. Group turnover fell by 15 per cent to
Dollars 3.25bn.
By cutting costs, McDonnell Douglas was able to increase operating profits
to Dollars 259m from Dollars 234m last year, excluding unusual items.
Earnings per share were Dollars 3.50, compared with Dollars 4.33 last time,
or Dollars 2.87 without unusual items.
The most profitable segment was military aircraft, which saw an 11 per cent
increase in revenues.
Operating profits rose to Dollars 153m from Dollars 118m.
Commercial aircraft revenues fell more than 40 per cent due to declining
demand.
The company delivered eight MD-80 twin-jets and four MD-11 tri-jets in the
second quarter, against 13 MD-80s and 10 MD-11s in the same period last
year.
However, the division lifted operating profits to Dollars 24m from Dollars
12m.
The missiles, space and electronic systems segment saw a 33 per cent decline
in revenues because of the company's reduced role in the space station
programme and the winding down of the advanced cruise missile programme.
Operating profits fell to Dollars 80m from Dollars 99m.
Cashflow from aerospace operations remained strong, allowing the company to
cut debt by more than Dollars 300m in the first six months to Dollars 1.3bn
at June 30.
Net income for the first six months was Dollars 272m, compared with Dollars
207m before unusual items and Dollars 386m after them.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pfizer warns profits may not
match analysts' hopes - Prescription sales boost results of US drugs groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A warning from Pfizer that this year's profits would fail to match many
analysts' estimates clouded what was otherwise a moderately positive set of
second-quarter figures yesterday from some of the leading US drugs groups.
All the companies reporting yesterday showed double-digit gains in sales of
prescription drugs in the US, with overseas sales growth generally lower due
to regulation on prices in Europe and a weaker dollar.
The US gains mainly stemmed from new products and reflected higher volumes,
with prices remaining under pressure.
Mr Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chief financial officer, warned that the
company's earnings per share for 1994 would come 'toward the bottom' of the
range of market expecta-tions, which stand at Dollars 4.10 to Dollars 4.25.
The warning follows the issue of a new patent in the US to Bayer, the German
pharmaceuticals group, which will require Pfizer to pay higher royalties on
its biggest-selling product, the cardiovascular drug Procardia XL.
Pfizer said the effect was to reduce pre-tax profits by Dollars 18m in the
second quarter, with the full-year cost put at Dollars 36m. These figures
represent the company's expected higher royalty payments to Bayer, offset
partly by lower royalties it will have to pay to its US partner, Alza, on
the drug.
Sales of Procardia XL also dropped 9 per cent during the quarter from a year
before, though the company blamed this mainly on short-term inventory
adjustments by wholesalers.
Despite this, sales during the period were 10 per cent higher than the year
before, driven by a 16 per cent increase in US pharmaceuticals sales. The
growth was driven by a range of new products, with sales of four - Zoloft,
Zithromax, Norvasc and Cardura - growing in aggregate by 59 per cent to
account for a third of total drug sales in the period.
Merck, the US's biggest drugs group, recorded a 10 per cent growth in sales
of human and animal health products from a year before. Adding in sales of
Medco Containment Services, the drugs distributor it acquired last year,
sales growth was 18 per cent.
The company's after-tax profits grew at the slower rate of 10 per cent,
though, due to the lower margins on Medco's business compared to Merck's
traditional operations.
Mr Raymond Gilmartin, who recently took over as Merck's chief executive and
will become chairman in November, said the company had seen 'strong unit
volume gains' during the period.
Sales of Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering agent, fell on competition from
rival products, along with a group of other longer-established products.
This was countered by volume gains for a range of newer drugs, the company
said.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's sales growth during the quarter was driven by a 12
per cent increase in drugs sales, with Capoten, its largest-selling product,
advancing by 7 per cent despite increasing competition.
Consumer product sales, meanwhile, grew by only 1 per cent, while
nutritional product revenues fell 1 per cent.
The company also warned it could face an additional charge to profits
stemming from breast implant claims against it. The charge could arise due
to the number of women who have opted out of an global industry-wide
settlement reached in March, requiring the company to settle claims
individually.
Bristol-Myers said it did not yet know what the claims would be, but added
it 'could have a material impact on the company's results for the year'.
Bristol-Myers, like other drugs groups with manufacturing operations in
Puerto Rico, also reported a higher tax charge due to the phasing-out of tax
allowances in the US. This had pushed the effective income tax rate up to
nearly 30 per cent from 26 per cent a year before, it said.
A 26 per cent increase in US drugs sales, to Dollars 541m, was the main
factor behind sales growth of 10.6 per cent at Johnson &amp; Johnson during the
second quarter.
Total drugs sales grew by 17 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn, while sales of
consumer products rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.27bn and professional
products increased 8 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn.
US pharmaceuticals sales growth was led by two new products, Risperdal, a
treatment for schizophrenia, and Propulsid, a gastro-intestinal drug, said
Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive.
Schering-Plough also benefitted from stronger US prescription drugs sales,
with revenues from Claritin, an antihistamine, topping quarterly sales of
Dollars 100m for the first time.

<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second largest US long distance telecommunications
company, yesterday reported a 43 per cent increase in second quarter net
income, helped by growth in the consumer, business and global markets.
MCI, in which British Telecommunications will buy a 20 per cent stake when
regulators have approved the purchase, reported net income of Dollars 215m,
or 37 cents a share, compared with Dollars 150m, or 27 cents, in the same
period of last year.
The 1993 figures included a charge of Dollars 28m, or 5 cents a share, for
the early retirement of debt.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3.31bn, up 13 per cent on the second quarter of
last year, while year-on-year traffic grew 14.4 per cent, substantially
higher than the industry average.
The figures were slightly ahead of the consensus Wall Street forecast, which
was pitched around 36 cents a share.
They confirmed both the strong growth of the long-distance market amid US
economic recovery, and MCI's above-average momentum, due to strong marketing
and innovative products.
Sprint, the third largest long distance carrier, also reported good results
on Tuesday, with its long-distance unit reporting a 30 per cent increase in
operating income, to Dollars 158m.
Mr Gerald Taylor, MCI president, said the company continued to gain new
customers across the board.
He added that other factors behind the leap in profits were its ability to
capitalise on early opportunities in select markets and deliver services
faster and more cost-efficiently.
For the six months, the group reported net income of Dollars 424m, or 73
cents a share, compared with Dollars 301m, or 55 cents, in the first half of
1993.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Smith Barney earnings fall 45%
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith Barney, the securities company owned by Travelers, the US financial
services group, posted a 45 per cent fall in earnings in the three months to
the end of June compared with the previous quarter.
The company blamed the fall on lower trading volumes and difficult financial
markets, echoing other financial firms which have reported figures in recent
days.
Smith Barney's net income of Dollars 79m, on revenues of Dollars 1.28bn,
compared with Dollars 144m, on revenues of Dollars 1.45bn, in the previous
period.
Comparisons with a year ago are not relevant since Smith Barney absorbed the
retail broking arm of Shearson Lehman in the second half of last year.
The profit decline, which left Smith Barney with return on equity of 14.2
per cent for the period, was behind a fall in profits at Travelers compared
with the previous period.
The financial services group, which changed its name from Primerica after
acquiring the Travelers insurance company, at the start of this year, posted
net income of Dollars 320m, or 93 cents a share, and six-month net income of
Dollars 660m, or Dollars 1.89.
Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive, said the group results
showed that its diverse businesses made it able to 'withstand the volatility
of the securities business'.
Net income at most of Travelers' businesses equalled or exceeded the
previous period, with consumer finance contributing Dollars 55m, Primerica
Financial Services Dollars 52m, the Travelers life and annuities business
Dollars 50m, managed care and employee benefits Dollars 34m, and
property-casualty insurance Dollars 80m.

Allstate, the US insurance group whose first-quarter results were hit by the
Los Angeles earthquake in January, yesterday announced record second-quarter
net income of Dollars 402m, up from Dollars 396.7m in the same period of
1993.
The strong earnings represented a sharp rebound from the Dollars 275.2m loss
in the first three months of the year.
Net income on a per share basis was 89 cents in the quarter, down on the 94
cents a share income in the same period of 1993 due to an increase in the
number of shares outstanding.
For the first six months, Allstate earned Dollars 126.8m, or 28 cents a
share, down sharply from the Dollars 716.8m, or Dollars 1.70, in the first
half of 1993.
The decline was attributed to the cost of meeting more than Dollars 1bn of
claims from the Los Angeles earthquake and the severe winter storms which
hit large areas of the east coast in January and February.
Property and liability operations reported net income of Dollars 355.1m,
slightly lower than a year earlier because of higher catastrophe losses, but
still strong thanks to favourable trends in vehicle claims and expense
reductions. Life insurance operations reported a modest increase in net
income to Dollars 56.9m.
Allstate shares rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 7/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday.
ITT, the US conglomerate with significant insurance operations, yesterday
reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 258m, or Dollars 1.97 a share,
down from Dollars 267m, or Dollars 2.02, a year earlier.
Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said all three of the group's largest business
areas - financial services, manufactured products and hotels - registered
impressive sales growth in the quarter.

<TEXT>
Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, has reported a
36 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, blaming product delays and the
reorganisation of its sales force.
Net earnings from operations for the quarter were Dollars 9.7m, or 20 cents
a share, down from Dollars 15.2m, or 35 cents, last year. Revenues were down
5 per cent at Dollars 224m.
In last year's second quarter, Lotus took a Dollars 19.9m charge related to
the acquisition of Approach Software. After the charge, the company reported
a net loss of Dollars 4.6m, or 11 cents a share.
'Product delays, cyclical competitive pressures, the reorganisation of our
US sales force and the transition to a new worldwide channel sales programme
contributed to our disappointing performance,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president
and chief executive.
Lotus failed to release several new products on schedule. It is also under
intense competitive pressure from Microsoft, the largest PC software
company, analysts said. Although Lotus sales of communications software are
growing, it is still heavily dependent upon market segments in which it is
being overtaken by competitors.
Lotus's communications products include Notes, a tool for sharing
information and collaborating across computer networks, and cc:Mail, the
best-selling e-mail program.
'Based on the expected shipment of the delayed products during the next
several weeks and continued momentum in our communications business, we
expect to see improved revenue growth in the second half of the year,' said
Mr Ed Gillis, chief financial officer.
For the half year, net income from operations was up 13 per cent to Dollars
31.1m, or 64 cents a share, on revenues 2 per cent higher at Dollars 471m.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Stores side helps boost net at
Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stronger results from its revamped stores helped Sears Roebuck, the US
retailing and insurance group, improve underlying net profits by almost 10
per cent, to Dollars 503.4m, in the second quarter.
Operating profits in the stores division shot up by 23 per cent, to Dollars
199.3m from Dollars 162.5m, driven by an 11 per cent increase in sales to
Dollars 7.6bn from Dollars 6.85bn.
Under the leadership of Mr Arthur Martinez, chief executive since 1992,
Sears Roebuck is well-advanced on a store remodelling programme aimed at
making the merchandise, and the stores themselves, more attractive to
customers.
The company said cost-reduction programmes initiated over the last year had
also helped the retailing results. Selling and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues fell to 26.6 per cent from 26.8 per cent. However,
the improvement was offset by the costs of an extensive advertising
campaign, leaving the gross margin unchanged at 28.9 per cent.
The international stores, Sears Mexico and Sears Canada, slashed their
losses to Dollars 800,000 from Dollars 5.2m last time.
Gains on the retailing side were partly offset by a fall in the contribution
from Allstate, the insurance company of which Sears Roebuck owns 80.1 per
cent. Net income after minority interests fell to Dollars 322.1m from
Dollars 371.8m, largely because of higher catastrophe losses.
Revenues for the group as a whole rose 7 per cent to Dollars 13.01bn. Net
income of Dollars 503.4m appeared to represent a decline from last time's
Dollars 1.09bn, but the year-ago figure included a Dollars 635.1m gain from
the sale of a minority interest in Allstate. On a like-for-like basis,
earnings per share on continuing operations rose to Dollars 1.27 from
Dollars 1.19.
For the first six months, net income on continuing operations fell from
Dollars 775.5m to Dollars 405.5m.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: USAir faces heavy loss despite
improved quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the struggling US carrier in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per
cent stake, yesterday reported a small increase in net profits, to Dollars
13.8m from Dollars 5.8m, in its second quarter. However, it still looks set
to end the year with heavy losses.
The company operates mainly in the north-east of the US, where it faces
tough competition from Continental Airlines, Southwest Airlines and other
low-cost carriers making inroads to its markets. Earlier this year, it had
to slash fares to win back passengers.
Yesterday USAir said its low-fare strategy had been vindicated, because the
increase in passenger numbers had more than outweighed the effect of lower
fares. Total revenues rose by 3.5 per cent, to Dollars 1.72bn from Dollars
1.69bn.
The airline also said its attempts to increase productivity had succeeded in
cutting operating costs per available seat mile - the standard industry
measure of unit costs - from 11.12 cents to 10.87 cents.
However, the second quarter is traditionally USAir's best because of
seasonal factors, and it acknowledged that its cost levels were still far
too high to enable it show a profit for the year as whole. In the first
quarter, the airline lost Dollars 196.7m, and warned that its full-year
losses would be even worse than last year's Dollars 349m.
British Airways has invested nearly Dollars 400m in USAir, and was due to
invest another Dollars 450m between now and 1988. However, in March it
announced it would not commit any more funds to the US airline until it
improved its financial performance.
Last month, USAir announced it would seek to take Dollars 1bn a year out of
operating costs by 1996 through a combination of efficiency improvements and
cuts in labour costs. However, it has yet to reach an agreement with its
unions about how the labour savings are to be achieved.
USAir has indicated it has enough cash to take it into next year. However,
it is six years since the airline made a profit, and it is widely regarded
by industry analysts as one of the two large US airlines least likely to
survive another wave of bankruptcies. The other is Trans World Airlines.
After preferred dividends, losses per share were 0.9 cents compared with 23
cents last time. For the first six months, net losses rose from Dollars
55.2m to Dollars 182.8m, excluding the effect of accounting changes.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at BankAmerica advanced 8 per cent in the three months to
the end of June, as the fortunes of the San Francisco-based bank continued
to reflect the Californian economy's slow emergence from recession.
Net interest income fell by Dollars 20m to Dollars 1.83bn, as an increase in
loans failed to offset a fall in the bank's net interest margin to 4.49 per
cent from 4.72 per cent. However, provision for credit losses during the
period, at Dollars 125m, was Dollars 102m lower than last time.
Non-interest income, meanwhile, dropped by Dollars 40m to Dollars 1.02m. In
line with other banks and securities houses which have reported results in
recent days, BankAmerica's trading income was affected by the turbulent
financial markets. It fell to Dollars 106m in the latest period from Dollars
172m a year ago. On Tuesday, Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest securities
house, reported net earnings of Dollars 252m, 27 per cent below the Dollars
345m of a year before.
BankAmerica's fees from a number of products - including deposit accounts,
credit cards and trust work - also fell during the period. Higher fees,
particularly from retail customers, have been one of the main methods by
which US banks have increased their non-interest revenues in recent years.
BankAmerica's income, however, was bolstered by a Dollars 65m increase in
other sources of non-interest income, mainly the disposal of assets it had
previously earmarked for sale.
Net income for the three months was Dollars 525m, or Dollars 1.32 per
fully-diluted share, up from Dollars 488m, or Dollars 1.19, the year before.
For the first half as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars
2.58 a share, from Dollars 972m, or Dollars 2.38.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fall of the Springer old guard -
The shake-up was dramatic. Did it come too late?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Axel Springer, who in 1946 founded what was to become one of Germany's
largest publishing and newspaper houses, never had any doubts about what
editorial line his papers should take, and what they stood for.
Mr Springer, born in 1912, was a staunch defender of the reunification of
Germany; he was virulently anti-communist; he sought reconciliation between
Germans and Jews; and he was an ardent advocate of the market economy. The
decision to locate Springer's tall office block at Check Point Charlie, the
main crossing point for the divided Berlin, and to ensure it could be seen
by east Berliners, confirmed these principles.
However, he never lived to see the collapse of the Berlin Wall. He died in
1985.
The Springer group's troubles started after German reunification, which
coincided with the rapid expansion of the electronic media. The group, whose
reputation was based on its three big dailies - Die Welt, Bild, and Berliner
Morgenpost - were slow to adapt to a united Germany and the changing tastes
of consumers.
'Springer was just too slow in getting into the electronic media,' said Ms
Ute Wolf, media analyst at Deutsche Bank Research. 'They were also slow in
cost-cutting.' In fact, it wasn't until two years ago that the board finally
undertook to shed 800 of its 12,000 workforce, revamp Die Welt, and move the
paper's headquarters to Berlin.
However, the main stumbling block facing Springer was the lack of strategy,
caused largely by uncertainty on the board itself. Over the past year,
shareholders have been asked to accept no continuity in the leadership of
the group.
When Mr Gunter Wille, the chairman, died in November 1993, aged 65, he was
succeeded by Mr Gunter Prinz, 64. Then last April, it was announced that Mr
Horst Keiser, 58, would take over at yesterday's annual general meeting. He
would remain in the job for only for a short time, an then be replaced by Mr
Jurgen Richter, 52.
Yesterday's decision by the supervisory board to end the uncertainty by
promoting Mr Richter as chairman was welcomed by shareholders and analysts.
'This is a positive development,' said Mr Michael Geiger, media analyst at
NatWest Securities in London. 'Now it can work on its strategy.'
The question is who organised the 'coup' against the old guard, and what
does Mr Richter want to do with the Springer group, which is almost certain
to leave behind the traditions of Axel?
Dissatisfaction over the lack of continuity was apparent for some time,
particularly within the Springer family, which holds a 50 per cent stake.
Three of the heirs to the Springer group earlier this year published a
letter in Die Zeit weekly criticising Mr Bernhard Servatius, chairman of the
supervisory board, for what they saw as a confused strategy and the slow
implementation of decisions.
Staff at Springer yesterday said the heirs had the support of Mr Leo Kirch,
the media magnate who holds a 35 per cent stake and who, since 1956, has
built up a a vast media empire spanning film, television, print and
interests in eastern Europe. For his part, Mr Servatius supported Mrs Friede
Springer, Axel Springer's widow, who is on the supervisory board.
The internal divisions in the family and supervisory board were expected to
be papered over at yesterday's AGM. 'But suddenly, three days ago, the
supervisory board held a special meeting. They decided to replace the old
guard. They informed the management board. And that was that,' a Springer
staff member said.
Mr Richter, apparently backed by Mr Kirch, now intends to proceed with the
following strategy:
the management board will be reduced from seven to six members;
intermediate layers of decision-making will be scrapped, with the aim of
giving board members more direct responsibility for marketing and
distribution; younger staff from within the group will be promoted, to
improve morale and keep them from going outside the company. Yesterday, Mr
Klaus Leisner, 59, was dropped from the board and replaced by Mr Falk
Ettwein, 52, who will be responsible for finance. Meanwhile, Mr Rudolf
Knepper, 49, replaces Mr Hans-Joachim Marx, 63, as head of production.
Springer will also focus more on the electronic media, and look at how best
to cut the losses in its television magazines, which have not yet found
their audience, and cut Die Welt's annual losses, which exceed DM70m
(Dollars 45m).
Analysts and staff believe Mr Kirch has played a role both in the strategy
and the 'coup'. 'After all, he would like to increase his stake to 50 per
cent,' an analyst said, and this depended on whether the Springer family was
prepared to increase his stake.
Already, Mr Kirch and Springer are working closely on Sat 1, the independent
television network in which the former holds a 20 per cent stake, and the
latter, 40 per cent.
'The possibility of Kirch holding a majority stake in Sat 1 through Springer
cannot be ruled out, but it would be criticised, if not prevented, by the
authorities. We all think of Berlusconi,' another Springer staff member
said.
Whatever the outcome, yesterday's quiet revolution in Springer represents
just one of the biggest shake-ups in the German media. It also represents
the end of an era in a publishing house which prided itself on castigating
the communists and upholding conservative traditions at any opportunity.

Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance company scheduled for
privatisation in autumn, yesterday confirmed it was considering the sale of
its 43 per cent stake in Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the
specialist banking group.
AGF also verified that it was in talks with Credit Lyonnais, the troubled
French banking group that owns 24 per cent of BFCE, over the proposed
disposal. However, AGF and Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on
speculation that they were considering selling their holdings together as a
controlling stake.
The disposal of their combined holdings, a majority stake of 67 per cent
with an estimated value of FFr2.8bn (Dollars 534m), would in theory raise
more money than the separate sales of the individual stakes, given that a
potential purchaser could be expected to pay a premium for control of BFCE.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Taking a leaf from the car industry's book
 -A look at Aerostructures Hamble's new approach to making aircraft parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1930s the slipway at Aerostructures Hamble was used to launch
seaplanes; in the 1990s it is being used to dispatch the cargo door of a
single transport plane.
The door, built for the cargo aircraft used to ferry sections of Airbus
airliners to Toulouse for final assembly, measures 8 metres by 8 metres by 8
metres and weighs 2.5 tonnes. That is far too big to take down the lane
through Hamble without removing power lines and other obstacles.
The Hampshire-based aircraft components maker completed the first of four
doors late last year, 18 months after the initial order. It was taken down
Southampton Water by barge, across the Channel and floated up the Dordogne
river.
The people in 30 villages en route to the final destination of Toulouse were
not so lucky as the Hamble villagers. They had to take down their Christmas
decorations to let the load past.
Work on the next cargo door has started on the enormous and robust jigs
built specially for the job.
Mr Howard Wyman, operations director, believes the speed of execution of the
order and its delivery on time - 'totally foreign to the aircraft industry'
 -reflects the company's fresh approach to managing an aircraft component
manufacturer.
It is working hard to introduce Japanese techniques devised by car
manufacturers, and stressed these new capabilities when it was floated on
the stock market in May.
The company's history began, however, in 1936 and reflects the many changes
undergone by the British aerospace industry. As Folland it made the Midge
and Gnat aircraft. Hawker Siddeley took it over in 1963; the aircraft
manufacturing side was nationalised as part of the British Aircraft
Corporation, which was privatised in 1979.
It became Aerostructures Hamble in 1989, when British Aerospace decided to
make it more accountable as a profit centre. Mr Andy Barr, chief executive,
joined from Rover Group and led a Pounds 46.7m management buy-out in 1990.
There are now 10 senior managers, including Mr Barr and Mr Wyman, who have
come from Rover, where Japanese management techniques were the norm.
'You have got to get it right first time, like the Japanese carmakers do,'
said Mr Wyman. He believes that if the introduction of a product is correct,
everything will run smoothly, whereas a false start will turn everything
into an uphill battle.
A tour of the factories shows the group's continuing investment in new
equipment, including riveting machinery, a large press, machine tools, and a
world class aluminium finishing plant.
'We are upgrading our equipment,' said Mr Barr in his office - a beautifully
proportioned room with a high ceiling, decorated with birds and flowers, in
a listed 1750s house guaranteed to impress potential customers. 'But that's
not very relevant to what we are doing.'
The company is also concentrating on statistical process control, known as
SPC, which sets narrow parameters within which a component must fall. Under
old methods, a part would be made and then measured to see if it fitted. But
with SPC and computer technology 'you know it's going to come out right',
explained Mr Wyman.
In order to get things right first time, the group approaches each new
project through a multidisciplinary team with a manager who becomes the main
contact with the customer. People are seconded from other parts of the 1,500
workforce, which has been divided into 12 'cells'.
The manager sticks with the team right through the project, from the initial
bid to the finished project.
While some of the team members might change, there is a consistent thread
running through a project from initial conception to final delivery. 'The
whole idea is to get a seamless process,' said Mr Wyman, in contrast with
the old methods of passing a project from one department to another.
The team's brief is to come up with a product which can be made repeatedly
to tight quality and budgetary parameters. The process includes a
presentation to the shop floor and a preliminary design review that can also
involve the customer. 'We want the considerable wisdom of the company
involved in a project,' said Mr Wyman,
For a high technology industry the method of showing progress with work in
hand is very old - coloured pins and charts on a large board. A mass of blue
pins clearly illustrates that things are going well.
Daily quality control meetings, detailed analysis of rejected goods, and a
suggestions scheme in which 55 per cent of the staff have taken part, have
all been introduced in the past few years. The group is also working towards
scrapping its aluminium store, and relying on just in time delivery to
specific parts of the factory.
Perhaps more novel is the logical reorganisation of the stock room, so that
parts needed for a particular job are kept side by side on the shelves.
'Kitting' has been introduced, through which parts are dispatched to a
customer in a carefully laid out package. Any part missing is immediately
visible - a simple innovation that has revolutionised the traceability of
orders and saved hours of argument.
The company claims nothing new in its management strategy, but it does claim
its methods are new in the aircraft components industry. Mr Wyman gives the
example of hourly reports - second nature to the car industry - which were
introduced in the detail machine shop and doubled output in two weeks.
In the past three years margins have increased from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per
cent. The company's reliance on its former owner, BAe, which accounted for
93 per cent of its business in 1990 and 78 per cent last year, is expected
to fall further this year.
It has been successful in getting new orders and now has an impressive blue

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Eve static following interest income
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eve Group, the USM-quoted civil engineering group, blamed sluggish trading
conditions in the construction industry for a flat performance in the year
to March 31.
Pre-tax profits fell slightly from Pounds 4.15m to Pounds 3.9m despite a 16
per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 53m).
Mr Peter Adams, finance director, said the decline was exacerbated by a
sharp fall in interest earned on the group's deposit funds, which fell from
Pounds 487,000 to Pounds 181,000.
Although operating profits were virtually unchanged at Pounds 3.68m (Pounds
3.66m), he claimed it was 'a creditable performance given the battering the
industry has taken during the recession'.
The shares, however, fell 25p to 383p.
Gross margins declined from 8.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent and profits in
contracting - the largest of the company's three business sectors - fell
from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 3.65m.
Mr Graham Foster, managing director, hinted that the results would have been
worse had it not been for increased orders in the transmission division,
which designs and manufactures overhead power line systems and communication
towers. It had won a number of contracts for the National Grid network and
had opportunities to win orders in France and Italy, he added.
Mr Foster also hailed an improved contribution from Trakway, the portable
road and walkway division, which increased profits from Pounds 1.21m to
Pounds 1.34m.
Losses in the property development division, meanwhile, were cut from Pounds
576,000 to Pounds 390,000 although the company warned that activity remained
subdued.
Earnings per share fell from 27.4p to 25.4p.
While expressing disappointment at the pace of recovery in the construction
industry, Mr Foster said the company was confident enough about future
prospects to recommend an increased final dividend of 8p, making a total of
11p (10p) for the year.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Second-quarter drop for First Maryland
Bancorp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First Maryland Bancorp, the wholly owned US subsidiary of Allied Irish
Banks, reported net income down 10 per cent from Dollars 31m to Dollars 28m
(Pounds 18.4m) for the second quarter of 1994. For the half year, net income
was Dollars 54.1m, against Dollars 59.5m.
Net interest income in the three months was down by Dollars 2.3m because of
a lower net interest margin while non-interest income declined by Dollars
9.4m, mainly reflecting a lower level of realised securities gains. However,
there was a Dollars 5.7m reduction in provision for bad debts.
Return on assets for the six months fell from 1.29 per cent to 1.13 per
cent. At June 30 non-performing loans of Dollars 83.6m represented 1.59 per
cent of total loans.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Colefax consolidates recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steadily improving conditions in the UK and the US helped Colefax &amp; Fowler
Group to consolidate on the return to profit shown at the interim stage.
During the 12 months to April 30, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics
manufacturer swung from losses of Pounds 396,000 to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 331,000, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 211,000
following the disposal of a freehold warehouse in New Jersey. The group had
returned to the black at half way with a modest profit of Pounds 50,000
(losses of Pounds 192,000).
Overall sales rose 22 per cent, from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 35.2m.
Turnover in the product division rose by 10 per cent. Trade sales expanded
by 15 per cent in the UK, by 25 per cent in Europe and by 48 per cent in the
rest of the world, excluding the US. Retail sales, however, remained
difficult and dipped by 10 per cent.
Turnover in the US showed an 8 per cent increase in dollar terms - the first
material growth since 1991, according to Mr David Green, chief executive,
reflecting a showroom refurbishment programme and slightly improved market
conditions.
The group's decorating division had had an 'exceptional year', Mr Green
said, with turnover ahead 75 per cent; this, in turn, had a beneficial
impact on antique sales which rose by 41 per cent.
Kingcome Sofas, the upholstered furniture operation, lifted turnover by 9
per cent following increased factory efficiencies and improved trade demand,
which is continuing into the current year, he said.
Gearing at the year end was 33 per cent (40 per cent).
Earnings emerged at 0.8p, against losses of 1.05p; the final dividend is
held at 0.5p for a maintained total of 1p.

FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Oceonics Group falls to Pounds
1.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oceonics Group, the Norfolk-based survey services group, reported a slide
into pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.28m in the year ended March 31.
There were profits of Pounds 1.61m last time, restated for FRS 3.
The company said the operating environment continued to worsen in the second
half, particularly in the North Sea.
It had also suffered a slowing in business in Nigeria since December because
of the political climate.
However, new orders had been won in South Africa, and a new base established
in Cape Town, directors said.
Current trading remained difficult and operating losses continued, they
added, although action had been taken to maintain overheads at an
appropriate level.
They looked forward to a better trading environment in 1995.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 30.7m) and operating losses
amounted to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 2.23m profits).
Losses per share emerged at 1.6p (0.2p earnings).
The second tranche of dividend arrears relating to the preference shares
redeemed last year is being delayed and the company is unable to pay the
convertible preference share dividend.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: David S Smith pleases market with 56% rise
 -Chairman forecasts strong year ahead as paper and packaging markets
recover across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in David S Smith Holdings jumped by 22p to 550p after the paper,
packaging and office supplies group pleased the market with
better-than-expected results and a confident trading statement.
Pre-tax profits jumped by 56 per cent to Pounds 42.2m in the year to April
30, while turnover rose by 51 per cent to Pounds 783m.
Both increases were mainly due to a nine-month contribution from Spicers,
the UK's largest wholesaler of office products, bought for Pounds 93.5m last
year.
Mr Alan Clements, chairman, said: 'After three years of cautious statements
it is pleasing to be able to be more upbeat . . . The trends in our markets
are favourable and I am confident that the group will perform strongly in
the year ahead.'
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said Spicers wholesaling in the UK had
turned in an excellent performance, producing operating profits of Pounds
15.8m on sales of Pounds 242.5m, and showing growth of 9.5 per cent in a
recovering market.
Spicers' UK and Irish manufacturing operations were adversely affected by
low market prices, but a gradual improvement was expected in the coming
year.
In packaging and paper, total sales were Pounds 540m, up 4.1 per cent.
Operating profit slipped to Pounds 37m, down 2.9 per cent from the previous
year, reflecting a fall in margins from 7.3 to 6.8 per cent.
The group said the markets for its products had improved recently as the
recovery spread across Europe, bringing reasonable growth in most areas.
Packaging paper markets staged a particularly robust recovery with good
growth in demand and significant price increases. However, papermaking
margins had not reflected the full benefit due to a rapid escalation in
waste paper prices.
Similarly, although the group's packaging operations were generally enjoying
better volumes, they were faced with the problem of passing on the cost of
large paper price increases to their customers.
Gearing fell from 57 per cent to 37 per cent. Earnings per share increased
by 17 per cent to 25.2p (21.6p). A final dividend of 8p gives a total of
10.75p (10p), an increase of 7.5 per cent.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Mosaic returns to the black
with Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mosaic Investments, the licensing and design, display products and
specialist packaging group, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1m for the year to April 30, writes Caroline Southey.
Last time there were losses of Pounds 14.8m, restated for FRS 3.
The company also announced the separate listing of Copyright Promotions
Group, its wholly owned subsidiary in which it will retain a 30 per cent
holding.
Mosaic's sales fell from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 21.4m, although turnover
from continuing operations rose marginally to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 20m).
Operating profits were Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 1.47m), including losses of
Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 460,000) from discontinued activities. The pre-tax
result last time was after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds
15.4m.
Mr David Williams, founder and chairman, who returned to Mosaic in February
after leaving in 1991 following boardroom disagreements, said the results
'demonstrated that Mosaic has returned to a position of financial
stability'.
He said the flotation of CPG was the beginning of his strategy to refocus
the company and shareholders should expect the process to continue.
Mosaic's shares were suspended between September 1992 and May 1993 because
it could not raise sufficient funds to redeem a preference share issue.
Mr Williams said the relisting had been achieved by the disposal of
lossmaking activities, the arrangement of new banking facilities to provide
adequate working capital and the settlement of obligations relating to
deferred consideration.
A further boost came from Montagu Private Equity Investments subscribing to
a preference share issue in February.
Earnings per share were 0.78p (91.42p losses). There is again no dividend.

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hollas restructuring starts to pay off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollas, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday
announced details of its restructuring programme aimed at transforming the
company into a broadly-based garment supplier.
The group, which acquired clothing companies JB Hunter and Textilion in
March following an Pounds 18.3m rights issue, said it was pursuing
'significant opportunities' among both high street retailers and industrial
customers.
The strategy follows the appointment last autumn of Mr Julian Lee as chief
executive, who yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 165,000 for the
year to March 31 against restated losses of Pounds 7.3m.
The 1993 figures were readjusted under FRS 3 to take account of Pounds 7.9m
of goodwill written off on the 1989 acquisition of Hawkshead, the 50 per
cent-owned mail order company.
Mr Lee said the small profit last year was due entirely to contributions by
Gardiner, the clothing import business.
Turnover, however, fell slightly from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 43.8m and Mr
Lee warned: 'This company would have been dead within three years if it had
remained an importer.'
Operating profits fell from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 756,000, although Mr Lee
said there would have been an increase had the company not made a Pounds
280,000 compensation payment to Mr Tony Lawson, who stepped down as chief
executive to become non-executive chairman.
In other management changes, Mr Roger Wallwork, finance director for more
than 20 years, has been replaced by Mr Paul Baddiley. Mr Jaymin Trivedi has
left the board to concentrate on Gardiner Trading, the group's Hong Kong
associate; and Mr Robert Jackson, a former director at Charterhouse Tilney,
has joined as director responsible for corporate development.
Although losses per share fell from a restated 12.28p to 0.12p, the final
dividend is cut to 0.3p, making 0.6p (1.2p) for the year.

It is being spun-off by Mosaic Investments, the mini-conglomerate. Mosaic
will receive Pounds 3m in cash raised from the placing and 3m shares worth
Pounds 3.6m at the placing price of 120p. The placing and offer is fully
underwritten by Charles Stanley, a small London broker.
A total of 3m new shares, out of a total of 10m, will be issued of which
half are subject to clawback by existing Mosaic shareholders on the basis of
one CPG share for every 29 Mosaic ordinary shares or 6.67 preference shares.
Mosaic will retain a 30 per cent shareholding. Four members of CPG's
management, including the company's co-founders Mr David Cardwell, chief
executive, and Mr Richard Cully, managing director, will hold a 40 per cent
stake.
Mr David Williams, Mosaic's chairman, will serve as a non-executive chairman
and Ms Sue Ball, Mosaic's finance director, has been appointed part-time
finance director.
Mr Cardwell said the listing would increase the profile of CPG and improve
its market position in the UK. CPG is also involved in advertising
consultancy and character costume manufacture.
Mr Williams said the underlying value of CPG was not fully reflected in
Mosaic's market capitalisation and the flotation would increase shareholder
value.
He added that CPG's performance had been overshadowed by difficulties at
Mosaic, which is engaged in licensing and design, display products and
specialist packaging.
Mosaic will set aside Pounds 1m of the Pounds 3m cash payment from CPG to
indemnify CPG against development costs incurred by ELG, its European joint
venture, and has also granted CPG a Pounds 750,000 two-year, interest-free
loan.
Character licensing generates more than 50 per cent of CPG's turnover. It
receives commission on gross royalty income by acting as the matchmaker
between character licensors and licensees such as manufacturers and
retailers like Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Mothercare, Burton and Pizza Hut.
Mr Cardwell said future earnings potential was underpinned by income from
long-standing 'classic characters' although it would be influenced by
revenue from new 'hot characters'.
The company expects income to be boosted in the coming year by royalties
from the Flintstones following this week's release of Steven Spielberg's
film of the famous American cartoon characters.
The company's costs were low, he said, with no stock and 75 employees.
In the year to April 30, CPG reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 567,000
(Pounds 212,000) on turnover of Pounds 4.95m (Pounds 4.07m).
Dealings in the shares are expected to begin on August 15.

however income was lower at Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 5.27m). Units sold fell by
3.3 per cent despite units offered rising by 13.3 per cent, resulting in
higher operating costs. Action has been taken and April saw an increase in
units sold.
Interest payable fell by Pounds 46,000 to Pounds 143,000.
Losses per share came out at 3.1p (earnings 1.81p) and the interim dividend

FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: McKay shares jump on sharp advance to
Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in McKay Securities rose 16p to 187p yesterday as the property
investor and developer reported doubled pre-tax profits for the year to
end-March.
The profits increase - up from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3m - was helped by a
reduced interest charge of Pounds 2.57m, against Pounds 3.89m, and benefited
from the absence of one-off charges - last year's figure included Pounds
686,000 of refinancing costs.
Gross rental income was marginally down from Pounds 8.96m to Pounds 8.39m as
were service charges, which amounted to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.88m). Income
from investment properties also fell, from Pounds 7m to Pounds 6.49m.
Comparatives were restated to comply with FRS 3.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.7p (4.2p) and a recommended final dividend
of 3.1p raises the total for the year to 5.2p (3.5p).

<TEXT>
Compaq Computer yesterday reported a 53 per cent jump in sales for the
second quarter as the US personal computer manufacturer continued to win
market share from competitors.
The company shipped a record number of computers in the quarter to reach
revenues of Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn) up from Dollars 1.63bn in the same
period of 1993. During the quarter it also introduced a record number of
products, ranging from high-performance notebook computers to servers for
computer networks.
Net income more than doubled to Dollars 210m, or 78 cents per share, from
Dollars 102m or 40 cents per share.
Compaq's results came one day ahead of IBM's. The industry leader is today
expected to unveil strong earnings for the quarter, in contrast to the heavy
losses sustained in the same period of 1993, when it took an Dollars 8.9bn
restructuring charge.
Analysts estimate that IBM's quarterly PC revenues grew by about 10 per
cent, suggesting it is losing ground to Compaq, which aims to overtake Apple
Computer and IBM to become the largest seller of PCs by 1996.
Compaq's figures were in line with Wall Street projections but the company's
stellar performance over the past year has heightened expectations and its
stock was trading at Dollars 32 in mid- session yesterday, down from
Tuesday's close of Dollars 33 1/4 .
'The growing worldwide acceptance of the Compaq brand has helped propel the
company to another record sales quarter,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer,
president and chief executive.
Calming investor concerns that PC market growth may be on the wane, Compaq
said it anticipated growing demand in the second half of the year. The
company is building new production lines to expand its operations worldwide.
Inventories stood at Dollars 2.24bn at the end of the second quarter, up
from Dollars 1.12bn at the end of 1993. Mr Daryl White, chief financial
officer, said this was in anticipation of strong demand, particularly in the
fourth quarter. 'Our inventory level, in terms of weeks of inventory, has
not increased from the second quarter of last year,' he added.
Compaq also announced partnerships aimed at new market segments. Compaq and
PictureTel, a video conferencing equipment company, have formed an alliance
for the design and manufacturer of PC-based 'personal conferencing'
products. Microsoft, the leading PC software company, has teamed up with
Compaq to develop video servers for interactive television applications.
Compaq has also announced a joint venture with Oracle to develop database
software for Compaq servers.
For the half year Compaq reported revenues of Dollars 4.8bn, up from Dollars
3.2bn in the first half of 1993. Net income more than doubled to Dollars
423m, against Dollars 204m, while earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.59
from 81 cents.

FT  21 JUL 94 / A breather for the funding laggards: A look at governments
struggling to finance their debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent bond market recovery has provided European governments with a
much needed opportunity to step up funding programmes that had become bogged
down in market turmoil and adverse yield movements.
Some governments - notably Germany - had cancelled auctions and fallen
behind with their funding programmes. Others had shifted funding to the less
volatile shorter maturities.
However, the improvement in sentiment eased the way this week for the German
government's first auction of 10-year bonds since September, raising DM10bn
(Pounds 4bn). Next week the UK will auction its first long-dated
conventional bond in six months. Since January, it has auctioned Pounds
10.5bn of 'exotic' instruments, such as convertible and floating-rate gilts
and shorter-dated bonds.
Altogether, the next four weeks are likely to see around Dollars 100bn
(Pounds 65.7bn) of new supply from the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK
and Italy, as well as substantial issuance in Spain and Sweden. Indeed, the
heavy supply may limit the scope of the bond market recovery, especially as
some countries are lagging in their funding schedules.
Even before yesterday's wobble, the sustainability of the recovery was being
questioned. Some analysts were dismissing it as little more than a technical
bounce and remained concerned about investor demand. 'Is this a genuine
rally or just a correction in the bear market?' asked Mr Kirit Shah,
international bond strategist at First Chicago in London. 'I think it is the
latter.'
The recent rally began with investors switching into German bonds out of US
assets. Then US bonds and the dollar staged a cautious recovery, calming
world markets. Moreover, encouraging German money supply data revived hopes
that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates again.
Some bond dealers have also reported a cautious return by traditional bond
investors, who had abstained during the sell-off but were tempted by the
sharp rise in yields to buy again from the start of the third quarter.
Others, however, attribute the recent gains mainly to futures buying by
players seeking short-term capital gains, and warn that more retail buying
is needed to underpin the recovery. 'At the moment, most of the buying is
futures driven, with some increased buying by hedge funds,' said Mr Shah.
'To cite an old truism: supply is never a problem when there's adequate
demand,' said Mr Jan Loeys, European fixed-income strategist at JP Morgan.
Governments will want to ensure that this year's supply goes into firm hands
after last year's borrowing bonanza turned sour. 'They issued like mad last
year, but half the investors absorbing that supply weren't permanent
investors - they were in it for the short term,' said Mr Loeys. Early this
year, many of them took their profits.
Reliance on foreign capital made some markets particularly vulnerable to the
bears. About 48 per cent of Sweden's 1993 net borrowing was financed by
overseas buying of government bonds or foreign currency borrowing, and heavy
foreign sales this year have taken their toll.
As a result, some governments have started targeting domestic investors to
ensure more secure homes for their debt. France plans to launch a programme
this autumn to encourage private investment in government bonds. And the
Spanish Treasury earlier this week said it would sell three-year fixed and
floating-rate paper to domestic insurance companies and banks on August 2.
But although supply is not causing serious difficulties now, it may well do
so later in the year, warns Mr George Magnus, chief international economist
at SG Warburg Securities.
Indeed, the worries which plagued investors earlier this year could easily
return. For one, economic growth - while helping to slim government budget
deficits through higher tax revenues - will fuel fears of inflation and
higher interest rates. Even if the Bundesbank continues to cut interest
rates, traders will be increasingly worried that each cut will be the last.
Further threats to European bonds could come from the US, where interest
rate increases are feared.
Political risks abound, too. Jitters could surface, for instance, ahead of
Sweden's elections in September and its referendum over EU membership in
November, and ahead of the French presidential elections in early 1995. In
Italy, Spain and Belgium, with their fragile coalition governments, the
threat of government crisis is never far from investors' minds.
A snapshot of European governments' remaining bond issuance for the year,
scaled to gross domestic product, shows that supply pressures remain the
largest in Italy and Spain, according to Mr Loeys.
While Italy is fairly up-to-date with this year's schedule, it has so far
failed to fund any of next year's massive redemptions as originally planned.
Meanwhile, Spain issued few long-dated bonds during the first half of the
year, relying heavily on short-term funding. Some 60 per cent of its
borrowing so far this year has been channelled through treasury bills which
will have to be refinanced within the next 12 months, implying more supply
later this year and especially in 1995.
Supply pressures are relatively low at present in Belgium, which is slightly
ahead in its issuance calendar. However, it, too, has been borrowing heavily
at the short end of the yield curve implying heavy refinancing volumes not
far down the road.
Countries borrowing at the short end make themselves vulnerable to rising
short-term rates, which increase the cost of servicing their debt.
The UK is doing fairly well after last year's substantial pre-funding, and
has few redemptions to refinance. The French authorities have stuck doggedly
to their monthly funding schedule throughout the bond market turbulence -
though as a result French bonds substantially underperformed their German
counterparts.
But after yesterday's bout of profit taking, the big question remains: will
investors absorb the waves of supply to come later this year?

FT  21 JUL 94 / Shake-up at German publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper group, has sacked four of the
seven board members, including Mr Horst Keiser, the chairman designate, in
one of the country's biggest ever management shake-ups.
The announcement, made to stunned shareholders at the annual meeting in
Berlin, follows months of criticism within the group and among the family
about Springer's strategy.
The Springer family holds 50 per cent of the group, which publishes Die
Welt, the loss-making daily, the mass-circulation Bild and the Berliner
Morgenpost. It also holds 20 per cent of the Sat-1 television station. The
Kirch Group, headed by Mr Leo Kirch, holds 35 per cent of Springer and 40
per cent of Sat-1.
Mr Bernhard Servatius, chairman of the supervisory board, said: 'Axel
Springer will attempt to meet the challenges of the markets with a
significantly changed board.' Springer last year had a turnover of DM3.4bn,
(Pounds 1.4bn), a fall of 1 per cent on the previous year, and profits of
DM71m, a rise of DM14.2m.
Mr Jurgen Richter, 52, was appointed chairman of the management board. He
will be flanked by three new members. Among those sacked are Mr Claus
Liesner, chief financial officer and Mr Hans-Joachim Marx, responsible for
technology.
The shake-up coincides with the rapid expansion of the electronic media,
involving new partnerships between Germany's biggest publishing groups and
foreign companies. These include the decision by Bertelsmann and News
Corporation, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, to take over Vox, the Cologne-based
television station which faced liquidation.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Former Burton finance director moves to Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, has appointed as its finance director Mr
Richard North, 44, who two weeks ago left Burton Group, the fashion
retailer, with a non-contractual bonus of 12 months' salary - close to
Pounds 250,000.
Bass said Mr North intended to fulfil a Pounds 60,000 contract to do 12
months' consultancy work for Burton, awarded when he left. But the contract
could be ended should pressures on his time prove too great. Bass declined
to disclose Mr North's new salary.
He takes over the role of finance director vacated by Mr Philip Bowman, 41,
who is being given operational experience as chairman and chief executive of
Bass Taverns, responsible for the group's 4,200 pubs and 120 Toby
restaurants.
Analysts welcomed Mr North's arrival, saying his strong retailing background
would benefit Bass, which also includes Holiday Inn hotels, Britvic soft
drinks, Coral betting shops, bingo and 10-pin bowling.
Mr North, hired by Burton in 1991 from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, left the retailer
because he said he had completed his task of sorting out the group's
problems as finance director. During his three-year stint, Mr North reduced
Burton's debts from Pounds 800m to Pounds 50m, and gearing from 100 per cent
to 6 per cent, through two rights issues, the sale of Harvey Nichols in
Knightsbridge for Pounds 60m, and other property deals.
Analysts said Mr North might emerge eventually as a possible candidate to
take over as chief executive if Mr Ian Prosser, 50, were to spilt his role
of chairman and chief executive.
However, the decision to give Mr North's predecessor operational
responsibility for Bass's biggest profit centre means that Mr Bowman - as
the youngest member of the Bass board - is even better placed, should his
new role prove a success. Profits from brewing are expected to increase only
slowly over the next few years, but pub retailing is thought to have
considerable potential for growth.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Merck-Celltech dealon asthma drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest corporate deal yet to be signed by a UK biotechnology company is
set to be announced today between Celltech and Merck, the biggest US drugs
manufacturer.
The two will collaborate on an asthma drug invented by Celltech. Codenamed
CDP840, it has been successful in early clinical trials. Merck will largely
pay for the much more expensive later rounds of trials.
The deal will bring Merck and Slough-based Celltech into direct competition
with Europe's biggest drugs company Glaxo, which has a deal with Icos, the
Seattle-based biotechnology company, to develop a similar drug.
It reinforces Merck's challenge in asthma, a sector worth at least Dollars
4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) a year and growing at 15 per cent annually. Glaxo
dominates with two drugs, Ventolin and Becotide. Other big-selling products
in the area are made by Astra, of Sweden, Fisons, of the UK, and Boehringer
Ingelheim, of Germany.
Merck has already signalled its intention to fight its way into the asthma
sector and has a drug of its own in the later stages of clinical trials
called MK-476. It would be launched a year or two before the Celltech
product and both could be on the market by the end of the decade.
For Celltech, the deal represents a vote of confidence in its product
pipeline, as well as bringing in cash. The drug belongs to a class,
phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors, which holds out the promise of a once-a-day
tablet to replace steroid inhalers.
Several other companies are working on similar drugs, including Icos/Glaxo.
Celltech claims that its drug is either further down the development route
than rivals or performs better in clinical trials even at high doses.
It has now completed phase I trials at Guy's Hospital, London, and Phase II
trials are scheduled to start in September.
Celltech has been in talks with at least eight companies on collaborating
over the asthma drug since it decided last autumn that it wanted a large
partner to shoulder the burden of running large-scale clinical trials.
It already has a collaborative deal with the German chemicals company Bayer
to develop a drug for treatment of septic shock.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Left MEPs put Santer presidency at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of Mr Jacques Santer as the next president of the European
Commission appeared on a knife-edge last night after the powerful Socialist
group in the European parliament voted overwhelmingly against his candidacy.
The Socialists' stand, supported by Green and Liberal MEPs, fuelled
uncertainty ahead of today's parliamentary vote on Mr Santer's candidacy.
The mood was heightened by a new assertiveness at this week's inaugural
session of the parliament.
Supporters of Mr Santer, the long-serving Luxembourg prime minister, seemed
confident of reaching the necessary simple majority of votes cast in the
567-strong parliament. But they conceded that his last-minute emergence as a
compromise candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Delors had irritated MEPs and
could provoke a large number of abstentions.
The failure of Mr Santer's candidacy would trigger a political crisis
between the member states and the parliament. Last night, Ms Pauline Green,
leader of the Socialist group and a British Labour party MEP, said MEPs were
unhappy at the lack of consultation by the member state governments, and the
UK veto of early favourite Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's premier.
She added that the parliament would shortly draw up a short-list of viable
candidates to succeed Mr Delors. 'We are voting against because of the
squalid nature in which the Santer candidacy came about,' she said.
Last night's Socialist group vote was 108 against the candidacy, 38 for, and
4 abstentions. Some 41 MEPs were absent. The Greek and Spanish delegations
reserved the right to vote according to their consciences, but were expected
to come under pressure today.
Mr Klaus Hansch, new president of the European Parliament, made clear in his
maiden speech that MEPs had the power to derail the Santer candidacy.
'Legally speaking this is only a consultation, but politically speaking any
candidate that does not receive majority support from this parliament will
fail.'

FT  21 JUL 94 / Companies hit by recruiting problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies experienced growing difficulties recruiting staff in the second
quarter of this year, providing a first indication that Britain's economic
recovery might be running into supply side constraints.
In an otherwise upbeat survey of nearly 8,000 UK manufacturing and service
companies, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce found that
recruitment difficulties were at their highest level since late 1990.
The chambers' findings, to be published today, follow official retail sales
and bank and building society lending figures yesterday which provided
further evidence that the economy was growing steadily and shrugging off
April's tax increases.
City economists suggested yesterday's news of a 1 per cent seasonally
adjusted increase in retail sales volumes between this year's first and
second quarters and a surprise Pounds 2.9bn increase in bank and building
society lending last month was consistent with bank base rates being held at
5.25 per cent for a few months yet. However, some predicted higher base
rates by the year's end.
Publication yesterday of the minutes of the June 8 meeting between Mr Eddie
George, Bank of England governor, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, showed
that the Bank was advocating a pre-emptive rise in interest rates if
stronger growth or increased costs threaten price stability in the years
ahead.
Data released yesterday suggested that British families and manufacturing
companies were developing an increased appetite for credit last month.
New mortgage lending by building societies rose sharply in June to reach its
highest level for almost two years.
Britain's nine biggest banking groups increased new consumer lending
substantially last month.
Manufacturers increased their borrowing from the banks by Pounds 162m in
June after several months of repaying debt.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Directors may be liable to fines by new watchdog: Financial
services sector faces stronger penalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual board members of financial services companies - including
non-executive directors - could be penalised for the regulatory failures of
the organisations they run under proposals being considered by the Personal
Investment Authority, the new financial watchdog.
The move would be possible if - as expected - the new regulator to protect
the private investor introduces a system of registering individuals as well
as companies in the retail financial services sector.
The PIA, which began operations this week, is hoping to launch a public
debate about the arrangements for disciplining the organisations it
regulates, probably later this year. This proposal is likely to be included
in the consultation exercise.
At first, individual registration was seen as enabling the regulator to
impose fines specifically on 'rogue' sales agents. But after an initial
discussion, the PIA board has commissioned further work from its staff on
how this system could be used to make individual directors more responsible.
This might mean, for example, that a finance director who failed to ensure
that enough resources were put into training or compliance could be fined by
the PIA.
While it is less likely that non-executives would receive individual
penalties, if there were cases where they had brushed aside concerns that
had been put to them, they too could fall foul of the watchdog.
The current arrangements for disciplining companies have concerned City
regulators, who believe that they mean fines imposed for serious rule
breaches have to keep rising in order to attract publicity, which acts as
the most significant deterrent.
The record penalty imposed by Lautro, the existing regulator for the life
insurance industry, has risen from Pounds 180,000 imposed on Legal &amp; General
in February to Pounds 300,000 imposed on Premium Life and Norwich Union in
April. So far this year, Lautro has fined 10 organisations a total of Pounds
1.77m.
If the rising trend continues, some regulators can foresee a point at which
ever-increasing penalties could reduce the returns available to investors.
They believe that penalising individual board members would end 'fine
inflation' while intensifying the deterrent effect.
Supporters of the idea accept it would put a greater burden of
responsibility on the PIA, since it would have a more direct impact on
individuals' careers.

FT  21 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle lines in global futures trading are being drawn. In one camp are
the Chicago Board of Trade and London's Liffe. Yesterday they agreed to
explore linking their electronic out-of-hours trading systems. In the other
camp is Globex - an alliance embracing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
Germany's DTB and France's Matif as well as Reuters, the financial
information group. The two groups have rather different visions. CBOT and
Liffe, reflecting their positions as the largest exchanges in their
respective time zones, understandably do not wish to lose control of their
futures contracts to rival exchanges. As a result, they favour loose
bilateral alliances. Both are also committed to the system of open outcry.
So electronic trading is envisaged mainly as a way of extending their
services outside normal opening hours.
Globex is a tighter alliance, requiring a greater degree of commitment from
its members. That is one of the reasons CBOT left it earlier in the year and
Liffe refused to join. Electronic trading also plays a more central role,
with Globex ultimately envisaged as a round-the-clock system.
In the medium term, both approaches can coexist. The only contract over
which there is serious competition is the bund future. Moreover, Globex's
slow start shows that global futures trading will not develop quickly. But a
fully screen-based trading system looks like the more cost-effective option
in the long run. If so, open outcry could find itself consigned to history
in the way face-to-face share trading was in the 1980s.

FT  21 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: David S. Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Making paper should be a relatively predictable business since demand is so
closely linked to the economic cycle. But the competitive environment can
change extraordinarily quickly as David S. Smith's annual results make
clear. Last year, paper makers were obsessed with price battles with their
customers. This year, they have watched with a mixture of excitement and
alarm as pulp prices have shot skywards. The scale of the rise has made it
easier to pass on the pain to the end users. But, as Inveresk warned earlier
this month, that has not been universally possible.
Smith has done well to avoid the margin squeeze on most paper grades. The
Kemsley mill is complete and can take full advantage of the market strength.
Recent acquisitions are already proving their worth. Not only is Smith
benefiting from the pick-up in demand across Europe; it can also gain from
the greater market penetration for its recycled products.
Yet the 4 per cent rise in Smith's shares yesterday seems excessive after
the company's 33 per cent outperformance against the market over the past
year. Smith's tax charge will double from last year's 11 per cent, pegging
earnings growth. Besides, there is no guarantee that the benign trading
climate for recycled paper will continue. The absurd German recycling
scheme, which has distorted European recycled paper prices for years, has
finally been adjusted. But insanity could easily break out once again.

FT  21 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BA's passenger figures have recently shown some encouraging gains but two
dark clouds are drifting across its flightpath. USAir's second-quarter
profits increase disguises its dreadful plight. The fall in fuel costs which
flattered its latest figures will be rapidly reversed this quarter while
staff costs are still rising at an alarming rate. USAir accepts it needs a
'permanent and substantial' reduction in operating costs. The strength of
union representation will make conventional cost-cutting hard to achieve.
United Airlines' blueprint for swapping labour concessions for employee
ownership may therefore appeal. But such a scheme would cause big problems
for BA. Either BA's 24.6 per cent shareholding would be heavily diluted or
it would need to inject substantial funds to retain it at that level. BA may
also worry that a rise in employee representation would lessen its own
influence over the future of USAir.
BA's other bugbear of the moment is that the European Commission seems set
to wave through the state bale-out of Air France with minimal conditions.
That would be little short of scandalous given the EC's supposed commitment
to free markets. Air France would receive FFr20bn of financial aid, which is
equivalent to about 60 per cent of BA's market value. State subsidies on
that scale promise to do for the European aviation industry what Chapter 11
achieved in the US. Too much capacity will be kept in the air, distorting
competition and destroying profitability.

FT  21 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Growth without pain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a well-earned hint of self-congratulation in the minutes of the UK
chancellor's June meeting with the governor of the Bank of England. Both
said that the economic situation was 'favourable' with steady growth and low
inflation. That is doubtless a fair assessment of the present but it says
little about the future. The task now is to maintain this benign
environment: the risk, underlined by yesterday's crop of economic
indicators, is that the economy may be set to grow too quickly.
Retail sales grew 1 per cent by volume in the last quarter despite April's
tax increases. Building society lending is picking up, which must offset
some recent worry about the housing market. In the background is the nascent
economic recovery in Europe which should boost exports, especially at
sterling's current low exchange rate. The economy's ability to withstand tax
increases may also encourage hitherto reluctant companies to invest. So the
governor's threat to raise interest rates if the pace of activity picks up
could well be put to the test.
The question for the markets will be whether this can occur without the
turmoil that followed the Federal Reserve's tightening in February. At least
both gilts and equities have fallen back since then. Equities would have the
consolation that the economic strength which prompted monetary tightening
should also do wonders for corporate earnings. Gilts might prefer the first,
pre-emptive tightening to be larger than the quarter point measured out by
the Fed. The trouble is that the glare of publicity which now surrounds
monetary policy is more conducive to compromise than bold gestures.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Enter, looking for the trap-door: A look at the political
and institutional challenges that Santer would face as European Commission
president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is about to discover whether there is life after Mr Jacques Delors.
In Strasbourg today, newly elected members of the European Parliament will
size up Mr Jacques Santer, the safe but uninspiring choice to succeed Mr
Delors as president of the European Commission.
The vote in the parliament, though not binding, will in practice determine
whether Mr Santer takes over the most powerful non-elected post in Europe
next January. It also offers the long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg
the chance to dispel doubts about his stature and set out his own agenda for
the next five years.
Speaking to Socialist MEPs on Tuesday night, Mr Santer showed he is walking
a tightrope. His remarks that his policies were no different from those of
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, were calculated to pre-empt
parliamentary criticism of his last-minute emergence as a compromise
candidate. But they provoked an uproar in the UK, which vetoed Mr Dehaene as
president on the grounds that he is a centralising federalist who flirts
with protec-tionism.
A more substantive point is whether Mr Santer's appointment signals a
weakening of the Commission, which Mr Delors turned into the driving force
behind European integration, following his arrival in Brussels nearly 10
years ago.
As president of the Commission, Mr Santer would take charge of a body whose
morale is low and whose mission needs rethinking. His challenge is both
political and institutional: how to preserve the Commission's role as
umpire, power-broker and political catalyst, and how to stand up to an
increasingly assertive European Parliament and a Council of Ministers in
which majority sentiment leans towards cutting the Commission down to size.
Many in Brussels are mourning the imminent departure of Mr Delors, but it is
easy to forget that his legacy is double-edged. Against the grand designs of
the European single market, the European Economic Area and the plans for
political and monetary union must be set the polarisation of public opinion,
Euro-disenchantment and his own admission that he may have overreached
himself in his final years. The argument over the direction of European
integration remains unresolved among member states: 'The president of the
Commission must reconcile the irreconcilable,' says a fellow Luxembourger
and former senior Commission official.
The immediate tasks facing a Santer Commission are the preparation of the
1996 Inter-Governmental Conference, which will review the Maastricht treaty,
possibly streamline decision making in an enlarged Union, and examine the
use of national vetoes. Some fear a rerun of the Maastricht debate, with a
polarisation of views and the British Conservative government held hostage
by its Euro-sceptics. 'The conference could be disaster,' says one
Maastricht negotiator. 'It would be better to put it off until 1998.'
Other practical tasks for the Commission include the absorption next year of
up to four new EU member states (Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway) as
well as planning for the next round of enlargement in eastern Europe, Cyprus
and Malta; monitoring and eventually judging whether member states have met
the strict criteria for joining a European monetary union; and preparing for
the next five-year budget when the present Delors II package expires in
1999.
Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner, has argued in his recent
book on the future of the EU that many of these issues are linked, and may
be resolved only through a series of trade-offs, in which the Commission
could play a pivotal role in identifying and brokering compromises.
For instance, the degree to which the 'Club Med' states of Greece, Portugal
and Spain can preserve their privileged status in the next EU budget
negotiations may determine their support for membership of the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary at the turn of the century.
In the same vein, German enthusiasm for swapping the D-Mark for a single
European currency may depend on French agreement to expansion of the EU
eastwards and a political union far more ambitious than the present loose
co-operation among governments over foreign and defence policy. 'There must
be a compromise on these matters,' says a German official.
Mr Delors showed on several occasions in the past 10 years - notably in his
two budget packages, his early support for German unification and, latterly,
in his white paper on competitiveness, jobs and growth - that the Commission
has a special role in nudging member states towards Europe's collective
interest.
Yet Mr Delors' powers of persuasion have clearly ebbed in the past two years
as suspicion of the Commission has grown - not just in the UK, but also in
France, where officials rail against its pretensions in foreign policy, and
work to weaken its primacy in trade policy. Others in Brussels detect cases
of 'creeping unilateralism', as countries invoke their own national
interests ahead of the common interest, most notably in Greece's imposition
of a trade embargo on neighbouring Macedonia.
In seeking to maximise his authority, Mr Santer starts off with two
disadvantages: he comes from the smallest state in the union and he was
nobody's first choice as Commission president. Better-known candidates such
as Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Dehaene of
Belgium, and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain either were blocked or
declined to enter the race.
Much depends on whether he could grow in his job, like Mr Delors, who, as Mr
Santer pointed out this week, was also everybody's second choice in 1984. It
will also depend on his ability to reform the Commission.
It is symptomatic of the mistrust of the Commission by member states that,
35 years after the foundation of the European Union, the president still
does not have the power to choose his own team. Commissioners are still
regarded as national representatives and therefore national appointments.
Sir Roy Denman, a former EU ambassador in Washington, says: 'Governments do
not like appointing people to the Commission who are too good. They want to
control things from capitals and are happy to send second-raters to
Brussels. The exception is France, which is why the French effectively run
the Commission.'
Mr Delors has always been at pains to dispel the notion that he was a
creature of the French government. Occasionally, as in the final stage of
the Gatt trade talks, he even distanced himself discreetly from Paris. But
the French language and culture still permeate the Brussels bureaucracy, so
much so that the Balladur government's minimum requirement was that Mr
Delors' successor should be a Francophone.
A Santer Commission would be likely to contain hold-overs from the Delors
era. Advocates of an open, free-trade-oriented Commission will welcome the
desire of Sir Leon Brittan to stay on in his job as chief EU trade
negotiator. And despite the odd mis-step, Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian
competition policy commissioner, remains one of the most popular and
effective operators in Brussels.
Less appealing for overworked Eurocrats is the prospect of another five-year
term for Mr Martin Bangemann, the talented but relaxed German industry
commissioner. Many will regret, however, the expected departure of Mr Rene
Steichen, the Luxembourger who has done yeoman work on implementing the
Common Agricultural Policy reforms and laying the ground for further changes
in anticipation of enlargement into eastern Europe.
Finding enough work to keep Mr Santer's colleagues busy may be the toughest
job for the new Commission. Thanks to the prospective enlargement of the EU
next year, the number of individual commissioners should rise from 17 to 21,
with one extra representative from the Scandinavian states and Austria.
Moreover, each commissioner has his or her own cabinet, which leads to
political appointees creating rival power-centres to the career civil
servants in the bureaucracy.
'The next Commission president has an awesome task,' says a senior EU civil
servant. 'He must give back the organisation a sense of pride. He must get
rid of the abuse and restore morale. It's anarchy at the moment.'
One logical reform would be a triumvirate at the top, with power divided
between the president and two vice-presidents, one responsible for the
single market and one for external affairs. Each would have 'junior'
commissioners who could take over specific portfolios such as
telecommunications and the environment, or Russia and eastern Europe,
external trade and development policy.
This leads into dangerous territory. When Mr Delors suggested streamlining
the Commission in early 1992, he was accused of harbouring plans to rule
Europe. The prospect of smaller member states losing their commissioner or
having obviously second-rank appointees provoked an outcry.
Another unresolved question concerns the Commission's monopoly right to
propose legislation, its willingness to use it to complete the single
market, and its ability to develop as a regulator and co-ordinator now most
of the legislation in the 1992 programme is complete. The desire to exercise
these functions sits uneasily alongside the post-Maastricht emphasis on
subsidiarity - the devolution of decision-making to the lowest appropriate
national, regional and local level - a principle to which Mr Santer has
declared he is committed.
A senior Commission official warns that there are risks in applying
subsidiarity too rigorously: 'The credibility of the European Union depends
on delivering the practical results of what it has decided to do. The
internal market exists in theory, but it must be created in practice, and
you do not do that through an act of God.'
Thus EU governments face a conundrum as they brace themselves for the next
phase of the single market in areas such as telecommunications and energy.
This will require member states to make significant adjustments, either by
applying mutual recognition of national rules or by agreeing to a second
burst of Euro-legislation to harmonise competing systems, which in turn will
require a strong central regulator.
The lesson of the Delors era is that member states are uncomfortable with an
overactive legislative programme and with the idea of the Commission as a
government-in-waiting in Brussels. Countries such as the UK and France are
particularly resistant to the idea of the Commission developing a separate
foreign policy-making function. The high-water mark for EU legislation may
turn out to be the 1992 single market programme.
The temptation is to restrict the Commission's ambitions to its traditional
tasks: principally conducting trade policy, monitoring the Common
Agricultural Policy; enforcing the Treaty of Rome in areas such as
competition and state aid; and dispensing regional aid.
Yet as Mr Niels Ersboll, the outgoing secretary-general of the European
Council, pointed out in a recent article in the foreign policy magazine
International Affairs, the Commission role as an 'implementing government'
is under threat not only from member states, which have an interest in
deciding how lightly or strictly EU law is applied, but also from the
European Parliament as co-legislator.
In Strasbourg this week, MEPs blocked the Council's decision to liberalise
the market in voice telephony by 1998 - the first use of such powers under
the Maastricht treaty. Mr Ersboll argues that the institutional
power-struggle could become even more acute in an enlarged Union.
Some member states such as the UK might relish the prospect of the
Commission in retreat, but the price could be high if this means lax
enforcement of existing rules or a condominium between integrationist-minded
member states led by Germany. 'We are not entering a trap-free zone,' admits
one British official.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Leading Article: A soft-shoe reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's new cabinet, announced yesterday, is not unlike the one that
preceded it. The significance of the reshuffle was greater in the
anticipation than the deliverance. Weeks of advance fanfare have been
followed by the quiet rasp of soft shoes. Three ministers who had long been
ready to leave office did so; one was dismissed for poor performance. There
was rather more changing of titles and offices in the middle and junior
ranks of the administration, but that is a standard way of keeping
backbenchers in a state of hope of preferment. It is a whip's stratagem.
This is not to say that the changes are a nullity. The new faces may be
better on TV than the old. Mr John Patten was hardly a success as education
secretary; Mrs Gillian Shephard, a former teacher, is likely to soothe the
profession and bed down the national curriculum. She may not be a creative
policymaker, but she should be a safe pair of hands. Mr Peter Brooke,
unexpectedly brought in from retirement to serve at national heritage, did
so with moderate distinction. His successor, Mr Stephen Dorrell, is one of
the brighter characters in the mini-drama. For him heritage may be a
disappointing ticket to the cabinet room.
The move of Mr Michael Portillo to employment will test both his
administrative abilities and the government's intentions on education and
training. He is as right-wing as his predecessor, Mr David Hunt, was left,
but the portfolio does not offer unlimited scope for demonstrating either
proclivity. He will team up with Mr Peter Lilley, rightwing secretary for
social security, to introduce the new Job Seekers Allowance.
Mr Portillo is succeeded as chief secretary by Mr Jonathan Aitken, another
Eurosceptic. Mr Jeremy Hanley, previously unknown, becomes chairman of the
party. He has taken over an institution whose performance can hardly
decline.
Lord Wakeham had outstayed his usefulness in the upper house. He deserved
his unofficial title of 'Lord Fixit' but recently too much legislation has
emerged from the Lords in a broken state. His job has been subdivided. One
of his successors, Viscount Cranborne, will bring a Cecil back to prominence
among Conservatives; another, Mr David Hunt, may become as adept as Lord
Wakeham was at smoothing troubled waters, arranging deals, spotting hazards,
fixing it. Mr William Waldegrave deservedly survives, and moves to
agriculture. At transport, Mr John MacGregor had for some time intimated his
readiness to retire; his replacement, Dr Brian Mawhinney, is good at
presentation.
At best, yesterday's change-around marks a small but discernible step in the
long battle by the prime minister to recover his administration's authority.
The previous steps are well-known. The government was blown off-course in
September 1992 when sterling was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism.
Stability has been restored, at the cost of ceding greater influence over
monetary policy to the Bank of England. The electorate is proving slow to
respond to the improved economic outlook, but it may do so in time. The
Conservative party's divisions over Europe have been papered over.
In short, the cabinet reshuffle may be taken as evidence that the government
believes it has passed through the nadir of its unpopularity. It probably
has. As part of the process of regaining poise, yesterday's moves are
unlikely to harm Mr Major. Nor are they likely to prove memorable. The prime
minister is doomed to continue the struggle to put a distinctive stamp on
his government.

Why are politicians unable to resist piggy-backing on the success of
national sporting heroes? Argentine president Carlos Menem's designation of
Diego Maradona as a 'roving ambassador' after the 1990 Rome football World
Cup now looks risible.
Brazil's government is now doing its damnedest to repeat the error, by
connecting the Brazilian team's success in the US World Cup to hopes that
the country's new Real currency will also struggle through to eventual
victory.
Don't bank on it.
For the thousands of Braslia residents who cheered their returning soccer

when three government ministers stepped on to the runway. Looks like a

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With one previous winner in jail and another having resigned from a senior
sporting post amid allegations of cheating, the Asian of the Year award has
something of a chequered past.
Tonight, at London's Grosvenor Hotel, the 1994 plaudit is likely to go to
Ghulam Kanderboy Noon, owner of Noon Products, which has successfully
cornered a niche in Indian frozen foods, numbering Sainsbury among its
customers. The gong is presented by the UK publication, Asian Who's Who
International, to high-achievers in the diaspora.
Previous winners have been Nazmu Virani - now spending 30 months inside one
of Her Majesty's less salubrious hostelries for his role in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International fraud - and Imran Khan, former Pakistan
test cricket captain.
Khan recently resigned from the International Cricket Council, after
admitting once using a bottle-top to tamper with a cricket ball.
Perhaps the organisers are feeling the need to polish up the award's image.
That could explain the presence of some big noises, including Michael
Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, as chief guest. He's joined by
Labour's Margaret Beckett and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown.
Associates of Noon describe him as 'squeaky clean'; so maybe the choice is
right for a change.

Tough luck on DPR Publishing, which today brings out the 1994 edition of the
Whitehall Companion, an invaluable 'Who's Who' for government departments
and quangos; it's already out of date. Yesterday's UK government reshuffle
means moves not just for ministers but also their advisers.
Life will certainly change for Eleanor Laing, adviser to John MacGregor,
outgoing transport secretary. The Companion discloses that she has advised
MacGregor on a diverse range of subjects; she was his aide when he was at
education and stayed by him when he was Leader of the Commons, ending up in
transport.
Cliff Grantham, special adviser to departing education secretary John
Patten, may also be casting around. A former BBC radio news reporter and
lobbyist, he also advised Patten as minister of state at the Home Office.
Peter Brooke enjoyed the services of two advisers at the Department of
National Heritage. Dominic Loehnis came from the Sunday Telegraph, but could
always turn a hand to his first calling, as a lyricist. Bryan Jefferson may
survive the change of ministers, since he brings professional skills to his
role as architectural adviser.

national heritage? Get your CVs in fast.

So much for Sweden's famed sexual libertarianism. Bjorn Rosengren has been
forced to quit as head of the country's white-
collar union, the Confederation of Professional Workers, following
revelations that he visited a topless club - three years ago.
Rosengren dropped in at the Tabu club along with an American guest, but says
he left - after less than an hour - when he realised what sort of
establishment it was.
Some hour. His bill was for SKr55,000, or Dollars 7,200, which even by
Scandinavia's expensive standards is pushing the boat out. His lawyer
managed to reduce the outlay to below SKr10,000. What sank Rosengren was the
outcry from his membership, 50 per cent of whom are women. Some taboos die
hard, it seems.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Will new Tory party chairman Jeremy Hanley again display his Dennis the
Menace cufflinks? The nastily naughty Dennis is one of the UK's most
well-established comic characters. Hanley's links caused a stir at the
Northern Ireland political talks during his stint as a junior Northern
Ireland minister. Children's entertainment seems to have been a recurrent
theme of those tense negotiations.
During them, Hanley was said to have been accused of introducing 'Blue Peter
documents'. The term derives from another ageless feature of British
childhood, the BBC television programme Blue Peter, whose presenters
instruct children how to fashion wonderful objects from old detergent
bottles and glue, using the catch-phrase 'here's one I made earlier'.
Hanley's accountancy training will be useful for a party with a Pounds 17m
debt. But has he enough spare time? What with constituency work, Mensa
membership, his cookery, chess, cricket, languages, theatre, cinema, music
and golf interests, surely something has to give.

FT  21 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Aid to Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by Africa's grim record, the horror of Rwanda defies belief. In an
exodus without precedent, up to 2m refugees have fled to neighbouring
Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire since early April, and as many again are
now pouring across the frontiers. Perhaps a quarter of Rwanda's population
is now outside the country. This tragedy demands an international response,
with an urgency and on a scale well beyond the current efforts.
The tide of fleeing humanity must be fed. But it neither can nor should be
housed in refugee camps on foreign soil. The flow must be reversed, and the
relief effort must strike a careful balance between immediate needs and
longer-term objectives, while not exacerbating the refugee problem itself.
As it is, there is a danger that the exodus could take on a logic of its
own. As more people flee to Goma and other points across the borders, so
more supplies from the outside world will arrive. As more aid arrives, so do
more refugees.
Calls for large-scale military intervention need to be treated with caution.
The lesson of Somalia is that soldiers are not enough. Their intervention
should be accompanied by a carefully thought-out programme of political
reform and economic reconstruction. In Somalia the absence of such a
framework proved fatal. Rwanda, with its history of bitter ethnic conflict,
will be no easier.
Yet there is a way in which additional, limited military assistance and more
relief supplies can be combined, in an exercise aimed at stemming and then
reversing the exodus. While the harrowing plight of the refugees in Goma
requires immediate medical and food aid, the bulk of assistance should be
directed to centres established within Rwanda. The additional troops, under
UN supervision and reinforcing the French presence, should carry out these
operations, protecting the relief centres and, where necessary, helping to
distribute the supplies.
The presence of foreign soldiers should reassure the remaining local
population, and encourage the refugees to return, by allaying their fear of
revenge killings by the victorious Rwanda Patriotic Front. There is no
evidence that this fear is justified. Rumours of reprisals seem to have been
spread by broadcasts from the retreating government, determined to leave
chaos in its wake.
But once short-term relief has been provided, the world should take stock of
Africa's deepening crisis. Unless a co-ordinated attempt involving African
and other governments, the United Nations and aid agencies is made to help
Africa help itself, the continent may be heading towards a catastrophe on an
even greater scale. Horrific though it is, Rwanda is only one symptom of
Africa's decline, as it pays the price of 30 years of disaster, man-made and
natural.
Conflicts in Angola and Sudan drag on; states like Zaire are in chaos;
others hitherto seen as stronger, such as Nigeria and Kenya, are under
increasing political and economic strain. More than 4m children in Africa
under the age of five die each year from preventable diseases.
It is more and more difficult to get Africa's crisis on to the agenda of an
international community which has been discouraged by the Somali experience,
and by Africa's evident marginalisation: a falling share in the world
commodity market, stagnant share of trade, and tiny share (barely 1 per
cent) of world investment. Before long, the more fortunate parts of the
world will have to decide whether to ring-fence Africa or accept a share of
responsibility for it. Rwanda should at least concentrate the mind.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The newly elected European Parliament has got off to an unpromising start.
By vetoing this week legislation to liberalise European voice telephony, the
parliament has threatened a programme vital to industrial competitiveness
and thereby diminished its own standing.
There appear to be three main reasons for the decision: confusion among
MEPs, some of whom apparently did not realise what they were voting on;
concern that liberalisation would raise residential telephone charges; and a
broadly shared desire to demonstrate institutional parity with the European
Commission and Council of Ministers.
Only the first explanation is readily acceptable, on the grounds that many
MEPs are still inexperienced. The second is understandable, but
wrong-headed. Technology and competition are rapidly eroding the monopoly
profit structure which has long subsidised residential telephone services.
Thwarting liberalisation will simply impede the European telecommunications
industry's adjustment to market realities.
The sorriest aspect of the affair is that the parliament seems to think it
can command respect by setting its face against economic progress. Using its
powers in this way is a disservice to the electorate, whose interests it
claims to represent, and invites charges of frivolity. With luck, the
telecom-munications package can be reassembled soon. On current form,
repairing the damage to confidence in the parliament's legislative wisdom
may take rather longer.

GREENING THE GATT: Trade, Environment and The Future
By Daniel C. Esty
Institute for International Economics, Washington DC
344 pages, Dollars 19.95
When a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade panel ruled against the US in
1991 for banning Mexican tuna exports, because they were fished with nets
which also caught dolphins, American greens saw red. On posters and in
newspaper advertisements, they attacked 'Gattzilla' as a rampaging dinosaur,
brutally trampling on ecological safeguards and national sovereignty.
The tuna-dolphin case has since become a potent symbol of friction between
environmental and trade policies - and of the heat it can generate.
Environmentalists sneer at the trade community as bloodless zealots, who
worship only economic efficiency.
Free-traders, meanwhile, deride environmentalists as wild-eyed idealists
with poorly thought-out goals which, implicitly or explicitly, favour
protectionism.
These mutual hostilities have not favoured rational debate on a subject
which is commanding growing international attention, but about which much
remains uncertain. The relationship between trade and environment policies
is so poorly charted that it is hard to be sure how far they genuinely
conflict - or whether the controversy is mostly politically contrived
alarmism.
Esty, a former US environmental policy official, declares his interest at
the outset. He insists serious issues are at stake because environmental
problems increasingly cross frontiers. Many trade experts would dissent. But
judging by the plaudits for his book from both sides of the divide, he has
set out the opposing arguments with exemplary fairness.
His starting point is that the focus of environmental policy has shifted
from crude curbs on smokestack pollution towards reliance on market forces
to change individuals' behaviour. The result is growing interest in the
principle of 'the polluter pays', in pricing mechanisms and in ensuring that
environmental costs are properly internalised.
Yet economic disciplines can work only if agreement is first reached on the
value of the assets concerned - a question on which opinions can differ
widely. What, for instance, is the value of a pretty view? On such
questions, Esty argues, political judgments are unavoidable.
However, he says, environmentalists lack a suitable institutional framework,
of the kind Gatt has provided in trade, in which to forge international
consensus on rules and their enforcement. As a consequence, the
environmentalist cause remains splintered, poorly focused and prey to
special interest lobbies.
Esty's preferred solution is a Global Environmental Organisation, which
would set worldwide standards and settle disputes. However, he is honest
enough to admit that - barring some global ecological catastrophe - the idea
is politically a non-starter.
But when Esty seeks alternatives, his balance starts to wobble. In striving
to be even-handed, he becomes enmeshed in convoluted arguments, the
implications of which he does not always fully explore.
On the one hand, he accepts that unilateral trade sanctions are a poor way
to enforce environmental standards: often, they lead to evasion or inflict
economic damage without solving environmental problems. Far better, he says,
to use financial incentives to encourage adoption of higher standards.
Equally reasonably, he suggests that Gatt disputes settlement procedures be
made more transparent and involve more environmental expertise.
Yet he says Gatt rules should nonetheless be changed to permit greater
recourse to trade measures for environmental reasons, because the US and
some other members will probably impose them anyway.
The notion is flawed. Not only does Esty admit that Gatt is a far from ideal
body in which to settle environmental issues. But he implies that
internationally agreed rules must be bent to suit the vocal political
lobbies in powerful economies which he earlier disparages. The same case
could be made to condone sanctions against low-wage exporters - or to
justify the enormities of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy.
Esty raises more problems when he tries to construct general principles
under which Gatt might reasonably authorise use of trade measures. His idea
that they should be allowed in support of environmental policies which enjoy
wide 'moral' legitimacy internationally or address 'global' problems looks
suspiciously like a formula for endless hair-splitting debate about matters
on which even scientists find it hard to agree.
The water is muddied still further by his proposal that the Gatt clause
which authorises bans on products for environmental reasons should be
extended to production methods. Not only would that heighten risks of trade
conflict by elevating local environmental problems to international status;
but by switching the onus from protecting consumers to disciplining
producers, it would create immense administrative difficulties.
How would environmental standards at millions of factories worldwide be
monitored? How would customs officers identify offending products, such as
microchips which had been processed using ozone-unfriendly CFCs? And why
should producers necessarily respond to trade sanctions by raising
environmental standards, rather than by lowering them still further to cut
costs?
That Esty provides no satisfactory answers is less a criticism of his book,
which is an honest attempt to make sense out of confusion, than an
illustration of the difficulties of policymaking while so much in the trade
and environment debate remains unclear. The immediate need is not for more
solutions, but for rigorous and objective analysis to clarify the true
nature of the supposed problems, and how much they matter.

FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll surprises dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A chink of light appeared in the gloomy food retailing sector yesterday as
Argyll Group surprised the market with an upbeat trading statement.
Increasing sales and improving margins came in ahead of analysts' best
expecta-tions and prompted a raft of profits upgrades, together with several
swift buy recommendations.
Marketmakers, who had anticipated another cautionary tale of difficult
trading, were caught short of stock and scrambled to buy. The shares shot
forward to end a busy session 12 1/2 ahead at 251p with a hefty 19m traded.
However, the initial technical situation did not prevent the more wilder
speculation seeping into the market, with one suggestion that J. Sainsbury
might be tempted into a bid for Argyll, attracted by the strong position of
its Safeway chain in Scotland.
This was dismissed by specialists, who suggested that the persistent rumour
of a stalking Hanson was more feasible, though still unlikely.
Meanwhile, William Low shares continued to hold firm as the market awaited
Sainsbury's response to last week's Pounds 154m friendly bid by Tesco.
Sainsbury is currently studying information supplied by the Scottish
supermarket group before making a decision. However, some analysts believe
Sainsbury's real strategic ambitions lie in the US, with rumours of an
imminent Pounds 1bn deal to buy an eastern seaboard retailer to complement
its Boston-based Shaws food business.
Even if Sainsbury does not enter a bidding war for Low, most in the market
believe a third party will, with Kwik Save shareholder Dairy Farm, of Hong
Kong, and Rewe, of Germany, among the names being mooted. Sainsbury ended 2
1/2 up at 400p, Kwik Save 9 ahead at 537p, and with no change at both Tesco
at 238 1/2 p, and Low at 256p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer close after an uncertain
trading session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market made a determined run at the Footsie 3,100 hurdle
yesterday but was restrained by caution in the British government bond
market ahead of the announcement of details of the impending auction of
gilt-edged securities. Confidence was helped by the latest retail business
survey from members of the Confederation of British Industry, which provided
an optimistic curtain-raiser to the official retail sales statistics for
June, due out this morning.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed a net 9.3 up at 3,091.3, having swayed between
3,096.2 and 3,072.6 during the course of an uncertain session. It was left
to the September futures contract on the Footsie to trade convincingly above
3,100 in the second half of the session.
Although the size and maturity of the gilt-edged stocks to be auctioned
satisfied the market, traders agreed that the chief focus remains the
prospects for testimony to Congress today by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, and, probably more sharply, the meeting of the
Bundesbank policy council tomorrow.
There was little response from UK equities to the news that growth in German
M3 money supply had slowed down in June, although this news raised
confidence that interest rates in Germany will be allowed to continue to
fall.
Equities opened firmly and were then taken ahead strongly in the wake of
early gains in the stock index futures market. However, the market peaked
quickly, with investors preferring to take profits when Footsie 3,100 came
in view. Selling pressure was moderate, however, and traders pointed out
that, with the UK equity account system now consigned to history, there was
less reason to let share profits run ahead of this week's important
developments in Germany and the US. Most fund managers have achieved
significant trading profits over the past week and were content to take some
of them yesterday morning.
Shares fell back smartly but soon rallied and traded fairly evenly until
mid-afternoon. Firmness in the dollar, partly reflecting a narrowing in the
US-Japanese trade deficit and a steadier trend in UK gilts on the auction
announcement, helped share prices to edge ahead towards the close. The Dow
Industrial Average put on about three points in UK trading hours.
Second line stocks continued to make progress, indicating a firm underlying
tone in the stock market. At 3,574.4, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which
incorporates a range of second line and Footsie 100 issues, closed a further
14.1 higher on the day.
Trading volume increased to 691.4m shares from the 518m of the previous
session, with only about 54 per cent of the business taking place in
non-Footsie issues. On Monday, retail business in equities was worth Pounds
1.13bn, comfortably in line with the recovery in trading seen over the past
fortnight.
Dealers expressed satisfaction with the stock market's continued progress
this week, commenting that only the more sluggish trend in bonds appeared to
have curbed the advance in the Footsie. Trading statements, in particular
from the retail sector, bore out the indications from the CBI survey, which
reported the strongest monthly growth in retail sales recorded so far this
year, that economic recovery is making its presence felt at consumer level.
While opinions on the chances of a cut in key rates this week by the
Bundesbank remained mixed, worries that rates might be forced higher in the
UK have receded a little further into the future.
BZW, the UK investment bank, reiterated its reminder to clients of the
benefits for UK exporters of sterling's 8 per cent decline from its January
highs against the German currency.

FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in the derivatives reported a lacklustre session that brought poor
turnover as the market waited for details of the UK gilts auction and
today's testimony from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, writes Joel
Kibazo.
There was a firm start to trading in the September contract on the FT-SE 100
which opened at 3,106 on continued support from Monday. The CBI's positive
report on retail sales provided a further spur over the next couple of hours
before the decline in bonds brought about mid-morning profit-taking.
Having fallen to a low of 3,075, September rallied on the back of a recovery
in bonds, and the firm opening on Wall Street saw it advance further.
However, dealers reported a marked lack of activity in the market,
attributed in the main to uncertainty ahead of Mr Greenspan's speech and
some nervousness about the impending gilts auction.
September ended at 3,098, the same level as its previous close, and around 4
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6 points.
Volume came to 11,170 lots.
Traded options were quiet and volume fell to 25,337 contracts from Monday's
32,291. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was particularly poor at a mere
6,349 lots, and only 1,828 contracts were dealt in the Euro FT-SE option.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technology and banking
sectors weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Banking and technology stocks swooned yesterday after investors finished
sifting through an avalanche of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.12 easier at 3,748.31, its
lowest level of the day, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
was off 1.36 at 453.86. New York SE trading volume was 251m shares. The
Nasdaq composite declined 3.30 to 719.32, while the American SE composite
held on to a gain of 1.31, closing at 433.90.
Although earnings news buffeted some individual share prices, market indices
were nearly static for most of the session. Anticipation of today's
congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
seemed to be restraining activity.
Some investors were concerned that Mr Greenspan would say something to upset
the bond market, which was expecting the central banker to signal that
monetary policy was on hold for the time being. On the other hand, if he
were to send out comforting signals, stocks could respond with a more
decisive move higher.
There was only a shred of economic data released yesterday, and it offered
little guidance. The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit in May
had widened to Dollars 9.17bn from the previous month's Dollars 8.5bn.
Analysts interpreted the development as evidence of a cooling economy,
reinforcing expectations that Mr Greenspan's appearance on Capitol Hill
would clear the air for a rally.
In the meantime, investors had plenty of corporate news to keep them
occupied, and by the end of the session, the losers began to pile up.
Banking and financial services issues were under the general pressure after
Citicorp disappointed the market with its second-quarter results. The group
posted a slight decline in second-quarter revenues and Wall Street responded
by marking down the issue Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 .
Chase Manhattan suffered from a delayed reaction to the publication of its
results the previous session. The stock fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8
after finishing unchanged on Monday.
Merrill Lynch shed a net Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 . In early trading
the stock was down as much as Dollars 1 5/8 as the investment house revealed
that its revenues and net income were substantially lower than year-earlier
levels.
Signet, a regional banking group, dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8
when its results came in below expectations.
Technology issues came under fire, partly in response to news that Intel's
profit margins had shrunk. The announcement by the industry bellwether had
been made just after Monday's close.
Intel fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57, although supported somewhat by the
fact that it had achieved record net income in the quarter. Novellus Systems
weakened Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 .
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, Lotus Development was rocked after revealing net
income of 20 cents a share in the quarter, against analysts' forecasts of 22
cents. The stock, which had fallen sharply last month when the company
issued a profits warning, plunged a further 14 per cent, or Dollars 5 5/8 ,
yesterday to Dollars 33 1/8 .
Amgen, the biotechnology concern, forged ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49
7/8 . Its net income of 77 cents per share easily beat the consensus
forecast of 73 cents.
Canada
The Toronto market closed virtually unchanged after moderate trading in
spite of a sharp increase in gold stocks.
The TSE 300 composite index was up just 0.3 of a point at 4,200.1, with
advances narrowly leading declines by 373 to 355. Volume amounted to 52.1m
shares valued at CDollars 604.3m. The gold shares index advanced 1.81 per
cent.
Midland Walwyn retreated CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 after announcing
that it will purchase a majority stake in Financial Concept Group, a
financial planning firm, for an undisclosed amount. Separately, Midland
Walwyn reported disappoint-ing second-quarter earnings which were below
analysts' expectations.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian shares fall 4% in thin
trading volume
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sao Paulo accelerated a decline in late trade to close 4.2 per
cent down on lingering rumours that two banks were having financial problems
in liquidating operations in the stock and fixed-income markets.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares lost 1,706 at 38,747.
Turnover was low at RDollars 164.6m (Dollars 177m).
Analysts said news of a postponement until today of a meeting of President
Itamar Franco's cabinet members to discuss proposed salary rises to civil
servants also weighed on stock prices. The market fears that the proposed
wage increases, if approved, will swell the federal workers' payroll by
Dollars 2.5bn, threatening the government's efforts to keep its 1994 budget
balanced.
Mexico
Mexican stocks fell for the seventh time in eight sessions in continued
light dealings, with investors sidelined by upcoming earnings reports and
currency worries.
The IPC index dipped 18.96 to 2,255.30. Volume, at 20m shares, was only
slightly above that of Monday, which was the slowest trading day for 10
months.

Johannesburg ended generally lower as the recent firmer trend ran out of
steam and foreign demand dried up. Gold shares tracked the softer bullion
price and dealers said the metal needed to put in a strong showing to
attract renewed investor interest.
The overall index receded 39 to 5,549, industrials dipped 41 to 6,357 and
golds fell 61, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,095. De Beers finished R1 down at R108,
Anglos was 50 cents softer at R232.50 and Anglovaal fell R2 to R133.
Gencor was 10 cents easier at R11.80 as investors awaited news of its bid

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris steer the
continent forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strength returned throughout the Continent yesterday.
PARIS finished at its highest level since the end of May, with the CAC-40
index up 27.20 or 1.3 per cent at 2,052.33, just off the day's best of
2,059.
Dealers attributed strength to the firmer bond markets and some
short-covering. Turnover was a firm FFr4.8bn.
Nomura Research has added its voice to expectations of an autumn rally in
the market - although given yesterday's performance the timing might well
come forward.
Casino once again featured with a 6 per cent gain, the share price rising
FFr8.90 to FFr161.90, although brokers could find no feature to explain the
movement.
FRANKFURT was underpinned by better than expected M3 data, which also came
out a few days ahead of schedule. This is likely to add pressure on the
Bundesbank, which meets tomorrow for the last time before the summer recess,
to trim interest rates.
The Dax index closed the session 30.60 or 1.5 per cent firmer at 2,128.79,
and in the post-bourse gained a little more to 2,129.86.
Mr Patrick Shields of NatWest Securities in London said that with the good
M3 data, the prospect of lower inflation and expectations of a further
reduction in interest rates, the stage was now set for a positive market
performance during the autumn. This should be supported by the publication
of half-year results starting next month, he said, which were likely to
confirm that an earnings recovery in the corporate sector was on course.
The chemicals sector stood out yesterday, with Hoechst rising DM16.70 to
DM328.70, BASF DM9.30 to DM303.80 and Schering DM15 to DM956.
MILAN rebounded after Monday's slide as signs emerged that the coalition
government was digging itself out of its difficulties. The Comit index
advanced 15.14 or 2.2 per cent to 704.83, with the day's industrial
production and industrial sales figures offering further support.
News that Mr Silvio Berlusconi had agreed with his coalition partners to
scrap the widely unpopular judicial decree, which would have limited
magistrates' powers of arrest, and submit a modified draft law to
parliament, came after the market had closed.
Banks took the market higher, with BCI providing the lead after shareholders
gave the board the go-ahead to launch a L2,380bn capital increase on August
10. The shares climbed L258 or 5.9 per cent to L4,643 after the bank also
forecast improved results for the year.
Credito Italiano added L151 or 7.3 per cent at L2,222 on hopes that it would
follow the BCI lead with its own rights issue.
Among blue chip industrials, Fiat appreciated L110 to L6,670, Pirelli rose
L115 to L2,775 and Montedison added L43 at L1,474.
AMSTERDAM enjoyed a positive spirit as confidence returned to the market.
The AEX index finished 5.51 firmer at 399.12, a day's improvement of 1.4 per
cent.
The internationals led the way, Royal Dutch moving ahead Fl 3.80 to Fl
193.60 and Philips up Fl 2.60 to Fl 52.90. However, KLM remained steady at
Fl 52.30 as two brokers came out with contrasting opinions on the stock.
Paribas Capital Markets, in its latest European aviation review, said that
it had upgraded its profits expectations, with the main reasons being that
the yield situation was no longer deteriorating.
Merrill Lynch, however, lowered its opinion, downgrading its intermediate
rating from above average to neutral. This was based, said Merrill Lynch, on
the stock's strong recent performance: since June 24 it has gained 15.5 per
cent. On a long term view - two years - it raised its rating from above
average to buy.
ZURICH turned higher in thin trade in response to lower interest rates and
the firmer dollar, and the SMI index regained the 2,500 level, rising 26.9
or 1.1 per cent to 2,521.6.
Roche certificates, which have led the market's declines over the last week,
picked up SFr35 to SFr5,295.
Sandoz registered shares moved forward SFr3 to SFr650: James Capel, which
rates the stock a sell, has downgraded its earnings forecasts, primarily to
reflect currency movements but also reduced expectations for the
pharmaceuticals division.
The interest rate outlook helped insurers to put in a firm showing. Swiss Re
gained SFr4 at SFr559 and Winterthur picked up another SFr17 to SFr675 in
further response to Monday's positive earnings forecast.
Nestle was SFr7 higher at SFr1,103 ahead of its first-half sales figures,
which came after the market had closed. In the event, the company reported
flat six monthly sales compared with analysts' forecasts of a 1 to 2 per
cent reduction.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese equities make a
modest improvement

Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range on small-lot trading by domestic
institutions, and the Nikkei 225 average closed marginally higher after
selling by financial institutions erased some of the earlier gains, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was up 57.52 at 20,775.16 after a day's peak of 20,851.87 in the
morning and low of 20,736.35 in the afternoon. The Topix index eased 0.71 to
1,664.30 as some financial institutions liquidated trading positions. The
Nikkei 300 slipped 0.20 to 302.09.
Volume totalled 260m shares, against 213m, and advances outscored declines
by 510 to 452, with 213 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 2.83 at 1,351.59.
Traders said the Nikkei 225 would move in a narrow range until the currency
markets indicated the direction of the yen/dollar rate.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said that while the higher yen would prompt
profit-taking from foreign investors, it might not be as strong as in the
third quarter of 1992 when the European Monetary System collapsed. But with
some profit-taking limiting the upside of share prices in the short term and
buying by domestic investors preventing a sharp plunge, the Nikkei is
expected to be range bound for the next several months.
Toray Industries rose Y8 to Y780 on reports that it would double its
production of colour filters for liquid crystal displays. Other textile
makers also improved as laggard stocks. Teijin moved forward Y10 to Y567 and
Nitto Boseki Y13 to Y357.
Sumitomo Chemical gained Y8 at Y534 on reports of a decline in its operating
loss, while Nabco, a car and train brake maker, jumped Y58 to Y611 on news
of firm profits.
Foreign investors sold some high-technology issues, which were later bought
by domestic institutions. Casio Computer shed Y40 to Y1,280 but Matsushita
Electric Industrial ended Y30 ahead at Y1,780.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 8.42 to 23,203.84 in volume of 19.7m
shares. Kyocera, the semiconductor packaging maker, climbed Y70 to Y7,410.
Roundup
Mixed activity with few apparent trends dominated the Pacific Rim markets
yesterday.
TAIPEI failed to build on Monday's strength as profit-taking took hold. The
weighted index dipped 7.07 to 6,526.39 in turnover of TDollars 119.02bn,
after Monday's TDollars 131.04bn.
Profit-taking was heavy in financial stocks, which had gained more than 3
per cent the previous day.
Elsewhere, China Steel rose TDollars 1 to TDollars 28.60 on news that it had
secured Dollars 423m in loans from German and British banks. ICBC retreated
TDollars 2 to TDollars 88 on heavy profit-taking.
SEOUL saw some gains in smaller capitalised shares, although the market
closed lower for a fifth consecutive session due to a lack of institutional
activity.
The composite stock index lost 5.75 at 939.05 as investment trust companies
extended their sell-offs ahead of an August 10 deadline to repay part of
their borrowings to the central bank. A warning by the securities watchdog
of a crackdown on price manipulation also deterred many institutions.
HONG KONG finished moderately lower but bargain hunting, particularly in
HSBC Holdings, helped to trim losses. The Hang Seng index was finally off
48.82 at 9,145.01.
HSBC, in demand by European investors on expectations of positive interim
results being reported next month, was 75 cents firmer at HKDollars 90.50
after touching HKDollars 91.
Uncertainty about local property prices and worries about an upward trend in
US interest rates remained the major concerns. Among property issues that
encountered profit-taking, Sun Hung Kai Properties declined 60 cents to
HKDollars 48, Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 39.20 and Hongkong Land
45 cents to HKDollars 20.10.
MANILA continued to improve on a technical rally, now in its fourth session.
The composite index added 18.25 at 2,669.06 in turnover of 677.56m shares
worth 914.79m pesos. Rising issues outpaced losers by 31 to 28.
Second-line stocks topped the list of gainers, with retail-based SM Prime
Holdings leading the way by climbing 5.4 per cent to 5.90 pesos. Benpres,
which has holdings in Meralco and broadcast company ABS-CBN, jumped 2.15 per
cent to 9.50 pesos.
PLDT led blue chips with an advance of 1.6 per cent to 1,535 pesos.
SYDNEY managed to recoup opening losses to notch up its fifth consecutive
gain. The All Ordinaries index, down 11 points at the start, closed a net
5.1 firmer at 2,077.4.
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index contract
recovered to finish only 3 off at 2,097 after 2,076. National turnover came
to 176.2m shares worth ADollars 374.9m.
Austereo was the most traded industrial stock with almost 3m shares changing
hands: it opened at a 4 per cent premium before closing at 89 cents, down a
cent from its issue price of 90 cents.
Goodman Fielder rose 4 cents to a two-month high of ADollars 1.43, and was
the second most traded industrial holding.
In the banking sector, NAB slipped 14 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to ADollars
11.24, ANZ lost 2 cents to ADollars 4.26, Westpac was steady at ADollars
4.82 and Commonwealth Bank added 9 cents at ADollars 8.09.
WELLINGTON consolidated to end marginally lower after a strong run on Monday
and late last week. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 6.75 at 2,027.71 on
turnover of NZDollars 29m.
The main stocks were marginally weaker with the exception of Telecom, which
gained a cent at NZDollars 4.64.
BANGKOK finished a day dominated by speculative trade higher. The SET index
improved 3.74 to 1,348.94, with interest centred on finance and blue chip
issues.
BOMBAY recovered from early losses to close higher on late buying by local
mutual funds. The BSE 30-share index gained 16.74 at 4,114.85 after an
intraday low of 4,078.67.
Indian mutual funds, mainly Unit Trust of India, were said to have bought
select blue chips, including Tata Iron and Steel, Rs5 ahead at Rs290 on
takeover expectations.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in thin trading as investors who
bought at higher levels looked to cut their losses.
The composite index failed to hold above the psychological 1,000 support
level, ending 5.85 down at 999.20 in thin volume of 69m shares.
SINGAPORE saw the broad market weaken on profit-taking, although demand for
some index heavy issues took the Straits Times Industrial index 5.77 ahead
to 2,204.92. Volume was light at 64.3m shares.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovers ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government's decision yesterday to withdraw its controversial
detention decree helped the lira recover on foreign exchanges, writes Philip
Gawith.
Having spent a miserable Monday contemplating Italy's football world cup
defeat, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi doing the same to the currency,
traders had more to cheer about as the lira broke through the L1,000 barrier
against the D-Mark.
The Italian currency finished in London at L1,001, from L1,002 on Monday,
and later firmed to L999.
The dollar, meanwhile, continued its recent recovery ahead of the Humphrey
Hawkins testimony today of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
The US currency closed in London at Y99.0250, from Y97.9050 on Monday.
Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5569 from DM1.5558. The yen ended
slightly firmer against the D-Mark at Y63.63 from Y63.75.
The sterling index finished at 79.5 from 79.3 as gains against the D-Mark,
on the back of a stronger dollar, outweighed losses against the US currency.
The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5598 from Dollars 1.5586 and
DM2.4284 from DM2.4248.
The lira started trading in Europe at the L999 level, but then crashed
through L1,000 on rumours that Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, had
resigned. The currency fell as low as L1,007 before news that the
controversial decree would be amended helped the currency recover above
L1,000.
Analysts agree that while the latest initiative has taken the heat out of
the situation, Italy is not out of the woods yet. Mr David Cocker, economist
at Chemical Bank in London, said: 'You still have major political
uncertainty in Italy as a result of Mr Berlusconi's faux pas. He really has
played this very badly.'
His views were echoed by IDEA, the financial markets consultancy, which
noted in its commentary: 'Even a compromise solution will leave the
government deeply shaken . . . its ability to implement tough reform and
deficit-cutting measures will be questionable. Bearing in mind the
difficulties faced even by a fully functional government in fiscal terms,
these developments paint a bleak picture for Italian assets in the medium
term, regardless of short-term announcement effects.'
The focus of attention for the dollar was the release of the May trade
figures. The market initially tried to sell the currency after the release
of the figures, which showed the deficit to be Dollars 9.17bn, against a
forecast Dollars 8.3bn deficit and April's Dollars 8.4bn deficit.
The sell-off, however, was soon reversed as the market took cheer from the
19.9 per cent drop in the trade gap with Japan, which fell to Dollars
4.39bn.
Traders reported that the rally was bolstered by market rumours of unrest in
North Korea, which led to some dollar buying.
Mr Cocker said the market was in a profit-taking phase, with the potential
to rise 3 to 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark. With the deficit improving and
Mr Fred Bergsten, the hitherto bearish economist changing his tune, Mr
Cocker commented: 'We do seem to be getting more voices speaking as one from
the US.'
He cautioned, however, that it was difficult to see this improved sentiment
lasting. July 31 is the deadline by which substantial progress must be shown
to have been made in US-Japan trade talks. If not, there is the prospect of
the US imposing sanctions against Japan, and this will most likely lead to
renewed dollar selling.
Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said the dollar
had also gained support from the strength of US imports, which bolstered the
case of those arguing for an early tightening. But he pointed out that the
trend in US interest rates at the moment is, if anything, down.
In the futures market, for example, the December Eurodollar contract was
trading at 94.28, higher by 41 basis points than a week previously.
The dollar continued to firm after the London close, but analysts said trade
was thin. In New York it finished at Y99.225 and DM1.5685.
A slowdown in the rate of German M3 money supply growth in June, to an
annualised rate of 11.3 per cent, boosted hopes that the Bundesbank council
might decide to lower its official rates when it meets tomorrow.
On Monday Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member, fuelled speculation
about the outlook for lower rates when he said he could not rule out that M3
would be back within its 4 to 6 per cent target range by the year-end.
German call money was steady at 4.85/4.90 per cent. The Bundesbank will
announce today the outcome of its latest repo auction, with rates expected
to fall by one to three basis points from 4.91 per cent.
In the UK the Bank of England provided money markets with Pounds 776m
assistance after declaring a shortage of Pounds 850m. In the futures market
the short sterling contracts were quiet, but Euromark contracts traded
positively on the M3 news, the December contract ending at 95.17 from 95.13.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian frost fails to excite
sugar trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response of the sugar market to the recent frosts in Brazil, a big
exporter, is described by ED F. Man, the London trade house as 'anaemic'. It
suggests, in its latest sugar report, that damage to sugar-cane from the
frosts in southern Brazil has wiped out the overall production gain expected
earlier from increased output in the centre/south.
'After a record production of 7.02m tonnes in 1993-94, initially a further
6-8 per cent increase in sugar production was expected,' says Man. 'It is
this increase in production that has now been eroded.'
It sees as more serious the damage to the young cane 'with estimates of a
potential reduction for the 1995-96 crop'. But it says this is too far ahead
to have a serious effect on futures markets.
Nevertheless, 'worries about the Brazilian crop have set in motion an early
trail of concern for the 1994-95 crops in the region,' says Man. 'The
Argentine sugar industry, already suffering from an unstructured approach to
deregulation, has been affected by drought. . . There is some concern too
for the Dominican Republic and Mexico, whilst further degradation of the
Cuban 199394 crop does not bode well for next season.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unease growing about Russia's
aluminium cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CANBERRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government trade delegation attending talks between some of the
big aluminium producing countries arrived here with no new information and
without previously supplying new data, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Russian industry officials had already admitted that for 'technical reasons'
their producers had not been able to fulfil undertakings given earlier this
year and had cut annual output only by 200,000 tonnes by July 1. Russia
originally promised to cut 300,000 tonnes by the end of April and another
200,000 tonnes by August 1.
Five of the six delegations gave details of their latest production figures
before this week's meeting. One industry official, who asked not to be
identified, said Russia's failure to present more data in Canberra could be
taken as deliberate or incompetent. But this added to the feeling that
Russian producers were not playing their part in an agreement for voluntary
cuts. He said this could affect the goodwill of other participants,
especially as prices had risen sharply, increasing the temptation to boost
production.
The meetings in Canberra, which continue today and tomorrow, follow one in
Brussels in January at which trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the
European Union, Norway, Russia and the US, agreed that about 1.5m tonnes of
annual production needed to be cut for two years to bring the aluminium
market back into balance. One estimate suggests that by June producers in
the western countries had announced cuts totalling 1.28m tonnes.
Mr Vladimir Kalchenko, first deputy chairman of Russian producers' group
Aluminiy, said on Monday that Russia had no proper accounting system for
metal exports but that informal data showed imports lower in the first six
months of this year than in the second half of last year. 'We know exports
are falling, partly due to output cuts and partly to bigger domestic
demand,' he said.
Some 35 government officials from the participating states are at this
week's meeting to discuss issues covered in a 'memorandum of understanding'
signed in Ottawa in March. No industry representatives are present.
Topics on the agenda include ways to make the Russian aluminium industry
economically viable and prospects for bringing Brazil, Venezuela, Japan and
the Gulf states into the agreement.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU farm price deadlock broken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union farm ministers broke a six-month deadlock over farm prices
and milk quotas yesterday, marking an early success for Germany's
presidency, reports Reuter from Brussels.
The breakthrough was made after the European Commission conceded some aid
for northern French producers of durum (pasta) wheat and Germany moderated
its own demands after taking over the rotating EU presidency on July 1.
'Durum was a particularly difficult question,' Mr Jochen Borchert, the
German farm minister told a news conference after a final 10-hour
negotiating session.
The annual EU farm price talks, which began in February, have a history of
stretching over months, with some all-night sessions as ministers try to
squeeze more money for farmers. Talks this year were unusually lengthy
because of delays caused by European Parliament elections in June and a
budget squeeze.
EU agriculture commissioner Mr Rene Steichen finally bowed to French
pressure and agreed that northern French producers of durum wheat would be
eligible for EU payments on up to 50,000 hectares, a quarter of what they
requested.
Spanish, Portuguese and Italian durum wheat farmers will be entitled to aid
for an extra 30,000 hectares.
Mr Steichen dismissed the aid as a small concession with little extra cost.
'It's a minor adjustment,' he said. 'The essence of CAP (common agricultural
policy) reform has been preserved.' He was referring to sweeping reforms
agreed in 1992 to get rid of costly grain, beef and butter mountains.
Mr Jean Puech, the French farm minister, said France's insistence had paid
off even though it led to the failure of a week-long negotiating session in
Luxembourg last month.
French officials said that the aid would ensure that French mills in
northern Europe would continue to receive durum wheat supplies at
competitive prices.
The German compromise, which also included improved terms for sugar, beef
and dried fodder producers, will cost around Ecu375m (Dollars 465m) extra,
officials said. But the additional aid represents only about 5 per cent of
the massive EU farm budget.
The final package was a little cheaper than the Greek compromise rejected
last month.
'Spending will still be within budget limits, though 1995 will be
difficult,' Mr Steichen said.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts differ on coffee price
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coffee market is likely to continue its retreat from recent 8 1/2 -year
highs, according to London Trade house GNI. But FO Licht, a West German
commodity statistics consultancy, does not rule out a renewed price surge to
nearly double present levels.
At the London Commodity Exchange yesterday September delivery robusta coffee
futures, which peaked last week at Dollars 4,085 a tonne, fell another
Dollars 88 to Dollars 3,690.
In an article in its International Futures and Options Briefing GNI argues
that estimates of damage done to the 1995-96 Brazilian coffee crop by two
heavy frosts during the past few weeks 'have probably been exaggerated' and
that 'from a fundamental perspective' supplies of coffee over the next three
years were likely to be 'ample'.
In the shorter term it sees the Brazilian government's willingness, in
response to a surge in domestic prices, to liquidate its stockpile of 17m
bags (60kg each) as the most critical factor. With the world coffee market
effectively in balance in the 1994-95 season, Brazilian stock sales could
help consumer reserves to increase sharply to 23m bags, the highest level
since 1989-90, GNI calculates.
Worries about the possibility of further frosts and the fact that a clear
idea of post-frost output prospects will not be available until September
mean that 'only a minor (price) correction is likely over the next couple of
months', it says, suggesting that New York futures prices, which last week
topped Dollars 2.70 a pound, might fall from yesterday's Dollars 2.35 to
between Dollars 2 and Dollars 2.20. After that, however, near record exports
from producing countries are seen pushing prices as low as Dollars 1.40 a
pound.
'If there are no production problems in the following year,' says GNI, 'then
the impact of the low Brazilian crop on physical availability could cause
another mini-rally, but after the end of 1995 prices should fall again as
the roasters become more confident in the level of their reserves, probably
back to a normal Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.40 a pound range.'
Licht sees things rather differently. If it is true, as the US Department of
Agriculture has suggested, that a large proportion of Brazil's stockpiled
coffee is undrinkable, prices are likely to rise above the Dollars
7,000-a-tonne all-time high seen in 1977 after the worst ever Brazilian
coffee frost in 1975, the German consultancy says.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Betelmania takes Taiwan by
storm - A look a craze that is turning Taipei's streets blood red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A taxi driver sticks his head out the window and spits a stream of dark red
juice on to the pavement. Splat] Red spittle dribbles from the corners of
his mouth; some down the side of the car.
Not to worry - he's not ill, and those blood stain-like blotches speckling
Taipei's streets and sidewalks are not the scenes of a myriad of violent
crimes.
Betelmania has reached endemic proportions in Taiwan. Chewing the
bitter-tasting green nut of the betel palm, areca catechu, is supposed to
ward off fatigue and chill. In Taiwan, betel quid is usually prepared with
slaked lime, to cut the acidity, betel flower and cardamon for flavour and a
bit of Chinese medicine for good measure; all tucked into the tough, fibrous
husk of the betel nut. Every vendor has his or her own special formula. When
chewed, the concoction induces copious amounts of saliva and stains the
teeth and mouth red, giving the masticator a rather ghoulish aspect.
Called binglang in Chinese, betel nut is a mild stimulant long popular in
many southeast Asian countries. But for no apparent reason, except perhaps
that disposable income has risen, its consumption in Taiwan has grown
dramatically over the last decade.
The 'red-lipped population group' is estimated at 2.5m strong, or 12 per
cent of the population, several times that in the early 1980s. The typical
'binglang mi' - betel fanatic - is a manual worker, but according to a study
conducted by National Taiwan University, students, intellectuals and
professionals - mostly men - also chew. Some 40 per cent of chewers are 65
and older, but chewing is quickly gaining popularity among the young.
Production has risen commensurately as farmers have transformed rice paddies
into palm groves to cash in on the betel bonanza. According to figures
compiled by Taiwan's provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry,
there were 44,671 hectares of land under betel cultivation at the end of
1993. The harvest weighed in at 137,467 tonnes, compared with 30,102 tonnes
a decade earlier.
Meanwhile, the value of 1993's betel crop topped USDollars 380m, making the
betel nut the country's second most important crop after rice in value
terms, according to government figures. However, researchers say that
official statistics are conservative.
Several independent studies have estimated the market at upwards of
USDollars 1bn a year. A local newspaper, citing unnamed officials from the
ministerial-level Council of Agriculture, recently reported that betel was
now Taiwan's number one cash crop, with a street value approaching USDollars
2bn. Betel nuts retail at 50 US cents to USDollars 1 a chew, and hard-core
chewers munch through 20-30 quids a day. Demand is so high that when betel
is out of season in Taiwan, supplies must be smuggled in from Thailand.
The government is alarmed at the rise in use of the nut. 'We're concerned
about the health implications as well as the fact that spitting in the
streets is unsightly and unsanitary,' said Ms Fu Chi-yu, a special assistant
in the horticulture division of the Council of Agriculture.
Dr Tsai Chi-cheng, dean of the school of dentistry at Kaohsiung Medical
College, said betel-chewers tended to suffered from periodontal disease,
dental attrition, submucosal fibrosis and oral cancer. 'Not everyone who
chews betel gets cancer, but nearly all the people who come into our clinic
with mouth cancer chew betel,' he said.
The National Science Council several years ago commissioned a study to
develop betel substitutes, to be undertaken by the graduate institute of
food science and technology at National Taiwan University. Researchers
extracted alkaloids and other key ingredients and removed potentially
carcinogenic compounds to produce a betel nut chewing gum, designed to look,
taste and chew like the real thing.
A lecturer in nutrition at the Chung Shan Medical College, Mr Wang Chin-Kun,
is trying to persuade private manufacturers to bring betel nut gum out of
the laboratory and into the mouths of Taiwanese. 'We hope our healthy and
non-polluting betel substitute can be accepted by the consumer market,' he
said, while conceding that the plan had so far met with limited success. But
who knows, maybe betel nut gum will one day find favour with clean-living
chewers across Taiwan and even the rest of South-east Asia.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Hopes of German rate cut lift European
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European bonds edged higher again yesterday, buoyed by hopes that slowing
money supply growth in Germany could pave the way for further interest rate
cuts by the Bundesbank in the short-term.
Italian bonds surged strongly yesterday on the news that Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi had averted a clash with his coalition partners and so
ended the latest bout of political uncertainty in Italy.
Italian bond futures ended at 104.21 in after-hours trading on Liffe
yesterday, up more than a point on the previous day's close.
However, the market is still waiting for details of the government's fiscal
package on Thursday. 'There is still plenty of room for the market to move
in either direction,' said one analyst.
The UK gilts market ended only fractionally higher, having absorbed the
details of next week's gilts auction.
The news that the Bank of England plans to auction Pounds 2bn, the smallest
amount it can issue, at the July 27 auction was welcomed by traders.
In fact, because the stock chosen by the Bank - a 6 1/4 per cent 16-year
gilt - trades substantially below par, the net amount raised will be well
below Pounds 2bn.
'The Bank clearly feels confident about the market because it has been
issuing taps,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at S. G. Warburg. This
has also helped buoy market sentiment, he added.
Ahead of the auction, the market is likely to trade within a relatively
narrow range.
In the meantime, traders are focusing on today's retail sales data for June.
The market held up yesterday despite the fact that the Confederation of
British Industry report showed very strong retail sales in June, but traders
are hoping for weaker government figures today.
German bonds ended a busy day about  1/4 point higher, lifted by evidence
that M3 money supply growth continued to slow in June. A warm reception for
the government's latest 10-year bond issue and speculation over a possible
cut in official interest rates at tomorrow's Bundesbank Council meeting also
lent support.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 11.3 per cent in June
after a 13.4 per cent rise in May. This is still well above the Bundesbank's
M3 target of 4 to 6 per cent, which will be reviewed at tomorrow's Council
meeting.
The German government issued DM3bn of 6.75 per cent bunds due 2004 to the
bond consortium and is expected to raise another DM3bn - DM4bn of the stock
at today's US-style auction. Including the Bundesbank's market-tending
allotment, the issue is expected to total DM10bn. It is the first new bund
the government has issued since last September.
However, while some dealers reported healthy investor demand - partly helped
by the paper's rarity value - others said that most of the paper appeared to
have gone into professional hands. 'We saw no retail demand whatsoever,'
said one bund dealer.
US Treasury bonds staged a moderate advance yesterday as the market
anticipated today's congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman.
Late in the session, the 30-year government bond was  13/32 better at 85
21/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.458 per cent. The two-year note was
1/8 ahead at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.894 per cent.
The quiet confidence prevailing in the fixed-income markets since the end of
last week held fast throughout the day. In the morning, prices drifted
higher, with many traders convinced that the economy had slowed enough to
allow the Fed to delay a further increase in short-term interest rates until
after its next policy-making session on August 16.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, was expected to confirm such
suspicions this morning, when he will appear before a Senate committee to
give his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins economic briefing.
Still, activity was restrained, with few traders willing to make substantial
new commitments ahead of Mr Greenspan's testimony.
Later in the afternoon, as the US currency picked up ground against the yen,
bonds extended their earlier gains and finished near their session highs.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Bonds: BT gives the sterling sector a
badly-needed injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications (BT) launched two eurobond offerings yesterday to
refinance the three bonds with a total face value of Pounds 539.7m it bought
back on Monday at the UK Treasury's auction of privatised companies' debt.
BT injected badly-needed supply into the long end of the sterling bond
market when it raised Pounds 300m through an offering of eurobonds due 2020,
which were priced to yield 37 1/2 basis points over the yield on the UK
government's 8 3/4 per cent bond due 2017.
It also raised Dollars 375m (increased from an initial Dollars 300m) through
an issue of three-year eurobonds which were priced to yield 15 basis points
above the 6 1/2 per cent US Treasury due May 1997. The proceeds of this
offering were swapped back into sterling 'at very attractive rates,' BT
said.
The pricing of both issues was thought to be generous in view of BT's high
standing among investors. Syndicate managers said this may have attracted
short-term speculative investors hoping to make a profit, so delaying
placement with long-term investors.
The spread on the dollar bond narrowed to 12 1/2 basis points at one stage
but ended the day at 14 basis points over US Treasuries. By contrast, the
spread on the sterling issue was unchanged at the end of the day.
S. G. Warburg, joint lead manager of the offerings with Lehman Brothers,
rejected suggestions that the dollar tranche was too cheap. It noted that,
compared with a new higher-yielding US Treasury bond due August 1997 due to
be issued next week, the spread was only 6 basis points.
This issue represents the final stage of a programme aimed at restructuring
BT's debt profile, BT said.
Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), the Dutch municipal finance bank, raised
Dollars 1bn through an offering of five-year eurobonds, its first benchmark
issue since it was assigned triple-A debt ratings a month ago.
As expected, the offering was arranged by Goldman Sachs, which acted as
financial adviser to BNG on its rating. Syndicate managers said that while
the pricing of the bonds, to yield 28 basis points over five-year US
Treasuries, was fine, the amount raised was too big given that the demand
was mainly from retail investors. 'The issue should have been Dollars 750m
tops,' said one syndicate manager.
However, Goldman Sachs said it had sold its allocation of bonds by mid-day
and that when the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. It
added that demand had been strongest in Europe.
The lukewarm reception to BNG's bonds, despite the issuer's strong name
recognition among eurobond investors, fanned concerns about the imminent
Dollars 1bn two-year global bond offering by Federal Home Loans.
Market talk that FHL hoped to achieve a yield spread of just 9 basis points
over two-year Treasuries worried many syndicate managers since FHL is still
relatively unknown in the eurobond market.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Manweb buys back Pounds 37m
more of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb, the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier, said
yesterday it had bought back a second tranche of its issued debt due 2008
with a face value of Pounds 37m from the UK Treasury.
However, unlike the debt due 1999 with a face value of Pounds 20m which
Manweb bought back on Monday during the Treasury's sale of debt issued by
privatised utilities, it had to buy the second tranche of debt via SG
Warburg Securities, which the Treasury appointed on Monday to sell the
Manweb 2008 bonds.
The fact that Manweb had been the only company which failed to buy back all
of its debt during Monday's auction prompted rumours in the market that
either Manweb had been badly advised on what it should bid or that it had
believed the debt could be bought later at a lower price.
However, Mr Dennis Hughes, Manweb's treasury manager, said he had been
concerned about overpaying for the 2008 bonds on Monday due to 'alarming
rumours' that he had heard about the level of bids in the market for this
tranche.
Therefore, the company put in a 'reasonable, competitive bid' which was not
successful so it proceeded to buy back the debt yesterday through Warburg.
'I am sure that we would have had to bid far more yesterday (Monday) to be
sure of getting back the bonds than what we bid today,' said Mr Hughes.
Bankers involved in the auction believe that Manweb ended up paying an
additional five basis points to buy back the debt through Warburg.
Manweb said the debt buy-back would result in a charge of Pounds 10.8m to
its 1994 - 95 profits but that the earnings enhancement in future years to
be derived from reduced interest costs would more than compensate for this.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: CS First Boston repays
Dollars 40m loss on derivative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston's asset management arm has repaid around Dollars 40m to
three clients after breaching investment parameters agreed between the bank
and the institutions on a number of derivative-related trades, sources close
to the bank said.
The investments involved are believed to have been securities with embedded
derivatives, such as bonds with returns linked to stock indices or foreign
exchange rates. The investments were severely hit by the recent turmoil in
the financial markets.
The breaches were apparently discovered by the internal compliance
department of CS First Boston.
Mr Keith Walsh, the manager in charge of the accounts, and Mr Nicholas
Bogard, a director of CS First Boston Investment Management, have been
dismissed as a result of the losses, which have resulted in a Dollars 40m
pre-tax write-off.
The Dollars 40m was not related to recent small losses at the First Boston
Institutional Money Market Fund, the management of which also involved Mr
Walsh.
CS First Boston Investment Management, the bank's asset management arm, has
Dollars 22bn under management worldwide.

Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental company which is diversifying
into other entertainment businesses, has reported a 31 per cent increase in
net income for the second-quarter of 1994.
The group made Dollars 63m, or 25 cents a share, compared with Dollars 48m,

492.5m to Dollars 676.3m. System-wide revenue, which includes sales from
franchised video stores, totalled Dollars 841.4m, up 29 per cent.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said same store revenues had risen by 13.1 per
cent at outlets in operation for more than a year, while music retailing
operations had been enhanced by the continuing consolidation of its buying,
distribution and administrative functions.
For the first six months of the year, net income rose by 46 per cent to
Dollars 135.6m, or 53 cents a share, compared with Dollars 92.6m, or 44
cents, in the first half of 1993. Company revenues totalled Dollars 1.37bn,
compared with Dollars 925m.
Mr Huizenga added that the company's programming and distribution businesses

Mr Carl Reichardt, the banker credited with converting Wells Fargo from one
of the most troubled US commercial banks in the late 1980s into one of the

Mr Reichardt, who is 63, said he was retiring because the job of rebuilding
the bank's financial position was complete and he wanted to give other
managers a chance.
'There was just nothing to be gained from hanging around,' he said. 'People

<TEXT>
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS, the television broadcasting network,
yesterday denied the business was for sale and dismissed rumours that
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest US cable system company, might join
forces with Mr Barry Diller, the television executive, to bid for the
company.
Mr Tisch, speaking during a visit to CBS's Hollywood facilities, said:
'Let's make it abundantly clear, CBS is not for sale . . . We have the best
group of executives in television at CBS and I am looking forward to the
challenge of the coming seasons.'
Last week, merger talks between CBS and QVC, the home shopping network
headed by Mr Diller, broke down because of an unexpected bid for QVC from
cable systems company Comcast. Comcast and TCI are substantial shareholders
in QVC.
He dismissed the idea of a TCI/Diller bid and brushed aside rumours that
Walt Disney might bid for CBS.

Trans World Airlines, the sixth biggest US carrier, is to axe air services
to 12 cities in the north-east at the end of the summer as part of its
efforts to restore the airline to profitability. Some 475 jobs will go.
The services being cut are flown by TWA's Trans World Express subsidiary, a
short-haul operator that TWA bought from Pan American World Airways in 1991
to provide feeder services for its long-haul operations out of New York.
TWA said it had become evident that many of the short-haul routes were not
feeding sufficient traffic into the long-haul network to justify the losses
they incurred, and these routes were being cut.
The cities that will lose Trans World Express services are Albany,
Binghamton, Buffalo, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse and Newburgh in New York;
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Manchester, New Hampshire; Providence, Rhode
Island; Richmond, Virginia; and Portland, Maine.
American Airlines said yesterday that it was discontinuing its jet service
between Lubbock and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, from December because it was
unprofitable.

<TEXT>
Plans for two separate theme park ventures in Australia were announced
yesterday, agencies report.
Nine Network, the Australian television company controlled by Mr Kerry
Packer, and Village Roadshow, the leisure industries concern, have formed a
ADollars 100m (USDollars 73.5m) joint venture to develop 'out-of-home'
entertainment concepts in Australia, Asia and the Pacific Rim.
The companies said the venture, to be called Village Nine Leisure, would
create a series of theme parks, entertainment centres and adventure
playgrounds.
Nine Network and Village Roadshow said there were plans to open as many as
20 suburban 'indoor theme parks' in Australian regional centres, in
conjunction with the Westfield group. The parks will include indoor
adaptations of most sports.
The first of the parks, called 'Intencity,' will open in Hurstville in
Sydney in December.
Meanwhile, Sega Enterprises, the Japanese manufacturer of electronic games,
plans to build six space-age indoor theme parks and 20 large-scale arcades
around Australia, at a cost of about ADollars 250m.
Each park is expected to cost up to ADollars 50m to build and equip, while
the arcades are expected to cost between ADollars 2m and ADollars 5m. Sega
expects the first to open early next year.

at Lotus

Lotus Development's share price plunged yesterday when the US personal
computer software company reported a 36 per cent drop in second-quarter
earnings, blamed on product delays and the reorganisation of its sales
force. Lotus shares closed at Dollars 33 1/8 , down Dollars 5 1/8 . The
stock has collapsed from a high of Dollars 86 1/2 in March.
Net earnings from operations for the quarter were Dollars 9.7m, or 20 cents
a share, down from Dollars 15.2m, or 35 cents per share, last year. Revenues
were down 5 per cent at Dollars 224m.
In last year's second quarter, Lotus took a Dollars 19.9m charge related to
the acquisition of Approach Software. After the charge, the company reported
a net loss of Dollars 4.6m, or 11 cents per share. 'Product delays, cyclical
competitive pressures, the reorganisation of our US sales force and the
transition to a new worldwide channel sales programme contributed to our
disappointing second-quarter performance,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and
chief executive.
Lotus failed to release several new products on schedule. It is also under
intense competitive pressure from Microsoft, the largest PC software
company, analysts said. Although Lotus sales of communications software are
growing, it is still heavily dependent upon market segments in which it is
being overtaken by competitors.
Lotus's communications products include Notes, a tool for sharing
information and collaborating across computer networks, and cc:Mail, the
best-selling e-mail program.
'Based on the expected shipment of the delayed products during the next
several weeks and continued momentum in our communications business, we
expect to see improved revenue growth in the second half of the year,' said
Mr Ed Gillis, chief financial officer.
For the half year, Lotus reported net income from operations up 13 per cent
to Dollars 31.1m, or 64 cents per share, on revenues 2 per cent higher at
Dollars 471m.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Revenues at Lehman slide 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers' net income sagged in its first period as a free-standing
investment bank, leaving it with a return on equity of just 2.8 per cent,
well behind what most other US investment banks are expected to report in
the coming days.
Lehman, which completed a spin-off from American Express during the second
quarter, blamed its poor performance in the period on the upheaval in
financial markets.
Revenues slid 22 per cent, to Dollars 696m, with the fall coming in dealing
and underwriting.
Net income was Dollars 20m, down from Dollars 95m a year before, although
Dollars 12m of the drop was due to a one-off after-tax charge associated
with the spin-off.
Mr Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive, said the company had suffered
from lower underwriting volumes in equity and fixed income markets, as well
as less profitable trading with customers as a result of market volatility.
Investment banking revenues fell 27 per cent to Dollars 151m, revenues from
market-making and own-account trading dropped 17 per cent to Dollars 361m.
Commission income fell Dollars 2m, to Dollars 117m.
Bonuses were cut with a 24 per cent reduction in compensation and benefits
payments, to Dollars 364m. Total non-interest costs fell 12 per cent, to
Dollars 646m. Lehman's costs remain high relative to its competitors, and Mr
Fuld said cost-cutting was a priority.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Smith Barney drops 45% from
previous quarter
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Smith Barney, the securities company owned by Travelers, the US financial
services group, posted a 45 per cent fall in earnings in the three months to
the end of June compared with the previous quarter.
The company blamed the fall on lower trading volumes and difficult financial
markets, echoing other financial firms which have reported figures in recent
days.
Smith Barney's net income of Dollars 79m, on revenues of Dollars 1.28bn,
compared with Dollars 144m, on revenues of Dollars 1.45bn, in the previous
period.
Comparisons with a year ago are not relevant since Smith Barney absorbed the
retail broking business of Shearson Lehman in the second half of last year.
The profit decline, which left Smith Barney with return on equity of 14.2
per cent for the period, was behind a fall in profits at Travelers compared
with the previous period.
The financial services group, which changed its name from Primerica after
acquiring the Travelers insurance company at the start of this year,
reported net income of Dollars 320m, or 93 cents a share, and six-month net
income of Dollars 660m, or Dollars 1.89.
Net income at most of Travelers' businesses equalled or exceeded the
previous period, with consumer finance contributing Dollars 55m, Primerica
Financial Services Dollars 52m, the Travelers life and annuities business
Dollars 50m, managed care and employee benefits Dollars 34m, and
property-casualty insurance Dollars 80m.

<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer which last week
announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs, has announced a new structure for its
core computer systems division. The plan involves turning all but its top
1,000 largest customers over to third-party sales and support organisations.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, named last week to head the division, said Digital
served about 8,000 customers, but the 1,000 largest accounts made up some 75
per cent of the group's revenues.
He said the transition would be orderly and he expected customers to be
better served.
Mr Pesatori, who has headed sales and marketing and personal computer
operations, said the new division would consist of three worldwide business
units, each with profit and loss responsibility.
One is the company's PC division, which is to be headed by Mr Bernhard Auer,
who headed the company's European PC business.
A new systems business unit, which will be temporarily headed by Mr
Pesatori, will make Alpha workstations and client server systems and sell
them through partners.
An accounts business unit, headed by Mr Vincenzo Damiani, president of
European operations, will concentrate on sales to the top 1,000 accounts.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Carmakers drive deep into India
 -Foreigners have jump-started a dormant market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the world's leading carmakers are focusing on India, where the
fast-growing, newly-liberalised automotive industry is seen as offering a
great deal of scope for joint ventures with Indian partners.
However, while the manufacturers eye a slice of sales worth Rs39bn (Dollars
1.24bn) a year, some industry watchers feel the market is not nearly as
promising as it seems, especially in the large-car sector that most foreign
investors are targeting.
Last year, General Motors of the US linked up with Calcutta-based Hindustan
Motors - India's oldest carmaker, which produces the Ambassador, the most
commonly seen car on Indian roads - to produce its Opel Astra model.
France's Peugeot Citroen group signed up with Premier Automobiles - which
produces the Indian version of Fiat cars - to make the Peugeot 309.
Rover, the UK carmaker bought this year by Germany's BMW, is collaborating
with Bangalore-based Sipani Automobiles to assemble the Rover Montego.
Mahindra and Mahindra is teaming up with Chrysler to make the Cherokee
four-wheel-drive, using an earlier collaboration with Peugeot for the
vehicle's engines and gearboxes.
Telco, part of India's Tata group, has signed up to make the German
Mercedes-Benz E220, and South Korea's Daewoo Corporation last month entered
into a joint venture with the Delhi-based DCM group, which already has a
tie-up with Japan's Toyota, to make the Daewoo Racer.
Until recently, India's car market was languishing, dominated by obsolete
models of Fiats and Ambassadors which owners used for 15 years or more. The
industry has been given a much-needed boost in the last decade by the
introduction of the Maruti-Suzuki, produced by Maruti Udyog, a
government-owned company, and Suzuki of Japan.
The company, started by Mrs Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay in the late 1970s,
relied on a mix of political patronage and Japanese technology to corner 71
per cent of the 210,000 cars sold in India in the 12 months to last March.
The company's 800cc model, which was meant to be a 'cheap' family car,
became the status symbol of the growing 200m-strong middle classes. The
market registered an increase of more than 30 per cent in the last year, and
the industry expects a further 20 per cent boost in the current year.
Indian demand for new cars is expected to more than double, to 500,000 a
year, by 2000; the numbers sound encouraging, but not encouraging enough by
international standards for an industry dependent on large volumes.
'The global giants are racing into the Indian market, but they all seem to
be targeting the top end of the market,' said an official at the Automobile
Association of Upper India. 'The new cars are all priced in the Rs400,000 to
Rs600,000 range, and only a small section of the so-called middle class will
be able to afford them.'
However, Mr Vivek Bharat Ram, vice-chairman of DCM Toyota, is convinced
there is a 'nascent demand' for cars in the premium sector. 'There will
always be a demand for the small 800cc car, but we have perceived a distinct
shift in favour of a larger-sized family car that gives quality at an
affordable price.'
Mr Ram believes that the bottom will fall out of the small-car market, which
currently commands nearly 60 per cent of the new car market.
'Our survey shows there is an untapped demand for relatively larger cars,
and modern technology will be instrumental in boosting that demand,' he
says.
Industry watchers, however, tend to agree with Mr R. C. Bhargava, managing
director of Maruti, that it is the small-car sector that will continue to
grow fastest. 'The argument that the premium car market is growing faster
does not hold good, because it is from a much lower base,' says Mr Bhargava.
'If it is the middle classes we are looking at, then people who are driving
two-wheelers will move up to the 800cc small car, not the larger cars,' says
Mr AC Mehta, an executive with Telco.
For Daimler Benz, 'India is a market of the future,' according to a company
spokesman visiting the sub-continent recently. The Mercedes E220, priced at
Rs1.5m, will be the most expensive of the new cars entering the market, with
the Rover Montego following at Rs1m.
The manufacturers are confident that there are enough rich Indians who will
want to own large cars, and that it is a segment which will grow in time.
'Judging by the prices, very few Indians will be able to afford the new
cars,' says the Automobile Association official. He hopes that some of the
new ventures being planned will seriously consider a 'common man's car,' a
basic, low-cost alternative to the small Marutis.

Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, reported record revenue
and earnings for the second quarter. It was the eighth consecutive quarter
the company has achieved revenue and earnings records.
Rising sales of Pentium chips, Intel's latest generation of microprocessors
for use in high-performance personal computers, helped drive second-quarter
growth, the company said. Second-quarter revenue rose 30 per cent to Dollars
2.77bn from Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net income was up
12 per cent at Dollars 640m, or Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with Dollars
569m, or Dollars 1.30, in last year's second quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street projections.
'We had a solid quarter as growing sales of PCs increased demand for Intel
microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief execu-tive.
'We are particularly pleased with the rapid move of Pentium processor-based
systems into the PC mainstream, as we continue to drive the most aggressive
processor ramp in our history.'
During the quarter, PCs using chips produced by Intel's latest process
technology began to reach computer users. Microprocessors produced with this
technology were rapidly becoming the base for the highest performing
volume-produced computers in each segment of the PC market, the company
said.
Revenue increased from first-quarter levels in all geographic markets, with
the Asia-Pacific region and Japan showing the strongest growth rates.
American revenues accounted for 51 per cent of sales; Europe 27 per cent;
the Asia-Pacific region 14 per cent; and Japan 8 per cent.
For the first half of 1994, revenues were Dollars 5.43bn, up 31 per cent
from Dollars 4.15bn in the first half of last year. Net income grew 13 per
cent to Dollars 1.26bn, or Dollars 2.86 per share, from Dollars 1.12bn, or
Dollars 2.53.

for year

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ifi, the financial holding group of the Agnelli family, recorded a L285bn
(Dollars 184m) loss on its consolidated balance sheet in 1993 compared with
profits of L2,389bn in the previous year.
A company statement attributed the sharp swing to a consolidated loss
primarily to the troubled performance of Fiat, the automotive group in which
the Agnellis still retain part of their stake through Ifi.
In 1993 Fiat suffered a net loss of L1,783bn and the group was obliged to
pass over a dividend payment on ordinary shares for the first time since
1947.
The non-consolidated balance sheet was also affected by the Fiat group's
performance, the company said. The 1993 profit was down to L110.2bn from
L151.2bn.
At the Ifi annual meeting on September 30, the board will be proposing a
L270 dividend for privileged shares reduced from L365.
For ordinary shares the dividend will be cut to L220 from L315.

<TEXT>
Chemical Banking lifted underlying post-tax profits 9 per cent in the second
quarter as a lower loan loss provision helped to offset the effects of lower
revenues from trading in financial markets.
However, the headline profit figure fell to Dollars 357m, or Dollars 1.28 a
share, from Dollars 381m, or Dollars 1.35, a year earlier when the bank had
benefited from Dollars 54m of one-off tax benefits.
Total revenues fell during the second quarter as net interest income edged
up just Dollars 10m to Dollars 1.185bn and non-interest income dropped
Dollars 175m to Dollars 867m.
The non-interest figure was affected by a decline in trading revenues to
Dollars 203m, from Dollars 298m the year before.
The bank blamed 'difficult conditions in certain markets,' including
emerging country debt, European government bonds and foreign exchange
markets, for the decline. Also, the year-ago period benefited from a one-off
gain of Dollars 44m from the sale of Brazilian bonds.
Loan loss provisions dropped from Dollars 205m to Dollars 160m.
Mr Walter Shipley, chairman and chief executive, said the bank was
benefiting from 'a further improvement in . . . risk profile, including a
substantial reduction in non-performing assets and another sharp decline in
our provision and other credit costs'.
The bank's return on equity dropped from 15.97 per cent the year before to
13.9 per cent, behind the level achieved by many of its peers. Post-tax
profits for the first half as a whole were Dollars 676m, down from Dollars
720m.
BancOne, the Ohio-based regional banking group, reported a sharp fall in its
net interest margin during the second three months of the year as US
interest rates were ratcheted up.
The bank's margin had been buoyed in recent periods by its use of interest
rate swaps to enhance earnings, an effect which ended with the rate rises.
The net interest margin fell from 6.29 per cent a year ago to 5.51 per cent.
The decline was partly due to increasing competition among banks to make
loans, which had driven down the pricing, the bank said. It added that it
had reversed its treasury policy to make itself less vulnerable to future
interest rate rises.
Net income for the period rose 12 per cent to Dollars 316m, or 81 cents a
share, from Dollars 282m, or 73 cents, the year before.
A gradual recovery in the Californian economy, after three-and-a-half years
of recession, helped San Francisco-based Wells Fargo record a 38 per cent
rise in second quarter net income, to Dollars 206m, or Dollars 3.57 a share,
from Dollars 149m, or Dollars 2.46, the year before.
Pointing to what he called a weak economic recovery, Mr Carl Reichardt,
chairman and chief executive, said loan balances had risen for the second
consecutive quarter, and were now 3 per cent higher than at the end of 1993.
The recovery also added to a fall in the quarterly loan loss provision, to
Dollars 60m from Dollars 140m.
Lower-yielding assets pushed the net interest margin down from 5.71 per cent
to 5.56 per cent. However, Wells Fargo still managed a return on equity of
21.67 per cent.

Sprint, the US tele-communications group in which France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom recently agreed to take a stake, yesterday reported a 40
per cent rise in second quarter net income, powered by its long distance
division.
Net income totalled Dollars 220m, or 63 cents a share, compared with Dollars
157m, or 46 cents, last time. Operating revenues rose from Dollars 2.8bn to
Dollars 3.15bn. Income from continuing operations advanced 33 per cent to
Dollars 220m.
Operating income in the long distance unit rose 30 per cent, against the
second quarter of last year, and totalled Dollars 158m on revenues 12 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.7bn. Minutes of use rose 12 per cent on a year ago.
Sprint's local telephone operations saw operating income rise 8 per cent to
Dollars 255m, while revenues were 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.08bn.
Its wireless phone business produced operating income of Dollars 25m, up
from Dollars 8m.
For the six months net income was Dollars 447m, or Dollars 1.28, including a
Dollars 22m non recurring gain, compared with a 1993 net loss of Dollars
256m, or 75 cents a share.
GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported
second quarter net income of Dollars 595m, or 62 cents, against Dollars
438m, or 46 cents, in the same period last time. The 1994 results included
Dollars 71m of after-tax gains from the sale of operations, while last
year's figures included a Dollars 46m one-time charge. Excluding special
items, earnings per share rose 8 per cent.
Local telephone operations produced operating income of Dollars 1.06bn, up 6
per cent, and minutes of use rose 9.8 per cent. Cellular operations saw a 74
per cent increase in operating income, to Dollars 80m.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch tumbles 37% as
currency swings take toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch's post-tax profits tumbled by 37 per cent in the second
quarter, compared with a year ago, as the upheaval in US and foreign
financial markets took their toll.
However, the dominance of the US securities underwriting business and
further growth in assets under management supported earnings, enabled it to
report an impressive 18.5 per cent return on equity during the period.
Mr Dan Tully, chairman and chief executive, called the three months to June
'the most difficult operating environment for our industry in over three
years'.
He blamed rising interest rates, unsettled currency markets, investor
caution and a fall-off in the issuance of new securities worldwide for the
second quarter fall in earnings.
Volatility in the markets led to a fall in profits from principal
transactions to Dollars 561m, a quarter lower than a year before.
The drop in underwriting revenues led to a 22 per cent fall in investment
banking revenues, to Dollars 322m, although Merrill claimed 17 per cent of
the US underwriting business and 14 per cent of underwriting worldwide.
As a result, revenues nonetheless dropped 6 per cent from the 1993 period,
to Dollars 2.4bn, despite a 3 per cent rise in commissions, to Dollars 691m.
With non-interest costs flat at Dollars 2bn, net income during the period
fell to Dollars 252m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars 345m, or Dollars
1.51, a year before, when the strong financial markets had pushed Merrill to
a return on equity of 22.9 per cent.
For the first six months, net income fell to Dollars 624m, or Dollars 2.87 a
share, from Dollars 852m, or Dollars 3.03, in the first half of 1993.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital Equipment agrees Dollars
400m sale to Quantum

Digital Equipment is selling substantial portions of its data storage
business to Quantum, a Silicon Valley computer disk drive manufacturer, for
approximately Dollars 400m.
The sale is the first in a series of divestitures planned by Digital as the
company 'downsizes' its operations in a struggle to improve its financial
performance.
Digital announced last week it would dispose of certain 'non-strategic'
assets and lay off 20,000 workers over the next 12 months.
Quantum, the world's largest disk drive manufacturer, will acquire Digital's
magnetic disk drive, tape drive, solid state disk, and thin-film heads
businesses.
The transaction also includes Digital's 81 per cent interest in Rocky
Mountain Magnetics, a leader in the development of magneto-resistive disk
drive technology, which is widely seen as an important technology for
increasing the data storage capacity of disk drives.
Digital will also sign a contract under which Quantum will supply a
substantial portion of Digital's internal hard disk drive requirements. The
terms of the supply agreement were not disclosed.
Quantum said the acquisition would enable it to become a significant force
in the high-capacity disk drive market. Its sales for the fiscal year ending
in March were Dollars 2.1bn.
'While these segments of our storage business unit have been highly
successful and represent some of the best technology in the world, this
agreement enables Digital to sharpen our focus on our core computer systems
and components businesses,' said Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's president and
chief executive.
There are around 5,000 regular and temporary employees in the Digital
businesses being purchased by Quantum.
Quantum will also buy Digital facilities in the US and Malaysia while
leasing others in the US and Indonesia.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Record profit of Dollars 1.52bn
at GE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
General Electric, the US conglomerate which has been severely embarrassed by
a bond trading scandal at its Kidder, Peabody securities business, yesterday
reported a 14 per cent increase in second quarter earnings to a record
Dollars 1.52bn.
The earnings worked through at 89 cents a share and compared with income of
Dollars 1.33bn, or 78 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose 10
per cent from Dollars 14.76bn to Dollars 16.2bn.
The company said nine of its 12 businesses reported improved comparable
operating profits, and eight of them reported double digit increases:
appliances, transportation, motors, power systems, plastics, lighting,
medical and GE Capital Services.
Operating profits were lower at aircraft engines and at NBC, the television
broadcasting network. The dip at NBC was attributed mainly to the lack of
programming as strong as 1993's final episode of the popular comedy series
Cheers.
Earnings at GE Capital rose 12 per cent to Dollars 463m. The company said
excellent performances in the consumer, specialty, insurance and equipment
management segments more than offset the Dollars 29m net loss at Kidder. The
securities firm, the market leader firm in the mortgage-backed securities
business, has been hit by a downturn in the fixed income sector.
In the first quarter Kidder took a Dollars 210m charge to cover what GE says
were phantom profits generated by Mr Joseph Jett, the former head of its
government bond trading desk.
GE said the group's second quarter operating margin was 15.3 per cent,
against 14.2 per cent a year ago.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that 'rapid introduction of new products
coupled with continued expansion into new markets puts GE in an excellent
position to achieve record performance in 1994'.
For the six months, earnings were Dollars 2.59bn, or Dollars 1.52, against
Dollars 2.42bn, or Dollars 1.41 a share, excluding accounting charges and
earnings of discontinued businesses.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales slip in Europe behind fall
at Unisys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unisys, the US computer company, reported a decline in revenues and earnings
for the second quarter as European sales of mainframe computers slowed.
Net income was Dollars 49.9m, or 12 cents a fully diluted share, down
sharply from Dollars 103m, or 39 cents, in the same period last year.
Revenues fell to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 1.93bn.
'Our results in the quarter did not meet our expectations,' said Mr James
Unruh, chairman and chief executive. The company had warned that earnings
would drop, based on slower than anticipated sales in Europe and declining
US government systems sales.
'Our US government business declined while our worldwide commercial revenue
was flat, year-to-year,' said Mr Unruh. However, US commercial business and
sales in the Asia Pacific region grew, he added.
European revenue, although continuing to decline, is doing so at a slower
rate than over the past six months, the company said. Unisys said it would
not plan on growth in European revenue until the fourth quarter, at the
earliest.
'Despite these current business conditions, the transformation of Unisys is
on track,' Mr Unruh said.
Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses.
Revenues, however, have continued to decline.
For the half year, Unisys reported net income of Dollars 109.9m, or 28 cents
a fully diluted share, against net income of Dollars 363.6m, or Dollars
1.48. The 1994 half-year included a charge of Dollars 7.7m for costs
associated with repurchase of debt.
The 1993 figure included a net gain from accounting changes of Dollars
203.8m, or 83 cents.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool turns in best-ever
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the world's largest producer of white goods, yesterday announced
its best-ever quarterly earnings - and revenues that for the first time
exceeded Dollars 2bn for a three-month period.
Net income for the second quarter rose from Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.04 a
share, to Dollars 84m, or Dollars 1.10, which included a 3 cents a share
restructuring charge. Revenues rose from Dollars 1.91bn to Dollars 2.05bn,
in spite of the sale this year of the company's European compressor
business.
Whirlpool's improved performance was broadly based. Second-quarter product
shipments in its North American Appliance Group rose at a double- digit
pace, as the company increased the combined market share of its KitchenAid,
Whirlpool and Roper brands.
Whirlpool Europe continued to increase market share by raising product
shipments in an 'essentially flat' market, compared with the second quarter
of 1993. In Latin America integration of manufacturing contributed to higher
total earnings from the region.
In the expanding Asian white goods market, Whirlpool's product shipments and
revenues grew at rates of about 40 per cent. But further spending on
expansion led to a quarterly loss, as expected.
Profits for the first six months rose to Dollars 151m, or Dollars 2, against
a net loss of Dollars 88m, or Dollars 1.23, a year earlier, reflecting
Dollars 220m of accounting charges.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer in Asian venture with
Swiss group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based marketing and distribution group, aims to lift
its presence in the Asia Pacific region through a joint venture with Cosa
Liebermann, a privately-held Swiss company.
The joint venture, HCL, will be based in Hong Kong and may seek a listing on
the Hong Kong stock exchange to underline the company's Asian character and
ease access to Asian capital markets.
The 50:50 joint venture will pool the two companies' combined Asian Pacific
operations in more than 13 countries. Its turnover will total about Fl 1.4bn
(Dollars 809m), with a similar amount likely every year in commission income
through third-party sales.
Hagemeyer, whose activities in Asia are smaller than those of Cosa
Liebermann, will pay Fl 100m to its Swiss partners to make up the difference
in assets. The move will meet Hagemeyer's objective of bolstering its Asian
businesses.
Mr Andrew Land, Hagemeyer chairman, said the partners had complementary
businesses in Asia, where both are active in the marketing and distribution
of brand-name products.
For Hagemeyer, which is 50.3 per cent owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong,
the deal is partly a response to the loss in January of its role as an agent
for Matsushita products in Singapore. The decision by Matsushita, the
Japanese electronics group, to do its own Singapore distribution led to a
halving of Hagemeyer's Asian turnover of roughly Fl 800m per year.
However, the termination of the Matsushita contract produced an
extraordinary gain of nearly Fl 80m for Hagemeyer. The company said
yesterday its first-half results, due to be published on August 24, would
show net profit of about Fl 140m, including the extraordinary gain. This
compares with a net profit of Fl 50.6m in the 1993 first half, when no
extraordinary gains were recorded.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Exide bids for Banesto's Tudor stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exide Corporation, the largest US producer of car batteries, yesterday moved
to establish a hold in the European market by launching a Pta31.5bn (Dollars
248m) bid for Tudor, the Spanish automotive and industrial battery company.
The Michigan-based company, which went public last autumn, has reached a
memorandum of understanding with Corporacion Banesto to negotiate the
purchase of its 57 per cent stake in Tudor as part of a public tender offer
for the whole of the battery company.
The bid comes only four months after Exide paid more than Pounds 20m
(Dollars 30.4m) for Big Batteries, the Welsh company which is the UK's
largest privately-owned maker of automotive batteries.
The Spanish deal will give Exide a larger presence in Europe and one of the
continent's best-known battery brand names.
Tudor is ranked third overall in the European battery market behind
Germany's Varta and Fiat of Italy's Ceac-Marelli group.
The Spanish company has 19 per cent of the European automotive (starter)
battery market and 15 per cent of Europe's industrial battery sector.
Just over half Tudor's production is concentrated in Spain but it also
manufactures in Portugal and Germany. In Scandinavia it owns the local
battery producers Hagen and Neste.
Last year the company made 77 per cent of its sales outside Spain.
The proposed takeover marks the first large disposal by the Corporacion
Banesto, after its parent, Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) was bought by
Banco Santander in a Dollars 2bn acquisition three months ago .
Although Banesto officials stressed yesterday that there would be no 'fire
sales' of the bank's industrial assets, analysts considered Exide's bid of
Pta1,145 per Tudor share for outright ownership of Tudor to be cheap.
The US company's bid was below the Pta1,245 price at which Tudor shares
closed on Monday, before details of the takeover were disclosed, and well
down on the battery producer's Pta1,375 year high trading price in April.
At the beginning of this year Iberagentes Bolsa, the Spanish broking arm of
Credit Lyonnais, valued Tudor shares at Pta1,500.
Tudor posted pre-tax losses of Pta4.2bn last year, compared with a 1992
deficit of Pta1.7bn. The increase in losses was due to a strong fall in
extraordinary income when expected land sales fell through, and to
continuing restructuring costs. The workforce was cut by 1,500 to 4,500 last
year and will fall to 3,500 by 1995.
Exide said last night it expected 'a brisk conclusion' to the talks with
Corporacion Banesto. The proposed takeover is part of a plan to boost sales
growth and is timed to take advantage of recovery in European markets.

Dollars 7.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cincinnati Milacron, the US machine tool and plastics machinery producer,
lifted second-quarter earnings by nearly 30 per cent and announced its best
quarter for new orders.
Net profits were Dollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, compared with profits
before extraordinary items of Dollars 6.2m, or 19 cents, in 1993. Sales
advanced to Dollars 269.3m from Dollars 236.6m.
New orders totalled Dollars 302m, against Dollars 232m a year ago and
Dollars 267m in the first quarter of this year. Orders exceeded shipments
causing the backlog to grow to Dollars 299m, up more than Dollars 50m so far
this year.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive, conceded that part of the
increase in new business came from the recently acquired Ferramatik, a
German producer of injection moulding machines.
Second-quarter machine tool sales fell year-on-year to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 78m, and the business had an operating loss of Dollars 900,000,
against operating profits of Dollars 1.6m a year ago.
Six month profits were Dollars 12.9m or 37 cents, compared with Dollars 9.8m
or 32 cents. That was before extraordinary items - mainly accounting changes
 -which left Milacron with a Dollars 46.8m net loss.

<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US soft drink and fast food company that last month warned of
flat profits in its second quarter, yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in
net income for the term to Dollars 446.5m
However, further indications of its difficulties came with the announcement
of another top management change. Just one week after the departure of Mr
Jeff Campbell, senior vice-president for brand development, PepsiCo said Mr
John Cranor, chief executive of its KFC fast food business, had resigned.
Mr David Novak, a Pepsi-Cola North America executive, will become chief
executive of KFC-USA, and Mr Larry Zwain will remain chief executive of KFC
International. Both will report directly to Mr Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo
chairman and chief executive.
Yesterday, PepsiCo confirmed that 11 per cent growth in revenues from
domestic beverages had been partly offset by higher discounts to retailers,
producing a 5 per cent increase in operating profits to Dollars 270.9m.
Internationally, operating profits from beverages fell by 23 per cent to
Dollars 64.1m, mainly because last year's figure included a one-off Dollars
11.9m credit.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Citicorp writes off Latin
American investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp has written Dollars 157m off the value of some of its Latin
American investments, and is sending a senior executive to the region to
take charge of its interests there.
The bank would not provide any details of the write-downs, although they are
believed to have been made mainly in equity investments acquired in
debt-equity swap agreements.
These are arrangements under which the bank took an equity interest in local
companies in return for giving up part of its debt claims against them. They
were part of the debt reduction plans that stemmed from the Latin American
debt crisis of the 1980s.
Citicorp said yesterday Mr Mike deGraffenried, an executive vice-president
who had represented it in the negotiations over Brazil's foreign debt, was
moving to Buenos Aires to oversee its equity interests in Latin America.
These include both the results of debt-equity swaps and investments in
financial companies in the region. He is 'being dispatched to maximise
values from debt-equity swaps,' the bank said.
The effects of the write-downs, taken in the second quarter, were offset by
profits of Dollars 244m during the same three-month period on bonds the bank
holds as a result of Brazil's debt restructuring agreements. Some Dollars
173m came from recording bonds issued as part of a recent agreement at
market value, with the rest from the sale of bonds issued in a previous
restructuring. Citicorp said the events were unrelated.
Against this background, and the benefit of a Dollars 150m deferred tax
adjustment, second quarter earnings were ahead of market expectations.
The US's biggest commercial bank reported net income of Dollars 877m, or
Dollars 1.64 a share (fully diluted), compared with Dollars 446m, or 82
cents, a year ago.
The figures confirmed its continuing recovery from the credit problems of
the early 1980s. Commercial non-performing loans dropped by Dollars 1.3bn,
the bank said, while the loan loss provision for the latest period fell to
Dollars 361m from Dollars 442m. Revenues fell marginally from a year before,
though, to Dollars 4.2bn. For the first six months, net income rose to
Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 3.07 a share, from Dollars 816m, or Dollars 1.59,
a year before.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Illinois Central takes over
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Illinois Central, one of the 12 biggest freight railroads in the US, is to
take over another of the biggest, Kansas City Southern, in an all-share deal
worth Dollars 702m, the two groups said yesterday.
The takeover comes less than three weeks after two other large railroads,
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific, said they planned to merge in a
deal worth Dollars 2.8bn.
The latest deal will bring together the 10th and 11th largest US railroad
systems and create a network spanning 14 mid-western and southern states. It
will link the markets of Chicago, New Orleans, Memphis, Kansas City, Port
Arthur, Dallas and Birmingham.
Kansas City Southern is being sold by its parent company, Kansas City
Southern Industries, because the parent wants to concentrate on its non-rail
activities in the financial services sector. It plans to spin off these
businesses - mainly the DST Systems data processing operation and the Janus
Capital fund management business - through a free distribution of shares.
The parent company had announced the railroad was for sale in May. Companies
thought most likely to buy it were Burlington Northern, Santa Fe Pacific and
Illinois Central, but Burlington and Santa Fe put themselves out of the
running by deciding to seek a merger with each other.
In exchange for the railroad, Kansas City Southern Industries' shareholders
will get 21.2m Illinois Central shares, which were trading yesterday morning
Dollars  1/8 down at Dollars 33 1/8 . Illinois Central will assume Dollars
929m of Kansas City Southern Industries' debt.
If approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory
body, the takeover will vie with the Burlington/Santa Fe deal to become the
biggest railroad merger since a wave of consolidations took place in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.
The Illinois/Kansas City merger is less likely to face anti-trust objections
than the Burlington/Santa Fe deal because it is considerably smaller, but
neither deal is likely to win approval until next year.
US freight railroads have been enjoying a renaissance caused by a
combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency and
productivity, and a shortage of capacity in the long-distance trucking
industry caused by driver shortages.
The logic for railroad mergers is that it gives their customers better
service to an increased range of destinations without costly delays at the
borders between different company's networks. The increased traffic density
can usually be accommodated without a matching increase in costs.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cott steps up own-brand drive
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cott Corporation, the fast-growing maker of private-label soft drinks, has
set up a venture to help North American and European supermarkets expand
their range of retailer-controlled products.
The new company, which has yet to be named, is a joint venture between Cott
and Mr David Nichol, formerly a senior executive at Loblaws, Canada's
biggest grocery chain.
The first products - likely to include ice creams, fruit juices and snack
foods - will be available next spring.
Mr Nichol spearheaded a successful retailer-brand programme at Loblaws, and
has carved out a reputation as one of North America's most outspoken
champions of retailer-controlled products in the assault on national brands.
He recently helped J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket group, launch Cott-made
soft drinks under the Sainsbury's Classic label.
The low-priced Sainsbury brand garnered a market share of almost 75 per cent
in its first nine weeks on the shelves, while Coca-Cola's share of Sainsbury
sales fell to 9 per cent from 44 per cent.
However, the investment community has given Cott's diversification plans a
lukewarm response. Cott shares have tumbled by about 13 per cent on the
Toronto Stock Exchange in the past two days, to CDollars 16.62 at
mid-morning yesterday.
Mr Nichol said yesterday the venture's customers would be mainly North
American retailers expanding their private-label portfolios but lacking the
experience in this sort of development. He said several European retailers
had asked for help in broadening private-label ranges.

<TEXT>
British Gas and its part-owned US affiliate Natural Gas Clearinghouse have
formed a joint venture to trade fuel in the UK.
The new company, Accord Energy, would combine BG's strength in the UK market
with NGC's commercial skills and experience of trading in the deregulated
North American market, according to Mr Russell Herbert, the managing
director of BG Global Gas who will be its chairman.
Initially, the company will focus on trading short term gas in the wholesale
market, and will support the development of a liquid spot market in the UK.
Later, it will expand internationally, and include other fuels such as oil,
electricity, liquified gas and derivative products.
The new company will be 51 per cent owned by BG and 49 per cent by NGC.
British Gas owns 39 per cent of NGC which is one of the leading gatherers,
processors and marketers of natural gas in the US.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Freeport Leisure heads for market after
Pounds 4.6m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Freeport Leisure yesterday announced the purchase of Hornsea Freeport, the
factory outlet and leisure centre, for Pounds 4.6m from Peter Black, the
Marks and Spencer footwear, cosmetics and accessories supplier.
Factory outlet malls, common in the US but still rare in the UK, offer
customers deep discounts on branded goods which are typically over-runs,
cancelled orders, end of ranges or slight seconds.
Hornsea Freeport, established by Peter Black on the outskirts of Hornsea in
east Yorkshire three years ago, is occupied by 18 companies including
Aquascutum, Benetton, Damart and Laura Ashley. It also houses leisure
activities such as playgrounds, a model village and The Yorkshire Car
Collection. With a catchment area of 1m people within 90 minutes' travelling
time, the centre attracted 1.4m visitors last year.
Mr Sean Collidge, Freeport Leisure's managing director, said he believed
factory shopping was 'the only major growth area in retailing in the next
decade'. He anticipated the market could cope with 30 sites and that Hornsea
Freeport could manage six or seven sites over the next five years.
The Hornsea purchaser, a shell company which recently changed its name to
Freeport Leisure, will seek a stock exchange listing after the acquisition.
It will fund the deal by placing 7.2m shares and making an 8-for-1 rights
issue of 2m new shares at 65p a share.
The rights issue, which is not underwritten, will raise about Pounds 1.35m.
The proceeds of the placing and rights issue together are expected to total
some Pounds 5.5m after expenses. The company's market capitalisation will be
about Pounds 6.4m.
Peter Black has agreed to subscribe for 1.6m shares, giving it a 16.4 per
cent stake in the company. Mr Thomas Black, a director of Peter Black since
1971 and joint chairman since 1977, will become a non-executive chairman of
Freeport Leisure.
The funds raised will also be used to finance a second factory outlet centre
at a cost of Pounds 3m. Mr Collidge hoped the second facility in north-west
England would open next spring with a catchment area of 5m people within 90
minutes' travelling time. Two further sites were at an advanced stage of
planning.
Mr Collidge, who has a background in high street retailing, said he was
aware of opposition from some retailers who feared the deep discounts would
undercut their business. However, the concept of setting up malls some
distance from high streets allowed manufacturers to dispose of surplus and
other stock at a profit without significantly affecting traditional sales
channels.
Only 10 per cent of clothing in the UK is sold through discount outlets,
compared with almost 50 per cent in the US, and factory centres are likely
to narrow the gap. There are currently some 300 US factory malls with a
further 150 planned. Hornsea is one of only two in the UK but developers are
planning another 15.
For the year ended June 1993, Hornsea Freeport made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 267,000 (Pounds 45,000) on sales of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.21m). In
the 10-month period to 9 April it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 332,000
on sales of Pounds 1.62m.
In February Peter Black reported a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 5.73m to Pounds 7.01m. The distribution, leisure and
retail sector contributed Pounds 948,000 (Pounds 845,000) to profits despite
flat turnover of Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 7m).

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birkby expands via I-Mex acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birkby, the space management and hire purchase group, has accelerated its
expansion programme with the acquisition of I-Mex Group, a privately-owned
manager of commercial and light industrial units.
Birkby, which established a national presence earlier this year with the
Pounds 58.7m purchase of In-Shops, has agreed to pay a nominal sum for
I-Mex; it will also repay its property mortgages and acquire its outstanding
debts.
I-Mex made operating profits of Pounds 731,000 (losses of Pounds 4.46m) in
the year to March 31.
The deal follows a debt reduction agreement between Birkby and Hill Samuel,
the mortgage lender on 14 of I-Mex's 18 workspace centres.
Mr Kim Taylor-Smith, Birkby's deputy chief executive, said Hill Samuel had
agreed to reduce I-Mex's debt from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 19.3m. Of that,
Birkby will repay Pounds 7.87m from existing cash resources and raise a
further Pounds 11.4m through the placing of 4.43m new shares at 257p.
'This was an opportunity to acquire quality workspace at an attractive
price, and it will allow us to expand our concept in the north of England
and the Midlands,' he said.
The I-Mex portfolio also includes an interest in two space management
projects in the Netherlands.
In addition to the placing, handled by Charterhouse Tilney Securities, Bank
of Scotland has agreed to extend Pounds 3.1m of a Pounds 5m term loan
facility owed by I-Mex. The balance is expected to be repaid from group
resources following the acquisition.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company, has begun a new round of
trials for its kidney transplant drug, writes Daniel Green.
The trials are the first placebo-controlled in phase II, which is designed
to assess how well the drug works. If they go well, it would be put through
the much larger phase III trials before approval and product launch in 1997.
The drug is being developed with Baxter International, the US healthcare
company.
The drug, code-named LM-CD45, is designed to reduce the chance of a newly
transplanted kidney being rejected by the patient.
'LM-CD45 holds the promise of reducing the frequency of acute rejection,
thereby improving the success rate and cost-effectiveness of the transplant
procedure,' said Mr Don Joseph, president of Baxter's renal division.
Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said the company was investigating the use
of the drug to prevent rejection in transplants of other organs.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered's brave new order - A
look at the reorganisation planned to prevent further scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On one of the panes of a large stained glass window which decorates Standard
Chartered's Hong Kong headquarters are the Chinese characters 'dong fang
hung' - the East is Red.
The phrase comes from a celebrated Cultural Revolution hymn to Mao Zedong,
the late Chinese dictator, but it could well describe faces among Standard's
top executives.
The past 20 days have not been the best in the bank's 144-year history.
On June 28, there was the censure from the Securities and Future's
Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, over the participation by its
securities company and merchant bank in questionable share price support
schemes.
Then came the revelation at the weekend that two top executives from
Mocatta, Standard's gold and silver bullion dealer, had been sacked after
employees in Malaysia and the Philippines had offered bribes to central
bankers to direct their bullion purchases through Mocatta.
With memories of the bank's unfortunate experiences in the Bombay securities
trading scandal still fresh in investors' minds, it seems as if Standard is
never going to get it right in the east.
Neither of the two scandals which have jolted the bank this year compare in
scale to that of Bombay, which necessitated a Pounds 269m provision for
possible losses in 1992. Moreover, the Mocatta incident came to light as a
result of current management's action.
For Mr John McFarlane, an executive director now stationed in Hong Kong, the
scandals were the result of inadequate management control - which he plans
to put right.
As part of a reorganisation of the bank's businesses - a Standard Chartered
Markets division is being created - Mr McFarlane plans to concentrate
initially on issues relating to compliance, fiduciary responsibility and
code of conduct.
For the new markets division, he will soon announce two new executives.
The first, a global operations manager, will be responsible for the group's
back office procedures. The second appointment will focus on compliance,
market risk and regulation.
'I don't want to be at the mercy of local managers as to the operating
integrity of the businesses . . . I want a robust series of independent
controls that bite hard on the business and communicate rapidly up to me,'
he says.
Won't this bureaucracy slow down business?
Mr McFarlane contends that today's manager spends far too much time on
administrative detail and not enough on the development of the business.
The new positions will free managers to develop the bank, while giving Mr
McFarlane a 'magnifying glass' on their business.
He is also equally firm that Standard will not be involved in any businesses
where bribery or unethical behaviour is an entry or operational requirement.
'If that means we do not operate in a certain line of business or offer a
certain product, then that's fine. It's not for us,' he says.
Mr McFarlane clearly believes that the bank is able to hold these beliefs
about business practice and successfully execute the strategy recently laid
out by its top executives. This sees Standard as 'an Asian and emerging
markets bank', which will engage in international banking to service its
clients from those regions.
He was involved in the development of this strategy, which to him is a
recognition of the obvious. The bank has more than 60 per cent of its net
assets in Asia/Pacific and the Middle East and south Asia. More than half
its profits derive from Asia/Pacific alone, the largest slice of which comes
from its banking operations in Hong Kong where it occupies the number three
slot after Hongkong Bank and Bank of China.
Mr McFarlane, a management school graduate, liberally peppers his analysis
with phrases such as 'key success factors', 'focus', and 'matrix
management'. Standard has divided its business into three broad functions -
corporate banking, personal banking, and markets - which overlay geographic
responsibilities.
Mr McFarlane will manage Standard's global markets unit from Hong Kong,
while Mr David Moir, another director, manages the bank's corporate banking
function from Singapore.
Standard Chartered Markets, as the new group will be known, consists of four
businesses:
Investment banking: comprising stock broking and corporate finance. Mr
McFarlane is personally supervising Standard Chartered Securities and
Standard Chartered Asia - the bank's Hong Kong broking and investment
banking subsidiaries that were censured by the colony's regulators.
He says his priorities are first to make sure of the 'absolute integrity' of
the operating companies: 'We will not tolerate another control failure in
these areas.'
Then he plans to address strategic business development issues, recruitment
of 'world class' executives to manage the businesses and, finally, their
management for long-term profit.
'You need to be local in markets but at the same time you need a
distribution presence in London and New York, in particular,' he says. 'We
do not yet have critical mass in investment banking. We are not as large as
we need to be.'
Treasury. This makes a large contribution to Standard's profits. Mr
McFarlane says the bank is particularly strong in 'exotic currencies'.
London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore are 'hubs' in the trading of
reserve currencies, while its other branches specialise in trading local
currencies.
He says the growth opportunities for trading currencies in Asia is
'tremendous', given the rapid rates of economic growth which countries in
the region have achieved.
In terms of development, however, he believes the bank could leverage its
position in exotic currencies better, and improve its position in currency
options.
Financial institu-tions, which manages relationships with the bank's main
counterparties. 'It is the 'relationship management' arm for our key
financial institution clients,' Mr McFarlane says.
Bullion trading. Mocatta is, he says, enjoying a very good year.
Mr McFarlane says that the division of the bank into three business segments
and Standard Chartered Markets into four distinct groups adds clearer
definition to and tighter control over its operations.
'The simplification of our strategy will help us grow profits and improve
the quality of our earnings,' he says.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bucknall buoyed by strong second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bucknall Group, the construction industry management consultancy, returned
to profit during the year to April 30 with Pounds 236,000 pre-tax, against
losses of Pounds 1.33m.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 16.8m after a strong
second half.
While overseas operations improved substantially, with first-half operating
profit of Pounds 16,000 rising to Pounds 131,000 for the second six months,
a first-half loss of Pounds 149,000 in UK activities was turned into profits
of Pounds 415,000 in the second half.
There was also a reduction in long-term debt, with net borrowing lowered by
Pounds 368,000, and a fall in net interest payable to Pounds 177,000 (Pounds
223,000).
Gearing dropped from 157 per cent to 122 per cent.
Mr Richard Miles, chairman, said the current year had started well, with a
'significantly higher' order book.
The UK market was showing 'signs of steady improvement,' he added.
Earnings per share were 0.2p compared with losses of 10.5p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Exco shares jump to 199p on first day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Exco, the money broker, jumped 14 per cent on their first day of
trading, closing at 199p - compared with the issue price of 175p.
The public share offer had been 3.2 times subscribed, and brokers suggested
stock market sentiment had substantially improved since the issue was
priced.
While stags will be extremely pleased, the administrator of the collapsed
British &amp; Commonwealth group, which sold its 40 per cent stake in the
company, may be less so.
Analysts believe the company should make more than Pounds 48m pre-tax profit
in 1994, compared with Pounds 41.5m last year, which puts the shares on a
prospective p/e ratio of 8, and a yield of more than 5 per cent.
Some brokers described the issue as being launched at 'give-away prices',
but the backers had initially struggled to find institutions to take up the
issue.
The issue was launched in a sliding stock market, and there was limited
appetite for all new issues, particularly one tied to the volatile finance
sector.
Underwriters said they were surprised by the public response to the issue,
which may have reflected Exco's strong performance in the stock market
during the 1980's, before it was bought by B&amp;C.
More than 5.85m shares were traded yesterday, suggesting demand from
institutions whose allocations had been substantially marked down.
Buoyant demand for Exco shares was mirrored yesterday by a successful first
day's trading for Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, which saw its shares surge 25p
above the 140p placing price, writes Tim Burt.
More than 220,000 shares were traded in what the company described as a vote
of confidence by institutions.
'It shows there's still demand in the new issues market for a company with a
good track record which is sensibly priced,' said Mr Peter Dickson, managing
director.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Whitbread to step up capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread, yesterday underlined the brewing,
retailing and leisure group's intention to step up capital spending on its
retailing businesses this year.
Sir Michael, speaking at the group's annual meeting, confirmed that
Whitbread plans a 50 per cent increase in its capital spending in the year
to February 1994 to about Pounds 300m.
He said this was equivalent to adding six businesses the size of Boddingtons
Brewery to the group's operations or of opening a new large pub like a
Beefeater or Brewers' Fayre 'every single day of the year'.
In fact Whitbread will use its increased capital expenditure to open 40 new
Brewers' Fayres, 12 Beefeater restaurant-pubs, three more TGI Fridays and 66
Pizza Hut sites this year. In addition the group plans to add about 25 more
cut-price Travel Inn hotels.
Sir Michael also emphasised that the group does intend to acquire new
businesses for its portfolio, 'when they are a good strategic fit and when
we can buy them at realistic prices'.
However, he added, 'we have walked away from potential deals in the past
when they did not meet our criteria, and I can assure you we are resolved,
if necessary, to do so again in the future'.
Whitbread has abandoned two potential acquisitions over the past year -
Harvester and the Chef &amp; Brewer chains - because it considered the price too
high.
Commenting on the outlook, Sir Michael said Whitbread beer volumes were
ahead of last year, despite the impact of cheap beer imports from France,
which he described as 'a gross distortion of the market which the government
cannot allow to continue'.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Baring fund receives Ecu353m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baring Capital Investors, the venture capital group, yesterday announced it
has received commitments worth Ecu353m (Pounds 279m) for a new fund to
invest in large management buy-outs in Europe.
The group expects to have raised about Ecu450m by the time it closes the
Baring Capital Partners fund in the autumn. Some 90 per cent of the
commitments come from investors in its existing funds.
Charterhouse, Morgan Grenfell and Candover all recently raised large funds
for management buy-outs.
Some observers of the venture capital industry say the large end of the
buy-out market is becoming overcrowded with new funds chasing a relatively
small number of big deals.
They feel this could increase competition and might lead to deals being
structured with a larger proportions of debt, thereby increasing their
riskiness.
Few observers believe, however, that the ratios of debt to equity will rise
from the current levels of about one to one to the levels of leverage seen
in the late 1980s, when some banks were providing over 80 per cent of the
finance for deals.
Mr Otto van der Wyck, chief executive of Baring Capital, said he did not
believe the UK market was becoming overcrowded, and added that Baring was
also investing in continental Europe where there are fewer suppliers of
venture capital for large deals.
He said he did not believe the large venture capital suppliers, currently
having to compete with corporate buyers, were bidding up the prices of
potential MBO companies.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Tests prove new soap powder safe, says
Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products combine, is today releasing
detailed laboratory tests on its new-generation soap powder which it says
prove the detergent's safety and effectiveness.
Rival Procter &amp; Gamble, which is soon to launch its own new detergent, has
criticised Unilever's product, claiming test results show that it can damage
clothes after repeated washing.
The latest battery of tests from Unilever, conducted by six independent
institutes in the Netherlands, France, the UK, Switzerland and Austria, were
on Persil Power, which is also sold as Omo Power and Skip Power. They are
all the same product sold under different names in different countries, and
all contain a new manganese-based ingredient that has been at the centre of
the dispute between Unilever and Procter.
The latest tests were on the 'rebalanced' version of the detergent, which
contains less manganese, - reformulated after the Procter criticism.
Persil Power was tested against Procter's Ariel Ultra.
Unilever quotes CTTN, the French institute, as saying that effectiveness 'is
superior to that of Ariel Ultra, and is so with a dosage that is 21 per cent
lower'. The Fabric Care Research Association in the UK is said to have found
that 'a visual assessment showed no evidence of physical damage on any of
the articles, and minimal differences in colour loss between the test
products'.
In the Netherlands, the Consumers' Union, the largest consumer protection
group which had earlier cautioned its members to hold off buying Unilever's
new detergent, said it would await the results of its own tests before
deciding what to say. These tests are expected to be completed in the next
two weeks.
The consumer protection group's tests are being carried out by TNO of the
Netherlands, one of the six independent test institutes used by Unilever.
The Consumers' Union noted that, although the test institute was the same in
both cases, the testing programmes themselves may not be similar because
these are drawn up by the client commissioning the study.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Division shares hold price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Division Group closed 4p lower yesterday at 129p, maintaining most
of the 28p gain achieved on Monday after the Bristol-based virtual reality
computer technology company announced a strategic alliance and product
development agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the US computer group.
The agreement helped Division's shares climb to a high of 133p on Monday -
the company was floated at 40p a share in May last year.
The deal is designed to strengthen both companies' offerings in the growing
market for virtual reality applications in computer-aided design, training
and medicine.
As part of the agreement, virtual reality software developed by Division, an
acknowledged market leader, will be adapted to run on Hewlett-Packard's
powerful HP 9000 Series 700 workstations.
The two companies will also collaborate on future generations of
high-performance graphics products.
Division, which is due to report its interim results next month, also warned
that although sales growth continued to be 'very strong', it would
nevertheless report a deficit.
The company said the loss would reflect its continued heavy investment in
product development, particularly in the area of high performance graphics
systems.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MMS pays Pounds 57m for BAe's satellite
side - Merged group will have turnover of Pounds 750m and employ 4,200 in
France and the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matra Marconi Space, the satellite joint venture between GEC-Marconi and
Matra, yesterday confirmed that it was buying the satellite business of
British Aerospace.
Talks have been held over the past two years and MMS is paying Pounds 57m
for the business which had a turnover last year of Pounds 151m and made a
profit of less than Pounds 5m. It employs almost 1,000 people at Stevenage
in Hertfordshire and Filton in Bristol.
The merged group will have a turnover of Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 750m) and
employ 4,200 at sites in Paris, Toulouse, Portsmouth, Bristol and Stevenage.
No redundancies will follow the deal, and Mr Armand Carlier, MMS chief
executive, said that the company was short of technicians and engineers. BAe
has, however, halved the workforce in its space business in the past two
years.
BAe Space is being sold with net assets of Pounds 57m, including freehold
land in Stevenage and Pounds 20m of cash which is principally customer stage
payments which will be used to fund work in progress. The deal will not
require MMS to write off any goodwill, and is being funded from its cash
resources.
The order book of the combined company will be slightly more than Dollars
2bn. The principal projects include the Skynet 4 D/E UK defence satellites,
the Telecom 2C/D French civil/military satellite and the ERS 2 European
radar observation satellite.
There have been on and off discussions between the companies for some time
and serious negotiations for the past six months. Mr Noel Forgeard, chief
executive of Matra Defence Espace, the space and defence arm of Lagardere
Group, said the deal would confirm Matra Marconi Space as Europe's leading
space company and its largest satellite manufacturer.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said the sale of the
space systems business was a further step towards concentrating the
resources of BAe on its principal businesses in defence and aerospace. 'This
agreement is a logical development in the consolidation of the space
industry in Europe.'
Each of the sites is likely to specialise once the companies are integrated,
with Bristol concentrating on science projects such as the polar platform,
and Stevenage concentrating further on military satellites such as the
Skynet.
BAe and Matra have also been in discussions about the merger of their
military missiles businesses for the past 18 months. Mr Forgeard said that
negotiations with British Aerospace concerning the merger of the missile
divisions were 'well advanced', adding that he hoped for an agreement by the
end of the year. 'Most of the difficult points have been overcome,' he said.
'But we cannot give a precise prediction of the timing.'
It is understood that the missile businesses will be merged on the basis of
a 50:50 joint venture, but BAe will have to make a cash payment to Matra
because Matra has the larger order book. Negotiations over the value of the
order books and size of the payment are continuing.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Delayed contract behind fall at AIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in AIM Group fell 20p to 146p yesterday as the maker of aircraft
interior fittings reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.52m to
Pounds 1.01m for the year to April 30.
The company said the outcome had been severely affected by a continuing weak
market and a delay in the contract for the interior of the Saab 2000. The
contract - the company's biggest - was not now scheduled to reach economic
production rates until the last quarter of the year.
Profits were struck after a charge of Pounds 199,000 from discontinued
operations and reorganisation costs of Pounds 584,000. Turnover fell to
Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 42.7m), of which Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 1.04m) came
from discontinued operations.
Last year the company booked losses of Pounds 1.45m from discontinued
operations. These, though, were offset by a Pounds 1.34m profit on
disposals.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.2p (17.9p) and the recommended final
dividend of 3p (6p) gives a total of 4.5p (7.5p).

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Creighton's rise held back by exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Creighton's Naturally, the USM-traded toiletries and fragrances
manufacturer, yesterday reported a 9 per cent improvement in annual profits.
On turnover ahead 6 per cent to Pounds 9.05m (Pounds 8.52m), the pre-tax
line for the 12 months to March 31 emerged at Pounds 1.09m, against Pounds
1m last time.
The outcome, which took in a full contribution from the Fine Fragrances &amp;
Cosmetics associate, acquired in January 1993, and an initial showing from
Dalton Young, purchased in June last year, was struck after an exceptional
charge of Pounds 149,000 relating to the company's withdrawal from a 'major
acquisition'.
Earnings per share were 14.2p (13.9p); a proposed final dividend of 5.5p
brings the total for the year to 7.7p (7.3p).
The group intends to apply for a main market listing.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis sets new date for annual meeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jarvis, the building, civil engineering and property group, is having to set
another date for its annual meeting. The meeting was scheduled for yesterday
but the company was informed that it had not given sufficient notice.
A notice convening a new meeting will be issued in the next few days.
The company also responded to a number of critical comments made by a
shareholder, and sent to other shareholders, concerning the company's poor
performance and last year's Pounds 2.4m rights issue.
While regretting the performance - 1993 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.15m
(Pounds 3.72m) - it rejected the criticisms, adding that other companies and
individuals mentioned were taking legal advice.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Holmes &amp; Marchant Group fell 17p to 38p yesterday as the marketing
services company warned that pre-tax profits for the current year would be
some 40 per cent lower than in 1993.
Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said the downturn was the
result of disappointing trading levels within certain of the group's
subsidiaries coupled with reorganisation costs at two lossmaking businesses.
The group's bankers have agreed to a 12-month capital repayment holiday on
its medium term loan, with the term being similarly extended by 12 months to
December 3 1999.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Strong recovery at Victoria Carpet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a decidedly cautious statement from the chairman, shares of Victoria
Carpet Holdings jumped 19p to 154p yesterday after the Kidderminster-based
group announced a strong profits recovery.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 33.5m), pre-tax profits for the
year to end-March amounted to Pounds 1.86m - a figure which compared with a
depressed Pounds 598,000 last time and Pounds 1.74m in 1991-92.
However, Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said that current conditions in the UK
remained 'as difficult as at any time during the current prolonged
recession'. There was a lack of confidence among consumers, he added, with
'consequent pressure on sales and margins'.
Earnings per share leapt from 5.28p to 18.62p and the single distribution is
raised 50 per cent to 4.5p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Carlisle returns to the black with Pounds
1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlisle Group, which specialises in property services, achieved a turnround
from pre-tax losses of Pounds 337,000 to profits of Pounds 1m in the half
year to June 30. For the full 1993 year there were losses of Pounds 2.86m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 1.96m) including Pounds 435,000
(Pounds 238,000) from investment activities.
The principal subsidiary, Pepper Angliss &amp; Yarwood, the surveyors, had a
good first half, Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said, and contributed profits of
Pounds 195,000 compared with losses of Pounds 433,000. The turnround had
been partly because of 'difficult rationalisation decisions'.
Mr Wray added that the group had a solid balance sheet with substantial cash
resources and no debt.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.2p (0.8p losses) and an interim
dividend of 0.25p is declared.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobo Group yesterday announced a near-doubling of pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.5m, for the year to April 30.
The manufacturer of office and business products said the increase, achieved
on turnover ahead 25 per cent to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 21.1m), was partly due
to the acquisition in September of Elite Optics for Pounds 3m. Elite
contributed Pounds 325,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.87m (Pounds
1.75m) from turnover of Pounds 3.16m.
Earnings per share jumped 91 per cent from 8.15p to 15.59p. A proposed final
dividend of 4p makes a total of 6p (4.8p).

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Grosvenor Dev net asset value at 155.9p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grosvenor Development Capital, a venture capital investment trust, reported
a net asset value, fully diluted, of 155.9p per share at June 30.
The figure represented a modest appreciation on the value of 153.8p a year
earlier.
Mr David Bucks, chairman, said the acquisition in February of Grosvenor
Venture Managers by Mercury Asset Management had enabled the company to
participate in larger transactions. Investments made during the half year
amounted to Pounds 2.3m, including Pounds 1.77m in three new companies -
Castle Corporation, Creos International and Vero Electronics.
Realisations totalled Pounds 900,000 and included the sale of part of the
holding in Chiroscience and further reductions in its holding in Vega.
Losses per share for the first half showed little change at 1.89p (1.91p);
directors said the single distribution for the year was unlikely to be below
last year's 1.1p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Belgian steelmaker looks at east German plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN, EMMA TUCKER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BRUSSELS, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steelmaker, is in talks about a possible
takeover of Eko Stahl, the ailing east German steel works.
Cockerill said there had been only one meeting with the Treuhand, the
government agency trying to privatise Eko Stahl. The talks are the first
evidence of interest in the east German plant since a bid by Riva, the
private Italian group, collapsed in mid-May. 'There has been one contact and
we are sending a technical delegation over there on Monday,' Cockerill said.
German steel analysts expressed surprise because Cockerill had previously
said it would join an international consortium, including Thyssen, the
biggest German steelmaker, and Usinor-Sacilor, the largest French producer,
to prepare a feasibility study on Eko Stahl's prospects.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said after the failure of the Riva
bid that he would push to have an integrated steelworks built at the mill
which lacks hot-rolling capacity. However, German steelmakers have rejected
such a proposal given the existing excess of hot-rolling capacity. They
argue instead that the cold-rolling mill should be extended.
To add to difficulties surrounding privatisation of Eko Stahl, the European
Commission has begun inquiries to establish the legality of state aid, much
of which was conditional on the Riva takeover.
Eko Stahl receives about DM10m (Dollars 6.1m) per month from the Treuhand
and the Commission said recently that the agency had provided further loans
of DM15.6m and had guaranteed DM149m in bank debt.
Eko Stahl is the last bit of heavy industry in Eisenhuttenstadt, on the
Polish border, and indirectly provides work for many of the 50,000
inhabitants. The plant used to be east Germany's biggest steel mill, but has
cut annual production from more than 2m tons to 900,000 and reduced its
workforce from 12,000 to fewer than 3,000 since 1991.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Argyll shortens rolling contracts to two years: PosTel
campaign gathers pace as NAPF consults members on corporate governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, NORMA COHEN and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll group, the UK's third-largest food retailer, unexpectedly announced
at its annual meeting yesterday that it was cutting the length of its
directors' service contracts from three to two years.
The move follows a high-profile campaign by PosTel, the Pounds 25bn pension
fund, to limit the length of directors' 'rolling' contracts to two years.
Argyll said its move was an internal initiative, but admitted it had
consulted with its main shareholders.
However, PosTel suffered a setback to its campaign yesterday at the annual
meeting of Courtaulds, the chemicals company, where a three-year rolling
contract for chief executive Mr Sipko Huismans was approved, in spite of
PosTel voting against his re-election.
PosTel objects to the fact that executives with typical three-year rolling
contracts can demand three years' salary if forced to resign.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, said: 'We very much
welcome Argyll's move, but we will continue to press for rolling contracts
of two years or less. We will not go away.'
There were signs yesterday that PosTel's campaign could gather steam among
other institutional shareholders. The National Association of Pension Funds,
the UK's largest shareholder group, said it was considering modifying its
advice to members on three-year rolling contracts which are allowed under
the Cadbury Code on corporate governance.
Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, said it would
consult pension fund trustees on whether they wanted to wait for
modifications in the Cadbury Code due in 1995, or whether they should begin
voting against contracts with terms longer than two years. This would be in
line with the original NAPF advice to the Cadbury Committee.
Argyll's agm was dominated by shareholders' questions about directors' pay
and Sir Alistair Grant's 74 per cent increase in total remuneration to just
over Pounds 1m last year. Sir Alastair's rough ride came despite encouraging
trading figures. First-quarter pre-tax profit was 'usefully ahead', he said.
Argyll's shares gained 12 1/2 p to 251p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Second-quarter slip for SmithKline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare group, yesterday reported its
first year-on-year quarterly decline in pre-tax profits since 1990. Its
results for the quarter to June 30, dropped 1 per cent from Pounds 294m to
Pounds 291m.
The fall was partly because last year's figures were helped by a Pounds 37m
exceptional profit on the sale of the personal care business. Also
responsible were increased expenses, up from Pounds 584m to Pounds 593m, as
the company pushed new products to compensate for the US patent expiry on
Tagamet, its former top-selling product.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive, said: 'I think these are pretty good
results given the difficult environment.' Earnings growth would remain in
the high single digit area for the rest of the year.
Operating profits from continuing operations were up 21 per cent at Pounds
296m on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 1.57bn.
The results benefited from currency movements. At comparable rates, sales
rose 6 per cent and trading profits 8 per cent. Mr Leschly said the company
had gained from hedging, but this would gradually unwind during the rest of
the year.
The pharmaceuticals division's trading profits increased 8 per cent to
Pounds 219m at comparable exchange rates, while sales rose 9 per cent to
Pounds 909m. Diversified, the newly acquired US pharmaceuticals benefit
management group, accounted for 2 percentage points of growth.
SB's two top drugs posted declines. Sales of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug,
fell 8 per cent to Pounds 165m, while Augmentin, the antibiotic, fell 1 per
cent to Pounds 166m. Mr Leschly said: 'We are not depressed by Tagamet which
has lost more than 50 per cent of the new prescriptions since the patent
expiry. We've planned for this. Augmentin was hit by the chaos in Italy and
a poor European 'flu season. It would be unfair to say Augmentin has
peaked.'
Growth had been driven by new products. Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as
Paxil in the US, more than doubled its sales to Pounds 70m while Kytril, an
anti-nausea drug, posted sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 24m. Relafen, an
arthritis medicine, rose 52 per cent to Pounds 60m, and sales of Havrix, a
hepatitis A vaccine, rose 84 per cent to Pounds 17m. Sales of these drugs
would reach Pounds 700m during the full year.
Consumer healthcare increased trading profits 6 per cent to Pounds 42m,
while clinical laboratories fell 6 per cent to Pounds 23m and the animal
sales side slipped to Pounds 12m.
Earnings per share rose 7 per cent from 14.7p to 15.8p while earnings per
equity unit increased 7 per cent from 73.5p to 79p. The company declared a
second quarter dividend of 3p per share, 5.854 cents per equity unit and
29.27 cents per equity unit.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Hoping the dollar may get a breather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar, it seems, did not need much help from the G7 summit 10 days ago.
It looks as though traders are reasoning that at these levels it is simply
getting too risky to gamble on even more distortion of the dollar/yen
exchange rate. But there are no rules about when turning points may come -
though the dollar was suddenly looking frisky yesterday afternoon.
How the dollar drifted to under 100 yen (and is being projected down to 90
by some analysts) is clear enough from the financial flows. Last year the
combination of the US current account deficit and the outflows on capital
account totalled nearly Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197bn). There were substantial
long-term capital inflows too, but it looks as though something like half of
that near-Dollars 300bn total had to be financed by attracting short-term
flows.
The role of the financial institutions in the US and Japan has become
crucial. As the latest BZW Global Economic Digest points out, the Japanese
were net sellers of Dollars 3.4bn of US securities in the first quarter of
1994, whereas the Americans bought Japanese securities worth Dollars 12.9bn.
Between the October- December and January-March quarters there was a net
turnround of Dollars 28bn in capital flows between the two countries,
undoubtedly contributing to the weakness of the dollar.
Such flows have become destabilising. In theory, assets denominated in a
weakening currency should become more attractive to foreigners and
counterbalancing flows will be induced. In practice, the weakness may choke
off inflows entirely because foreign investors fear more short-term currency
losses.
For instance, unhedged Japanese investors have lost 15 per cent in yen terms
on US equities so far this year, and about 17 per cent on 10-year US
Treasury bonds. Of course, the currency risks can be covered separately, but
conservative institutions find it difficult to engage in transactions which
could be regarded as currency speculation.
In theory, an equity market will weaken when the currency is strong, because
profits will be damaged: export prices will soften and imports will become
more competitive. However, the Tokyo market has been strong this year, with
foreign capital attracted in a self-feeding way to exaggerate the
imbalances.
Japanese investors - notably banks - have sold equities to foreign buyers,
but have switched the resulting dollars or other currencies back into yen,
strengthening the exchange rate further. Indeed, a yen deposit has been
practically the best investment that could have been made this year. It
follows that markets dominated by such influences are likely to overshoot
but then flip suddenly back as the fears subside and the underlying values
become attractive and safely realisable.
The recent improvements in most securities markets may reflect an attempt by
hedge funds and other speculators to anticipate that the Japanese may turn
the tap on again. Meanwhile, the yen could weaken again quite significantly,
as it did in the later months of last year. But the timing of this is highly
uncertain.
In those circumstances some of the market movements of the past six months
could be partly reversed. This would be positive for the US Treasury bonds
which have recovered far less than European bonds in the past few weeks. But
could there be a backlash for Japanese equities as foreigners attempt to
take profits?
At any rate, such a move would emphasise just how much the global markets in
general, and the US in particular, depend upon the Japanese savings
mountain. As Mr George Magnus of Warburg points out, the G7 countries are
due to issue more than Dollars 100bn of bonds within just the next four
weeks.
It happens, however, that Japanese savings are threatened in the medium term
by the development of a unique consumer-led economic recovery in Japan,
encouraged by an overvalued currency (which is now causing consumer prices
to fall) and fiscal laxity.
If the Japanese surpluses are eroded they are likely to shift to the
developing countries, which are much less likely buyers of US Treasuries,
but will be eagerly importing capital goods instead. Any respite for the
dollar and the deficit-ridden US economy should be seen as a temporary
remission rather than a cure.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Standard to shun places that bribe

Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, would withdraw from
countries where unethical behaviour such as bribery was a prerequisite for
doing business, Mr John McFarlane, a bank director, said yesterday.
Mr McFarlane's remarks followed the disclosure that the bank was
investigating allegations that executives from its bullion arm might have
paid commissions to officials in the Philippines and Malaysia to obtain
business.
He said that he had no comment to make on a report in the Financial Times
that the bank was also investigating the disappearance of Dollars 10,000
(Pounds 6,400) of gold coins, allegedly given by the division to a Malaysian
minister as a 'trade sample'.
'We cannot allow any one business to risk the reputation of the bank . . .
We have also made it clear (to managers) that we will not tolerate another
control failure,' said Mr McFarlane, whose bank operates in 57 countries.
The bank is to establish a new operating unit called Standard Chartered
Markets covering its investment banking, treasury and bullion operations. It
will be led by him from headquarters in Hong Kong.
Two senior executives were dismissed by Standard Chartered as a result of
the bank's investigation into expenses claims in its Mocatta bullion arm.
The bank discovered claims said to have been used as gifts to central bank
officials.
Mr McFarlane said it had dealt swiftly with the problems in Mocatta as soon
as they came to light. But he said that such scandals could be 'debilitating
in terms of the impact they have on perceptions of the group'.
It has suffered from a series of mishaps in Asia including a scandal in the
Bombay securities market which required a provision of Pounds 269m against
possible losses in 1992, and involvement in share support schemes in Hong
Kong.
Ministers are concerned the Malaysian government may delay lifting a ban on
UK participation in public contracts. 'We could have done without this,'
said a Whitehall official. 'I fear it has set our chances back.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Honda to spend Dollars 310m on boosting N American plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker, is to spend Dollars 310m (Pounds
198m) expanding its North American operations.
The investment will bolster its car and engine manufacturing capacity as
well as strengthening its research and development and sales facilities.
The move is the first significant step in a new strategy to give more
manufacturing autonomy to each of the four global regions into which it is
dividing its activities - the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa,
Asia/Australasia and Japan - and to lessen dependence on Japan as a
high-cost production base.
In another significant move, yet to be formally announced, it is planning to
tackle head-on the production cost difficulties it faces in Japan because of
the high value of the yen.
It plans to build a small car in Japan for supply to world markets. Expected
to be launched within the next three years, the small car - as yet unnamed -
is regarded by Honda as a test of the company's ability to drive costs down
inside Japan and keep its Japanese assembly plants world-competitive.
If Honda can do this with a small car, which is typically least profitable,
then adequate long-term profitability for its larger Japanese-produced
vehicles should be assured, according to senior executives.
However, Honda expected that it would have to source many of the components
for the small car in other Asia-Pacific states with emerging motor
industries and a lower cost base, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president,
said. No indication of likely production volumes has been given.
Some of the increased capacity is to be used to boost exports from North
America. These are already planned almost to double this year to 75,000 from
just over 43,000 in 1993. Under the expansion programme, they will double
again to at least 150,000 before the end of the decade.
The company said it would also produce 15,000 cars a year in Mexico,
starting next year.
Honda is to spend Dollars 60m increasing its North American vehicle-making
capacity by 110,000 units a year, to 720,000 units a year by 1997. Another
Dollars 200m is being invested in raising the capacity of its engine plant
at Anna, Ohio, from 500,000 units to 750,000 units a year. The remaining
funds are to be spent doubling capacity of its North American R&amp;D
facilities.
The investments will create more than 1,100 jobs, 600 of them at Honda of
America's Ohio manufacturing plants and 250 at the new Mexico facility,
bringing Honda's total US employment to more than 17,000.

FT  20 JUL 94 / MEPs veto move to free European phone market

The newly-elected European Parliament flexed its muscles with an
overwhelming vote yesterday in favour of blocking legislation to liberalise
the European market in voice telephony by 1998.
The vote, in the parliament's inaugural session in Strasbourg, signals MEPs'
determination to gain equal decision-making rights to the Council of
Ministers on European Union legislation.
It could throw into disarray plans to open the EU's telephone market to
competition. At present, only the UK allows competition in basic telephone
services. Pressure from EU ministers is the driving force behind the early
introduction of competition in most of the other 11 states.
The parliament's decision means that the European Commission must return
with a modified proposal on the liberalisation of voice telephony to pave
the way for a future compromise between the Council and MEPs.
However, member states are already working towards the 1998 deadline, with
new operators lining up to offer services.
Furthermore, the Commission and the Council are trying to accelerate the
pace of telecoms liberalisation by allowing operators to build their own
infrastructure. The EU heads of government meeting in Corfu last month
endorsed the principle of infrastructure competition, and Commission
proposals are expected within months.
MEPs argued yesterday that deregulation could hurt consumers through higher
charges. But the Parliament appeared concerned to establish equal status
with the Council and the Commission on the passage and implementation of
legislation.
The parliament required 284 votes to block the Council. In the event, 373
out of 430 MEPs present voted in favour of a motion not to adopt the
decision. Officials said there was room for a compromise in September.
Pressure for faster telecoms liberalisation reflects concern across European
industry that existing telecoms monopolies are keeping prices artificially
high.
An industry committee, chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner, reported last month in favour of rapid telecoms
liberalisation, emphasising the danger of Europe trailing the US and Japan
in the development of 'superhighway' services.
Mr Bangemann yesterday stepped up pressure on EU member states to liberalise
their telecoms markets warning 'a race is on at a global level'. Presenting
an action plan for implementing the recommendations of his group, he said:
'Those countries which adapt themselves most quickly will set technological
standards for those who follow.'
He said the Commission wanted agreement on a deadline for liberalising
infrastructure, likely to be 1998 if that survives as the date for opening
telephone services to competition.
The Commission will publish a report before November 1996 on guaranteeing
universal service of voice telephony.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Contractors threaten to quit market testing programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private sector contractors may withdraw from bidding for civil service work
under the government's market testing programme unless changes are made in
the rules, a spokesman for some of the largest contractors warned yesterday.
Under the programme, civil servants must compete for their jobs against bids
from private sector companies. If they put in the best value bid, the work
stays in-house.
But Mr Charles Cox, who chairs a newly-formed Confederation of British
Industry market-testing advisory group, told a CBI conference on market
testing that many contractors were refusing to bid against in-house teams.
He said it was difficult to win such contests because of the advantages
enjoyed by an in-house team in preparing a bid, especially if properly
advised by consultants.
Mr Cox, of Hoskyns, the information technology company, also warned that
making civil servants bid for their jobs created an adversarial climate in
which service could suffer. If the staff lost a bid and were transferred to
the winning contractor, they would be like 'demoralised prisoners of war put
to work for the enemy'.
The 14 large companies represented at the first meeting of the group on July
5 had agreed that 'the inclination to participate in the market testing
programme was declining', Mr Cox said.
Five working parties are examining detailed proposals to improve the market
testing process to be presented to the Cabinet Office which is in charge of
the programme.
The biggest obstacle was the role of the in-house bid, Mr Cox said. The cost
of bidding for contracts ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and with
the probability of winning against an in-house team low, contractors were
reluctant to bid.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, said that he would look
sympathetically on the group's findings. But he rejected criticism of market
testing, saying that competition may be 'useful and necessary'.
He added that the savings were greatest where staff were allowed to compete,
reaching 28 per cent when work was contracted out after an in-house bid,
compared with 20 per cent when there was no competition from staff.
Earlier, Mr Waldegrave told the conference that there would be no let-up in
market testing, even though departments would be given greater freedom over
their programmes after last week's white paper on the civil service.
The Cabinet Office would monitor progress in departments and publish the
results of market testing annually.

FT  20 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll has been the soggy lettuce of the food retailing sector of late
having underperformed its peers by 20 per cent over the past 18 months. But
yesterday's upbeat trading statement suggests it may be recovering some
freshness. Argyll's shares rose 5 per cent on the back of reasonable
like-for-like sales figures. One has to take a particularly dim view of the
industry's future not to warm to a company which yields 6 per cent and
boasts dividend cover of two times.
Argyll also added more weight to the industry establishment's argument that
recent price skirmishes reflect a one-off step change in margin structure
rather than the start of an ever-deepening price spiral. The discounters
have certainly been badly squeezed by the big superstores' aggression -
although that is not altogether to Argyll's advantage. Its own Lo Cost
discount chain has been hammered worst of all.
Still, the longer term doubts about the industry persist as an increasing
amount of capital chases a decreasing pool of profits. One remedy is for the
industry to consolidate further, which is what the scramble for Wm Low is
all about. Argyll, which is heavily reliant on Scotland, may believe it is
better for Tesco or Sainsbury to take over existing capacity than add new
stores. But given the greater trading muscle of both chains, that
consolation may prove short-lived. If Sainsbury's is locked out of Scotland,
it may divert more capital abroad. Its Shaw's chain in the US provides a
handy launch pad.

Standard Chartered is no exception to the rule that any bank which chooses
to focus on emerging markets is likely to run high risks as well as reap
high rewards. That much is inevitably reflected in its share rating, but the
art for a management trying to improve that rating is to minimise the risks
without foregoing the rewards. If its dismissal of two employees at Mocatta
is evidence of a stronger management grip, then it should be welcome. So
should the appointment of Mr John McFarlane to Hong Kong, where he will run
the markets business.
But investors would delude themselves if they assumed that all emerging
market risk could be eliminated in this way. Nor will Standard find the
going easy. Its reputation with its customers as well as investors will
suffer if it is continually forced to wash its dirty linen in public. Mr
McFarlane says Standard will eschew business that compromises the bank's
high ethical standards. That is laudable, but it could also be a handicap to
apply rigorous Western standards in markets with different customs and
traditions.
Nor can the discipline be confined to operational risk. Standard's recent
accounts have been remarkable for the low level of bad debt provisions in
the Asia Pacific region - only Pounds 48m on total assets of Pounds 23bn
last year. Whether this proves sufficient when the region's economy turns
down will be another test of management grip.

At last Germany's money supply seems to be coming right. The annualised
increase slipped to 11.3 per cent in June, still well above the target
ceiling of 6.5 per cent but a marked improvement on May's 13.4 per cent.
Particularly encouraging is the way in which capital formation is finally
expanding as investors move further out along the yield curve. At DM12.3bn,
the growth in June was nearly twice that of the same month last year. The
bond market's remarkable recovery this month is reason to hope that this
trend should continue. That will limit future money supply growth even if
the rapid expansion in the early months of the year virtually guarantees
that the 1994 target will be exceeded. Happily the improvement has come just
in time to save the Bundesbank from too much embarrassment when its council
meets to review the target tomorrow. There will be no particular pressure to
revise the target or recast monetary policy. But that does not mean the
Bundesbank will now automatically rush to cut official interest rates. The
task of building on the improvement is a delicate one.
With a whiff of recovery in the air, there is less urgency about interest
rate cuts. Though inflation is likely to fall below 3 per cent this month,
it is still well above the level which the Bundesbank regards as acceptable.
Above all, hasty interest rate cuts while the money supply remains so far
outside its target could undermine the bond market all over again. That
would put an end to the capital formation which is now having such a
beneficial impact.

FT  20 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: SB's bill of health
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is life after Tagamet. That is the message of yesterday's
second-quarter results from SmithKline Beecham. The company's prize
anti-ulcer drug came off patent in the US during the quarter but sales,
profits and margins in its pharmaceuticals division rose.
Tagamet's US sales are certainly under pressure and, since the end of the
quarter, they have fallen off a cliff. Margins in the second half will
consequently be squeezed. But new products are filling the gap. Paxil, the
group's antidepressant, in particular, is storming ahead. SB also has high
hopes for Famvir, its antiviral therapy, which is on the point of being
launched in the US. The drug has taken 25 per cent of the UK market in the
six months since it was launched.
In the medium term, much depends on the success of SB's strategy of turning
itself from a purveyor of pills into a 'total healthcare' group. May's
Dollars 2.3bn acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US drugs
wholesaler, gives it most of the pieces that are needed to put together such
a strategy. But it is too early to say whether DPS can be used to boost its
market share, let alone whether it can become the platform to provide total
health care. It also remains to be seen whether SB's ambitions to export the
DPS concept to Europe can succeed, given the region's socialised healthcare
systems.
SB has survived the ending of its Tagamet patent in good shape. As such, it
is in a better position than Glaxo, whose star product Zantac has yet to
face a similar fate. But the turmoil in the world drugs industry is such
that it is still hard to argue that the shares should be bought.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Russian criminals using City to launder millions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian criminals are laundering millions of pounds of crime profits on UK
money markets but are escaping prosecution, a UK police intelligence chief
warned yesterday.
Mr Albert Pacey, director general of the UK's National Criminal Intelligence
Service, said banks and building societies had reported 200 cases last year
of 'suspicious' transactions involving Russian businesses or individuals.
Amounts varied from several hundred thousand to several million pounds. The
money reaching the UK is part of the Dollars 20bn in capital Russian
officials believe is leaving the country each year.
The lack of information and regulation in Russia was undermining the
agency's attempts to pursue suspects, said Mr Pacey, presenting the NCIS
annual report yesterday.
'Until banking and money laundering regulations are put in place in Russia,
it will be difficult to successfully prosecute cases across borders,' said
Mr Pacey, who was in Moscow last week for discussions about possible
co-operation on crime intelligence gathering.
The NCIS had identified cases of Russian banks handling illegal profits, and
using shell companies in the UK as vehicles for money transfers, he said.
'Russian criminals regard the UK as a good place to launder their money
because the City of London is one of the major banking capitals of the
world.' There was growing concern that money laundering could lead to
violent crime, as it has in Russia.
Mr Michael Hyland, a member of the UK's joint steering group on money
laundering, which is chaired by the Bank of England, said last night:
'Russian money laundering is a potential problem. It does the reputation of
City of London institutions no good if they find themselves involved in
sophisticated international scams.' He added: 'Tackling the problem is a
challenge not only to banks but also to lawyers and accountants who may be
handling property deals and other transactions on behalf of Russians.'
In Moscow, Mr Mikhail Suduk, acting head of the department on organised
crime in the interior ministry, said yesterday that while he welcomed a
decree passed earlier this month by President Boris Yeltsin to fight
organised crime, parliament should flesh it out with further laws.
He also called for legislation which would allow the police to open the
books of any company suspected of money laundering or other criminal
activities.
The main abuses, according to Mr Suduk, involved the transfer of funds
between Russian banks - with extensive forging of central bank orders to
transfer money to enterprise accounts.
He urged Russia to sign a Council of Europe convention on international
co-operation on the seizure of illegal funds.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Leading Article: When targets are overshot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A yawning gap has opened up between what is actually happening to German
broad money and what ought to be happening. A similar gulf has appeared
between how the Bundesbank is supposed to respond and how it is actually
responding. When, on Thursday, it puts forward its revision to this year's
target it needs a good story. If it fails to provide one, its credibility
may be damaged.
Fortunately, by June the annualised rate of M3 growth above the average of
the fourth quarter of 1993 was only 11.3 per cent, down from 15.4 per cent
two months before. Even so, growth was almost double the 4-6 per cent target
range for 1994. If the target is to be met, there must be no further
monetary growth this year, which seems highly unlikely, even though M3 has
been stagnant since April.
Missing monetary targets has become a habit. Goldman Sachs forecasts that M3
will end up having increased at an annual rate of nearly 9 per cent between
1991 and 1994. Since an inflation-neutral rate would be some 5 1/2 per cent,
it also argues that this augurs a renewed rise in inflation.
Even though monetary growth has been bounding ahead, the Bundesbank has
continued to cut interest rates. Since the autumn of 1992, the repurchase
(or 'repo') rate has been cut from 8.9 per cent to 4.91 per cent, with a
reduction of 1.09 percentage points this year. The policy has been one of
modest, but frequent, rate reductions, as inflation has continued its
downward path, from almost 5 per cent in early 1992, to 3 per cent in the
year to June 1994.
Asset growth
How has the supposedly monetarist Bundesbank justified what it has been
doing? Its principal appeal on the overshooting has been to temporary
factors, the most important of which was the unwillingness of depositors to
hold illiquid bank deposits (not included in M3) rather than liquid ones.
Lower short-term rates will, it argues, encourage investors to shift towards
longer term deposits.
This argument is valid, but only up to a point. Total monetary assets, which
include illiquid deposits, have been growing at around 8 1/2 per cent
year-on-year. More serious still, lending to domestic non-banks grew by 10
per cent in the year to April 1994, while that to the public sector rose 13
per cent. The benefits of lower interest rates on the composition of
deposits could be more than offset by accelerated expansion of the total, as
lending takes off.
The Bundesbank has six options, argues Merrill Lynch: to leave the target
unchanged, but explain the overshoot away; to increase the target; to
abandon M3 for another aggregate; to abandon monetary targeting; to extend
the current target range until end-1995; or to announce that the growth
rates for next year will be based not on the outcome, but on the upper bound
to this year's target.
Attractive alternative
The first is the most likely, but perhaps the least satisfactory, since it
would render policy utterly obscure. Raising the target substantially would
be almost equivalent to abandoning it. Meanwhile, the most attractive
alternative definition of money, in terms of its recent performance, would
be one that included illiquid deposits. The question, however, is whether
these are relevant components of liquidity. As to abandoning targeting, this
is what has happened almost everywhere else. But such abandonment could be
justified only if the Bundesbank were certain M3 does not mean what it has
long claimed it does. The evidence so far would not support that
proposition.
For the moment, therefore, the ideal mixture of pragmatism with rigour is to
be found in the last two options. Either way, any excess liquidity this year
would have to be mopped up in 1995.
The Bundesbank was right to put M3 to one side while the economy was in deep
recession and inflation was falling. But it should try to keep the growth of
M3 in line with historical experience of the demand for money, at least
until that policy has become demonstrably wrong. The worst of all options
would be to insist on a target whose overshooting is ignored. The Bundesbank
is a far more pragmatic institution than its critics admit. But it should
not be as pragmatic as that.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Giant step for mankind?: On the 25th anniversary of the moon
landing, Vanessa Houlder asks whether it was all worth it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-five years ago, one of the greatest human adventures of the 20th
century reached its climax. The Apollo 11 moon landing was a milestone in
history, a feat of technological brilliance which promised to usher in a
golden age of discovery and exploration.
Yet now that much of the glamour of space exploration has faded, mention of
the Apollo programme often prompts the question: 'what was it for?' Did the
astronauts' landing in an airless, barren wilderness really advance the
human race? How could any endeavour, however heroic, justify a total cost of
some Dollars 24bn?
In this age of financial realism, questions about the justification of the
space programme are often answered in terms of its practical benefits.
Without space exploration, 'the quality of life in the US today would be
inconceivable', according to a recent US newspaper advertisement by
Lockheed, the missiles and space company. 'Countless technologies - things
we take for granted today, from automobile design to sewage treatment - owe
their origins to space,' it says.
The technical innovations that stemmed from the Apollo programme pushed
forward the state of electronics, materials science, rocketry and computer
software. The demands of the space venture to reduce the weight of equipment
provided the catalyst for the development of the transistor and synthetic
substances such as Kevlar and Fiberite, which are used for strong
lightweight materials.
Microwave ovens and weather forecasting satellites are also examples of
sophisticated gadgetry which have emerged as a result of equipment developed
for the space programme. The coating designed to reduce aerodynamic drag on
the return capsule has been used on the bottom of racing yachts. Estee
Lauder uses the digital image analyser software designed to map the depth of
the moon's craters to measure skin wrinkles.
But the potential value of such technological spin-offs played little part
in persuading President John Kennedy to launch the Apollo mission,
originally characterised as 'non-military, non-commercial (and)
non-scientific' by his officials. The driving force behind Kennedy's
decision was the desire to boost national pride and to compete with Russia's
space programme in the face of cold war tensions.
'The primary reason to go the moon was the huge psychological benefit, in
terms of national self-confidence,' says Lewis Branscomb of Harvard
University, who presided over a committee that reported on the scientific,
economic and psychological benefits of the Apollo programme in 1967.
'The main reason was international political competition,' says John
Logsdon, a historian at George Washington University. 'Space was used as an
arena for symbolic competition between communism and capitalism.'
But once the initial awe at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's achievement wore off, the agency sought to sustain
political support through stressing the economic spin-offs of the space
launches.
For instance, a study in 1975 by Chase Econometrics, a research group, found
that a Dollars 1m R&amp;D expenditure each year for 10 years by Nasa would
produce a 14-fold return for the wider economy.
Mathematica, another US research group, also found a justification for
Nasa's R&amp;D spending (in 1966, its peak year, the agency's spending accounted
for 13 per cent of total US R&amp;D expenditure). It examined the agency's
influence on speeding up the development of a number of technologies,
including integrated circuits and a computer programme for analysing large
structures.
However, these findings have been criticised. Henry Hertzfeld, senior
research associate at the Space Policy Institute in Washington, argues that
the economic models 'were not sufficiently robust' to ensure the accuracy of
the studies.
Moreover, some observers doubt whether it is possible to isolate the
influence of Nasa's R&amp;D spending. John Logsdon, for example, questions
whether you can 'disentangle what superficially can be attributed to Apollo
while there was a military developing advanced weaponry at the same time'.
Ultimately, attempts to provide a cost-benefit analysis for space
exploration founder on the complexity of quantifying the prestige, economic
benefits and scientific advances arising from the Apollo missions.
Instead, the outcome of the Apollo programme tends to be seen in a more
emotional light. For many people, its most valuable legacy was the
perspective on the earth provided by photographs from the moon: the image of
a blue, fragile globe against an infinite black backdrop of space has
assumed a symbolic importance.
For others, the achievement of setting foot on the moon is viewed in
spiritual terms, as a fulfilment of mankind's fundamental urge to seek new
frontiers.
Set against these grand, abstract ideals, attempts to apply economic
analysis to the space programme risk being treated with scorn. 'The
programme's not about little technical gains, developing Teflon and Velcro,'
says Buzz Aldrin, one of the astronauts on Apollo 11. 'That's not why we
went to the moon.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Staying on can mean missing out: A look at whether the old
problem of skill shortages is returning to UK industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economic recovery is gathering pace with few sightings of that old
enemy - skill shortages. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey
found only 7 per cent of companies complaining that output was being
constrained by skill problems. Furthermore, pay settlements are not being
pushed up by recruitment difficulties.
A cause for celebration? Not if you listen to members of the UK's training
establishment. They point out, with some justification, that all seemed well
at a similar point in the economic recovery of the mid-1980s. But by the end
of the decade nearly a third of companies were complaining of skill
shortages, and pay and inflation rates were once again chasing each other
upwards as competition intensified for a limited number of skilled workers.
Few people expect a repeat of that cycle, but tomorrow's survey from the
British Chambers of Commerce is expected to highlight the growing anxieties
of some manufacturing companies about skill shortages. There are other
grounds for worry: Overall figures for skill shortages may be low but some
sectors - such as the construction industry - are suffering, according to
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation. The
shortage of bricklayers in London is said to have forced up hourly pay rates
by 25 per cent in the past year.
Other industries, such as information technology and engineering, appear to
have permanent skill problems in certain important areas, even during
recession. GPT, the UK-based telecommunications group, says it has
persistent problems recruiting graduate engineers. Marconi Instruments
complains that demand far outstrips supply for radio frequency engineers
(for the large mobile telephone market) and software engineers. Some
training experts in industry and academia even complain that the relative
silence of employers on skill shortages is a bad sign, not a good one. It
shows that they have adapted company strategies to compete in market
segments where the skill requirements are not so demanding.
Some of this pessimism should be viewed with scepticism. After all,
employers' organisations and the training establishment - now represented by
the 82 government-sponsored, employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils
in England and Wales - have a vested interest in stressing the problem to
attract more public investment.
Mr Chris Humphries, the chief executive of the Tec National Council, says:
'Tecs expect a revival of skill shortages, that is why we are telling the
government that a recovery is the time to invest more, not less, in
training. If you don't, you risk either a slowdown in recovery or a return
to 'wage push' inflation as employers outbid each other for the best skilled
workers.'
Mr Humphries is a training lobbyist and it is his job to make such
observations. But some of the evidence from Tec directors and chief
executives - particularly about the lack of interest in manufacturing
apprenticeships from young people - is harder to dismiss. 'Somebody forgot
to tell young people that the government has changed its mind and now thinks
that industry and apprenticeships are important,' says one Tec director.
The trouble is that government departments have been sending out mixed
messages about vocational training. On the one hand, the department of
employment is planning to spend Pounds 1.5bn a year, starting next year,
putting 150,000 young people through 'modern' company-based apprenticeships.
On the other hand, the department for education has been encouraging an
unprecedented increase in further and higher education, and nearly 70 of 16-
to 18-year-olds are now in full-time education.
The push to increase the staying-on rate has had the unintended effect of
reinforcing a bias against manufacturing jobs, already exacerbated by the
recession and by the fact that UK blue-collar unemployment at 13.9 per cent
is more than twice the rate of white-collar unemployment. The result is that
hundreds, possibly thousands, of manufacturing apprenticeships remain
unfilled.
'We have dozens of engineering apprenticeships in Walsall that are going
begging,' says Mr David Frost, chief executive of Walsall chamber of
commerce and industry. 'Parents and young people have seen the volatility of
manufacturing and the lack of job security and are saying, 'why not stay on
at school and try to get a white-collar job in local government or a bank'?'
Mr Frost warns Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, that too many of
those leaving school at 16 are not wanted by companies because they are the
least capable, and that it will be hard for the modern apprenticeships
scheme to attract a sufficient number of the more able young people into
skilled manual jobs.
That is partly because of the association, established in the 1980s, in some
young people's minds between training schemes such as Youth Training, the
government's main programme for out-of-work 16- to 19-year-olds, and failure
in the job market. The modern apprenticeships will also face competition
from schools, which receive generous funding for their sixth formers, and
whose in-house careers staff thus have a strong financial interest in
persuading youngsters to stay on.
Mr Allister McGowan, senior vice-president of the Institute of Careers
Guidance, says: 'There are now too many people staying on to do
inappropriate courses for the wrong reasons. People are marketing in a very
aggressive way to get bums on seats because that's how the funding regime
rewards them.'
A survey by South and East Cheshire Tec of young people who stayed on at
school until 18 revealed that a significant number got jobs afterwards which
were similar to those they would have found at 16. Similarly, research by Mr
Robert Bennett, professor of geography at the London School of Economics,
suggests that the earning power of 18-year-old school leavers is little
different to those leaving at 16.
'Staying on at school is often a kind of dropping out,' says Mr Richard Guy,
chief executive of South and East Cheshire Tec. 'Some people would have been
better off leaving school at 16 if they had got a job with training.'
Against the national trend, school staying-on rates in his Tec area fell
slightly last year. Mr Guy suggests that this was because the careers
service run by the local authority could offer quality alternatives. The
Tec, for example, now offers a substantial number of improved YT places with
trainees taken on from day one as employees, and on an enhanced, weekly,
state-paid allowance.
Mr Hunt's employment department appears to have recognised that quality is
the key to success in its attempts to improve the nationwide image of
government training schemes for young people. Most YT participants train to
National Vocational Qualification level 2, the second most basic level of
skills attainment under the scheme. It is regarded as the vocational
equivalent of 4 GCSEs, exams taken in schools at 16.
But under the government's planned apprenticeship scheme, participants will
be offered training to level 3, which is the vocational equivalent of 2 A
levels, taken at 18 in schools. The scheme - for those between 16 and 18 -
will thus aim to equal the esteem in which academic courses are held.
Mr Peter Morley, chairman of the National Association of Industry Training
Organisations, which is helping Tecs to pilot the modern apprenticeships,
says they offer a 'top of the range product'.
The test, however, will be whether young people vote with their feet and
take up the new places. The courses will require skilful marketing.
Automotive parts group Unipart, for example, conducted a survey of young
people recently which revealed that only 10 per cent wanted a manufacturing
job, although more than half said that manufacturing was vital for the
health of the economy. But after a visit to the company, a majority decided
that they would take a job in manufacturing if offered.
But even if significant numbers of young people can be persuaded to embark
on apprenticeships to fill the scheme's 150,000 places, they will only make
a small contribution to improving the UK's skills bank. There remains the
problem that employers may not see the need to upgrade the skills of their
employees: a survey last week of Tec directors showed that a narrow majority
did not believe employers would support the venture in sufficient numbers to
make a significant impact on skills shortages.
Unless apprenticeships act as a catalyst, spurring a substantial improvement
in the abilities of the UK workforce, the danger persists that skill
shortages will lead to an overheated labour market and choke the economic
recovery.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Mr Blair's new party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barring accidents, Mr Tony Blair will become leader of the Labour party
tomorrow. The event should refresh Britain's tired politics. Mr Blair's
election could mark the ascendancy of a new generation of 'modernisers,'
whose leader-in-waiting has not been afraid to proclaim that he values the
dynamics of the free market. The old Labour party, dominated by trade
unions, representative of producer interests, steeped in socialist history,
is being subsumed by what might be called, after the New Democrats in the
United States, Britain's new left. Thus revitalised, Labour might yet
present the voters with an acceptable alternative party.
The balance of forces, old and new, will be evident from the voting patterns
in the leadership contest. The size of the modernisers' victory will be
important. Mr Blair has attracted promises from some 60 per cent of Labour
members of the Westminster and European parliaments; the remainder support
either Mr John Prescott or Mrs Margaret Beckett.
The electoral college is, however, divided into three parts, of which the
MPs constitute one. It is not clear whether the new leader will win overall
majorities in the sections reserved for rank-and-file party members and
trade unionists. If he fails to do he may be seen to have depended on the
second preferences of those opting for the least popular candidate.
This may matter more than the party's choice of deputy leader. Whether it be
Mrs Beckett, with her roots in the old left, or Mr Prescott, who does not
personify renewal, is of no significance. To borrow the advice given to
Lyndon Johnson before he became vice president of the US, the deputy
leadership of the British Labour party is not worth a pitcher of warm spit.
Political strategist
Mr Blair will have learned that and more from the US. Like President
Clinton, echoes of whose primary campaign can be found in his own, the new
Labour hopeful aims to reposition his party in the centre. His campaign has
revealed him to be a careful and self-disciplined political strategist. He
is not telegenic by accident; he works at it. His use of language is
designed to win wide popular support. He has grasped that most ordinary
voters, whether they be working or middle class, are apprehensive of rising
crime, reluctant to pay more taxes, and doubtful of the wisdom of
maintaining increasing numbers of people on the welfare rolls.
In a series of stump speeches he has intimated as much. He has been
particularly forthright, for a Labour politician, on welfare dependency. A
great deal of what he has said, notably on the economy, is a moderniser's
restatement of existing Labour themes. Some of it is his own: early on, for
example, he scratched the renationalisation of water from the party's
manifesto. Some of it is detailed, as with his proposed bill to incorporate
the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, or his promise to
disbar hereditary peers from the House of Lords. Some of it is a marker, as
with his careful redefinition of Labour's approach to the European Union, or
his cautious rephrasing of party policy on education.
Questions remain
In short, his campaign has changed the mood, but left obvious questions
unanswered. The music has been rephrased but the lyrics remain unwritten.
The Labour party faces a blank page. This is both a weakness and a strength.
Mr John Smith and Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Blair's immediate predecessors, were
modernisers, but were never quite free of old Labour thinking. Tomorrow's
man does not carry the intellectual baggage of the party's past. If his
campaign had been bolder and more radical, it could have been used to commit
the whole party to a more creative direction. As it is, that task remains.
From now he will be urged to outline specific policies. Too much detail can
be the death of a political campaign: the voters do not absorb it, but rival
parties build their counter-attacks upon it. Too little could result in the
election of a government with no credible programme. Mr Blair's solution is
a series of 'flagship' proposals, which would serve as examples to buttress
his theme of renewal of every part of the the British polity. The electoral
process is testing: he will be obliged to turn out a flotilla of flagships
before polling day comes.

<TEXT>
Not only did Didier Pineau-Valencienne, embattled head of the French
Schneider group, have to suffer the indignity of spending 11 days in a
Brussels jail after being placed under formal investigation by a Belgian
judge on charges relating to Belgian subsidiaries of the French engineering
group.
Now he's being asked to cough up no less than FFr2m to discover why he was
put in the slammer in the first place.
The sum has been requested by fax by a mysterious 'Van Krunkelsven', for
providing copies of the 2,400 page dossier allegedly compiled on
Pineau-Valencienne and Schneider by the Belgian judge supervising the case.
Schneider, who has no idea who Van Krunkelsven is, has neither responded nor
paid. Instead, it yesterday asked French prosecutors to open an
investigation - for attempted extortion - against person or persons unknown.
The fax, warning the company and Pineau-Valencienne that if they did not pay
up they would 'suffer the consequences', apparently derived from a
fax-for-hire shop in Brussels.

Opera-loving Sir Desmond Pitcher can be excused mixed feelings about the
three tenors' concert in Los Angeles last Saturday. It was their similar
performance before the 1990 World Cup final in Rome that gave him the idea
for an opera concert in Liverpool two years ago.
'I want something like the three tenors,' Brendan Carroll, his local PR
consultant, claims Sir Desmond told him, as they discussed maximising the
impact of the finish of the Grand Regatta Columbus tall ships race in
Liverpool.
Sir Desmond is chairman of Merseyside Development Corporation, the
government agency for regenerating the Liverpool and Birkenhead waterfronts.
It was responsible for the tall ships, though the inexperienced Carroll
ended up running the concert.
Unfortunately, the Pounds 2 company Carroll set up legally to distance the
concert from the MDC went bust after network TV coverage failed to
materialise - leaving the MDC and other creditors with nearly Pounds 700,000
of losses.
A report on the affair by the Commons' Public Accounts Committee is awaited,
but Sir Desmond got his retaliation in first yesterday with the
corporation's annual report to parliament, suggesting the MDC is doing
marvellously under his leadership.
Is it enough to save his part-time job with the corporation? Should he care
 -after all, he does quite nicely from his Pounds 338,000-a-year
chairmanship of North West Water, plus non-executive directorial commitments
to Everton and NatWest Bank.

Ha - hoist by their own petards.
Statisticians and analysts of the Labour Statistics Users group were due to
meet at the Trades Union Congress HQ in London today. One item on the agenda
was a discussion of how the department of employment records strikes. Sadly,
it's all off - thanks to the latest 24-hour national rail strike by
signallers.
Speaking of which, the government's department of transport has been urging
motorists to share cars as a way of beating the strikes. Not that the
department's own staff are enthusiastic about the idea.
A notice in the entrance hall of the department's London office, inviting
would-be sharers to sign up, had not a single signature on it by
clocking-off time yesterday. They can't all be driving in, surely?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime minister John Major's passion for furthering public-sector cost
controls is all very well; but just how far is he prepared to go?
A senior Whitehall mandarin has now worked out that each minister costs the
UK taxpayer a basic Pounds 250,000 a year. That includes only his or her
salary, office and transport costs. Add in the team of civil service
high-flyers demanded even by the most junior ministers, and the bill quickly
rises to more than Pounds 500,000.
So the advice to Major who, like his predecessor, prefers increasing to
cutting the ministerial payroll, is: thrift, like charity, should begin at
home.
Perhaps he will put his mouth where the money is this week - by not just
reshuffling the 100-plus cabinet, non-cabinet and junior ministerial ranks,
but by trimming their ranks a trifle.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Too late to kiss it better: Major has squandered the
government's credit in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Brussels this week, the British government launched a new
kiss-and-make-up campaign. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told
other European ministers that Britain pledged stronger support for the
European Union, notably in the field of foreign policy; and officials gave
his words a strong interpretive shove.
One may hesitate to take this story too seriously. The government has twice
this year clashed with all its European partners: over majority voting and
the next president of the European Commission. Both these crusades were
obviously in craven submission to the Euro-sceptics on its right wing; but
the government claimed they were matters of the highest political principle.
If so, Mr Hurd's peace overture may not mean anything very much, even if it
does reflect his personal luke-warm pro-European proclivity. And yet if the
government were rational, it would see at least two overriding reasons of
realpolitik for a fundamental re-examination of its attitude - you can't
call it a strategy - of ill-tempered obstructionism in Europe.
First, the logic of a new phase in building a larger and more integrated
Europe is gathering momentum on the continent, and is being irresistibly led
by Germany. Second, and almost as important, this week's election of Tony
Blair will, for the first time, give the British Labour party a leader who
is openly as well as genuinely pro-European.
Separately, each of these factors will be threatening for the government's
chosen posture in Europe; in combination, they must be lethal.
Britain was not able to prevent the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty,
and it will not be able to block the continental coalition now building for
the next phase in the construction of Europe. But over Maastricht the
government could fall back on the atavistic rhetoric of xenophobic
nationalism at home, because the Labour party was almost as divided on
Europe as the Conservatives. The late John Smith may have been a genuine
pro-European, but he was not prepared to take on his own Euro-sceptics. So
when Maastricht was on the table, he side-stepped the central issues of
principle, and succumbed to the cheap pretext of sulking over the treaty,
just because it did not contain the social chapter.
In other words, where the Conservatives had taken an opt-out from the social
chapter, the Labour party took a general opt-out from a straight-forward
European policy. This made life difficult for the prime minister; but
delightfully easy for the anti-Europeans on both sides of the House of
Commons.
Mr Blair's campaign speeches suggest he will take a much bolder pro-European
line than Mr Smith. He has avoided getting trapped into dogmatic one-word
commitments on specific issues, such as monetary union, the social chapter
or majority voting. But he strikes a new note of rational pro-European
serenity, free of the defensive hang-ups of his predecessors. He assumes
that integration in Europe should in general be in Britain's interests, and
will continue. Naturally, it will raise difficult issues; but they will be
difficult for everybody, not just for Britain; and since integration is a
co-operative, not an adversarial process, we must all talk about it.
If the Labour party follows this line it will pose a serious threat to the
government. For unless John Major can manoeuvre away from the rhetoric of
nationalism, he could find himself imprisoned between a pro-European Labour
party, opposite him, and the Euro-sceptic faction behind him.
As Mr Blair has said: 'In British national politics, it is not inconceivable
that Europe will become one of the most powerful political questions of our
time.'
What he means, of course, is that the dialectic between the pro-Europeans
and the nationalists is replacing the left-right divide as one of the main
fault lines in politics; that there is no future in the nationalist option;
and that therefore the Labour party must avoid the danger facing the
Conservatives, of being irreparably split over the issue.
Just how serious that danger is will depend on the scale of the agenda for
the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference. This was originally scheduled for a
modest revision of the Maastricht treaty; but it may turn out to be a much
bigger affair, extending perhaps to the redesign of a substantially expanded
Union including eastern Europe.
Mr Blair for one expects that 1996 will lead to the negotiation of a new
treaty. But this will mainly depend on the Germans - they are in the lead on
the question of eastern enlargement and they currently hold the EU
presidency at the critical moment when the 1996 agenda is starting to be
hammered out.
It is not yet clear whether the Germans are going to press for a maximalist
agenda right away, with far-reaching reinforcement of the institutions of
the EU; whether they will downplay the big and difficult constitutional
issues until after their general election in October; or even wait until
after the French presidential election next spring. But one way or another,
it seems inevitable that they will force a far-reaching integrationist
agenda on to the table in 1996.
If that is the probability, it is incomprehensible that the British
government should have squandered what little credit it once had in Europe,
by single-handedly precipitating a gratuitous and futile crisis over the
appointment of the next president of the European Commission. Has Mr Major
not noticed that the next phase in Europe will be decided, not by the
Commission, but by the member states, and mainly by the German government?

<TEXT>
Sir, Three cheers for Michael Prowse ('Why vegetarians will inherit the
earth', July 11). Why do vegetarians, non-smokers and non-drinkers face such
flak when they decide to 'come out'?
Probably because they are falsely perceived as wanting to occupy the high
moral ground. They aren't and are just scapegoats for people who would like
to cut out or cut down.
Ian Lamont's letter (July 13) firmly puts him in this bracket. Invoking
Hitler is patronising, petty and scarcely amusing.
It is estimated that 10 per cent of the UK population are vegetarian. I see
little sign of hair shirts or even sandals and beards among them. As a
non-smoker (promised a car for my 21st birthday if I didn't), a non-drinker
(dislike the taste but at 47 no longer mind when teased) and a vegetarian
for six years (self-preservation: no extra meals required when children
became ethical vegetarians), I have never felt or looked better. It is also
increasingly difficult (and irresponsible?) to ignore medical, ethical and
environmental factors. How do others manage?

FT  20 JUL 94 / Bretton Woods 50 Years: Modern tasks for the money men -
Approval from the IMF and World Bank can be a trigger for private investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days ago in Naples, the summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations
called for a review of the key international institutions that have served
the world for the past 50 years. It is not just because 50 is a good age at
which to take stock. But the world economy and the world financial system
have changed beyond recognition over this period, and continue to evolve at
a staggering rate. In the last few years we have seen a sea change in the
world political environment. We need to make sure we have institutions well
adapted to our future needs.
Fifty years ago this week, the conference in Bretton Woods which gave birth
to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank came to an end. It is
difficult today to conceive of the world that conditioned the visions of
John Maynard Keynes, Harry White, and their colleagues, who met at Bretton
Woods. It was a world still at war, only a month after the D-Day landings.
Memories of the collapse of world trade and the breakdown of international
monetary order before the war were still fresh.
Against this background, the conference aimed to ensure that the economic
beggar-my-neighbourism of the 1930s, which provided the backdrop to the rise
of fascism and the onset of war in Europe, would not rear its ugly head
again. That required the creation of a free, open and stable world trading
and financial system. In the following years, both institutions had to
respond to many changes, including the breakdown of the Bretton Woods
exchange rate system.
Today, the Bretton Woods institutions face new challenges just as great as
those of 50 years ago: the consequences of the end of communism; the massive
growth and integration of the world's capital markets; and the recognition
that economic success depends on a combination of market oriented structural
and macro economic policies, cutting across the traditional division of
labour between the Fund and the Bank.
In the post-cold war world, there is clearly still a need for World Bank and
IMF lending during difficult periods of adjustment for countries, while
macro-economic policies are stabilised and micro-economic distortions are
removed. And they have a continuing role in lending to the poorest countries
on concessional terms. But the Bretton Woods institutions can only provide a
proportion of countries' capital needs. Lending by the multilateral
institutions accounted for less than 20 per cent of total net capital flows
to developing countries in 1993.
In some cases, the signal provided by their lending is more important than
the lending itself. An IMF seal of approval often provides the trigger for
private, long-term investment. Indeed, while many developing countries,
including the poorest, need continuing assistance on concessional terms
through the World Bank's International Development Association, the
reduction in the Bank's lending to some developing countries this year is a
welcome sign of their success in attracting private capital inflows.
It is the private sector which is the engine for growth in this new phase of
global economic development. And the private sector in developing countries
now accounts for an increasing share of their overseas borrowing, growing
from just 13 per cent five years ago to around 40 per cent today.
The division of labour between the Fund and the Bank, and their efficiency
and governance as institutions, will also rightly come under continuing
scrutiny. While I believe the Fund should broadly continue to focus on the
macro economy, and the Bank on structural change, we need to recognise the
clear inter-connection between the two functions.
It is essential that the Fund and Bank co-operate closely with each other,
as well as with the regional development banks, the OECD, UN agencies, and
bilateral donors, so as to provide clear and coherent economic advice and
support to their members.
Both institutions face special challenges in helping to meet the needs of
the poorest countries, and the poorest groups within these countries . The
World Bank's main objective is poverty reduction and sustainable
development. The Fund has also helped these countries through policy advice,
and by offering lending on concessional terms.
The Fund must retain and enhance its pre-eminent role in providing frank
advice on the economies of all its members. This will become more important
as the international economic and financial system becomes more integrated.
The Fund has, and will have, a role in encouraging international discussion
of economic and financial issues, and convergence on low and stable
inflation. But I do not see any real prospect in present circumstances of
moving to a system of managed exchange rates administered by the Fund.
These are the general challenges that the Fund and Bank have to face up to
as we approach the next century. But I also have four more specific
suggestions.
First, the Fund should now give priority to removing the remaining
impediments to the free international movement of capital. Convertible
currencies for trading purposes encouraged the growth of trade, bringing
great benefit to the world economy. The free flow of investment brings
similar benefits. The Fund should now be working for worldwide abolition of
exchange controls on capital flows.
Second, the World Bank group, while continuing to improve its support for
institution building and social investment in the developing countries,
should also increase its emphasis on promoting private sector development -
a change supported by the report of Paul Volcker's Bretton Woods Commission.
This requires help for countries to create the conditions to attract private
capital, from home or overseas. It also requires increasing the volume and
quality of capital flowing to the private sectors of developing countries.
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank group's channel for
investing in the private sector, has a key and expanding role to play.
Third, the evidence suggests that in many countries around the world,
including the former communist countries in transition, temporary financing
needs are greater than can be met by the Fund under current rules of access
to its resources. I believe that countries making strong efforts to reform
should be granted increased access to IMF resources.
Fourth, I believe that the Fund, and possibly the Bank as well, should
explore ways to produce an increase in resources available on a concessional
basis to the poorest and most indebted countries.
Helping to bring the former communist countries into the global economy is a
fitting end to the first 50 years of endeavour by the Bretton Woods
institutions. Fifty years ago, the immediate need was to reconstruct
economies devastated by war.
Now, a priority is to help in the reconstruction of economies in Europe,
Asia and elsewhere devastated by years of communist ideology. But that
challenge is only a particular example of the institutions' general mandate.
Their continuing task is to help to promote sound economic and financial
governance in member countries, and to create the conditions for harmonious
economic and financial relationships between their members. We are fortunate
that the institutions have risen to that task over the last 50 years. The
task and the challenge are even more important now, as the economies and
finances of member countries become more and more closely inter-connected in
a single world system.
The author is the UK chancellor of the exchequer.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Misleading view of tax effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS MCWILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have no quarrel with most of Howard Davies's helpful summary of the
economic situation (Personal View, July 19), though he may be a touch
sanguine about investment prospects. The tide of inward investment has ebbed
and while construction activity in major projects like the Channel Tunnel
and Docklands has slowed down, the next round of equivalent projects is as
yet still on the drawing board.
But his assertion that personal tax increases have 'had so little effect so
far' is misleading. His argument seems to be that the economy is growing and
taxes have risen, ergo tax increases are having little impact. I suspect
that his former tutor in logic would have reminded him that the right way to
measure whether the tax increases are having an effect is to compare what is
happening with what might have happened had there been no tax increases.
Constructing the counter-factual hypothesis is, of course, complicated. But
the average rate of real gross domestic product growth in the second
calendar years of previous UK recoveries (1954, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1973, 1977
and 1983) has been 4.8 per cent. Growth usually picks up considerable
momentum at this stage of the cycle. The Treasury's forecast for 1994 is 2
3/4 per cent - only half the normal cyclical growth. The only comparable
year in recent history with growth as low was 1977, another year when taxes
were raised, on that occasion as part of the International Monetary Fund
package.
The weakness in demand this year owes a certain amount to the state of the
property market but is also influenced by the tax rises. Moreover, as Howard
Davies points out, these tax rises have yet to bite fully. The suggestion
that taxes can be raised without harming the economy is seductive for those
who believe in high government spending. But it should not be allowed to
pass unchallenged by those who prefer to rely on checking the facts rather
than on wishful thinking.
These facts show that tax cuts in 1988 had a much bigger effect than
expected, that the introduction of the poll tax in 1990 was associated with
a sudden drop in consumers' spending which started the recession, and that
the tax increases this year are associated with much slower growth than
usual at this stage of the cycle. A future chancellor who ignores this
evidence when considering whether to cut or raise taxes does so at his
peril.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advertising monopolies probe is a
farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER FERNLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My first reaction to the news that the Department of Trade and Industry
has referred the bid by More O'Ferrall for London Transport Advertising to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was to laugh ('MMC to probe
advertising bid', July 15). My second was to cry.
My company, British Transport Advertising, is an interested player in the
disposal by London Regional Transport of its advertising arm. But this
episode, with its inconsistencies and contradictions, has now descended into
a Whitehall farce, with doors of opportunity swinging open and shut and a
couple of characters caught with their trousers down.
At the outset, LRT and its advisers, KPMG Corporate Finance, made it clear
to BTA that they did not want the sale of London Transport Advertising
delayed by a referral to the MMC. BTA sought guidance from the Office of
Fair Trading and we were told that our bid, if successful, would be
referred. So we withdrew.
I understand that Mills &amp; Allen went through the same process and also
withdrew.
Given that the More O'Ferrall bid has been referred to the MMC, I am frankly
amazed that LRT and its advisers now find themselves in the exact position
that they insisted bidders should help them avoid. Something has gone badly
wrong.
LRT, its advisers and the Office of Fair Trading appeared to want to dodge a
referral as a pre-condition of sale. Only incompetence or inconsistency can
explain the failure to achieve this. Now, potential bidders, (including BTA)
which have acted with propriety throughout, are disadvantaged. Perhaps more
ominously, LRT and the government will never know what this sale might have
raised had other bidders not been invited to stand aside.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions burden of big salary rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SMALLBONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report about utility bosses ('It's better when you're private',
July 16) makes little mention of the most disquieting of all the effects of
directors' sudden huge pay rises; the impact these can have on 'final'
salary pensions.
Taking into account the probable expense of indexing and of surviving spouse
benefits, as a simple rule of thumb it should be assumed that the true
capital cost of a pension will be 10 times the final pay. So if a chairman's
salary was Pounds 60,000 four years ago, but is now Pounds 240,000, the
contingent burden on the fund will have rocketed from Pounds 600,000 to a
staggering Pounds 2.4m, dwarfing any stock option windfalls.
The individual's own contributions, say 5 per cent of annual pay, will not
go far towards this. The balance of cost must be found from shareholders,
and to a massive extent by taxpayers in general via funds' exemptions. The
later the age at which pay rises are granted and the greater these are, the
larger the amount and the greater the proportion of pension cost must be
paid for by other people - many of whom will not belong to an employer's
scheme and never benefit from their enormous subsidies.
Public accountability for the inequitable redistribution these schemes
encourage scarcely exists, but the sudden extra earmarkings of funds to pay
for late awarded windfalls can to no small extent be offset by taking a
sharp axe to middle management.
The maths of final schemes are such that, if turned into early leavers ten
years or more short of normal retiring age, those paid less than Pounds
25,000 (85 per cent of taxpayers never earn more) get such poor pensions
that their costs are likely to be sustainable wholly on the fruits of their
contributions.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Arts: A figurative aberration - The Turner Prize nominees
include a rarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is that time of year again when Nick Serota, director of the Tate
Gallery, must assume a weary, tight-lipped smile and defend the four artists
short-listed for the Turner Prize from the uncomprehending hostility of the
massed ranks of Philistines - that is the media and most art lovers.
This year there is a noticeable aberration among the artists in line for the
prize, which is sponsored by Channel 4 and announced on November 22 - a
figurative artist, Peter Doig.
Doig, 34, might live next door to a gas works in London but his art is
lyrical and nostalgic, often consisting of large landscapes of Canada, where
he spent his childhood.
They are a blend of photographic precision and almost
Whistlerish-abstraction. Doig is the first painter working in a style that
would be popularly accepted as art to be nominated for the Turner since
1989, when installationist Richard Long won the prize but Paula Rego and
Lucian Freud were insultingly commended.
The other three artists match most people's concept of a Turner contender.
Antony Gormley, 44, is a sculptor whose work focuses on the human body,
mainly his own. He takes moulds of his body, strengthens them with fibre
glass, and then covers them with beaten lead or iron.
He is best known for 'Field', a work consisting of up to 40,000 small clay
figures with upward staring eyes - a modern version of the buried Chinese
warriors. There have been four versions of 'Field' and the Tate hopes to
show one in its exhibition of the work of the four artists in November.
The video artist and photographer Willie Doherty and the Iranian-born
sculptor and installation artist Shirazeh Houshiary complete the list.
Derry-based Doherty, 34, is best known for his bleak, empty, urban landscape
photographs of his home city. His 'The only good one is a dead one', which
consists of two video tapes on adjacent screens, showing the build-up to an
assassination from the points of view of the victim and the murderer,
contributed greatly to his nomination.
Houshiary, 39, takes an oriental, Sufic, attitude to her most recent work,
returning to the abstraction of Islamic art and the geometry which underpins
it.
In her 1993 exhibition at Camden Arts Centre she produced cubes made from
precious metals with grid-like structures inside them. For Houshiary the
cube manifests the material world. 'Its inward activity can disclose the
'timeless present'. Its centre is inside our being . . . we should realise
that the world would be nothing without this essential centre.'
This is the true language of a Turner Prize winner but Gormley must start
favourite for the Pounds 20,000 prize.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Arts: Eerie coolness of a hot group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No city provides a clearer example of US theatre in microcosm than Chicago.
Commercial theatre dominates; several large houses pull in the biggest
audiences with touring productions of top Broadway musicals.
The city's leading resident theatre, the Goodman, is relatively financially
secure, but establishment comes at a price. The theatre is forced to weigh
its artistic choices against the tastes of its subscribers, while fending
off accusations by critics and the rest of the theatre community of
pandering to the mainstream.
At the other end of the spectrum, Chicago's network of tiny storefront
theatres remains vital, despite the odds. More than any other US city,
Chicago is the place where a group of college graduates with a few dollars
and a script can have a go.
The real problems lie in the middle ground. When a new theatre group
achieves some success, expansion is nearly impossible. There are few
mid-sized spaces around, and the costs involved in mounting larger
productions are often untenable.
Meanwhile, most of the first wave of Chicago's medium-sized theatre groups -
the Remains, Northlight, Body Politic and Organic Theatre companies - are in
mid-life crisis, low on cash and searching for renewed artistic inspiration.
But the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, whose raw, hyper-naturalistic acting
style and its crop of rising young stars placed it at the forefront of
American theatre in the 1970s and 1980s, is the exception to the rule.
Nowadays, Steppenwolf doggedly maintains its actor-run status even as it
dons the trappings of establishment.
The company built a new main stage theatre in 1991 and added a studio space
this year. It regularly sends productions to New York and London (though
with varied success: its US premiere production of Jim Cartwright's The Rise
and Fall of Little Voice lasted all of a week on Broadway this spring).
Its recent production of Libra was in many ways vintage Steppenwolf: not
only was it an adaptation of a prose work for the stage - the popular local
genre made famous by Steppenwolf's adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath - but
it was also adapted and directed by the company's best-known member, John
Malkovich.
But while it was the heat of Steppenwolf's productions which won the company
its initial fame, what is striking about Libra, based on Don DeLillo's
fictionalised account of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald, is its eerie
coolness. Both novel and play attempt a dispassionate account of an event
that inflamed the world, but Malkovich's production keeps the audience so
much at arm's length that, eventually, we feel unnecessary.
Like the novel, Malkovich's Libra weaves together real and fictional events
to create a portrait of a bright but disaffected young man who becomes the
patsy of a group of ex-FBI and CIA agents looking to avenge the Bay of Pigs
fiasco.
All the actors, with the exception of Alexis Arquette, who plays Oswald,
take multiple roles in Malkovich's techno-laden, collage-like production,
which is similar in look and form to the work of the avant-garde Wooster
Group.
As the play opens, the cast sits behind a long desk interrogating Oswald,
who stands upstage. This action continues throughout the production,
interspersed with scenes from Oswald's life, played out with the barest
suggestion of props, costumes and sets. Photographs and captions identifying
the characters and events are flashed on to a screen behind the actors; a
bank of television screens sometimes descends from the flies to play
Kennedy-era footage.
The production seems designed to keep the audience on edge. In the midst of
a naturalistic scene, characters will pick up microphones and deliver their
dialogue to the audience, talk-show host-style.
Some actors play their roles as pure schtick (Rick Snyder's twitchy Jack
Ruby), some for pure believability (Ingeborga Dapkunaite's moving, lovely
Marina Oswald). Laurie Metcalf turns in a set-chomping Steppenwolf star-turn
in two roles: Lee's stifling mother Marguerite and David Ferrie, the bizarre
small-time crook who was Oswald's closest contact to the plotters.
Arquette's Oswald remains eerily distant from the action; it is never clear
if it is actor or character who is disengaged.
The success of DeLillo's novel lies in his ability to emulate Oswald's
twisted mind and life through its disjointed narrative, while still creating
a sense of tension and dramatic build.
Malkovich's Libra lacks a similar cumulative weight; its beginning and
ending points seem random, as if it were excerpted from a longer piece.
However daringly staged and impressively acted, Libra retains the feeling of
an intelligent but misguided experiment.

We are promised details of a secret 50 years old on Countryfile: the
organisation and training of the BRO, the British Resistence Organisation.
Described as highly trained and heavily armed, this underground home guard
was apparently recruited from farmers, gamekeepers and fishermen. Organised
in cells of six or eight, the idea was that they would use their underground
bunkers, stocked with food and weapons, as bases from which to harry the
invader (7.30 BBC1). An oddly parallel story is told in The Restless
Conscience which is concerned with resistence to the Nazis inside Germany.
Nominated for an Oscar, this two-hour documentary is concerned with
individual acts of heroism rather than any underground organisation (10.55
C4). Frontline looks again at the death of WPc Yvonne Fletcher who was
killed in St James's Square in the centre of London 10 years ago by a shot
which came from the Libyan People's Bureau (9.00 C4). The final of The BBC
Design Awards, in which 100,000 members of the public may have voted, is
screened by BBC2 (9.50).

FT  20 JUL 94 / Arts: Humidity brings out an epidemic of irritants -
Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it the heat? Or perhaps the humidity? Whatever the reason, numerous
recent programmes have seemed abnormally irritating. Can I really have been
the only one who found the attempt to recapture the charm of The Three
Tenors concert mannered and naff?
It was not merely that the Dodgers' Stadium lacked the magic of the
Caracalla ruins, it was the calculated nature of the occasion. The Italian
concert in 1990 was chaotic, passionate and full of unrehearsed good humour.
The 1994 rerun had all the charm and spontaneity of a petrol pump clicking
up dollar totals.
As for the football which followed - why bother? Since FIFA continues to
spurn the Dunkley Revision, first advocated in this column 12 years ago
(double the width of the goal and scrap the goalie; that should banish all
this nil-nil nonsense and give us score lines of 45-28 or so), future World
Cups might just as well abandon all those tedious 90-minute defence
demonstrations and go straight for the penalty shoot-outs. That way an
entire World Cup competition could be televised in one day. Bliss.
It is not just a question of television's big events, either. At the other
end of the scale, in a matter as small as grammar, the summer programmes are
proving irksome. Maybe the second elevens are staffing the news and current
affairs departments while the senior people are on holiday. Or perhaps
Britain is reaping the whirlwind of barmy educational ideas sown in past
decades. Anyway, more and more television people speak poor English.
It seems there is nobody left in BBC News who understands the difference
between 'convince' and 'persuade', although the distinction is useful: I may
persuade you to lay down your arms without altering your conviction that you
are right. But BBC journalists are forever telling us that so-and-so
'convinced them to lay down their arms'. You persuade to, but convince of.
And what about the ludicrous phrase 'up to' as in 'Up to 600 demonstrators
took part'? Was it 590? Or three? The 'up to' phrase could mean either and
is therefore useless.
At 2.00am on July 12 the Sky News presenter said 'Police believe that up to
two shots were fired'. To say 'at least two shots' would tell us something,
but 'up to' tells us nothing. Irritating.
Of course, English useage is not such a small matter. US reporter Mary
Magistad, introducing herself at a front door in Cambodia during Frontline,
claimed 'I'm with the British 4th Channel'. If she cannot even get the name
of her employer right (referring to Channel 4 in that way is like telling
American teenagers to get their kicks on the 66th Route) then why should we
trust anything else she says?
This was, anyway, yet another of those programmes in which the reporter,
unable to obtain an interview with the chosen subject, this time Pol Pot,
pretends that the pursuit itself is the whole point. Nick Broomfield has now
tried the stunt with Eugene Terre Blanche and Margaret Thatcher and the idea
has worn very thin.
Apart from some anodyne statements from relatives, about Pol Pot having been
such a nice little boy, Magistad's programme told us nothing we did not
already know. John Pilger's programmes about Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge
were so much better, you wonder how anybody dared screen this one.
And what does Keith Floyd think he is up to in Floyd On Italy? He is as
entertaining as ever, even if he occasionally fails to say where he is, but
much of the cooking in this series would have to be described as
Anglo-Italian at best.
It is true that he has, so far, been in the north and rather more butter is
used there than in the south, but only a little more; olive oil still
dominates. Floyd keeps hurling in great wodges of butter in a most
un-Italian way. He also cooks his pasta far too long and then serves his
main meat course on top of it, a practice which I have never observed in 25
years of dedicated Italian eating from the Dolomites to Sicily.
Nor have I ever seen an Italian put Parmesan on a pasta dish containing
fish, or fail to serve the vegetables separately. Floyd ignores all this and
carries on English fashion . . . so what is the point of going to Italy?
Deeply irritating.
But of all last week's vexatious programmes the most niggling was the first
in a new batch of BBC1's tabloid science series QED. It offended
particularly because its pose was one of reasonableness, setting out as it
did to reveal the truth behind the recent 'Killer Bug Ate My Face' flimflam
in the tabloid press.
It is fashionable among television people to adopt an attitude of high
faluting superiority to mere newspaper journalism, and QED's thesis was that
the fuss over necrotising fasciitis was got up entirely by a bunch of
tabloid press wallies. QED was there to tell us that all we had seen in
Stroud was the coincidental occurrence of centuries' worth of nf within a
few weeks. Does that sound more likely than a breakdown somewhere in public
hygiene? (Remember Stroud's outbreak of meningitis in the 1980s?)
Who would be the people most likely to blame if this was not just some
thousands-to-one chance? Presumably the medical profession. So who did QED
interview? The medical profession. And what did they do? Pooh-poohed all the
press hysteria. Is this really what television regards as good journalism?
Very irritating.
The most bizarre programme of the week was surely the first in BBC2's series
Over The Edge. This seemed at first like a Monty Python satire on all those
transexual programmes where men earnestly explain how they spent years
knowing that deep inside they were really women.
In the case of Over The Edge, the men spent years knowing that deep inside
they were really amputees. The American in this programme eventually
achieved amputation by taking a shotgun to his leg, but his young English
admirer was still agonising over the unwillingness of the surgeons to lop
off a limb.
You have to pity such people, but what of the television service which
decides that, among all the world's appalling problems, this is the one that
deserves half an hour of national network time? Ex-tremely irritating.
It is clearly time to take a break from the idiot's lantern. Back in three
weeks.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Arts: Accent on French charm - Cabaret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sacha Distel is the short Frenchman famous for being an early lover of
Brigitte Bardot, and for a sad reflective smile: perhaps there is a
connection between the two.
In the days when Saturday night television was incomplete without a variety
spectacular he often popped up between the dancing girls, singing love songs
in a disarmingly Gallic style. Now Distel is briefly back in London, for his
first cabaret performance in 15 years.
He seemed nervous on opening night, unsure whether the twinkle of a man now
in his 60s could still brighten the lives of the loyal ladies who crowded
most of the tables.
He need not have worried. Distel has very little voice but beaucoup de
charm. He also has a surprising amount of musical talent: after all, his
uncle was the bandleader Ray Ventura and Distel was a skilled jazz
guitarist, good enough to play with Stan Getz and the Modern Jazz Quartet,
before the women started drooling and his career went commercial.
He can still liven up his act with impressive solos, especially a
sympathetic version of Django Reinhardt's 'Nuage', which brought respectful
looks from his backing trio. He also admits to having written 'The Good
Life', the doleful ballad not the sitcom, and includes a snatch in a medley
of French hits, or rather hit: the greatest French contribution to popular
culture will always remain Claude Francois' 'My Way' and it was good to hear
it in its triste original.
Distel keeps his cute accent well under control, only milking it during a
skilled impersonation of that professional Frenchman, Maurice Chevalier. For
the most part he performs the American standards - 'My funny Valentine',
'Just one of those things' - with style and grace.
He showed his new maturity by hardly bothering to feature his excruciating
hit 'Raindrops keep falling on my head' and only really tripped up when
trying to be contemporary with a mangled, tentative, version of Prince's
'Most beautiful girl in the world', which he had rashly added to his
repertoire that morning.
It is probably better to have an ingenuous Distel rather than a smug one,
but you hope that he gains enough in confidence during the run, which ends
on July 30, to confront the audience more energetically.
If he can get the critics' table 'dadedadeda-ing' to 'Song Sung Blue' there
is no reason why he should not leave the stage to work the room and perch on
a few welcoming laps, which will have paid Pounds 20 for 70 minutes or so of
this close-up cabaret, or Pounds 45 if they took dinner, too.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Making plans for rubbish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To their dismay, the Poles are finding that market-based societies produce a
great deal of waste.
They are struggling to deal with growing mounds of rubbish as the
consumption of packaged consumer goods rises, although city populations
remain stable.
Warsaw produces 470,000 tonnes of solid waste a year. Now, the Polish
capital, with a population of 1.6m, has chosen an Italian-led consortium to
study its problems in a Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 329,000) European
Union-financed study designed to pave the way for the restructuring and
privatisation of the city's disposal systems.
Officials hope the study will also lead to a 'garbage' law regulating an
area once left to the municipal authorities. Private competition is growing;
as much as 30 per cent of solid waste is taken to the city's only rubbish
dump 50km away by independent contractors, leaving less profitable 'routes'
to municipal employees.
The law would provide a regulatory framework to marry market needs with
assurances that city dwellers will be adequately served by the city's
disposal system.
Financial institutions such as the World Bank are waiting for such rules to
be put into place before considering loans to the municipal sector, since
they see the Warsaw project as a pilot scheme.
The consortium led by Fi. Mar, part of the Marchini group, includes AMIU
Modena, an Italian waste disposal company, and Prochem, a privatised Polish
chemical industry design company.
Market research will be carried out to gauge opinion among the city's 2,000
dustmen who are likely to resist change.
Already, a restructuring and privatisation scheme, prepared by Drawline, a
UK consultancy, for the city's buses has drawn criticism from the unions
representing some 10,000 transport employees.
The waste disposal project, in common with the transport plan and planned
studies on the city's water and road system, will form a blueprint for the
reform and privatisation of the city's infrastructure.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Uniting the Americas - A look
at controversial plans to complete a highway linking Colombia to Panama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
But for a gap of just over 100km, it would be possible to drive from Alaska
to Patagonia.
For more than 60 years, while governments pondered the road connection, the
Darien rainforests and swamps on the borders of Colombia and Panama have
held out against trucks and tourists, allowing an extraordinary natural
museum to survive. Now that the political decision to bridge the gap seems
to be crystallising, new options which would lessen environmental damage are
emerging.
Linking the Americas is a romantic challenge that dates back to the 1920s.
In 1971, when the US signed agreements for the completion of the highway
with Colombia and Panama, the Colombian section was expected to cost Dollars
60m (Pounds 40m). At that time, technical rather than environmental problems
preoccupied the planners, especially the 20km section across the River
Atrato wetlands and the 1.3km bridge over the river.
However, views have changed and the Inter-American Development Bank recently
approved a Dollars 1.5m loan for outlining the terms of reference for an
environmental study. The estimated cost has also changed and is now near
Dollars 300m.
The original, most direct, route was planned to run through two national
parks, the Katios park on the Colombian side and the Darien park in Panama.
The isthmus has a wide variety of species and is the key transition area for
flora and fauna between North and South America. The Katios park was created
as a buffer zone to protect Central and North American countries from foot
and mouth disease. Cattle in north-western Colombia are now reported to be
free of the disease and the US Department of Agriculture has lifted its
objection to completing the road.
Although the 1971 agreement pledged the US to contribute two-thirds of the
cost of the pan-American link, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club
have campaigned strongly against the highway and early this year the
International Union for Conservaion of Nature meeting in Buenos Aires
opposed the road on the grounds that conserving the Darien should be an
international priority.
In Colombia and Panama, the anti-road lobby consists mainly of environmental
groups and of Indians living in the area. Roads began to penetrate the
north-western region of Colombia known as Uraba from the 1950s, with
settlers following close behind. Vast areas were razed for timber and then
planted with bananas. Later marijuana and coca growing spread into Uraba,
while drug traffickers bought up land cleared of trees and turned it into
cattle ranches.
'It's a very fragile area; there must be proper environmental and
socio-cultural studies with the participation of Indian communities on both
sides of the border,' says Alberto Achita, an Embera Indian and a leader of
the regional Indian organisation Orewa.
Colombia has always been more interested than Panama in finishing the
highway. As a result of the development of the Uraba region, peasants and
Indians were pushed off their lands and into southern Panama. Uraba is also
infested with paramilitary groups and guerrilla columns living mainly by
extortion.
Colombians - especially smugglers of arms, drugs and consumer goods - are
regularly deported from Panama and the Panamanian government is concerned
that completion of the road would exacerbate its problems. Colombia argues
that, on the contrary, it would be easier to mobilise troops to control the
situation.
Gustavo Gaviria presides over a government commission working on bi-national
issues with Panama: 'It is not possible that, as we reach the 21st century,
the Americas are not united because of a few kilometres of road. The road
would help the two governments to preserve sovereignty on their frontiers
and it would benefit trade and tourism, particularly for Medellin and the
north coast of Colombia.'
'This should be a road for the Americas, a multinational project built with
funding from all countries. The Katios park would be looked after jointly
and a pan-American ecological university established to study the area,'
Gaviria adds.
The idea seems to have some backing in government circles: Colombia's
President Cesar Gaviria goes to the Organisation of American States as
secretary general when he finishes his term and the OAS could be the
appropriate launch pad for such a venture.
What seems to have become clear is that alternative routes must be assessed.
The Biopacifico project, a United Nations biodiversity project under
Colombia's new environment ministry, has carried out a study that underlines
this point. The study publishes maps showing how the construction of a
29km-section of the pan-American highway devastated part of Uraba between
1970 and 1992.
Experience has shown that it is virtually impossible to prevent colonisation
and deforestation when roads open up new areas. The Katios and Darien parks
contain much of the best preserved forest in the region. The Biopacifico
study claims the present route would have an irreversible impact on such
local ecosystems and it suggests a less damaging alternative along the
Caribbean coastline. This would involve a ferry across the Gulf of Uraba
from Turbo and links between existing road on the Colombian side of the
frontier.
A road connecting the northern pan-American highway terminal to the
Caribbean coast of Panama is already planned and could connect with the
Colombian section.
While the road discussion continues, a Colombia-Panama ferry is due to start
before the end of the year. There will be three sailings a week between
Cartagena and Colon. It will make a more relaxing trip than battling through
rain, mud, fevers and bandits in the Darien.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Root of a problem - A look at
a tree-saving code for digging up pavements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain fretted last week about air quality in its towns and cities, a
conference on protecting endangered street trees was taking place in Norwich
under an oppressive heat haze made more unbearable by traffic fumes. The
opportunity to score a point was not lost on environmentalists who described
trees as providing air conditioning for cities - 'and one of the few
realistic counter-measures against traffic pollution.'
Yet many of the trees lining busy streets and suburban avenues in the UK
will be dead within a few years unless cable television companies can be
persuaded to be more careful about the way in which they plan to dig up an
estimated 60,000 miles of pavement.
Gas, electricity, telecommunications and water companies can be just as bad,
but they are less busy digging up streets as cable companies which have just
begun to install their services. Most of the tree roots, which provide vital
oxygen, water and anchorage, lie close to the surface and are severed when
even shallow trenches are dug, says the Arboricultural Association.
The threat is enormous: cable companies, under the 120 licences granted so
far by the Department of Trade and Industry, are expected to have reached
12.5m homes within the next four years. This works out at 288 miles of
trenches a week or a staggering 40 miles a day, according to Chris Baines, a
Wolverhampton-based environmental consultant.
Baines is campaigning to change the law which exempts utilities and cable
companies from local authority planning controls, leaving them virtually
free to dig when and where they like.
He says: 'Companies at the moment only have to satisfy the requirements of
the Highway Authority, which is solely concerned about traffic management.
They are delighted when companies dig up pavements rather than roads.
'Unfortunately, most roots run under pavements where there is more moisture
and oxygen than under concrete roads and where they can find their way into
front gardens. The damage currently being inflicted on street trees is worse
than the ravages of Dutch Elm disease or the great storm in 1987.'
It is not all bad news. Gas, electricity, water and telecommunications
companies will this autumn launch a national code of conduct governing the
way in which streets should be dug up, in a bid to protect the trees.
A draft code has been prepared jointly for the Arboricultural Association
and the National Joint Utilities Group by a working party led by the
environment department which included the Cable Television Association
and local authority tree
officers.
The code is expected to call for small bore tunnelling close to trees.
Trenches will be expected to be hand dug to protect tree roots where
tunnelling is not possible. Repair techniques, such as pushing new pipes
through damaged old ones, means that pavements do not always have to be dug
up.
The cost need not be exorbitant. A study by Midland Cable in Wolverhampton
revealed that the city's 16,000 street trees affected less than 5 per cent
of the trenches that the cable company planned to excavate. The company,
advised by Baines, agreed to train contractors to hand-dig around the roots.
'The company, which previously had not realised the danger, recognised that
it was in its own interests not to damage the local environment and
antagonise potential customers,' says Baines.
Midland Cable has financed a video by the Black Country Urban Forestry Unit
showing how to install and repair services without destroying street trees.
This has been sent to chief executives of every local authority and cable
company in the country. 'It is a beginning,' says Baines, 'but there is much
more to be done if the trees are to be saved. It is too late for some
already.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Research leads recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertised demand for executives continues to show a steady upward trend,
according to the latest quarterly survey by MSL International, the
recruitment consultant.
The MSL Index of advertised demand for executives, which, its compilers say,
has unfailingly predicted the ups and downs of the British economy for more
than three decades, has risen again in the second quarter of the year.
The index - a 12-month running total that irons out seasonal variances  -
now stands at 79 against the 1959 base figure of 100.
After hitting an all-time low in the second quarter of 1992 and languishing
there to the middle of last year, the number of senior level appointments
began to rise and the latest figures show a rise for the fourth consecutive
quarter.
Ian Lloyd, MSL International's managing director, said: 'The latest figures
tell us that the recovery is firmly established.'
Recruiting has been particularly strong in research and development and in
marketing and sales, both areas which reflect confidence in long term
business prospects and investment for growth.
Activity in accounting and finance on a par with recruitment in marketing
leads Lloyd to conclude that investment is being tempered with a greater
degree of caution and control than in the 1980s.
Recruitment in high technology industries is showing the largest sectoral
rise: increasing 12 per cent on the last quarter and 89 per cent over the
same quarter in 1993, while advertised demand in the retail sector has
fallen 32 per cent in the quarter and is down 11 per cent on a year ago.
The graphs on the right show the sector and industry changes and the
movement in the index. This still has some way to go before it reflects
executive recruitment levels throughout most of the 1980s.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Initials that stand for main board advance -
Young finance directors are breaking into the top echelon of directorships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The youngest Turks in UK boardrooms are likely to be linguists with at least
a brace of qualifications to go with their drive and ambition, according to
a study into the board compositions of big companies.
Korn/Ferry Carre/Oban International, the executive search company,
identifies what it calls a 'new breed of executive' in its research,
covering more than 1,000 directors in 154 companies. The survey sample,
drawn from The Times 1000 list of the UK's largest companies, has produced
discernible trends in the composition of boardrooms, which may include some
useful pointers for recruiters.
One of the most striking features is the emergence of MBAs as an
increasingly prevalent qualification among directors. The report found that
10 per cent of executives under the age of 50 had MBAs.
Many of the younger and more highly qualified directors, said the report,
are fluent in at least one foreign language and have practical experience of
working overseas. Only two years ago a similar body of research found that
fewer than 1 in 5 UK directors had a second language. Unfortunately the
survey did not produce an overall languages comparison this year but intends
to have another look next year.
Some 71 per cent of directors in companies with Pounds 1bn annual turnover
and above, compared with 63 per cent in last year's sample, had degrees.
A trend away from accountancy qualifications seems to be emerging among
finance directors. Among the 35 finance directors surveyed in the Pounds
1bn-plus companies, just over half had accountancy qualifications and just
less than a quarter had MBAs.
In previous years accountancy qualifications had dominated to a much greater
degree over a smaller number of MBAs. This swing in emphasis among
qualifications is even more apparent in the report's analysis of directors
by generation.
Only 5 per cent of chairmen, deputies and chief executives over the age of
50 in the sample had degrees, compared with 61 per cent of degree holders
among their younger counterparts. While the older generation had the edge on
legal qualifications, younger directors had more accountancy qualifications
and MBAs.
One figure that bucked this trend was the greater percentage of finance
directors over the age of 50 with accountancy qualifications than in the
younger age group.
Michael Brandon, the Korn/Ferry director who co-authored the report, says
this does not mean that finance directors are becoming less qualified. Quite
the opposite. Many of the best qualified of the older age group, however,
appear to be have gone on to the top job in companies, so fewer of the high
flyers are represented in this group.
The findings also show how finance directors are becoming younger and
increasingly mobile. Two-thirds of the sample 35 from the biggest companies
had been recruited from outside the organisation and nearly a quarter of the
same group were under 45.
Directors, generally, under the age of 50 were more likely to have more than
one qualification, the report found.
Other findings included an increasing preparedness among companies to buy in
foreign talent to strengthen their understanding of overseas markets.
The 1994 UK Board of Directors Study costs Pounds 99 and can be obtained by
contacting Michael Brandon tel (0) 71 312 3100.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Time to play the very last song
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So Swan Hunter, one of the world's great shipbuilding names, looks doomed.
The Pounds 50m refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship had offered the famous
Tyneside company which has built 2,700 ships since 1860 a last hope.
But with Bedivere now lost, and no work beyond November, Swans faces
dismemberment of its assets and the redundancy of its remaining employees -
the last 660 at a company which, less than 20 years ago, employed 33,000.
Most receiverships get little media coverage. But Swans' struggle for
survival has symbolic force. It touched a nerve of anxiety about the erosion
of the country's heavy manufacturing base and the loss of skilled jobs for
men in an area which already has mainland Britain's highest regional
unemployment.
Receivership has also, poignantly, underlined the quality of the workforce
and its products.
In spite of repeated rounds of redundancies, the survivors have maintained a
pride in their work, achieving a number of 'firsts' in frigate building
standards and winning praise from the Royal Navy.
The spirit of the workforce has impressed Mr Gordon Horsfield, the joint
receiver. 'To work with people who are committed and give of their best all
the time is a tremendous experience for anyone,' he says.
The day the receivers arrived, the workers emerged at lunchtime weighed down
with their tools, fearing immediate closure. Union leaders addressed them in
the driving rain that afternoon, urging them that by resuming work they
could save the company.
None of the 'gang of four' - the directors who led the 1986 management
buy-out which re-privatised Swans - were there.
'They would have probably been lynched,' said Mr Dick Gonzales, a union
leader. 'We were talking about a workforce with an average 20 years'
service, people who'd seen a livelihood possibly disappear within hours.'
The workforce's resolve to keep working enabled the receivers to negotiate
with the Ministry of Defence for Swans to continue outfitting work on the
three Type 23 frigates then at the yard. That gave 18 months' work and time
to seek a buyer for Swans as a going concern and to tender for more work.
The receivers strove to retain the 'golden nugget' of skilled staff, in
spite of reducing from 2,500 employees to 660, as well as the 238 who were
laid off.
Up to 3.30pm yesterday, the workforce hoped its efforts would give the yard
a future.
'We have great belief in ourselves, we know what we can achieve,' said Mr
Harry Cooper, a shipwright.
In spite of the optimism which surrounded the 1986 buy-out, warning signs
were already apparent. Within weeks it suffered a 'rude awakening', said
former joint managing director Mr Alex Marsh, when it lost a confidently
expected MoD order for the first auxiliary oiler replenishment vessel.
Swans, which had an annual turnover in the mid-1980s of about Pounds 100m,
won other MoD orders and made profits in the late 1980s. But the defence
procurement climate was changing rapidly with fewer orders and greater
pressure on price and profit margins. Solely owned by its directors, it had
no external finance to support the costs of redundancies and
diversification. An export drive consumed money but brought no new-build
export orders.
Needing work, Swans took the contract for the James Clark Ross, a British
Antarctic Survey ship. A technological triumph, it was a financial disaster,
losing Pounds 17m in 1991 and wiping out the reserves.
This meant Swans could not obtain underwriting for the performance bonds
required by the MoD, and consequently could not tender on its own for the
MoD helicopter carrier order then vital to its survival.
Mr Marsh said: 'We were too small in what had become a highly aggressive
market; we didn't have the financial and political clout necessary.'
GEC - owner of Yarrow, Swans' rival for Type 23 frigates - concluded heads
of agreement to acquire the company. But when Swans lost the
helicopter-carrier order to VSEL the deal was off.
Swans' net debt on receivership, two days later, was Pounds 51m, including
11m to Lloyds Bank, Pounds 12m to suppliers and Pounds 28m inter-company
obligations.
Only one potential buyer, CMN, emerged. It was always adamant it would only
buy Swans if it had two years' work - that meant Bedivere.
Redundancy before Christmas now looks almost inevitable for the last
employees. Their wages are among the lowest in UK shipbuilding and they can
expect only the minimum redundancy - 20 years' service will be worth barely
Pounds 4,000. Their prospects of other work look slim. Union surveys of the
1,400 made redundant in the first year of receivership show more than 75 per
cent still unemployed.
Mr Graham Gibson, 39, made redundant in May last year from his operations
control job after 19 years at Swans, found himself competing against 2,300
applicants for one job at a Gateshead printing company. He said: 'The only
consolation is there are so many people unemployed at least you don't feel
it's something wrong with you.'
Mr Cooper sees few prospects outside the yard, but of two things he is sure:
'We will still finish Richmond (the last frigate) on time. Then we'll go up
the road and sign on the dole.'

Simon Berry, 36, has been appointed to the board of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, one
of the UK's most well-known independent wine and spirits merchants. Berry
will continue working as the company's marketing director for the wine
division.
He is the seventh generation of the Berry family in the company, which has
remained independent and family-owned since 1698. He joined the company in
1977, first in the cellars and then in the original St James's shop, where
he was responsible for managing wine sales to the City.
Berry has spent all his working life in the wine business since leaving
school in 1975. His first employment was with Deinhard &amp; Co, shippers of
German wines, before moving to Moet et Chandon in Epernay, where he gave
wine tours to visitors.
He became Berry Bros &amp; Rudd's marketing manager in 1983, moving up to
marketing director in 1987. Recently he has been closely involved in
establishing the company's duty free shop at Heathrow airport, which opened
last month.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Management: Consultants try to get IT right - Clients are
critical about the quality of the advice they receive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information technology consultancy - a market worth an estimated Pounds 750m
a year - has been one of the fastest growing areas for management
consultants. But a litany of embarrassments ranging from Taurus, the London
Stock Exchange's failed paperless trading system, to vast write-offs on
government computer projects, has put the quality of their work under the
spotlight.
'There is considerable scepticism, even cynicism, among many users of IT
consultancy about the contribution that IT consultants can make,' according
to a new report on them by Business Intelligence, a research company.
Consultants' understanding of technology is rarely in doubt. But the
quality, independence and value-for-money of their advice is frequently
criticised, according to a survey of 187 clients carried out for the report.
The clients' complaints about the quality of consultants' advice include
poor understanding of the brief, superficial skills, inadequate control of
the work, lack of quality standards and lack of hands-on experience.
Many clients are concerned about whether the consultants are genuinely
independent, or whether there are hidden links between the consultant and
hardware and software suppliers.
Such links are not necessarily a disadvantage: a relationship between
supplier and consultant could make the consultant more expert at
implementing a product. The main problem arises when the relationship is not
disclosed to the client. There have even been secret payments to consultants
to recommend equipment or software, the report claims.
A common criticism of consultants, who charge up to Pounds 3,000 a day, is
poor value. 'Huge fees now demanded for major projects have become an issue
even for clients with traditionally deep pockets,' says Peter Bartram, the
report's author.
Consultants are often criticised for self-interest. They have a 'pit bull
instinct for continuously regarding us as a future revenue generating
opportunity,' according to John Cross, general manager of IT at BP
Exploration.
Not all criticisms should be taken at face value, however. Consultants
believe clients are sometimes responsible for a share of the blame when
projects go wrong. When Andersen Consultancy was criticised in the press for
its handling of a Social Security computerisation project, it responded by
blaming clients whose 'reluctance to take the advice of experts under the
mistaken belief that it is offered in self-interest also compounds the
problem.'
Moreover, the extent of the dissatisfaction should not be exaggerated. When
clients were asked to rate the consultants on a scale of one (very poor) to
five (excellent) on a sample of 187 projects, the average score was 3.7. The
skills at issue were the consultants' understanding of the brief, the
relevance of a proposed solution, understanding, knowledge, experience,
communication skills, integrity, effectiveness and value for money.
PA Consulting was ranked highest among the large consultancies with a client
satisfaction rating of 4.15. The other large consultancies, in order of
their rating, were LBMS, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, KPMG Management Consulting, Sema
Group, Touche Ross, Andersen Consulting, Price Waterhouse and International
Business Machines.
These large international firms continue to dominate the business, even if
the outlook is uncertain. Some trends are working in their favour, such as
management fashions like business process re-engineering, which involve a
combination of general business and IT consultancy and give large,
broad-based consultancies a clear edge over smaller firms. On the other
hand, smaller operations, many with excellent skills and far lower fees,
represent a growing threat.
Another potential concern for the large firms is that the IT consultancy
business may grow at a relatively modest pace. Over the next two years, 57
per cent of companies surveyed expect spending on IT consulting to stay the
same; the rest were split between expecting it to fall and expecting it to
rise.
The Business Intelligence study believes the cautious approach to
consultancy spending could reflect the pared down IT investment plans of
some organisations. 'More organisations are seeking to make their
consultancy budgets work harder for them - for example, by switching more
work to less expensive boutiques and sole practitioners and away from the
large international consultancies, it says.
The large consultancies could lose business unless they recognise the need
to improve their image and provide greater value for money, it concludes.

FT  20 JUL 94 / People: Ford takes a seat with London Transport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Transport has finally found a chairman acceptable to the government
in the shape of Peter Ford, formerly a director of P&amp;O Steam Navigation and
chairman of P&amp;O European Ferries.
The man originally intended for the job, Alan Watkins, London Transport's
deputy chairman and chief, was blocked by the government because of his
sharply-worded criticisms of cuts in LT's budget.
The decision not to appoint Watkins prompted an angry response from within
LT and an expression of 'deep regret' from the retiring chairman, Sir
Wilfred Newton. Sir Wilfred was forced to stay on extra six months.
Ford, 55, takes up his new appointment on September 15 and will be
immediately pitched into the privatisation of London Buses, due to be
completed later this year. There is a strong possibility that once rail
privatisation is completed the government will look at selling off London
Underground, leaving London Transport with little to do.
During his time with P&amp;O, Ford spent time in the group's shopping centres
and exhibitions divisions. He has a degree in chemistry from Oxford
University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Ford is regarded as one of the key lieutenants of Lord Sterling, chairman of
P&amp;O. He was one of a small group of executives who followed Lord Sterling
around as he expanded out of the property business and took control of P&amp;O.
Ford had been chairman of P&amp;O European Ferries for just three weeks when the
ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, overturned with the loss of nearly 200
lives on leaving the harbour of Zeebrugge in March 1987.

FT  20 JUL 94 / People: Manley's own award
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Manley has been trying to retire for some time. But after more than 30
years in the television and film business he has not managed to achieve it.
For 30 years he worked at Colour Film Services; he started there as company
secretary when it was really a film laboratory. By the time he retired, he
was managing director of a much broader company involved in everything from
video to the latest computer technology.
For more than 13 years, Manley, 59, served on the board of management of The
British Academy of Film and Television Arts and became finance director for
three years after his retirement; he is an accountant by training. He
retired to concentrate on entertainment industry charities; he is treasurer
of the Children's Film Unit.
But now he has embarked on a second career. Having been enticed back to
Bafta this year to run the organisation's famous awards ceremony - the
British equivalent of the Oscars - following the resignation last year of
Bafta director Tony Byrne, Manley has now been appointed chief executive.
' I haven't got a contract. All the people on the board are my friends. I
will stay as long as they want me,' he says.
The film and television organisation has been facing financial problems
mainly because a new lease was signed virtually on the day the recession
arrived and conference business began to dry up. 'We are very bullish about
the future. We have survived and things are beginning to look up,' he says.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Management: The end of a tradition - Japan's jobs-for-life
culture is disappearing but where does that leave new graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of Japan's graduates are having a hard time these days as companies
respond to sagging export markets, soaring costs and dwindling productivity
by putting a brake on new hiring instead of laying off inefficient or
surplus managers.
In the days when implacable growth seemed to be the norm for the Japanese
economy, most were virtually assured of a job on leaving university or
college. But now, says Jason James, strategist at stockbrokers James Capel
Pacific in Tokyo, 'it's a vicious cyclical market for graduates'.
Since the boom, or 'bubble', economy of the late 1980s ended in recession,
more of Japan's graduates leave college, high school and university each
year with no jobs: this year, the figure was around 150,000. They are
sometimes called employment-seeking ronin after the name for wandering
samurai without a lord in the feudal past.
Eventually, Japan's industry - still clogged with regulations which make it
hard for foreign companies and domestic start-ups to enter the market -
could benefit if bright graduates are forced to join smaller firms. At
present, adds James, the squeezing out of graduates from the traditional job
market represents 'one of the unfairnesses of the way Japanese restructuring
is going on'.
Thus the virtues of the Japanese employment system - jobs for life in most
companies and a high degree of commitment - now tend to work against the
young, believes Haruo Shimada, economics professor at Keio University. 'Able
college graduates are without jobs, but the less able who were hired in the
'bubble' are in no danger.'
In a country heavily committed to lifetime employment, redundancies are
almost unknown. Unemployment is a mere 2.8 per cent. Even lowering the
retirement age can bring down a torrent of criticism. Okuma, the ailing
machine tool company, found this out a few months ago; its president had to
resign after planning to cut the retirement age from 60 to 55.
Okuma provoked so much publicity that it is likely to remain a rare example
of a company trying to edge out employees early. 'Some companies do try to
retire people early with incentives,' notes Kuniyoshi Sasaki, director of
the Japan Productivity Centre. 'But Okuma is the exception of exceptions.'
The adverse publicity it provoked is likely to deter other companies from
trying the same, although Pioneer and TDK in the electronics sector have
also put pressure on managers to retire early.
The problem with Okuma's action was, says James, that 'it got into the
newspapers. If you're going to do anything, you'd better do it quickly'. But
most Japanese companies are not geared up for quick action on the employment
front. 'Only a few companies have done enough,' believes Shintaro Hori,
managing director of the Japanese office of Bain, the consultancy.
Cutting down on recruits and not replacing employees who leave is the easy
part. Honda, the car company, hired 2,075 graduates and school leavers in
1990; this year's figure was 250 and next year's will be around 200.
Fujitsu, the computer concern, used to take on at least 2,000 graduates
every year. Last year, this was 300 and the 1995 figure is expected to be
some 400.
Both companies have, by Japanese standards, gone a long way down the road
towards restructuring their operations. This has involved an extensive
rethinking of the way they work. Under Nobuhiko Kawamoto, its president,
Honda has looked at every aspect of its business and sought to make managers
more responsive to the tougher conditions of the 1990s.
It has introduced a payment system based on merit rather than seniority for
its 4,500 managers in Japan, being among the first in industry to do this.
Goals are worked out for each manager and performance assessed a year later.
More radically for consensus-minded Japan, Honda has just introduced a
tenure system to speed up the progress of bright managers through the
promotion chain.
There is a three-year transition before the system starts to bite. 'This is
a long period,' admits Kawamoto, 'but the change is still drastic for the
Japanese. Most people thought they would be managers until they retired, but
now limits are being set.' Some with specialised functions in research,
legal, advertising or other areas may welcome being freed from the
administrative burden. 'But some people will be shocked.'
In the computer and electronics sectors, where competition is fierce and
product cycles ever shorter, companies tend to be more open to new ways of
doing business. Fujitsu has also moved to a merit-based salary system for
managers and will also encourage people with exciting new ideas to start up
their own businesses - with company backing - or develop projects
internally.
'This is an attempt to change the conventional system we have in Japan of
lifetime employment,' says Toru Katsurada, personnel director. But in trying
to shake up the system, companies are desperate not to demotivate staff and
weaken the loyalty ties that have helped Japan become the world's second
biggest economy. 'It is important for us to sustain the willingness and
interest of our workers, especially the skilled ones developing products,'
adds Katsurada.
That is the dilemma for Japanese companies: how to keep the old virtues
without stultifying creativity and enthusiasm. 'Japan has never really had
the test of downsizing,' says Shimada. 'It's never experienced a long-run
downturn since the second world war.' Thus the system has provided what he
calls an 'incumbents' paradise'. But for many managers, Japanese industry
looks like becoming more uncomfortable and less secure.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Unionists receive settlement pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday reassured senior Ulster Unionists that efforts to
forge a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland would not lead to
Dublin sharing authority over the province.
The prime minister told Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, that he had no
intention of 'moving in the direction' of joint sovereignty over the
province.
In a one-hour meeting at Downing Street the two men also discussed security
matters and the purpose of the framework document that London has been
attempting to agree with the Irish government.
The meeting, which was attended by other senior figures from both sides, was
portrayed as the latest in a series of discussions with leaders of the
province's main political parties.
Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic
and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party, has been pencilled in for next week.
Mr Molyneaux said the prime minister had given a 'definite, firm assurance
that he was not in the business of joint authority, joint sovereignty or
even the slippery slope leading to either of these two developments'.
But in remarks likely to reassure Dublin, senior Downing Street officials
later emphasised that the establishment of new north-south institutions with
executive powers had not been ruled out.
Yesterday's meeting came 24 hours after Dublin responded with annoyance to a
newspaper interview with Sir Patrick Mayhew in which the Northern Ireland
secretary indicated that Dublin's territorial claim over Ulster was the
central issue to be resolved in drafting the framework document.
It came five days before Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is due to
decide its formal response to last year's Downing Street Declaration.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Final touches put to cabinet shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was last night putting the final touches to a mid-term
reshuffle which will see the departure of about a dozen ministers from his
government.
As he prepared later today to unveil the most extensive changes since he
took office in 1990, senior ministers said at least three, and quite
possibly four, of their colleagues expected to leave the cabinet.
This will be accompanied by a much more sweeping shake-out in the middle and
lower ministerial ranks, with a number of promising backbench MPs entering
the government for the first time.
The hopes of Lord Archer, the best-selling novelist and Tory party
fundraiser, for a place in the government were raised by the news that an
official report into alleged insider trading had been completed by
Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. As the report landed on the
desk of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, there was
pressure on the DTI to issue an immediate statement. Lord Archer is
convinced he will be exonerated of allegations of passing on insider
information about the takeover by MAI of Anglia Television.
The reshuffle will provide the first clear indication of how Mr Major
intends to counter the threat posed by the anticipated election tomorrow of
Mr Tony Blair as Labour leader.
The fate of figures on the right such as Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, will signal whether the prime minister intends to
follow the more rightwing tone of his rhetoric with a shift in policy
substance.
The three most important posts in the administration - the Treasury, Foreign
Office and Home Office jobs - are expected to remain in the hands of Mr
Kenneth Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Michael Howard respectively.
With Mr Heseltine determined not to be party chairman, Tory officials said
the choice would be from any one of four or five senior ministers. Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health
minister, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, are among those mentioned as possible replacements for
Sir Norman Fowler.
Mr Peter Brooke, Mr John Patten and Mr John MacGregor - among the most
likely candidates for retirement or dismissal - were all missing from the
front bench during Mr Major's last appearance in the Commons yesterday
before the summer recess. Lord Wakeham, the leader of the House of Lords, is
also widely expected to step down.
Mr Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury and Mr Jonathan Aitken at defence appear
certain of promotion. Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, may just
make cabinet rank.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Wimpey to build 'village' at Royal Docks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest housebuilders, has been chosen to begin the
first large-scale redevelopment of London's former Royal Docks.
The company has beaten off a challenge from a rival consortium to construct
a Pounds 70m 'open village' which will provide more than 850 new homes,
shops, a community and healthcare centre and other facilities on the south
side of the Royal Victoria Dock. Most previous large construction in
Docklands has been to the west in the West India and Millwall Docks on the
Isle of Dogs, to the south around the Surrey Docks, or to the north at
Beckton.
The development will begin at a time when homes and offices in Docklands are
selling and letting faster than at any time since the late 1980s. The London
Docklands Development Corporation said more than 800,000 sq ft of offices
were let in the 12 months to the end of March, the highest annual total
since 1987 and 50 per cent more than the previous two years combined. More
than half of the office space in Canary Wharf, which came out of
administrative receivership last year, is let.
The corporation expects more than 1,000 homes to be completed in the area
this year, after four years of recession in which almost no new private
homes were built.
In choosing Wimpey the corporation rejected a rival bid from a consortium of
Barratt Homes, Fairclough and Ideal Homes. The development represents the
first phase of a much larger scheme for up to 1,800 homes together with a
large number of workshops and studios to provide local jobs.
Wimpey will start building this winter with the first homes ready for
occupation in the autumn next year. Most of the homes will be for private
sale.
The corporation has invited another four development consortia to bid for an
exhibition centre, expected to cost more than Pounds 100m, on the north side
of Royal Victoria Dock. Detailed plans and financial proposals must be
submitted by the end of September.
The four consortia are:
London International Exhibition Centre, comprising Sir Robert McAlpine,
Trafalgar House Developments, Try Construction and Expvenue, a group of
exhibition companies.
Earls Court and Olympia, of which P&amp;O is the parent.
Sair, an association of European professional consultants, including
planners, architects and engineers.
A consortium of European construction interests, representing Arcoma,
Gleeds, Ove Arup, Mowlem and Cogefar-Empresit.

A Labour government would prevent the privatised water companies cutting off
supplies to domestic premises for non-payment of bills, Mr Chris Smith,
shadow environment minister, pledged yesterday.
He told the Commons that Labour would also impose a tougher regulatory
regime to curb excessive increases in charges and would not allow the
compulsory introduction of meters for domestic users.
A Labour motion calling for a tougher regulatory regime for water that 'puts
the public first' was defeated by a government majority of 34 (291-257).

The controversial Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday told MPs it
had met or exceeded all government targets set for it in the year to the end
of March.
The Liverpool-based corporation has been under fire from the Commons public
accounts committee over losses of nearly Pounds 700,000 on an opera concert
staged to celebrate a tall ships regatta in 1992.
The corporation's annual report says it has reclaimed 47 acres of land in
the last year, built nearly five miles of new roads and 402 houses,
developed more than 750,000 sq ft of commercial floor space, secured 2,753
jobs and attracted Pounds 37m of private-sector investment.
