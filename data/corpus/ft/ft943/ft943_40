FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich falls prey to fresh
weakness in Roche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses had a mixed day. The recovery in the dollar, in US treasuries and in
European bonds helped in some countries, particularly Germany, where the
expiry of DTB options contracts exaggerated the ebullience of equities.
However, there was continued equity weakness in Switzerland, where bonds
were a strong market, and Madrid ran out of steam although Spanish bonds had
been the strongest market of the week, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH was lifted by the expiry of July futures contracts early in the day
but, subsequently, Roche reasserted its negative influence. The SMI index
finished 13.4 lower at 2,514.9, after a high of 2,556.3, and 1.8 per cent
lower on the week.
In its latest market outlook, CS Investment Research said that the downside
potential for the market was limited and that a turnround was likely in the
next two to four weeks.
Roche certificates, under pressure earlier in the week after disappointing
half-year sales figures, gave up SFr70 to SFr5,430 with foreign investors
said to be taking profits after Thursday's improvement. According to one
analyst, it appeared that index-linked funds were selling in order to switch
holdings out of Switzerland. Ciba dipped SFr5 to SFr730 and Sandoz gave up
SFr6 to SFr679.
Banks, which produce half-year statements next month, ended mixed. UBS lost
SFr6 to SFr1,166 and CS Holding rose SFr4 to SFr577.
FRANKFURT consolidated Thursday afternoon's gains on the surge in bund
futures, climbed about another percentage point on the session and then
broke through the 2,100 mark in the afternoon, the Ibis-indicated Dax ending
the day 1.6 per cent higher over 24 hours at 2,103.54.
In official trading hours, it was up 2.1 per cent on the week at 2,093.61,
turnover climbing from DM5.4bn to DM8.1bn, but market professionals said
that both the scale of rises and business activity were inflated by the DTB
closures.
It was noticeable, they said, that the most of the big moves came in shares
with a heavy weighting in the Dax. Allianz rose DM64 to DM2,497 on the
session, and another DM19 to DM2,516 after hours. The top three shares by
moves in Ibis trading were Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens.
Outside the Dax index the ladies clothing company, Escada, put on DM31 or
9.6 per cent to DM353 on positive first-half figures, and the forecast that
this year's results will exceed expectations.
MILAN was unable to maintain early momentum on the last day of the monthly
account as the clash between the government and magistrates over moves to
limit powers of arrest in corruption cases raised the political temperature.
The Comit index finished 9.91 higher at 711.12, a 3.5 per cent rise on the
week. However, the real-time Mibtel index reflected the day's pull-back,
ending 16 higher at 11,294, after an early high of 11,427.
Independent Strategy, which has reduced its exposure to Italian equities
from a neutral 2.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent in its model portfolio,
commented that the government measures announced on Wednesday were unlikely
to be sufficient to achieve their budgetary target, and that the deficit
could rise to 11-12 per cent of GDP next year. The London-based group
thought that the government's failure to institute credible measures to
reduce the deficit in 1994 and 1995 would weigh heavily on financial market
sentiment.
Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley also reiterated an underweight
recommendation in Italy, commenting that the Berlusconi factor was no longer
a positive and Italian politics looked as fragmented as ever. The market's
valuation was high at 21.6 times 1995 prospective earnings and there was
still a significant equity supply overhang at a time when even domestic fund
flows were slowing, he said.
Telecommunications stocks remained in demand, Stet rising L89 to L5,607 and
Sip adding L60 to L4,446.
Some insurers also continued their strong showing. Ina added L28 to L2,430
while Ras was up L550 to L26,200. Generali was an exception, giving up L350
to L41,850.
AMSTERDAM was mainly unaffected by the expiry of options and the AEX index
closed the session 3.25 higher at 392.09, for a week's rise of 1.6 per cent.
The main international stocks were firmer, reflecting dollar stability:
Royal Dutch was up Fl 2.30 at Fl 190.10 and Unilever was Fl 1.20 higher at
Fl 184.80.
Heineken, strong in recent sessions, slipped 50 cents to Fl 221.50. Hoare
Govett rated the stock a buy yesterday and forecast 1994 eps of Fl 14.50 per
share and Fl 16.20 for 1995.
MADRID was rescued by Telefonica which rose Pta50 to Pta1,870 in 5.7bn
shares. Turnover was inflated by the closure of futures contracts but the
general index rose only 0.13 to 302.79, up 3.1 per cent on the week.

FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banking sector was in the vanguard of the market's advance with fund
managers across Europe said to have moved quickly to fill in underweight
positions.
'There was a feeling that many institutions have missed the bottom of the
market and have started to panic,' said one marketmaker who pointed out that
the banks have been left behind by the market for many months.
News that the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society intends to announce
revised terms for its merger with Lloyds Bank by the middle of next month
was seen as the trigger for the upsurge in the sector. Lloyds shares raced
closed 21 higher at 557p after turnover of 5.7m.
NatWest, viewed by some as the cheapest stock in the sector because of its
expansion in the US, leapt 16 to 470p on 8.9m traded, while Barclays rose 15
to 554p. HSBC raced up 31 to 727p with dealers pointing to the strong rally
in the dollar, linked to the HK dollar, and stories that HSBC is about to
embark on a big expansion policy outside of Europe.
SG Warburg slipped 4 to 693p amid suggestions that the shares had been
downgraded by one of the market's leading brokers.
Personal credit group Provident Financial jumped 16 to 499p after Hoare
Govett published a buy note on the company, focusing on the attractions of
collected credit and the group's cost cutting.
Great Universal Stores recouped losses sustained following the
disappointment over the non-appearance of a share buy back as the stock
responded to some cautiously positive comment on the company's fundamentals.
The shares lifted 8 to 574p.
United Biscuits fell 5 to 309p as BZW cut its 1995 forecast by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 190m implying flat profits because of dull trading conditions in the
US and Europe and advised clients to sell the shares.
Advertising and marketing services group WPP jumped 5 to 107p as SG Warburg
published an in-depth recommendation. The house argued that the shares
deserved to trade at a 25 per cent premium to the market which translated to
a medium term target of 127p at current levels.
A slight setback in oil prices and a sluggish opening on Wall Street
restrained the oil majors where BP, much more highly geared than Shell to a
rising oil price, settled a penny off at 400p after turnover of 7.5m shares.
Shell, helped by the upsurge in markets, edged up 3 1/2 to 709p.
Enterprise Oil, a strong performer since its failed bid for Lasmo and
boosted by the recent strength in crude oil prices, suffered from a bout of
profits-taking to close 4 off at 427p but remained sharply higher over the
week.
British Gas was the pick of the energy sector, the shares advancing 6 1/2 to
284p as dealers responded to a growing view that legislation to introduce
competition in the domestic gas market will be delayed for at least a year.
Retailer Marks &amp; Spencer improved 9 to 415 1/2 p on the anticipated boost to
profits prompted by its decision to open on Sundays. Suppliers also
benefited - Claremont Garments rose 16 pence to 315p, Dewhirst 4 to 130p and
Courtaulds Textiles 15 to 505p.
Hartstone, the leather goods and hosiery manufacturer, fell 10 to 22p as it
announced a Pounds 70.7m loss after exceptionals against Pounds 9.86m
previously and a deeply discounted two-for-one rights issue at 15p a share
to raise Pounds 30.3m. The cash call had been well flagged but the size of
it was a surprise.
Negative press comment for Rank Organisation, after better than expected
interim figures on Thursday, left the shares trailing 3 to 402p.
Whitbread rose 14 to 538p ahead of next week's annual meeting. Some analysts
said the group was trading ahead of budget and brewing margins were
stabilising.
Turnover in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the thinly-traded brewer, hit 3.6m
as one marketmaker took on a line of 1.5m shares at 263 1/2 p and placed
them at 264 1/2 p. The share price rose 3 to 266p.
Industrial conglomerate BTR gave up 5 1/2 to 377p, in heavy trade of 9.7m
with UBS reported to be cautious.
Components manufacturer Automotive Precision Holdings, which hosted a group
of analysts last week, closed 5 ahead at 111p. Wagon Industrial jumped 21 to
499p, after a presentation to institutions.

FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low counter seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of a counter bid for Scottish supermarket chain William Low
sent the shares powering ahead 17 to 253p, well above the 225p a share
agreed offer made by Tesco the previous day.
Most of the support reflected the surprise announcement by J. Sainsbury that
it was considering its options. But the market was also scratching around
for other possible candidates. There was a feeling that some overseas groups
might grab at the chance to grab Low's 6.6 per cent of Scottish market
share. Two names that attracted some consideration were Rewe, one of
Germany's largest food retailers and Dairy Farm International, the food
retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson. The pressure on the bidder
and potential bidder saw Tesco restrained to a rise of only a half to 233p
and Sainsbury fall 2 1/2 to 397p.

FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn hopes dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leisure and electronics group Thorn EMI reversed an earlier rise to close 9
lower at 1065p, after the company dashed market speculation of a demerger of
a number of its businesses. Volume was 1.8m at the close.
The shares had risen sharply in recent sessions fired by speculation that
the group planned to split its rental and music businesses. However, the
chairman told the company's annual meeting yesterday that the current group
structure, 'was a positive advantage and adds significant value'.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court said the news was 'a slap in the face for
the punters' but there was value for fundamental buyers of the stock at
these levels.
The group also announced an increased stake in Thorn's joint music venture
in Japan with Toshiba.

FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gains as the last equity
account closes - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last equity trading account in London equities closed with the market in
good form yesterday as share prices rose sharply for the third successive
trading session. Trading volume showed a further increase, boosted by a
large trading programme from a US investment bank.
The FT-SE Index closed 24.4 up at 3,074.8, having achieved most of its gain
within the first hour of the market's opening. Traders were pleased to see
the index convincingly extend its gain above the 3,050 hurdle. Profit-taking
ahead of the close of the account, a London phenomena now consigned to the
history books, proved no check to a market which has risen by 110.9 points
on the Footsie over the past three trading sessions. The tone of the market
appeared very confident at the close of business and was supported by
favourable comments in weekly reports to clients by several leading
securities houses.
The Footsie has risen by about 4.7 per cent over the two-week account, with
the greater part of the rise taking place this week as concern over the
dollar has subsided, bringing a rally in bond markets and returning investor
attention to the economic recovery and low inflation in the UK. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index gained 21.6 to 3,551.3 yesterday, bringing the advance over
the account to nearly 4 per cent.
The financial sectors, with balance sheets filled with assets in the form of
market securities, stood out strongly in the market advance. Dollar-earning
stocks remained less active than the rest of the market, with oil shares
failing to keep pace as some profits were taken after the strong run earlier
this week.
Traders identified further share buying from overseas investment
institutions. The lead was reportedly taken by Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, with a programmed buying operation across both Footsie and
non-Footsie stocks. Consumer stocks were again enlivened by the implications
of the Tesco offer for William Low, which is now widely regarded as the
opening shot in a potentially far-ranging battle.
Building and contracting stocks, which have been held back by the fears over
prospects for a rise in base rates, continued to recover ground yesterday.
Companies with German involvement were particularly firm on the back of
persistent support from European institutions.
Equity volume, as reported through the Seaq electronic network, jumped to
856.4m shares, the highest total for several months and a 17 per cent
increase on the previous session.
A recovery in trading volumes, which had slipped away during the period of
concern over bond markets, was borne out by Thursday's total of Pounds
1.51bn in retail, or genuine investor business. This was the sixth
successive day of Pounds 1bn plus business, contrasting sharply with totals
below this benchmark number at the beginning of last week.
The gilt-edged market traded firmly for most of the day but turned less
certain following the announcement that the next auction of government
bonds, scheduled for Wednesday July 27, will be of conventional stock in the
2007-2011 maturity range. Some bond trading houses were believed to have
expected a variable rate issue and had to reshuffle their market positions
following the auction announcement. However, traders agreed that, 'It was
Friday afternoon, and not the best time to measure the market's response.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A squeeze in stock index futures and the expiry of the July series index
options turned out to be the main features in the derivatives, writes Joel
Kibazo.
At the close, the reading on the September contract on the FT-SE was 3,091,
up 21 on its previous close and 13 points above its fair value premium to
cash of 5 points. Volume was 17,865.
In traded options, the mid-morning expiry of the July index options passed
off without much difficulty. Total volume was 48,139 contracts with 22,524
lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar maintained its firmer tone of recent days in European trading
yesterday, helped by economic data which initially propped up the US bond
market, writes Philip Gawith.
The London market interpreted the data as showing that the US economy was
slowing, with little inflationary pressures.
The US currency finished one pfennig firmer in London at DM1.5558 from
DM1.5457, and at Y97.9050 from Y98.28. In New York it gave up early gains to
close at DM1.5531 and Y97.75, as bond prices weakened late in the day.
The dollar's London performance helped sterling to hold on to recent gains.
The pound finished slightly lower against the dollar, at Dollars 1.5586 from
Dollars 1.566, but was 1 1/2 pfennigs up against the D-Mark at DM2.4248 from
DM2.4089. In New York, sterling strengthened further to Dollars 1.56175.
The currency was buoyed by foreign investors appearing to take a better view
of UK assets, following the release of encouraging labour costs and average
earnings figures earlier this week.
Although some of yesterday's US data appeared to show signs of an economy
running up against capacity constraints, analysts said most of the higher
numbers were weather related. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy
at JP Morgan in Europe, said they all 'added to the current view of slower
growth and lower inflationary pressures.'
The market focused on the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index,
which dropped to 88.9 in the preliminary July index from 91.2 in the final
June index.
Mr Persaud said he was doubtful whether the dollar would continue its rally,
since the rally in the bond market was likely to prove shortlived. He said
the the sharp fall in yields - the yield on the ten year US treasury note
fell to below 7.20 yesterday from 7.47 at the start of the week - was not
sustainable.
The improved interest rate sentiment has been reflected in the futures
market. The December eurodollar contract settled yesterday at 94.25, thirty
five basis points firmer than the 93.90 close on Monday ahead of producer
and consumer inflation data releases.
Some traders are expecting a rate rise ahead of the Humphrey Hawkins
testimony next week of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
With inflation apparently under control, however, most observers believe the
Fed will wait until its next policy meeting on August 16.
In Europe the main excitement was provided by the lira which slipped to an
early low of L999.25 against the D-Mark before recovering to L993.8. The
market was concerned about a political row surrounding the anti-corruption
probe by magistrates.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 30m late
assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 1.549bn after forecasting a
shortage of Pounds 1.65bn, the largest for some time. Overnight money traded
between 4 and 6 1/2 per cent.
In the futures market meanwhile, the eurosterling contracts retraced some of
their recent gains. The December contract traded 27,000 lots to finish at
93.98 from 94.00. The December euromark contract finished at 95.10 from
95.12.

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the holiday season, activity in the pepper market have been picking
up lately, reports Man Producten. White pepper prices rose considerably
during the week, mainly in the forward positions, because of the delayed
harvest in Indonesia and a very tight spot position in Europe and the US.
The spot price went to about USDollars 3,150 a tonne and July-August
shipment was quoted at Dollars 3,050 cif. The more distant positions were
somewhat discounted. Black pepper prices also developed a much firmer trend
as soon as fresh buying interest appeared. All origins are now extremely
reluctant to sell, as if the real statistical picture has become a lot
clearer. Spot black pepper grade 1 was quoted at Dollars 1,900 a tonne and
fair average quality at about Dollars 1,825, with very little supply
available in Europe.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee trade stays on
frost alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London coffee traders proved reluctant yesterday to leave themselves exposed
to the possibility, however remote, of a third damaging frost hitting
Brazilian growing areas this weekend. Having followed New York lower in
early trading, the market gradually clawed back losses and by the close at
the London Commodity Exchange September delivery robusta futures were quoted
at Dollars 3,830 a tonne, up Dollars 24 on the day. That was Dollars 255
below Wednesday's 8 1/2 -year peak but still Dollars 760 up on the week.
Weather forecasters saw little prospect of a repeat of last weekend's
Brazilian frost, which, together with the one that hit two weeks early, is
expected by some analysts to cut the country's 1995-96 coffee crop to below
15m bags (60kg each) from the 25m forecast previously. But traders were
taking no chances, especially as next week will bring a new moon, which is
often associated with frosty weather.
The retreat from the highs had been heavily influenced by technical
considerations - Monday's opening leap left a huge 'gap' in the charts  -
but it was also encouraged by expectations, later confirmed, that the
Brazilian government was about to reopen export registrations, which had
been closed while it assessed the extent of the frost damage.
The cocoa market has been very much in coffee's shadow of late, but the
Pounds 1,073 a tonne reached by the second futures position yesterday was
the highest since it hit a 6 1/4 -year peak of Pounds 1,085 in May. And it
would certainly have exceeded that level had in not been for the slide in
the value of the dollar since then, which has held back London's
sterling-denominated cocoa prices. The price finished at Pounds 1,066 a
tonne, up Pounds 50 on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange prices were generally modestly higher on the
week, with overhead resistance frustrating attempts by the copper and
aluminium markets to move into higher ranges.
Copper's three months delivery price was forced to retreat once again from
the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne barrier yesterday after meeting profit-taking and
liquidation selling. It closed at Dollars 2,483.75 a tonne, up Dollars 16.25
on the week.
Meanwhile the three months aluminium price, having flirted with its
near-term target of Dollars 1,550 a tonne, a 39-month high, settled back to
Dollars 1,544.50, up Dollars 5 overall.
The earlier rises in these metals had been encouraged by news of further
drawdowns from their LME warehouse stocks. Aluminium's 11,625-tonne fall was
the ninth in succession and took the total to 86,550 below its record level
of June 10.
Zinc's stocks continued to rise, but that did not prevent it participating
in the market's overall firmness. The three months price was yesterday able
to consolidate its break above Dollars 1,000 a tonne, closing at Dollars
1,008.50, Dollars 6.50 off the day's peak but Dollars 26 up on the week.
The gold price rallied yesterday in defiance, dealers told the Reuters news
agency, of technical and fundamental factors. 'After support held on
Thursday I think a few people who were short and lacking the courage of
their convictions started buying back,' one explained as the price firmed to
Dollars 385.20 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.80 on the week.
That performance helped silver to erase earlier losses and platinum to
extend its rise. But all were outshone by palladium, which reached a
five-year high as increased Japanese physical demand coincided with a
perceived tightening of Russian supply.

Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported record second-quarter results, driven by strong sales of
semiconductor products.
Earnings were above Wall Street expectations, but TI's prediction that world
semiconductor market growth will now 'moderate somewhat' hit the shares
which closed down Dollars 6 1/8 at Dollars 80 1/4 .
Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.5bn, up 19 per cent from last
year's Dollars 2.1bn. Profits from operations were Dollars 292m, up from
Dollars 173m, while net income was Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.93 a share,
against Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.18.
Semiconductor revenues rose by 29 per cent, with strong growth in memory
chip revenues.
'The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the fastest growing semiconductor
market in the world,' TI said.
Half-year revenues were Dollars 4.96bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars 3.99bn a
year earlier. Net income was Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.35 a share, against
Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04.
The latest results include a Dollars 132m pre-tax charge for European
restructuring and a Dollars 69m gain from royalty revenues.

Computer problems created havoc for US traders and investors using the
screen-based Nasdaq stock trading system yesterday, as the opening of the
country's second largest stock market was delayed for two and a half hours
while systems experts tried to find the fault, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York
Although the Nasdaq market, which is run by the National Association of
Securities Dealers and handles up to 263m shares a day worth billions of
dollars, finally opened just before noon, many parts of the system remained
closed all day, costing millions of dollars in lost business.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hoechst says it may close plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals company, said yesterday it might close plants
in the drive to return its west European fibres sector to profit by the end
of 1995.
There were no immediate plans for closures, but the company's west European
fibres operations lost between DM200m-DM300m (Dollars 123m-Dollars 184m)
last year, said Mr Hans Udo Wenzel, appointed a week ago as managing
director of Hoechst Trevira, the fibres arm.
Hoechst Trevira, a new company which will employ 5,000, is the result of a
decision by the parent company to concentrate its European fibre business
into a wholly-owned but separate company. It will start operations on
October 1.
It was created as a response to 'structural problems in western European
fibres, textile and clothing industries. Traditional suppliers are facing
increasing pressure on prices and cheap imports from Asia and eastern
Europe,' said the company.
Earlier this year Hoechst said it would cut 2,000 jobs in the fibres sector
and introduce performance-related pay.
Mr Wenzel said he could not rule out further job cuts to put the fibre
business back on track by the end of 1995.
Environmental operating costs in Germany in 1993 at Bayer were Dollars
816.2m, not Dollars 81.62m as published in a table in the Chemicals in the
Environment survey (June 30). The figure in the total spending column should
have read Dollars 1,102.17m and in the percentage of sales column, 4.45 per
cent.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Telefonica poised to sell Tisa
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonica, Spain's national telecommunications operator, is negotiating the
sale of a minority stake in Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), the profitable
holding company that groups its substantial Latin American assets. The deal
is likely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
A stake in Tisa, which raised first-quarter profits by 89 per cent to
Pta3.8bn (Dollars 30.8m) and has a market capitalisation of between Dollars
6bn-Dollars 7bn, is an attractive proposition to leading US operators
because of its Latin American holdings.
Tisa groups stakes in 20 South and Central American companies, including
local and long-distance operators and data transmission and mobile telephone
companies. It is the largest single telecoms group in the fast-growing Latin
American market.
Telefonica, however, denied reports that GTE of the US had acquired a stake
of up to 30 per cent in Tisa. 'We are talking to GTE and to others about
alliances (in Latin America). . . but no agreement has been formalised,' the
company said.
In addition to GTE, Telefonica is understood to be discussing the sale of
Tisa equity with three other groups: AT&amp;T, the largest US operator;
South-western Bell, a regional US operator; and Unisource, a joint venture
between the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators, in which Telefonica
itself is to buy a 25 per cent stake.
The negotiations come at a critical stage in the formation of international
telecoms alliances. US and European operators are manoeuvring to become
'one-stop' providers to multinationals through such groupings, in order to
exploit the rapid opening of telecoms services to competition in Europe,
Latin America and Asia.
Until last month, Telefonica had remained unaligned in the international
struggle, while strongly resisting the early introduction of competition
within Spain.
It appeared to have been successful last year, with the European Union's
decision to grant Spain a five-year extension to the 1998 deadline for
competition in basic telephone services which was imposed on most of the
rest of the EU.
However, last year's Dollars 5.3bn alliance between British
Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US operator, and the launch
of AT&amp;T's Worldsource international venture, left Telefonica feeling
exposed. Earlier this month it joined Unisource, which at the same time
forged a partnership with AT&amp;T.
The Spanish government also agreed to waive its five-year extension on the
1998 competition deadline, a decision endorsed by Telefonica.
Mr Bill Coleman, analyst at James Capel, the UK securities house, believes
Telefonica, which owns 76.2 per cent of Tisa, is considering the sale of up
to 10 per cent of Tisa via an issue of new equity which could raise between
Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m.
A second route into Tisa for potential strategic partners could also be
opened through the possible disposal by the Patrimonio del Estado, the
government's portfolio group, of the 23.8 per cent stake it holds in the
company.
A decision is expected shortly. The Patrimonio could either float its Tisa
equity or sell it directly to one or more of the operators that are talking
to Telefonica.
Either way, the Patrimonio, which is also Telefonica's largest single
shareholder with a 32.2 per cent stake, stands to raise some Dollars 1.5bn.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly net steady at Dollars
346m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drug company that earlier this week announced the Dollars
4bn acquisition of PCS, a drug distributor, yesterday reported almost
unchanged net profits of Dollars 346.6m for its second quarter.
It blamed the lack of growth on several factors including higher
manufacturing costs, increased spending on research and development, and a
special charge of Dollars 10m relating to the previous quarter's recall of
three liquid oral antibiotics.
The volume of products sold surged by 11 per cent, both in the US market and
internationally, mainly because of increased sales of products such as
Prozac, Axid and Humulin. Turnover, however, grew by 8 per cent to Dollars
1.68bn because volume growth was partly offset by lower prices in the
pharmaceutical division.
Worldwide, Eli Lilly said, competitive pressures were particularly evident
in anti-infectives sales. In the US, lower prices resulted from increased
Medicaid rebates and greater participation in managed-care programmes.
The Dollars 10m special charge was in addition to the Dollars 56m charge
already provided for the product recall in the first quarter.
Net income was barely changed from the comparable quarter's Dollars 346.8m.
Earnings per share were up slightly, to Dollars 1.20 from Dollars 1.18. For
the half-year, net income was down 5 per cent to Dollars 677.3m.

Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported record second-quarter results, driven by strong sales of
semiconductor products.
Earnings were above Wall Street expectations, but attention focused on TI's
prediction that growth in the world semiconductor market will 'moderate
somewhat' in the second half of the year.
Its shares fell sharply to Dollars 83 3/4 at mid-session, down from
Thursday's close of Dollars 86 3/8 .
Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.5bn, up 19 per cent from Dollars
2.1bn in the same period last year. Profits from operations were Dollars
292m, up from Dollars 173m, while net income was Dollars 184m, or Dollars
1.93 a share, compared with Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.18, last time.
TI said its second-quarter revenues and earnings were boosted by its
semiconductor operations, the company's largest business.
Semiconductor revenues increased by 29 per cent over the same period last
year, TI said, with strong growth in memory chip revenues.
TI also noted double-digit growth in sales of application-specific and
mixed-signal semiconductor products.
'Forces driving the longer-term growth of the world (semiconductor) market
remain intact,' TI said. 'The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the
fastest growing semiconductor market in the world.' TI is expanding its
resources in Asia to meet a rapidly expanding customer base, the company
said.
For the half-year, revenues were Dollars 4.96bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars
3.99bn in the first half of 1993. Net income was Dollars 318m, or Dollars
3.35 a share, compared with Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04.
The first-half results include a first-quarter Dollars 132m pre-tax charge
for costs of restructuring TI's European operations and the sale of some
computer product lines. The charges were partly offset by a one-time gain of
Dollars 69m from royalty revenues.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: NEC aims for Y200bn profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is aiming to increase pre-tax profits
to more than Y200bn (Dollars 1.9bn) by 1999, or eight times last year's
level. It also intends to raise overseas sales to 40 per cent of total
revenues over the same period.
The profits target would top NEC's previous record of Y174bn, achieved in
1990. In the fiscal year ended March, the group made consolidated pre-tax
profits of Y25.1bn and is forecasting profits of Y60bn in the year to next
March.
The proportion of overseas sales targeted would also be a record for NEC,
which currently derives about 24 per cent of sales overseas.
In a speech commemorating the company's 95th anniversary, Mr Hisashi Kaneko,
NEC's new president, outlined the strategy for achieving those goals.
While restructuring and cost-cutting will contribute to the increased
profits, Mr Kaneko expects new businesses, particularly in multimedia, to be
a significant contributor to profitability.
The company is a leader in advanced multimedia technologies, such as screen
technologies, and its business centred on monitors for workstations is
already worth more than Dollars 1bn, the company said.
To achieve its goal of becoming a front-runner in multimedia, NEC plans to
create an 'internal information highway'. It will also place more emphasis
on services and software, such as systems solutions, application software
and global information services, along the lines of Internet.
Mr Kaneko said the marketing framework needed to be revamped to create a
structure more responsive to consumers' needs.
As markets become increasingly global, NEC expects overseas sales to make up
a larger proportion of overall sales. By next March, for example, more than
half of NEC's output of 11m 4-megabit D-Ram chips chips will be manufactured
outside of Japan.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: US West set to enter cable TV
with Atlanta purchases

US West, one of the six US regional telephone companies, yesterday appeared
poised to become the first Baby Bell to enter the US cable television
business, after agreeing to buy two Atlanta-based cable systems for Dollars
1.2bn in cash and shares.
It has agreed to buy Wometco and Georgia Cable Television from the
privately-held Robert M. Bass group, and plans to use them to provide
466,000 households in metropolitan Atlanta with interactive information and
entertainment services.
US West said the price it was paying - Dollars 490m in US West stock,
Dollars 160m in assumption of debt, and the balance in cash - was equivalent
to 11.1 times the systems' annualised fourth-quarter cashflow.
The acquisition comes amid a whirlwind of activity by US media groups, as
they scramble for positions in the fast-developing US communications
industry.
Earlier this week, Comcast, one of the biggest US cable television
companies, overthrew a planned merger between QVC, the home-shopping
channel, and CBS, the broadcast television network, by launching its own
Dollars 2.2bn bid for QVC.
Yesterday's agreement marks the third attempt by a Baby Bell to move into
the cable television business.
Bell Atlantic tried to take over Tele-Communications Inc, and Southwestern
Bell had planned a joint venture with Cox Enterprises, but both deals
collapsed earlier this year.
Two weeks ago Bell Atlantic won regulatory approval for an alternative
strategy: competing head-on with cable television companies by providing
interactive television services over its telephone wires.
US West has already entered the cable television industry in the UK, where
it has a joint venture with Tele-Communications Inc which provides cable and
telephone services in 16 owned and eight affiliated franchise areas.
In the US, US West has a 25.51 per cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment,
the cable-television division of the Time Warner media group.
The two are working in partnership to speed development of so-called full
service networks in the areas they serve.

'difficult' market

<TEXT>
Sanyo Electric, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, reported higher sales
and profits for the half-year to the end of May, but warned that the
domestic environment remained difficult.
The parent company reported pre-tax profits higher by 213 per cent at Y6.8bn
(Dollars 66m) on turnover up by 0.6 per cent at Y503.9bn. However, Sanyo
said weak demand for domestic capital investment, sluggish personal
consumption growth, and the sharp appreciation of the yen had combined to
make trading conditions difficult.
The company has reported an operating loss for the past two years, and in
the first six months of the year, the operating figure was again in the red
at Y5.8bn, against last year's Y12.6bn. Profits on stock sales of Y9.3bn
accounted for the profits at the pre-tax level.
Domestic turnover was higher by 2.6 per cent at Y342.8bn due largely to
strong sales of semiconductors, colour televisions and commercial
refrigerator display cases.
Exports fell by 3.4 per cent to Y161.1bn as the company shifted production
overseas. The growing strength of the US and south-east Asian economies
helped bolster exports, but European markets remained stagnant.
Group pre-tax profits rose by 195 per cent to Y7.8bn on turnover up 4.8 per
cent at Y767.5bn.
After tax, the group reported a profit of Y1.4bn, compared with a loss of
Y2.7bn in the same period last year.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI says no demerger yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Thorn EMI fell by 9p to 1065p yesterday as Sir Colin Southgate,
the chairman, dismissed reports that the music and rentals group was about
to be demerged.
Sir Colin told the group's annual meeting that the current group structure
was a positive advantage and added significant value.
Speculation that a demerger announcement was close had helped lift Thorn's
shares from 1039p on Monday morning to 1074p on Thursday.
Sir Colin suggested that the board would not return to the demerger question
for another year.
He said: 'As a board, we review the group strategy once a year. I am able to
tell you that at our recent strategy review - held over the past two days -
the board did analyse, in great detail, the strategic options for the
business. The immediate challenge is to capitalise on the excellent
prospects which now exist for our businesses.'
The speculation that Thorn would be split into two companies - one centred
on music and one on rentals - arose because the group appeared close to
completing its disposals programme.
Sir Colin has said in the past that the time to discuss demerger would be
when Thorn had sold the businesses it no longer wanted. He said yesterday
that the group raised Pounds 192.3m last year from divestments of
non-strategic businesses, including Thorn Lighting and its majority interest
in Thames Television.
Discussions on the sale of the remaining businesses in Thorn Electronics
were continuing.
Sir Colin said that once buyers had been found for these, the group's
divestment programme would be complete.
The chairman also said that Thorn had signed a letter of intent to increase
its holding in Toshiba-EMI, its joint music venture in Japan.
Under the agreement, Thorn's stake in the venture would rise from 50 to 55
per cent.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ASH ahead 19% but interim omitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems
company, yesterday revealed a 19 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits, but announced that it would not pay an interim dividend.
This follows a furore over the 1993 interim dividend, which was paid in
scrip form, but was not adjusted when the shares dropped after a profits
warning.
The company said 64 per cent of its shareholders held American Depositary
Receipts, and preferred cash to be reinvested in the company, but a new
dividend policy would be developed during the year.
ASH's pre-tax profits for the six months to May 31 amounted to Pounds 5.79m
(Pounds 4.86m).
ASH Europe, primarily the group's UK operations, remained the main engine
for growth, with revenue increasing 12 per cent to Pounds 59.4m, and
operating profits up 5 per cent at Pounds 10.1m.
The US business has suffered from a recession-hit Californian market, with
turnover rising only 0.1 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Operating profits fell by
8 per cent to Pounds 3.63m, reflecting an increased depreciation charge at
its API subsidiary.
However, US sales are recovering, and showed a 21 per cent increase in the
second quarter.
Overall, group turnover amounted to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 78.2m), while
operating profits fell marginally to Pounds 11.79m.
ASH is launching a second generation TVX system next year, which will
substantially reduce costs for its successful alarm verification units.
The latest figures were adjusted for the restructuring of the company's
Dollars 54m (Pounds 35.5m) of stapled units, which have been replaced with a
Dollars 55m placement of debt.
Previously, interest charges on this debt had been accounted for as minority
interests, but Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.2m) was charged as interest in the latest
interim profits.
Earnings per share amounted to 3p (2.1p).

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon may sell two businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huntingdon International, the life sciences group, is investigating the sale
of its UK-based consultancy, Travers Morgan, and its engineering and
environmental services business in the US.
In May the group announced that it proposed to focus on its life science
business having concluded that the other divisions did not have the earnings
prospects originally envisaged.
They were built up by acquisition in the late 1980s by Mr Bennie Wooley, the
chief executive, who resigned two months ago.
The group called in Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, to help it identify
strategies for the businesses and is now considering the options proposed.
Yesterday the company said that it was 'investigating with Kleinwort Benson
the possible sale of one or both businesses. In the meantime, the management
of those businesses together with Huntingdon will take all necessary actions
to optimise performance and ensure clients continue to be serviced at the
highest standards.'
Travers Morgan is an international consulting firm specialising in
engineering, management, transport and environment. Its profits fell from
Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 343,000 in the six months to March.
The US businesses recorded an operating loss of Pounds 388,000 in the first
half.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Price Waterhouse chief goes to Charterhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Howard Hyman, head of corporate finance at Price Waterhouse, the UK's
fifth largest accountancy firm, is to become managing director of
Charterhouse, the merchant bank.
The move will come as a blow to Price Waterhouse, which was planning to
announce Mr Hyman's appointment as world head of corporate finance later
this month.
Royal Bank of Scotland sold 90 per cent of its ownership of Charterhouse at
a loss earlier this year, with the stakes going to Credit Commercial de
France and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank.
Mr Hyman, who is 44, will also become deputy chairman of Charterhouse Bank,
the company's banking subsid-iary.
He will be responsible for marketing and business development strategy, and
the development of its European corporate finance network.
He has spent the last few years building up Price Waterhouse's pan-European
corporate finance network.
He said negotiations for the move had started relatively recently and that
he had been offered 'a very attractive' remuneration package.
'My main aim is to build up the European side,' he said.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pelican achieves near threefold rise to
Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelican Group, the highly acquisitive USM-quoted restaurant operator,
yesterday revealed a close to threefold increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 908,000 to Pounds 2.51m for the year to March 31.
Organic growth came primarily from the rapid expansion of the Cafe Rouge
chain, which now has 20 outlets within Greater London. Four more sites are
currently under development and others are under negotiation.
Pelican also benefited from the acquisitions of three other chains last
year, Yankee Noodle, Jim Thompsons Spice Island Trading, and US restaurant
operator Cafe Tu Tu Tango. Overall, Pelican now operates 47 restaurants,
compared with just 15 in May 1993.
Turnover more than doubled in the year to Pounds 16.47m (Pounds 8.08m), and
it will show substantial growth in the current year following the Pounds
11.5m acquisition last April of 16 restaurants from Forte, including the
Dome cafes.
In addition, it has just signed an agreement enabling Granada to set up
diners at its 23 motorway service stations under Pelican's Rock Island Diner
brand name. Pelican will receive a share of turnover, and the first
restaurant, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, should open at the end of July.
Operating margins improved slightly to 16 per cent, but Mr Roger Myers,
chairman, said Pelican aimed to maintain margins, and use the improved cost
efficiency of the enlarged group to boost the restaurants' competitiveness.
During the current year Mr Myers said Pelican would focus on completing the
expansion of the Cafe Rouge and Dome chains in Greater London. Next year it
plans to take its first steps in expanding beyond the M25, moving into
southern England.
Pelican is proposing to lift the single final dividend by 14 per cent to
1.25p (1.1p).
Earnings per share rose by 22.5 per cent to 4.9p (4p).
The shares closed 2p higher at 91p.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Kazakhs celebrate gold rush in style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AUEZOV, KAZAKHSTAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the demanding standards of the international mining industry, this
has been a great party. Not one, but two public holidays were brought
forward so that everyone in Auezov, a frontier town of 6,000 people, could
celebrate in style the first gold 'pour' from the new treatment plant at the
Bakyrchik mine.
Out on Kazakhstan's north eastern steppes, 1,000 kms from the capital
Almaty, in yurts - the felt tents used by central Asian nomads - about 200
Kazakh VIP's including several ministers, dined on local delicacies such as
boiled sheep heads and fermented mares' milk.
And looking slightly incongruous in this setting were about 50 visitors from
the City of London, watching the Kazakh horse racing, wrestling and other
more exotic entertainments lasting through the night.
The London-based investors and analysts are here to reassure themselves
about the Bakyrchik gold mine. In the past year Pounds 11.5m has been
provided towards the first joint venture in the gold business between a
western company and this newly independent former part of the Soviet Union.
The money was raised by Bakyrchik Gold, a company listed in London which has
40 per cent of the joint venture. Some of the proceeds have been used to
raise annual gold output from the mine to 45,000 ounces but also for a
feasibility study to see if modern mining and processing methods could boost
Bakyrchik's production to 275,000 ounces.
Although it promises much - it is on one of the world's biggest gold
deposits with resources of 8.5m ounces - conditions underground at the mine
are extremely difficult. The ore is hard to process and contains arsenic.
The feasibility study shows the problems can be overcome. Before the year
end Bakyrchik Gold is to go ahead with plans to lift production at a cost of
Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.2m). Mr David Hooker, the chairman, says most of the
money will be raised from shareholders because debt offered by banks would
be expensive and the terms onerous.
Mr Nursultan Nazerbayev, president of Kazakhstan, was expected to host a
conference for the London investors last night to stress his personal
interest in the project.
He wants it to succeed as Kazakhstan needs to increase gold production to
provide backing for its fledgling currency, the tenge. He also wants more
foreign investment in Kazakhstan, a country as vast as western Europe,
stretching between Russia and China and richly endowed with natural
resources.

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone Pounds 71m in the red and calls
for Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone, the struggling hosiery and handbags group, yesterday launched a
Pounds 30.3m rescue rights issue, after revealing a pre-tax loss of Pounds
70.7m for the year ended March 31.
The rights issue was long expected, as Hartstone had committed to repay
Pounds 15m to its principal creditors by October, but the stock market
reacted badly to the level of discount for the new shares. Hartstone's
shares closed 10p lower at 22p.
The company's problems stemmed from its aggressive expansion into Europe
just before the recession set in. It purchased 20 companies in a four year
period, but failed to establish adequate financing and management controls.
Hartstone has been forced into a programme of asset disposals, under Mr
Shaun Dowling, chairman, who was appointed in May 1993 to keep the company
afloat.
The rights issue is designed to shore up the group's tattered balance sheet,
reducing its gearing levels to within the permitted maximum level under its
articles of association, and pay down its principal debt.
Mr Dowling said: 'The rights issue will put the group on a stronger
financial footing for the future and will allow the team to devote its
attention to the development of the group's core businesses'. This is
primarily its leatherware business.
Hartstone is offering 215.6m new shares at 15p on a 2-for-1 basis. The issue
is fully underwritten by Schroders.
Of the Pounds 30.3m proceeds, Pounds 15m will be repaid to creditors, and
Pounds 13.1m will provide working capital. Charterhouse Bank has an option
to utilise Pounds 2.2m of a term loan to subscribe for rights shares.
At the year end, the company had net borrowings of Pounds 62.6m with 23
banks. This was substantially below the 1993 level, but due to the
write-down of assets gearing increased to 310 per cent. After the rights
issue, gearing will fall to 63 per cent, with net debt of Pounds 31.8m.
Hartstone remained profitable at the operating level last year, and its
problems stemmed from its disposal programme and the extent of its
restructuring.
Turnover from continuing businesses rose by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 239.4m,
although total turnover fell to Pounds 363.9m (Pounds 370.3m).
The group's core businesses of Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens in its
leatherware division and Spanish hosiery subsidiary Aznar all remained
highly profitable, and total operating profit before extraordinary items and
interest amounted to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 16.7m). Last time there was a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.86m.
Hartstone paid Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.9m) of interest. Exceptional losses
came to Pounds 71.5m (Pounds 18.7m), of which Pounds 50.9m represented the
write-off of goodwill after disposals.
The company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 0.32p for the year to
March 1995, but it will not pay a dividend for 1993-94. Losses per share
amounted to 68.2p (12.4p).

FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Enough to give a one-legged stork an ulcer
 -Paul Abrahams on the problems for Glaxo as it faces an end to 15 years of
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo is at the crossroads. During the 1980s the company was headed in one
direction - forwards.
Its pre-tax profits galloped from Pounds 66m in 1980 to Pounds 1.67bn in
1993, as a pharmaceutical also-ran was transformed into Europe's biggest
drugs group.
Growth was based on the philosophy of discovering novel medicines, proving
they were safe and effective, and then convincing as many doctors as
possible to prescribe them.
It was a philosophy no different from that adopted by other drugs groups -
Glaxo was just very good at implementing it.
The problem for Glaxo now is that its formula may no longer guarantee
success.
The relevance of the group's strategy has been thrown into doubt by the
rapid deceleration in the world drugs market, where, according to IMS
International, growth has slowed from 11 per cent in 1990 to 7 per cent last
year.
Glaxo must now show it can adapt to this new lower-growth business.
But, so far, Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, appears to have been left
stuck on the starting block.
Since July last year, four of Sir Richard's rivals, Merck and Eli Lilly of
the US, SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, and Roche of
Switzerland, have spent more than Dollars 18bn (Pounds 11.8bn) on
acquisitions in an effort to position themselves in the new environment.
All the deals were designed to strengthen the groups' respective strategic
positions. But the methods used to achieve this aim were very different.
Roche's Dollars 5.3bn purchase of Syntex was a classic horizontal
acquisition, giving the Swiss company greater weight in the US and expanding
its product range in its traditional areas.
Merck's acquisition of the US distribution group Medco last July was, by
contrast, truly revolutionary. It introduced the concept of vertical
integration to the pharmaceuticals industry.
Medco is one of a number of the increasingly important pharmaceutical
benefit management companies. PBMs control drugs spending through a variety
of means, but, most importantly, through negotiating discounts and creating
formularies which limit the medicines doctors can prescribe.
Dr Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, claimed the deal would remodel not only
Merck, but also the entire industry.
In part, this was because it would allow Merck to supply more of its
products to Medco's patients. More importantly, it would permit Merck to
collect data about the cost-effectiveness of its treatments - a vital factor
in an increasingly cost-conscious health environment.
Dr Vagelos' counterparts at SmithKline Beecham and Eli Lilly were
sufficiently impressed by this strategy to acquire the remaining two
significant PBMs, so effectively preventing Glaxo from following a similar
route.
At Glaxo, Sir Richard's apparent paralysis is all the more perplexing
because the company's immediate problems seem so acute.
Salomon Brothers are predicting that the group's profits will fall in 1996
and 1997, ending 15 years of unbroken growth.
The main reason for this possible profits fall is the gloomy prospects for
Zantac, the world's top-selling drug, with sales last financial year of
Pounds 2.17bn.
Zantac's very success has made the whole group vulnerable. Glaxo is
dependent on Zantac for 44 per cent of group sales and probably more than 50
per cent of profits.
Glaxo has effectively become a one-legged stork, in the same way that Roche
became dependent on Valium during the 1970s.
In the old environment, Glaxo's dependency on Zantac would not have
mattered. Zantac and its revenues would probably have been secure until its
US patents expired in 2002. Now, threats to the drug in the US are legion,
and the net effect is that some analysts believe its sales could peak this
year.
Faced with this threat, Sir Richard and his team now appear ready to
consider possible strategic changes.
This conclusion has taken time. Mr Ernest Mario, Sir Richard's predecessor,
is understood to have wanted to acquire another pharmaceuticals company, an
ambition that in part led to boardroom disagreement and Mr Mario's departure
in March last year. The man perceived to be most opposed to a strategy
change, Sir Paul Giorlami, the chairman, is leaving the company in
September.
However, while the need to change has been recognised, the range of options
available is wide. They include:
Acquiring a PBM. This strategy has effectively been scuppered by the
purchase of the three most important PBMs by Merck, SmithKline Beecham, and
Eli Lilly. In any case, most analysts argue that such a move would not be a
sensible one for Glaxo. The company's chances of significantly increasing
its share in the therapeutic areas where it is already market leader remain
poor, and would certainly not be worth the required investment.
Buying another drugs company. Sir Richard could use his cash mountain of
more than Pounds 2.2bn to help fund the purchase of a smaller company,
active in areas where Glaxo does not have a presence. Glaxo could absorb the
other company's sales and reduce the combined group's dependence on Zantac
while cutting R&amp;D and marketing overheads.
Setting up strategic alliances with health management organisations in
specific disease areas. These organisations pay for all healthcare costs for
members for a set fee. They could provide Glaxo with data on the
effectiveness of various treatments.
Cost cutting. Some analysts are concerned that Glaxo's private medium-term
market growth forecasts remain too high. Glaxo, with its outstanding product
pipeline, expects to outperform the market.
The company could rationalise its US sales force. But if management has
overestimated its future sales growth, the group could be forced to make
hefty restructuring provisions.
Whatever direction Sir Richard and his team pick, there remain questions
over the management's ability to implement change.
Glaxo's managers have been successfully focused on research, development and
marketing. It remains unclear whether the company, accustomed only to
growth, can cut deals and costs.
One option Sir Richard cannot afford is to stay stationary. The environment,
particularly in the US, is changing too fast for continued inactivity.
The sign-posts are easy to read; choosing which one to follow is more
difficult.

Net assets per share of General Consolidated Investment Trust fell by 26 per
cent to 214.3p over the six months to June 30, against 290p at the end of
1993.
Net revenue increased from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 1.61m largely reflecting a
substantial increase in management fees earned by the trust's 53 per cent
investment management offshoot. This was unlikely to be repeated in the
second half.
Earnings per income share were 4.45p (4.01p). An unchanged interim dividend

FT  16 JUL 94 / No sign of comfort in the south: US policy options over
Haiti are increasingly pointing down the path of invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Clinton administration, about the only good news to come out of
Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, this week was reports of bad weather. Rough
seas buffeted the coast of the troubled Caribbean nation, slowing the tide
of boat people and granting the White House the time it desperately needs to
shore up its Haiti policy.
The island has nettled President Bill Clinton since he took office in
January 1993, forcing on him numerous about-turns. As more than 1,000
Haitians a day take to boats to escape deepening economic hardship and
political repression, solutions to the crisis are fast running out.
Even as Mr Clinton toured Europe this week, the outlaw nation 700 miles from
the US coast was demanding his attention. US backing for the United Nations'
trade embargo has so far failed to oust the military regime of Lt Gen Raoul
Cedras, which overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in
September 1991, and to return Mr Aristide as leader.
Lt Gen Cedras remains defiant. This week, he ordered 104 UN observers out of
the country as they were reporting increasing human rights abuses -
including political murders and rape.
If sanctions do not force Lt Gen Cedras to step down soon, pressure may
mount for the US to do more than commit itself to leading a multilateral
force to police Haiti if Mr Aristide is returned to power. Two
considerations are propelling the US towards invading the country of 5.5m:
first, the swelling numbers of refugees, and second, the deteriorating human
rights conditions in Haiti.
'There are not any other politically attractive options short of military
intervention,' said Mr Eric Melby, a former National Security Council staff
member under President George Bush. Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's chief
national security adviser, has said invasion appears inevitable.
The US administration has stepped up its rhetoric in recent days, issuing
thinly veiled threats of military action. Pentagon officials acknowledge the
military has already drawn up and rehearsed detailed contingency plans for
military action.
With a four-ship amphibious assault group offshore, ostensibly ready to
evacuate US citizens or other foreigners, the US could be ready to invade
this weekend, when a command and control ship arrives to lead the assault
group. But officials have said privately an invasion is more likely in early
August, when the US Congress - hesitant, like the American people about the
human and financial costs of military intervention - is in recess and thus
unlikely to cause political embarrassment for Mr Clinton.
The invasion would probably begin in darkness, as special forces move to
secure the airport, presidential palace, radio station and port facilities
in Port-au-Prince, according to Mr Daniel Goure, deputy director for
political-military studies at the Centre for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
Following these units, the 2,600 Marines now off Haiti's coast would come
ashore either by landing craft or helicopter to secure the capital. Mr Goure
said they would be reinforced by paratroopers - probably the US 82nd
Airborne Division - and units trained in jungle warfare, which would be
responsible for controlling the rest of the country.
Clinton administration officials have said it would take between 10,000 and
20,000 troops to capture the island. They would be likely to face little
organised resistance from Haiti's ill-equipped and poorly trained army of
7,000.
It is the prospect of a prolonged presence in Haiti that most worries the
Pentagon. Mr Goure predicts the US would have to stay at least eight to 16
weeks, while a multinational peace-keeping force from Latin America and the
Caribbean under UN auspices is organised and trained. He said there is
significant a risk that Haitians, who harbour strong anti-colonial
sentiments, would turn against their US 'liberators', as happened in
Somalia.
With no Haitian tradition of democracy, the US would have to provide much of
the physical and political infrastructure for a new government. Even then,
the chances of salvaging the poorest country in the western hemisphere are
not good.
Given these grim assessments, the US state department has been scrambling
for a diplomatic solution. One option would be to build a reconciliation
government including both pro-Aristide and pro-military factions. 'There
still is the option of trying to support a government of reconciliation,' Mr
Ernie Preeg, a former US ambassador to Haiti now with a Washington-based
think-tank, said. 'That is the least bad alternative.'
However, state department officials said the idea is no longer under
discussion and Mr William Gray, Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said
the time to negotiate had passed.
Mr Clinton's problems with Haiti began during the 1992 presidential
campaign. He described the Bush administration's policy of repatriating all
Haitian refugees picked up at sea as 'illegal' and 'immoral'. Soon after he
took office came the first embarrassment: the repatriation policy was
maintained.
Administration officials admit they panicked, following faulty intelligence
reports which led them to believe a policy change would unleash 150,000 to
200,000 boat people on the US.
Mr Rick Swartz, a Washington lawyer who represents several Haitian human
rights groups, said Mr Lawton Chiles, governor of Florida - the state that
would probably absorb most refugees - also lobbied Mr Clinton strongly to
keep out the boat people.
In June last year, the White House decided to back the sanctions to help
speed the faltering talks with the regime. The tactic worked, and the Cedras
government and Mr Aristide met at Governor's Island, New York, one month
later.
But when the US Navy attempted to bring Mr Aristide to the capital,
Port-au-Prince, in October, the military reneged on the agreement. A US
warship discovered an angry anti-Aristide mob at the dock and Mr Clinton
ordered it to return home.
Soon after, Mr Aristide began to criticise US policy toward the refugees.
After a coalition of black congressmen took up Mr Aristide's cause, Mr
Clinton in May announced the appointment of Mr Gray, a prominent former
black congressman, as special adviser on Haiti. He also said the
repatriation policy inherited from the Bush administration would change: all
Haitian boat people would receive asylum hearings aboard US Navy ships off
Jamaica.
'Under Clinton, (Haitian policy) has been driven predominantly by domestic
politics,' Mr Preeg said. 'Very narrow interest groups that are pro-Aristide
have a lot of influence.'
The new policy prompted more Haitians to flee by boat, after reports that 30
per cent of those applying for asylum in ship-board hearings were being
granted safe haven in the US - against 5 per cent at land-based processing
centres in Haiti.
Hoping to discourage the exodus and buy time for sanctions, Mr Gray
announced another change: Haitians taking to the sea would no longer be
given asylum in the US. They would be processed under a relaxed standard for
safe haven in other countries in the region, most notably Panama - which had
agreed to accept 10,000 boat people.
Less than a day later, on July 7, the new US policy was dealt an apparently
fatal blow. Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, facing strong domestic
opposition, withdrew his offer to house the refugees. At that moment, the
risky invasion which Mr Clinton had sought to avoid came one step closer.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K M R PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Hugh Dickinson's article on the royal title of defender of the faith
reveals a slight misunderstanding of the relevant history (Truth of the
Matter, July 9/10). Neither Henry VIII nor the next 10 sovereigns made the
slightest use of it. It was resurrected by the politicians in support of
George I and the protestant succession. Any continuity which fid def, or its
variants, gives to the currency stretches back only to 1714.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK government's plans for senior
civil servants 'unwise' and 'should be scrapped'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir MICHAEL FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right in saying ('Politicians and civil servants', July 14)
that the government's White Paper needs to be judged by 'the degree to which
it preserves a non-political civil service that can serve governments of any
persuasion'.
If there is a change of government at the next general election, incoming
ministers will be advised by senior civil servants, who will by then have
served a government of the same political persuasion for an uninterrupted 17
years. They will be willing and able to give unbiased advice. But anything
which has happened to reduce their traditional independence can only add to
the suspicion which they will inevitably face from a new government. It
would thus be most unwise to weaken the tenure of senior civil servants at
this stage. Even a strengthened appeal procedure would be a much less
effective safeguard of independence than the present appointments system.
Furthermore, the comparison between the role of senior civil servants and
heads of leading businesses - never very exact - becomes less and less
meaningful as more civil service functions are hived-off or privatised. The
role of the senior civil servant will be less the management of large
departments and more the traditional ones of offering disinterested advice
to ministers and watching over the public interest. There is therefore no
need to introduce procedures which are appropriate to the private sector but
which carry grave risks of political interference if applied to senior civil
servants. This part of the government's plans should be scrapped.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Storms in a coffee cup: The effect of severe frost in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee drinkers in Europe and the US may find the prospect of up to 50 per
cent rises in the price of a packet of ground beans a little galling. For
Brazilian coffee farmers who have lost some or all of their plantations, the
frosts that have sent the coffee market into a frenzy this week have been
little short of disastrous.
Both farmers and consumers are losers on the coffee market's wheel of
fortune. On the winning side are commodity speculators who have made
millions of dollars as prices surged, and coffee growers unaffected by the
frost whose future profits may be helped.
The combination of last weekend's severe frost with another a fortnight
earlier is believed to have been unprecedented in Brazil, the world's
largest producer. The damage to the crop that will be harvested this time
next year is expected to be the worst since a bitter frost in 1975 destroyed
more than two-thirds of Brazil's production.
The prospect of a squeeze on supplies sent prices soaring; in London,
robusta beans for delivery in September rose to Dollars 4,000 a tonne, 230
per cent higher than at the end of last year.
Even before the frosts, however, the market had climbed nearly 100 per cent
this year, driven by supply shortages, dwindling consumer stocks and
speculative interest.
The rise has been all the more remarkable because prices have been depressed
for the past four years. Last October the main producing countries began
withholding supplies to try to revive the market.
The agreement gave the market an initial boost, and it then gained fresh
momentum this year. US investment funds provided some of the impetus, though
Mr Robert MacArthur, head of trading in tropical products at Merrill Lynch,
the US investment bank, in London, says many took profits at the end of May,
when New York arabica futures became volatile. He estimates their well-timed
flirtation with the market netted between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn -
even though they missed the frost-driven rally.
Coffee drinkers have not been so fortunate. The latest surge in world prices
signalled the end of a period when self-induced insomnia was cheap, though
retail price changes tend to lag behind world bean prices because
manufacturers buy stocks four or more months in advance.
Continental European drinkers, who usually prefer ground coffee, should see
the biggest price jump: raw beans account for a lower proportion of the cost
of instant coffee, where production and advertising outweigh the price of
the beans in a jar (see graphic).
Nestle this week raised ground coffee prices in the US by 13 per cent, and
instant coffee by 10 per cent. In Germany some roasters marked up ground
coffee prices by 28 per cent and forecast the total increase in coming
months could be 50 per cent.
Douwe Egberts, the leading brand in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, has
raised the price of a 250g pack of ground coffee by 26 per cent since
January and further rises are possible. Mr Herman Bouwman, director of
corporate communications, says this year's increases have had no impact on
sales and points out that retail prices are rising from a low point. A pack
of medium-quality Douwe Egberts coffee in the Netherlands today costs Fl
3.40, compared with Fl 6.50 in 1977, two years after the devastating frost
in Brazil.
In the UK, where the market is dominated by instant coffee, prices are
forecast by the industry to rise by a further 15 per cent to 20 per cent in
the autumn after increases of more than 10 per cent so far this year.
Nestle, which has 58 per cent of the UK instant coffee market, points out
that the average price of a 100g jar of Nescafe had remained at Pounds 1.39
for four years until January. The price had fallen by 13 per cent when world
prices plummeted 60 per cent following the breakdown in 1989 of an export
quota pact between producer and consumer countries.
Not surprisingly, Nestle does not think the latest increases will kill the
UK taste for coffee. 'Ten to 15 years ago, we drank four cups of tea for
every cup of coffee,' said Mr Mick Casey, a Nestle spokesman. 'Now for every
cup of coffee, it's just over two cups of tea.' He adds there was 'no
consumer resistance' to the 12 1/2 per cent rise in the price of Nescafe in
January - though producers are not so sanguine about consumers' response in
emerging markets such as eastern Europe.
Moreover, the upward pressure on prices may not last. World coffee producers
could be tempted by high prices to expand output and improve productivity,
which some producers fear would lead to a repeat of the 'boom and bust'
cycle. New plants take about three years to produce a crop, so farmers
planting now may have only a couple of years before overproduction pushes
prices down again.
'The farmers lose in the short term as most have already sold their crops
for this year. In the long term they lose because of the short-lived nature
of the price rises,' said Mr Richard Hide, coffee buyer for Cafedirect, a
fair trading organisation which guarantees its farmers a minimum price.
Cafedirect is backing calls from producer countries for a revival of an
international agreement to stabilise the market by setting target prices and
operating supply controls.
But consumer countries, led by the US, have shown no eagerness to discuss
such proposals. Trade negotiators argue international pacts bring pressure
for higher prices for producers rather than stable prices for consumers. The
coffee market's roller-coaster looks set to hurtle on.

Since 1991 the bank has been independently managed through a trustee, Law

FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Technology is road to wealth creation
in long term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr NEIL A DOWNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Innovation Technology' (Economic Eye, July 11) Guy de
Jonquieres expresses doubts about the value of new technology. Surely he
would agree, however, that new technology - created by R&amp;D - is the only
long-term source of wealth creation.
After a few decades of development, industry based on a single unchanging
technology approaches a plateau of efficiency, and the cost and performance
of a manufacture plateaus too. Without the necessary (but not, I agree,
sufficient) condition of new technology coming along, long-term prospects
are invariably limited.
It is possible for individual companies to flourish without new technology
if they are looking for short-term gains, or if they are small niche firms.
(No doubt a stone-axe manufacturing plant could still today be made a paying
proposition). These possibilities have a tendency to blind us to the
essential role of new technology in wealth creation.
For the larger firms, those looking for long-term advantage, and for nation
states, new technology is essential. On a national level, for example, high
technology companies are very important. In my own sector, that of
semiconductor equipment manufacture, UK companies typically export 75 per
cent of their sales.
The fact that worldwide governments feel the need to inject taxpayers' money
into it is a reflection of the importance of new technology, and the failure
of private industry to invest in it sufficiently.
I fear for the future of UK industry if we carry on as we are: we have many
companies bent on short-term returns and ignoring investment in new
technology, and at the same time, we have government policy decisions which
are withdrawing taxpayers money too.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Town hall trench tactics: The (lack of) upheaval in English
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English local government is about to go back to the future - or, more
accurately, forward to the past.
The result of Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission, the agency in
charge of planning the reorganisation of English councils, looks
increasingly likely to be the restoration of the system as it was before
1974, when local maps were last redrawn.
That outcome might not seem obvious from the controversial recommendations
the commission has made so far. But with proposals for 33 of the 36 English
shire counties published, the survival of county councils, albeit in some
cases without their largest towns, is now probable across much of the
country. Some 30 large towns and cities seem set to take over all local
government functions for their citizens, in effect restoring the old county
boroughs swept away in 1974.
Ministers are startled by this prospect. They intended the commission to be
the engine of radical change. Both Mr Michael Heseltine, who set up the
commission when environment secretary in 1991, and his successor, Mr John
Gummer, favoured a nationwide system of unitary councils which combined the
functions of counties and districts.
But the mechanism chosen for drawing up reform plans now looks almost
designed to ensure ministers' grandiose ambitions would not be realised.
Learning from the unpopular 1974 reorganisation, handled by a royal
commission, Mr Heseltine decided the approach this time should be
consultative, treating each county individually.
Superficially, the commission has drawn up a plan in line with Mr
Heseltine's original intentions, recommending that 22 county councils that
should be replaced by unitaries. But it is clear such radical change will
not happen: the commission has failed to find much support for unitary
councils and has said the status quo should be an option in 13 of the
counties recommended for abolition.
Where change is likely is in towns which would regain county borough status
under the commission's proposals and the fastest-growing newer towns, such
as Milton Keynes and Swindon, which will be added to that list, mostly with
support from residents.
There is also a consensus in other areas in favour of unpicking the 1974
changes. All counties created by the 1974 reorganisation, such as Avon and
Humberside, have been recommended for abolition, while Herefordshire,
Huntingdonshire and Rutland, which disappeared in 1974 would be reinstated.
But the commission hit problems when trying to construct unitary authorities
outside cities. It believes a minimum population of 150,000 is needed to
make a unitary authority financially viable. In rural areas, that requires a
large geographical area. For example, the proposed unitary version of the
North Riding of Yorkshire would merge four district councils and stretch
almost from the North Sea to the Irish Sea - dubbed 'Shambleshire' by the
Association of District Councils.
Mrs Ann Levick, the commissioner with responsibility for Northumberland,
said 48 per cent of local people had supported unitary authorities in
principle, but 'when you give them something specific the principle fades
slightly'.
This week saw the formation of the Save Oxfordshire's Southern Borders
Campaign, which objects to a proposal that a unitary Reading authority
should include part of Oxfordshire. The Campaign for Cornwall - one of the
three counties for which proposals have not been announced - is already
trying to persuade the commission that splitting the county would 'undermine
the strength of Cornwall's voice' and leave the county 'vulnerable to
territorial expansion by Plymouth'.
Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies says the
commission's attempt to find unitary solutions is leading it 'to argue the
case for a size of authority which will often neither reflect local
community identity nor be able to carry out strategic functions'.
Another obstacle to creating unitaries is the cost. Initially ministers
assumed reorganisation would save money. But the commission's own estimates
suggest that some of its 'first-choice' proposals for restructuring counties
into unitaries could be prohibitively expensive. For example, its proposal
to cut Surrey into five unitaries could cost as much as Pounds 44m, with
annual savings of only Pounds 1m.
The review has also run into an unexpectedly strong political opposition,
which bears similarities to the unholy alliance of unions and
traditionalists which thwarted proposals for Sunday trading. Local
government unions are opposed to the review because they believe it would
fragment local services and endanger jobs. The Labour party supports unitary
councils in principle, but says it will vote against reorganisation
proposals unless guarantees are made for council employees' job security.
Conservative grandees also oppose reform. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary
and an Oxfordshire MP, supports the status quo in the county. All four
Somerset Conservative MPs, including Mr Tom King, former defence secretary,
oppose abolishing the county. The commission also now seems to have doubts
about reorganisation. Sir John himself says: 'Any reorganisation costs more
and delivers less than its proponents suggest.'
If the status quo emerges as a popular option after the extensive
consultative exercise on which it is now embarking (leaflets are being sent
to every household), the commission could drop its main recommendations for
changes without embarrassment. Sir John clearly believes this could happen.
'In all the surveys we've done, the level of popular support for unitary
districts in shire England is very low indeed,' he said last month. 'People
in shire England do not want to see a Balkanisation of local government.'
Perhaps significantly, ministers have recently gone quiet about their desire
for unitary councils. The review was a hopeless vehicle to deliver it in any
case. As one commissioner put it: 'A leisurely review like this might have
been used for some tinkering at the edges, but it would be impossible to
push through anything more radical.' Opponents will have plenty of
opportunities to try to block changes when they are debated individually in
Parliament.
As a result, the new local government map will almost certainly be very
different from the one ministers had in mind. But as it is due to be
implemented at about the time of the next general election they may be
grateful that the commission has offered an escape route from the original
plan for root-and-branch reform.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No complaints, whatever the 'human
need'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST G GOBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I congratulate John Willman on his 'dispensation of a biblical text' to
the bishop of Birmingham ('Judge not, that ye be not judged', July 9).
The bishop obviously aspires to the sort of health service that existed in
former socialist countries like East Germany. Allow me to relate a story I
heard in Berlin the other day.
Unwell lady in what was East Berlin to a friend in West Berlin: 'I got my
appointment with the specialist for last Wednesday at 9 am. I sat there all
day. At 6 pm they told me to make another appointment.'
Lady from West Berlin: 'Did you not complain?' Answer: 'It would not be
allowed.' A pause: 'Would it?'
That is how an all-powerful state treats its citizens. Even after four years
of being allowed to complain they are still afraid to complain. And so much
for the bishop's 'basis of a human need'.
I do recommend a trip to east Germany to anybody who wants to do away with
the 'morally wrong and unchristian culture of competition'. It is an
eye-opener.
Thank you, John Willman.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Time for a new US tune
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful jazz musicians must combine the ability to improvise with
rigorous technique. Though neither President Clinton nor Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan made a career of their saxophone playing, the US
dollar's recent travails demand much the same skills. They are right not to
keep slavishly to the market beat, but the underlying theme should not be
forgotten.
The week ended better than it began: with the dollar rallying above its
record lows against the yen, and long-term bond yields below their levels
when Mr Clinton took office. Over the past 18 months, investors have been
listening to the US Administration's haphazard comments about the dollar. Mr
Clinton may hope that they are now following his plea to judge the dollar by
US economic fundamentals. But the verdict on those is more mixed than he
implies.
The president's case against a further dollar decline rests on three planks.
First, unlike other major industrial countries, US economic recovery is now
well advanced, with GDP forecasts promising steady growth in output and jobs
for this year and the next. Second, inflation remains subdued: there is
little to indicate that a rapid monetary tightening is needed to keep demand
in check. Finally, the nascent recoveries in Europe and Japan mean that the
American current account deficit, though substantial, has reached its
low-point, and should prove less of a worry in the months ahead.
How plausible is all this? The administration's projections for US output
growth in 1994, as revealed in last week's mid-session budget review,
remains 3 per cent, with the pace expected to ease slightly in 1995. Most
observers think that the economy is currently expanding somewhat faster than
this, as evidenced by last Friday's leap of 379,000 in the number of jobs.
Whatever the true figure, few would argue that America's current problem is
anaemic growth.
Performance fears
Fears about current US economic performance do not, however, centre on its
weakness. They focus instead on the possibility that the economy is already
coming up against capacity constraints that will feed through into wages and
prices. Mr Greenspan has raised short-term interest rates four times since
February, by a total of 1.25 percentage points. Even Mr Clinton now accepts
that the current rate of 4.25 per cent will have to rise before the end of
the year.
The two are unlikely to agree on the timing of that increase, although the
president may wish to have the ritual outrage of some constituents well
behind him in the run up to November's House and Senate elections. Yet, for
the moment at least, both do seem at one in their opinion that interest
rates must remain a lever for domestic demand management, not for attempted
manipulation of the dollar.
Recent growth
Yet many would cite domestic reasons for lifting that lever as soon as
possible. In addition to the buoyant employment figures, for example,
capacity utilisation is reaching levels that have historically triggered
inflation. Against such capacity pessimism is a currently fashionable view
that recent growth in productivity, combined with rapid equipment
investment, over the last 18 months is overturning historical truths about
US economic capacity.
Prices and wages may not continue to support such optimism, but last week's
figures - flat producer prices with a slight rise in consumer prices - did
not indicate the need for a drastic correction. In other words, the Federal
Reserve chairman was given few domestic excuses for raising rates now rather
than at the next time the FOMC meets on August 16.
Where the line between 'domestic' and 'foreign' fundamentals is getting
increasingly hard to draw is with regard to the third - and shakiest - leg
of the Clinton case for the dollar, namely, the balance of payments. It is
the coincidence of two events, one familiar, the other unprecedented, which
has caused the trouble. The familiar one is US structural current account
deficits, exacerbated by faster domestic growth than in its trading
partners. As in the early 1980s, this leaves the US needing to attract
foreign capital equivalent to about 2 1/2 per cent of GDP to balance the
books. What is unique about the current situation is that the need for
foreign funding does not end there. Funds must also be found to offset the
Dollars 130bn of capital the US is currently sending abroad, compared to an
average of only Dollars 10bn a year in the 1980s.
Mr Clinton may be right to argue that the flight from the dollar has been
overdone. But he cannot be as confident as he sounds that the fundamentals
are on the dollar's side. Its plight is a reminder of long-standing US
weaknesses. The world's largest economy is trying to achieve rapidly rising
individual incomes with a net saving rate of around 2 per cent. Mr Clinton
should tell Congress it cannot be done.

FT  16 JUL 94 / It's better when you're private: Are the salaries of bosses
in former UK public utilities justified?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This kerfuffle about salaries is a peculiarly British thing, said Mr John
Bellak, once chairman of Severn Trent Water and recipient of a Pounds
512,626 pay-off last year. He was reflecting from the Carlton Club in London
on the latest arguments about pay, pensions and share options that are
swirling around the water and electricity distribution companies, four years
on from privatisation.
Some critics charge that the executives of the privatised companies are
former civil servants who have managed to get their hands in the honey pot;
supporters claim that they are overworked managers battling away in complex
industries, whose personal merits are only now beginning to be recognised.
The extremes of the debate are crude, of course, and do not address directly
the question of whether reward should be matched to performance. But as
annual reports have trickled out recently, and the small print at the back
has revealed details of remuneration and pay-offs, critics have become more
outspoken: the rewards have been outstripping performance, they say.
In the Commons, warming to the theme that privatisation had turned into a
swindle against consumers, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, asked
the prime minister this week: 'How can you defend the fact that the chairman
of North West Water got Pounds 47,000 a year before privatisation and now he
gets Pounds 338,000?'
Mr John Major defended the water privatisation programme and said directors
should abide by the government's strict limits on pay increases for public
sector workers. Meanwhile, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, has been
telling executives that those who climb to the top of the ladder should be
mindful of their responsibilities to others.
Water and electricity executives might have had an easier time fending off
their critics but for three factors: the recession, lay-offs in the
privatised industries, and larger bills for consumers. 'For a lot of people,
when they come into the industry, what really hits them is that they're in a
goldfish bowl,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity.
Those looking into the bowl see plumper and more valuable shapes than in
recent years. This is true even in the goldfish bowl of Scotland, where, as
in the case of Scottish Power and Scottish HydroElectric, the privatisations
were priced more parsimoniously than the English electricity companies, and
where the chairman and senior executives have been a little more restrained
in taking salary increases than some of their English peers. None the less,
the rises were substantial.
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive of Scottish Power, has seen his pay rise
from Pounds 63,175 before privatisation in 1991 to Pounds 255,218 in
1993-94. Sir Donald Miller, Scottish Power's first chairman, saw his pay
increase from Pounds 75,873 in 1990 to Pounds 203,192 in 1992, the year he
retired.
In England, at Northern Electric, the salary of Mr David Morris, chairman,
went up in the last financial year to Pounds 208,000; it was Pounds 72,151
in 1989-90. At Northumbrian Water, Mr David Cranston, the chief executive,
earned Pounds 150,000 in the last financial year, three times more than the
company's managing director at the time of flotation.
On top of their salaries, most directors and senior executives of the
privatised companies have been granted options to buy shares at a specific
price. There is nothing unusual in this practice: it is a common method of
allying hopes of personal fortune to corporate performance. But the bonanza
has led to growing calls from the Labour party for an independent inquiry
into the way the utilities are regulated.
At Swalec, the south Wales electricity company, Mr Wynford Evans, chairman,
has exercised options on 111,510 shares, making a paper profit of just under
Pounds 500,000. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, and two other directors of
Southern Electricity, had paper profits of more than Pounds 1m in total on
the exercise of 240,000 share options. The departure last year of Midlands
Electricity's managing director, Mr Richard Young, was made more comfortable
by his possession of options which could provide a paper profit of more than
Pounds 500,000.
There is no doubt that, as one City utilities expert put it, 'many of the
privatised company executives have gone from being moderately comfortable
engineers to quite wealthy businessmen in three or four years.' But the
qualification of the adjectives is significant. As the observer noted:
'There are plenty of 30-year-olds in the City making more money than these
guys.'
The amounts involved are trivial compared with the sums made by property
entrepreneurs in 1989-90, when values were surging. But the privatised
utilities' executives are a more cautious breed, trained to make technical
decisions rather than to play percentages.
'When we were privatised - the 12 English electricity companies - the 12 of
us were both chairmen and chief executives. Eleven of us were long term in
the industry, 10 were engineers,' recalled Mr Townsend. Now the roles of
chairman and chief executive have been split and 'virtually all the chief
executives are engineers, not all of them from inside the industry'.
They have in common the fact that they seem obsessed with work. Mr Alan
Smith, managing director of Anglian Water, said he had never worked harder,
never worked longer and never worried more than in the years since
privatisation.
Sir Desmond Pitcher, the subject of Mrs Beckett's ire as chairman of North
West Water, uses the golf course and opera house as an extension of his
office. 'He just hasn't time to be a playboy or anything like that,' said a
colleague.
Mr John Seed, chief executive of SWEB, the south-west electricity company,
started work on Thursday at 7am, finished at midnight and was starting work
again yesterday at 6am.
There is little evidence that the higher salaries and the grant of share
options has turned the technocrats into hedonists. 'After privatisation my
salary increased significantly, but I did not buy a bigger house or car. My
life did not really change,' said Mr Walter Waring, managing director of
Eastern Electricity until 1992.
Such modesty is characteristic. Sir Donald Miller formerly of Scottish Power
has a yacht but did not bother to upgrade it when he moved off nationalised
industry pay. Mr Bellak has a rambling country house in Staffordshire, but
he owned it before he joined Severn Trent. Mr Preston, also of Scottish
Power, who was taking a day off fishing yesterday, 'has a smaller house in
Glasgow than I have', said a colleague, 'and a little cottage in
Dumfriesshire'. Mr Townsend pointed out: 'The big difference is when you
retire - if you look at the situation under the old regime, we wouldn't have
been very well off at all.'
Yet, for all their rather mundane aspirations, the executives and directors
of the privatised utilities often attract venom. At the political level, the
disparity between their good fortune and the misfortune of those made poor
by recession is an easy target. In the City there are expressions of unease
at their salary levels.
'These companies were privatised on the cheap as the merchant banks did a
good job of persuading the government how little they were worth. They were
then given an extremely relaxed regulatory regime as privatised monopolies.
The directors were given a wodge of share options and the ability to sack
people, so they got large increases in their share prices. So everyone's a
millionaire,' said a senior fund manager.
The executives in the privatised industries would say this is a gross
exaggeration. They are not defensive about their pay packages. 'I would
never have come here for Pounds 40,000,' asserted Mr Michael Hoffman, chief
executive of Thames Water, who joined the company nine months before
privatisation. 'And I would never have recruited top people into other
positions if the company did not pay them proper competitive salaries.'
Attracting top talent through salaries that compete with the private sector
has been a crucial issue since the mid-1980s, when the government was
seeking to strengthen the management of the state utilities. Often the
incoming managers took pay cuts on the assumption that, as the state
utilities absorbed private sector practices, the pay position would be
redressed.
Mr Waring argued that one reason for the pay rises of the past three years
was the government's refusal to pay a fair salary in the public sector. It
was common for senior staff reporting to him to be paid 10 per cent more
than directors. 'There were discussions with government about adjusting
salaries before privatisation, but they would not do it,' he recalled.
After privatisation, as the water and electricity companies went into the
market for new staff, they had to pay market rates. This had a ratcheting
effect, as the wages of existing staff were brought into line with the
newcomers.
The arrival of new staff was only one element of the changes which took
place in the state utilities in the period before and immediately after
privatisation. 'As a nationalised industry, we had one paymaster. These days
we have to explain our strategy and requirements to a wider public,' said Mr
John Tysoe, for the last year non-executive chairman of Yorkshire
Electricity. That wider public includes shareholders, City institutions such
as merchant banks, the regulators and the customer; it is not as cosy as
being an old-fashioned water authority.
This wider range of functions is offered as one justification by executives
for their higher salary rates. They also cite the more complex nature of
their business. With finite profits from their regulated, mainstream
activities, the companies have been diversifying into unregulated business
such as power generation abroad, and waste disposal. So new and wider skills
have been required.
South West Water hired Mr Keith Court and Mr William Fraser as chairman and
managing director just before privatisation. They have not had a pay rise
since but, said the company, 'they were recruited for their extensive
international business experience to manage huge capital programmes and to
deliver to budget and on time. It was understood that, if they could
deliver, then the rewards would follow.'
What these rewards will be is not clear. In industries where, as Mr Bellak
noted, 'different companies are developing different personalities', the
levels of payment will remain a source of contentious debate. As they look
out of the goldfish bowl, Mr Court and Mr Fraser will know that, in the
interests of peace and quiet, they will have to be able to justify every
penny in their pay cheques.

Mr Jacques Santer is known as the man who never says no. Nicknamed 'Smiling
Jacques' or 'Champagne Jacques', the long-serving prime minister of
Luxembourg, who was selected yesterday as the next president of the European
Commission, is a low-key operator who avoids confrontation and specialises
in forging compromise.
By drifting towards Mr Santer - who was nobody's first choice in the contest
for Commission president - European Union leaders could not have chosen a
more different character from Mr Jacques Delors, the volatile visionary who
has been at its head for the past 10 years. History will show that they have
made an important statement about the future direction of the EU.
The Santer Commission signals a period of consolidation in the process of
integration in Europe, a pause for breath after the bold leaps forward
marked by the Single European Market, the European Economic Area, and the
grand design for European monetary and political union - all of which bore
Mr Delors' indelible stamp.
The risk that Mr Santer's appointment will weaken the institutional power
and political leadership role of the European Commission is serious, though
senior EU diplomats cautioned yesterday that it is premature to pass
judgment.
Much will depend on the quality of the Santer team and the degree of support
the new president can expect from the Franco-German axis, a crucial factor
in Mr Delors' successes in the late 1980s, when he became synonymous with Mr
Europe. It will also depend on whether Mr Santer, like Mr Delors, can grow
in the job during the five-year term which he starts on January 5 next year.
Born in the small Luxembourg town of Wasserbillig in 1937, Mr Santer, 57,
has spent almost all his life in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. His mighty
micro-state has deftly exploited free trade, open borders and a favourable
tax regime to build a thriving economy near the centre of a single European
market of 340m people.
Mr Santer's political career took off in 1972 when he was appointed
secretary of state for cultural and social affairs. He became leader of his
Social Christian party in 1972, a post which he held until 1982. Long
standing in the shadow of Prime Minister Pierre Werner, the intellectual
godfather of European monetary union, Mr Santer waited patiently for the top
job which he took over in 1984, having held several ministerial posts,
including finance.
Mr Santer has won re-election three times, most recently in last month's
poll. Asked about his strengths, an old schoolfriend who has kept in touch
with the prime minister, said: 'He is not a slave to his work. He does not
sit at his desk from 6am to 10pm thinking he is the most important person in
the country. You meet him everywhere, at each party. He is accessible to
everyone.'
Another colleague who knows Mr Santer well said that the prime minister is a
good delegator, with a light touch and a tough streak. 'He will never say
no, but that does not mean he lets himself be pushed around.'
Mr Santer's appointment has evoked memories of the selection of Mr Gaston
Thorn as president of the European Commission in 1980. Mr Thorn, himself a
former Luxembourg prime minister, took over from Lord Jenkins, the former
Labour cabinet minister, and served without distinction.
Mr Thorn was overshadowed by Viscount Etienne Davignon, the powerful
industry commissioner; and many predict that a similar fate could await Mr
Santer should heavyweights such as Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade
negotiator, retain their posts.
Yet Luxembourgers who know both Mr Santer and Mr Thorn argue that the
comparisons between the two men are flawed. 'Thorn was a tough guy who had
been chairman of the United Nations general assembly, but he was a poor
prime minister of Luxembourg. Santer is a nice guy who has done a very good
job here.'
Mr Santer's record on the European stage is easily underestimated. In 1985,
he chaired the negotiations leading to the Single European Act, playing a
useful role in persuading the then British prime minister, Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, to drop her reservations about the move towards more majority
voting on EU laws. He argued, successfully, that the loss of sovereignty was
worth exchanging for the prize of a barrier-free internal market.
It was during Luxembourg's six-month presidency of the European Union in
1991 that much of the groundwork was done for the Maastricht treaty on
political and monetary union. British officials recall that Mr Santer and
his team stood out in favour of the 'pillar system' - the term used to
describe the separation of supranational decision-making (trade,
agriculture, competition policy) and looser inter-governmental co-operation
on foreign policy, defence, justice and immigration.
Mr Santer is a federalist - but only if it means preserving local and
national powers in sensitive areas. He prefers the old Treaty of Rome term,
'European Community', to the new, Maastricht-inspired 'European Union',
which implies not so much about loose co-operation and more about the
direction of integration. 'The big difference with Delors is that Santer
does not come from the French centralising tradition,' says a colleague of
the prime minister.
As Mr Santer told the Luxemburger Wort newspaper this week: 'For me,
federalism is the opposite of centralism. To help the process of European
integration does not mean to usher in a Napoleonic Europe. The more Europe
is decentralised, the stronger it is.'
Such sentiments will endear him not only to British Euro-sceptics, but also
to the foes of Brussels centralism who have become more vocal in France,
Germany and Italy since the agreement on the Maastricht treaty in December
1991. His political beliefs spring from a deep conviction that Luxembourg
has thrived in the EU, precisely because it has avoided being submerged by a
central authority or swamped by its larger neighbours, France and Germany.
This conviction explains the Grand Duchy's resistance to German-led calls
for an EU-wide withholding tax, which would mean scrapping the tax
privileges offered to foreign savers (and stemming the flow of Deutschemarks
into Luxembourg).
Mr Santer has made clear that Luxembourg will only agree to a new harmonised
tax if it is extended to other OECD tax havens such as the Channel Islands,
Gibraltar, Lichtenstein, Monaco, and Switzerland.
'There will be no deal between Mr Santer and Chancellor Kohl on withholding
tax,' predicts Mr Lucien Thiel, general manager of the Luxembourg Bankers
Association.
Luxembourgers predict that Mr Santer will be a little more independent than
expected, if only because he has been a member of the exclusive club of the
12 heads of EU government (known as the European Council) since 1985. 'He
will listen to the big chiefs, but he will not be a puppet on the string of
Helmut Kohl and (French President) Francois Mitterrand,' said a colleague.
Still, there is an undercurrent of disbelief that a country with only
400,000 people has supplied a second president of the Commission in 14
years. Some fear a backlash against Luxembourg, which is already
over-represented in terms of institutions and voting weights in EU
decision-making.
'A new Burgermeister is coming to Brussels,' summed up one Commission
official yesterday.
In fairness, Luxembourg is merely fulfilling its historical role. In the
Middle Ages, several counts from the House of Luxembourg were called upon to
serve as successive German emperors, because they were compromise candidates
who came from a country which did not represent a threat to the Greater
Powers.
As Mr Delors might say: 'Plus ca change en Europe.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Graduate debt up 13% to Pounds 2,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The level of debt held by students on graduation rose by 13 per cent this
year to an average of Pounds 2,004, according to a survey of 2,286 students
by Barclays Bank.
The study shows that students are relying increasingly on funds from parents
 -in the form of gifts rather than loans - and less on banks. The average
size of a bank overdraft at graduation now stands at Pounds 286 - down from
an average Pounds 295 two years ago. They are also trying to avoid the
government's student loans scheme. The average borrowed from the scheme was
Pounds 699, compared with an average available of Pounds 1,205.
The figures suggest that student hardship will increase in the next three
years, as grants will be cut by 10 per cent each year, with the balance made
up by loans.
Evidence that middle-class parents are being forced to spend more money on
university education for their children, and that the take-up of loans is
low will intensify the pressure on the government from academics to reform
the student finance system, possibly by allowing students to repay loans via
higher income tax or national insurance payments.
Parents and guardians are bearing the brunt, and were nominated as the main
source of income by 31 per cent of students this year, compared with 26 per
cent last year. Those naming student grants and loans as their main source
of income fell from 61 per cent to 57 per cent.
More than 80 per cent of parents knew about their children's debt levels,
with 35 per cent saying they were worried by them.
The proportion owing money to their parents has fallen from 21 per cent to
12 per cent in the last two years, as parents increasingly give money on a
'no-strings' basis.
Barclays found that students were becoming more 'serious-minded' about their
personal finances, with most resigned to going into debt, and about their
careers, with exams overwhelmingly cited as the most important issues facing
them.
Those on professional courses were most likely to be in debt on leaving
university, while pure sciences graduates had the lowest debt levels.
Students from six institutions - including old universities and former
polytechnics - were surveyed. The six were Strathclyde, Manchester
Metropolitan, Sheffield, Warwick, Bristol and Westminster.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Law Society decision challenged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Society is to be challenged in the High Court over its refusal to
pay compensation to a company which lost thousands in a mortgage fraud
allegedly involving a dishonest solicitor.
In the first case of its kind a judge yesterday gave Mortgage Express leave
to seek judicial review on the grounds that the solicitors' professional
body reached a 'fundamentally flawed' decision.
Mr Robert Griffiths QC, for Mortgage Express, said the case arose after the
company funded the purchase of a flat in Marylebone, central London, using
the services of a solicitor whom the Law Society now accepted was dishonest.
According to a valuation report the property was worth Pounds 160,000 and
Mortgage Express agreed to loan the purchaser Pounds 144,150. It was only
after completion of the sale in December 1990 that the company discovered
that there had been an overvaluation and it had been caught in a
'back-to-back' transaction. The flat had been bought earlier the same day
for Pounds 120,000. In April 1992 Mortgage Express obtained an order for
possession. It later sold the property for just Pounds 72,767, leaving a
total loss with interest of Pounds 124,021.
Mr Griffiths said the Law Society had unlawfully rejected the company's
compensation claim on the basis that the money was primarily lost as a
result of the overvaluation and the subsequent fall in the property market.

Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, yesterday signed up to
the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private

The insurer made it clear that it was the fact that the PIA had become

The slide in the contribution of National Savings to government funding
continued last month, falling to Pounds 405m from Pounds 424m in May,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
Net receipts in June totalled Pounds 194m, with gross sales of Pounds 825m
being offset by repayments of Pounds 631m. Accrued interest amounted to
Pounds 211m.
For the first time since their launch at the beginning of the year
Pensioners' Bonds - with net sales of Pounds 116m - last month ceased to be
the highest contributor and were supplanted by premium bonds with net sales

FT  16 JUL 94 / Tory MP in sacking row with whips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night embroiled in a dispute with a ministerial aide
who said that whips had lied when they said he was sacked, just days before
the cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Tim Devlin yesterday insisted that he resigned - in spite of attempts by
ministers and whips to persuade him to stay on - in protest against planned
defence cuts in his Stockton South constituency.
When Mr Devlin, the parliamentary private secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell,
the attorney general, said he had resigned he was immediately contradicted
by Conservative party managers. They took the unprecedented step of saying
that he had been dismissed for his 'poor voting record and general
ineffectiveness'.
Friends of Mr Devlin asked why the whips should sack a ministerial aide when
they could remove him from office quietly next week. Last night Mrs Marjorie
Simpson, chair of the Stockton South constituency party, said she believed
the whips were lying and backed Mr Devlin.
The whips' office said Mr Devlin was sacked after he missed four important
Commons votes. They said Mr Devlin's dismissal was connected solely with
party discipline.
Party managers said that with a majority of 15 they were not prepared to
allow members of government to 'cherry pick' which votes they were prepared
to attend. The whips said the attorney general had been kept informed of Mr
Devlin's dismissal and had accepted their judgment. Sir Nicholas's office
would not comment.
Last night Mr Devlin - who has the reputation of being a rebel within
government - said on BBC radio: 'I am staggered. The chief whip and the
deputy chief whip Greg Knight and the attorney general have been trying all
week to stop me from resigning. It has been rumoured in the press for a few
days that I was going to resign. But they announce I am sacked. I find that
unbelievable.'
Asked whether the whips had been lying, Mr Devlin responded: 'Yes.'
Mr Devlin said Sir Nicholas had tried to persuade him to remain and fight
his corner in the government. But he felt unable to do so once the defence
white paper had revealed the loss of 384 jobs in his constituency.
Mr Devlin's removal gave rise to speculation that Sir Nicholas might be
dropped from the government in next week's reshuffle. The rumours were
fuelled by the announcement that Mr Devlin's duties were to be carried out
by Mr Gary Streeter, Tory MP for Plymouth Sutton, who will remain PPS to Sir
Derek Spencer, the solicitor general.
Party managers denied that the affair would have any effect on Sir
Nicholas's future.
Mr Devlin has featured in newspaper reports about his lobbying for the
release from prison of a man charged in connection with drugs dealing and
who was also alleged to have been a police informer. The man left the
country after charges were dropped.
While the matter was an embarrassment to the attorney general, government
advisers made it clear that it had nothing to do with Mr Devlin's return to
the backbenches.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Pounds 466,000 profit for electric chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Smith, chairman of regional electricity company Eastern, has made a
profit of Pounds 466,867 by cashing in share options awarded to him after
privatisation.
It brings to more than Pounds 12m the profits made by directors of the UK's
privatised water and electricity companies exercising their share option
perks.
Many of the executives are sitting on substantial profits from share options
they have not yet exercised and also from options they have exercised but
have not yet sold.
On April 5 Mr Smith, who at privatisation earned a salary of Pounds 62,270,
exercised 121,107 share options. He immediately sold 60,554 shares at 6.69p
each and 60,553 the day after at 6.80p, to give him a total profit of Pounds
466,867. Three other Eastern directors recently exercised share options
bringing them a combined profit of Pounds 143,000. The company said that it
was 'a private matter for the directors whether they exercised the share
options'.
A spokesman said that 'in order to attract and retain senior executives of
the right calibre and degree of specialist talent Eastern has to be prepared
to offer a remuneration package which is comparable with the rest of
industry'.
Eastern's recently published annual report gives some details of directors'
share options but does not reveal the actual profit Mr Smith made. This
practice is in line with several other water and electricity company
reports.
Stock Exchange disclosures compiled for the Financial Times by The Inside
Track, an Edinburgh-based consultancy, reveal the actual gross profits made
by directors when exercising share options.
Mr Tony Coleman, group finance director of Yorkshire Electricity, made a
profit of Pounds 152,550 by exercising 61,957 options in April and then
selling on 45,000 shares. That left him with 16,957 shares which are
currently showing a paper profit of Pounds 49,854.
Water company directors have made total profits of about Pounds 4.5m by
exercising options and selling shares since January last year.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Future of farm body in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has deferred a controversial decision on the future of the
Agricultural Wages Board, which sets pay and conditions for 180,000 farm
workers.
Labour says the board's existence is threatened by government plans to
repudiate two international conventions that would protect farm wages.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, told parliament she had
received advice from employers in the industry that Britain should not
recognised the two International Labour Organisation conventions as they
would restrict flexibility in the farm labour market.
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, called Mrs Shephard's move
'a shocking attack on some of the lowest-paid workers in the land'.
The two conventions, which are accepted in most countries, require the
setting of minimum wages for farm workers as well as the guarantee of an
annual holiday. But the National Farmers' Union said the conventions would
mean there could be no changes to arrangements for the next 10 years.
The NFU strongly supports the continuing existence of the wages board.
During the consultation exercise, Mrs Shephard has received calls from all
corners of the industry for the board's preservation.
But she said recent developments had forced her to rethink. This year's high
pay settlement by the board, which awarded a 4.9 per cent wage increase to
farm workers - double the average settlement for manual workers - had led
many employers to question the value of the board, Mrs Shephard said.
In addition, employees' representatives were seeking a judicial review of
the board on the grounds that it discriminated against part-time workers.
Mrs Shephard said that in view of these developments 'I believe we must
pause and take stock'.
Mr Strang said the abolition or weakening of the wages board would drive
down farm workers' wages, which were already 30 per cent below the
industrial average.

FT  16 JUL 94 / OECD supports 'bold' reforms of health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's reforms of the national health service are producing
'increasingly encouraging results', the OECD says in a review of the UK
economy.
It says the reforms, 'a bold attempt to introduce elements of competition
into the centrally-financed healthcare system', have increased the NHS's
efficiency.
They have also made hospitals respond better to patients' needs. And the
fundholding family doctors who purchase health services on behalf of their
patients have done much to challenge hospital practices and demand
improvements.
The OECD says, however, that the government has made little effort to
monitor the impact of the changes. It warns that political pressures over
the closure of hospitals may weaken the process of adjustment.
It says that the district health authorities, which purchase healthcare on
behalf of most people, are short of purchasing skills. The result is that
changes in patterns of healthcare are slow, as districts tend to deal with
the same hospitals as before rather than shopping around.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said it was gratifying that the
OECD had recognised the achievements of the reforms.
The organisation says that the NHS has traditionally delivered healthcare at
a lower cost than comparable countries. Infant mortality and life expectancy
are close to OECD averages.
The centralised control of the health service has been effective in holding
down costs, the OECD says, making the NHS a 'remarkably cost-effective
institution'.
The report says GP fundholders have been particularly successful in
improving the quality of treatment. It acknowledges the criticism that
fundholding may create a two-tier system, but compares that with the already
wide variations in the standards of family doctors before the reforms.
It says: 'The answer to potential inequity is not to abandon this effective
form of purchasing, but to extend fundholding and GP-based purchasing to
cover more patients.'
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said it was easy for Paris-based
economists to see the changes through rose-tinted spectacles.
He said: 'The reality for patients, nurses and doctors who experience the
NHS every day is different, with greatly increased bureaucracy and falling
standards of patient care.'

The government's controversial imposition of value added tax on domestic
fuel and power was yesterday given the full backing of the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
In a generally upbeat review of the UK economy the organisation, which is
owned by 25 industrialised countries, says levying VAT on fuel and power is
desirable for reasons other than safeguarding the environment.
The organisation applauds the tax because it broadens the VAT-base. It
suggests that the VAT rates on fuel, currently 8 per cent and due to rise to
17.5 per cent next April, might be too low.
It says: 'Allowing for the environmental costs of energy consumption, an
indirect tax rate even higher than the standard VAT rate could be justified
on efficiency grounds.'
Other UK tax changes of recent years gain less wholehearted support. The
organisation notes that more taxpayers have been shifted into higher
marginal tax brackets. In addition, the interaction of national insurance
contributions and income tax has resulted in an unfair fall in marginal
income tax rates for people earning about Pounds 25,000.
But in general the organisation praises the supply-side reforms introduced
since the 1980s to improve Britain's economic structure, although it warns
that 'the process is by no means finished'.
The UK, it says, 'now has one of the least regulated labour markets in the
OECD'. But as elsewhere, 'much remains to be done to reduce poverty traps,
notably for low-skilled unemployed with dependents and those receiving
housing benefit'.
The report fleshes out the analysis and forecast of the UK economy provided
in last month's OECD Economic Outlook. It says Britain has made 'major
strides' in restructuring its economy and should experience steady growth
with falling unemployment and a manageable current account deficit in the
next 18 months.
Inflation should not be a problem in the next two years but the Treasury and
the Bank of England are urged to remain vigilant and take pre-emptive action
to keep inflation low when the economy returns to its long-term trend rate
of growth.
The OECD warns, however, that unemployment will still be unacceptably high
and above its natural rate in late 1995.
It says Britain must continue to upgrade the skill level of its labour force
in the medium term.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Complex calculations for C&amp;G: The conundrum which faces the
building society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The task facing the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is a complex
one. It is having to devise a scheme for distributing the Pounds 1.8bn that
Lloyds Bank bid for the society that will be seen as legal by the courts and
as attractive by its investors.
The task before the society after the High Court ruling that certain
payments it planned to make to members were unlawful is reminiscent of the
sort of mathematical problem set in exams.
In essence it appears to amount to devising a lawful scheme where there is
the greatest possible overlap between members who can vote and members who
are eligible for cash payments. But the smaller number of those qualifying
for payments means that the payments themselves should be higher than
originally intended.
The original scheme involved cash payments of up to Pounds 10,000 to every
member, including borrowers, as well as to others who could not vote, such
as depositors - people with a savings account which did not make them
society members.
But Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that cash payments could
not be made to investors of less than two years' standing, nor to borrowers,
although it was lawful to give cash to depositors and staff. The requirement
in the 1986 Building Societies Act for high levels of support among
investors for such a takeover to go ahead, makes the task more difficult.
While borrowers have to approve the move only by a simple majority of those
voting, at least 75 per cent of investors voting - or investors representing
90 per cent of the value of investments which carry voting rights - have to
consent.
The details of a new scheme will be announced in mid-August, but there are a
few clues already about features it might contain. It appears unlikely, for
example, that an alternative way of handing out the Pounds 500 cash payments
to borrowers will be on offer.
The voting threshold for getting consent of borrowing members is lower than
for investors. Borrowers are also less mobile than investors, and so perhaps
more susceptible to the long-term benefits of accepting the Lloyds' offer,
for example in terms of the lower interest rates they may be charged. It is
also clear that a critical factor will be what is known as the qualifying
date - the date for the start of the counting back to establish who is of
two years' standing.
At the end of March, 27 per cent of C&amp;G investors were of less than two
years' standing, but that proportion will already have fallen, since the
society closed to new investing members in mid-June, the day after the
judgment.
There is nothing in principle to stop the society setting a qualifying date
well ahead of the announcement of the new scheme, thus increasing further
the overlap between those investors able to vote, and those able to receive
cash.
C&amp;G would not necessarily have to wait anything like two years before the
proportion of voting investors ineligible for cash fell to a level which the
society's board believed would enable it to win the vote.
There is a further, slightly baroque, twist, which involves encouraging
relatively new investors, and perhaps, borrowers, to open deposit accounts
as a way of receiving payments.
There are some difficulties with this - for example, the Building Societies
Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, might well look unkindly on
such an account if it were confined to existing members of the society.
Yet if it were open to anyone, the fact that its existence was announced
before the closing date for eligibility might lead to the very fluctuations
in funds between societies that the regulatory system has been keen to
avoid.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Straight talker who could ignite the warm-words committee:
Kevin Brown takes pre-result temperatures in the race for Labour's deputy
leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The form book was right. Mr Tony Blair, the modernising shadow home
secretary, started as favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour leader and
seems certain to win.
Even Mr Blair's rivals, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott, sound
increasingly half-hearted as they repeat the well-worn mantra that they can
win on the final straight.
That would be a huge and unexpected upset. But there may yet be some
excitement when the preferences of up to 4.5m Labour supporters are
announced on Thursday.
It looks increasingly possible that Mrs Beckett, the interim leader, may
also lose the deputy leadership to Mr Prescott, the rumbustious shadow
employment secretary.
If that happens, it will be a heavy blow to Mrs Beckett, who has campaigned
largely on her record as Mr Smith's deputy since the last leadership
election in 1992.
But it would be a stunning victory for Mr Prescott, whose passionate
advocacy of full employment has provided one of the few highlights in a dull
campaign.
Interviewed in the opposition leader's room at the Commons, Mrs Beckett
admitted that it was 'perfectly possible' that she might fail to win either
leadership post.
She said: 'I am used to going into elections that I might not win, and
having to make my case and abide by the judgment of electorate. There is
nothing odd to me about the fact that I might end up having lost both
positions.
'But the party must decide on the leadership team it wants at the next
election. Winning is so crucial that if the party were to decide that it
ought to have a different leadership team then the party must be free to
make the decision.'
Mrs Beckett's pessimism is mirrored by growing optimism in the Prescott
camp. Rifling through hundreds of supporters' letters in his turret office
overlooking the Commons, Mr Prescott said it was 'staggering how many people
are now coming over'.
He thinks the party will vote for Mr Blair because it wants a leader who can
persuade Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters to switch sides. 'I am not
a strong suitor on those grounds,' he said.
He added: 'But if they vote for me as the deputy leader, I represent the
heart and commitment that the party is concerned about, and it is a
synthesis of those two positions from which, presumably, we will draw our
general direction, values and presentation.'
Mr Blair has scrupulously avoided giving any indication of his preference
for the deputy leader's job. But if Mrs Beckett does lose there will be long
faces among his entourage.
In part, this is because of a long-standing enmity between Mr Prescott and
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, whose hopes of running Labour's
economic policy might come to nothing under a Blair/Prescott leadership
team.
But it also reflects concerns about Mr Prescott's volatile personality,
which throbs with passion and commitment, in sharp contrast to the
calculating but bloodless approach of Mrs Beckett.
Some Blair supporters say the shadow employment secretary is already prone
to embarrassing flights of fancy. Give him a leadership role, and he will be
a loose cannon on deck, they say.
Mr Prescott is clearly irritated by this. He repudiates many of the more
flamboyant stories about him - such as reports of a row in the Commons
tea-room with Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, over nuclear
disarmament.
He is keen to defend his record as a serious political operator - leader of
Labour's European parliament delegation from 1976 to 1979; successful cod
war negotiator with the Icelandic government in 1976; author of eight long
pamphlets on Labour's economic and industrial policies.
He is also no slouch at the soundbite strategy so dear to the modernisers.
His slogan, 'Traditional values in a modern setting' was devised by Mr
Rodney Bickerstaffe, assistant general secretary of the Unison public sector
union, but it could easily have been dreamt up by Labour's spin doctors.
But wouldn't there be tensions with Mr Blair over Mr Prescott's robust
approach, and his determination to sharpen Labour's image by setting targets
for progress in key policy areas such as full employment?
Mr Prescott rebuts this analysis with some force. He is clearly fond of his
freebooting image, and admits disarmingly that he has done little to
discourage it. 'My style fits easily into that character,' he said.
But that doesn't mean he is incapable of knuckling down to collective
responsibilities. 'The leader and deputy leader can't be at war with each
other,' he said. 'The party puts two people into the leadership . . . but at
the end of the day the leader is the leader and it is their responsibility
to set the framework.'
Nevertheless, Mr Prescott's language betrays an impatience with the Blair
style that augurs badly for those who think vigorous debate inevitably
spells electoral disaster for Labour.
Noting that people are supporting him 'because they think I will say it as
it is', he launches into a long critique of the 'be safe and say nothing'
approach of Labour's modernisers, whom he lampoons as the 'warm-words
committee'.
He said: 'We have started to have soft profiles which have made it very
difficult to differentiate Labour and the Tory party. I think we can be
robust about our principles and argue our case.
'Sometimes you have to find words to get over difficulties, but the trouble
with our side is that we have got too caught up with the warm-words
committees . . . the warm words almost become the policies. I think the
electorate has seen through a lot of this. Vision is OK, but they do like
the nuts and bolts, and I'm more of a nuts and bolts politician.'
What will he do if he loses? 'There are people who don't want to stand for
elections because they think they will come out a bit weaker because the
vote might not be as good as they think it should be.
'I've always taken the view that if you acquit yourself well you will come
out of it stronger . . . I will certainly come out of this one considerably
stronger, whether I have one of the leadership positions or not.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Tories improve party finances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party achieved an operating surplus of more than Pounds 2m
 -the largest in its history - according to the party's report and accounts
published yesterday.
But the balance sheet shows the Tories still have a bank overdraft of Pounds
15.82m.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party's out-going chairman, was upbeat about the
turnaround of a net operating deficit last year of Pounds 2.19m to a surplus
of Pounds 2.06m.
He said: 'The most encouraging feature of the year has been the recovery in
the finances of the party. After three successive years of deficits of
around Pounds 5m, the position was improved in 1992-93 when losses were more
than halved. Now in 1993-94 we have achieved a surplus of more than Pounds
2m.
'This represents the largest surplus in the party's history - a vital and
encouraging first step towards the elimination of the still substantial
overall deficit.'

<TEXT>
Talks aimed at reaching a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland
ground to a standstill last night after Mr John Major, the prime minister,
and Mr Albert Reynolds his Irish counterpart, were unable to compromise on
how to take forward the peace process, Emma Tucker writes.
The UK-Irish summit scheduled to take place at the end of next week has been
put off until autumn, when the two leaders will meet informally.
During yesterday's talks in Brussels, ahead of the summit to select the new
European Commission president, Mr Major was looking for a pledge from Dublin
that it would modify the republic's constitutional claim to Ulster. Mr
Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment ahead of the
conclusion of an overall agreement between unionists and nationalists.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Railtrack to try fresh direct appeal to strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack plans to make a further direct appeal to its 4,600 striking
signalling staff in an attempt to prevent the stepping up of the dispute
after next week.
The company will write to staff with more details of its latest productivity
pay offer in the next few days.
Railtrack managers said signalling staff were confused by their union
executive's decision to move to a 48-hour strike from noon on Tuesday, July
26. The sixth 24-hour Wednesday stoppage is planned for July 20.
Railtrack said that it had heard from about a quarter of the strikers on a
special telephone 'hot-line' over the past fortnight through its 'hearts and
minds' campaign. While the company acknowledges that the staff remain loyal
to their union's leadership, the calls were helping management clarify and
improve its pay offer.
The company has few options at this stage to counteract the union's move to
step up the industrial action. An official said that Railtrack had not yet
reached the point when it might consider imposing new contracts of
employment on the signalling grades which would change working practices.
The company has ruled out the option of dismissing the signalling staff and
replacing them with a newly trained workforce. Railtrack believes that such
a move would close down the network for at least three months and deal a
mortal blow to the company's future.
Railtrack continues to hope that the signalling staff will put pressure on
the RMT leadership to restart peace talks. The staff have already lost
Pounds 300 in pay through the strikes. They are set to lose as much as
Pounds 180 a week, more than 60 per cent of their earnings, if they move to
48-hour stoppages. This could mean the loss of three days' pay, because of
rostering arrangements.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said yesterday that there were
still 10 days left to reach a settlement with Railtrack before the first
three-day disruption took place.
He continued to insist that Railtrack had to agree to an interim payment for
past efficiency achievements before going on to negotiate a restructuring
package worth between 13 per cent and 26 per cent on basic rates.
Employer organisations are concerned at the cost of the rail conflict to
business. The Institute of Directors warned yesterday it could seriously
damage the economic recovery and hit Britain's reputation as a reliable
place to do business.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Row grows over aid for Hualon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is coming under mounting pressure to reconsider its decision
to provide a Pounds 61m grant for the Hualon textile project in Belfast.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, is seeking a
meeting on the subject with Mr Tim Smith, the Northern Ireland minister.
Mr Winterton, chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries
Alliance, an industry pressure group, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by
replies from Mr Smith to a series of parliamentary questions.
He described the decision to earmark aid for the Pounds 157m project as 'one
of those great civil service blunders that have affected British industry
for several years'.
Mr Christopher Whitehouse, the alliance's chief executive, said: 'We want it
stopped.'
Mr Winterton's remarks came a week after it emerged that the recently
established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe aspects of the
project as part of its inquiry into employment creation in the province.
The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese
conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern
Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture.
It became the subject of controversy in May, when it emerged that the
European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials in
approving the UK government grant.
In his answers Mr Smith said the government had no plans to review its
decision to assist the project, which it had concluded would not cause any
significant job displacement in the UK.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles
company, has warned that 'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost
because of the project.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Pledge of no more cuts in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government insisted yesterday that this week's defence cuts would not be
followed by more reductions in the near future, but the pledge was met by a
sceptical reaction from the opposition parties.
Government officials said that following Thursday's announcement of more
than 18,000 job losses the Ministry of Defence would not be a target in the
forthcoming public round of expenditure negotiations, which cover the period
up to 1996.
They stressed that the Pounds 2.4bn procurement package set out this week by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, would not have been feasible
unless he was was confident that he would not be asked by the Treasury for
further cuts.
Mr Rifkind yesterday signed a Pounds 1.1bn contract with the defence company
Vickers for 259 Challenger-2 tanks, which he said 'demonstrates that the
fighting strength of the armed forces is being continually increased'.
Mr David Clark, the Labour defence spokesman, said he doubted the
government's ability to meet its stated defence commitments, even after
Thursday's announcements, which are intended to trim spending by Pounds 750m
a year from 1996-97 onwards.
Mr Clark said the gap between commitments and available funding could rise
to Pounds 3bn in 1997-98 and Pounds 3.5bn the year after. He suspected that
more cuts were planned.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said there were
'significant omissions' in the procurements announced.
He said the armed forces' need for support and attack helicopters, and for
fresh or upgraded transport aircraft, was more urgent than the tanks, ships
and submarines Mr Rifkind pledged to buy.
In Fife MPs, union leaders and councillors yesterday launched the
Minesweepers for Rosyth campaign.
The base is set to close as an operational dock for Royal Navy ships, with
the loss of 700 jobs. Minesweepers and fishery protection ships are to be
moved elsewhere and the loss of 1,500 service personnel will hit the local
economy.
The base will be kept open with more than 900 jobs - about two-thirds
civilian - because of a continuing need for other operations at the base,
including support for the adjoining royal dockyard.
Along with the demand to keep minesweepers at Rosyth, the campaign will
lobby for extra financial resources for the Fife region.
In Exeter about 200 workers at a naval stores depot staged a walk-out in
protest at the depot's proposed closure.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Work disabled quota faces axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering abolishing the compulsory quota on employers
to provide jobs for the disabled, replacing it with a framework of
legislation that would offer protection from unfair dismissal.
The move, which could be enacted next year, is one of a number of government
proposals that aim to strengthen the rights of the disabled minority.
The proposals were published yesterday in a consultative document by the
Department of Social Security and follow attempts by Labour and Tory MPs to
introduce an over-arching civil rights bill for the disabled.
However, while ministers said they were prepared to introduce piecemeal
measures next year, the consultative document underlined the government's
determination not to introduce comprehensive civil rights for the disabled.
Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the disabled, told the Commons that a recent
private member's bill to create such civil rights would have a compliance
cost for industry running to at least Pounds 17bn.
Labour MPs accused Mr Scott of having belatedly responded to their attempts
to amend the law. Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour's disablement spokesman, said
the document was 'piecemeal, partial, pathetic, grudging, belated,
inadequate - and disabled people will not accept it'.
Ministers said yesterday that the measures in the consultation paper could
be introduced by individual Whitehall departments next year. These include a
statutory requirement on housebuilders to provide facilities for the
disabled in new houses and the creation of an advisory body, the National
Disability Council, to monitor the minority's rights.
Abolition of the disabled quota, which has been in operation since 1944 but
is now considered unworkable, would be at the heart of the changes. At
present, companies with more than 20 staff must employ at least 3 per cent
of registered disabled people. Ministers are looking at ways to replace this
with limited disabled rights through statutory legislation and industrial
tribunals.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Revenue misses accuracy targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quarter of self-employed tax returns processed by the Inland Revenue last
year were not right first time, according to details of a survey released
yesterday.
Nine per cent of returns processed for schedule E taxpayers - employees and
pensioners - also contained some inaccuracies, the figures showed.
To attain its targets, the Revenue is not allowed a single error with a tax
consequence in the returns, which are randomly selected from across the
country.
The survey was conducted in a pilot exercise as part of efforts to get bills
right first time.
The accuracy rates were below the planned targets for the year 1994-95,
which were 93 per cent for schedule E and 82 per cent for self-employed
taxpayers.
The Revenue also released details yesterday of three new targets for its
services to the public: to deal with every aspect of people's tax affairs
correctly first time; to answer telephone calls in 30 seconds; and to deal
with repayment claims within 42 days during peak periods and 28 days at
other times of year.
It stressed that it was continuing to aim for its existing objectives: to
reply to correspondence within 28 days and to attend to callers to its tax
inquiry centres within 15 minutes.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Waterways board increases income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Waterways, the nationalised body which runs Britain's canals,
increased its earned income by Pounds 3.5m last year as part of efforts to
phase out its dependence on government funding.
Some of the increase came from leisure uses such as boat and angling
licences. The board's annual report, published yesterday, makes clear that
leisure and tourism, as well as the property market, are seen as important
areas for growth.
The board has increased self-generated income by 40 per cent in real terms
since 1988, when it was the subject of a critical report by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Yesterday's report emphasises the board's heritage role - it owns more than
2,000 listed structures and ancient monuments and 64 sites of special
scientific interest - and envisages its development along the lines of the
National Trust.
The board received a Pounds 49.7m government grant last year, Pounds 2m less
than the year before, while self-generated income rose to Pounds 38.1m.
Mr Bernard Henderson, the chairman of Anglian Water who was appointed
British Waterways chairman in April, said that although plans for
privatisation would probably be welcomed by the government and the board he
did not expect this in the near future.
He said: 'There was no great problem in preparing Anglian for privatisation
because there was a will (among staff) to run the enterprise themselves. I
feel the same thing at British Waterways. And, if honest, the Treasury would
love to get rid of it too.'
He denied, however, that he had been brought in to prepare for
privatisation. He added: 'If the current grant suddenly stopped we would go
under.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / GM chief urges compromise to spur trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, president of General Motors, yesterday called for compromise
in the stalled trade talks between the US and Japan, which he said were
causing uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets.
'Somewhere along the line we need to reach some form of compromise to take
these trade talks forward,' Mr Smith said in Tokyo.
His comments came as US and Japanese trade negotiators failed in talks this
week to agree on how foreign access to Japan's vehicle and parts markets
could be improved.
The chief executive of the world's largest carmaker noted that the framework
trade negotiations were important in helping foreign companies make progress
in Japan but added that 'the strengthening of the yen against the dollar has
done more to level the trade playing field between Japanese and US companies
than all of the rhetoric and policy initiatives of the previous 20 years'.
Mr Smith warned that 'the fact that the US-Japan trade imbalance has
deteriorated despite the high-profile diplomatic talks. . . has not gone
unnoticed by the Congress and the public'. Consequently, 'if Japan fails to
open its markets more, then I believe the yen will continue to strengthen to
the detriment of Japanese exporters'.
GM had benefited significantly from the yen's sharp appreciation, Mr Smith
indicated.
The company has seen component sales to Japanese companies, for example,
rise substantially over the past year and expects in four years to double
its 1993 sales to Japanese companies of Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m).
GM also saw a 27 per cent increase in sales of cars and trucks in Japan in
the first six months of this year, to 17,400 units, of which about 8,000
units were made in North America.
This compares with 31,958 units for the whole of last year.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government is to crack down on leftist organisations
planning to hold mourning ceremonies for the late North Korean President Kim
Il-sung, whose funeral is scheduled for tomorrow.
The announcement follows the firebombing of six police stations in Seoul on
Thursday by radical students protesting at the arrest of student organisers
after they praised President Kim.
Student organisations have also said they will send groups conveying their
condolences to Pyongyang, after North Korea announced it would allow South
Koreans who wanted to pay homage to Mr Kim to cross the heavily fortified
demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas.
North Korea yesterday resumed propaganda attacks against the South after
suspending them following the president's death. It criticised South Korean
President Kim Young-sam for raising tensions by placing the country's
military and police on alert after the announcement last Saturday of Mr
Kim's death.
It compared the 'rude' actions to 'setting a fire at a funeral home'.
'Despite the fact that even the US president and Japanese prime minister
expressed their regrets over the death of President Kim Il-sung, only Kim
Young-sam. . . is acting recklessly,' declared the state-controlled Radio
Pyongyang.
South Korean officials have privately criticised US President Bill Clinton
for offering condolences over Mr Kim's death in what was seen as a
diplomatic gesture to maintain US dialogue with the new North Korean
leadership.
Suggestions by members of the main opposition Democratic party to send a
South Korean condolence mission to Pyongyang in an effort to improve
relations have been condemned by the ruling Democratic Liberal party.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Japan's widening trade gap hits hopes
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade gap widened by 14.8 per cent to Dollars 11.35bn (Pounds 7.3bn)
in the year to June, a serious blow to the Finance Ministry's belief that
the surplus had peaked.
The increase, fuelled by a 20.3 jump in exports to the US and a 14.1 per
cent rise in sales to the rest of Asia, brings Japan's overall trade surplus
for the first six months of the year to Dollars 60.01bn, a 5.1 per cent
increase from the 1993 period. In May the surplus fell for the first time in
six months.
Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the US rose by 14 per cent to
Dollars 24.56bn in the opening six months - or by 43 per cent in June alone
 -driven by the expanding US economy's appetite for foreign goods.
'The figures reflect the economic strength of the US and Asia, driving up
exports there. What is missing is a recovery in Japan,' said Mr Jim Vestal,
chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
Japan's demand for imports grew by 8.3 per cent in June, or an underlying 11
per cent after adjusting for a fall in oil prices, a slight slowdown on
previous months. Over the first six months, imports rose by 7.6 per cent.
This is slightly higher than exports, at 6.8 per cent.
The renewed surge in the yen, dating from the last week in June, has led
some analysts to doubt that the economy will grow enough in the second half
to bring the sharp drop in the surplus they were forecasting.
The government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday recognised that the
recent spurt in the yen's value casts a shadow over recent improvements in
corporate earnings and business sentiment. 'If it had not been for the
appreciation of the yen, the Japanese economy would have been close to a
state of bottoming out,' an official said.
Private sector economists believe that recovery would be stifled if the yen
rose to Y90 to the dollar, but that growth would be possible at Y100. The
yen fell slightly against the US currency in Tokyo yesterday, from Y98.19 to
Y98.30 to the dollar.
The latest bankruptcy figures indicate that the health of smaller companies
continues to be fragile. Debts of bankrupt companies fell by 12.7 per cent
in the opening six months of this year, but the number of corporate
collapses still increased by 1.5 per cent to 6,925, according to Teikoku
Databank, a credit research agency. Within that, a record 63.2 per cent of
bankruptcies were directly caused by poor economic conditions.
Separately, Tokyo department stores yesterday reported that sales fell by an
annual 3.4 per cent in June, an improvement on May but still the 28th month
of decline.

FT  16 JUL 94 / N Korea 'poses threat to region'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Defence Agency yesterday warned that North Korea's weapons programme
was 'a serious destabilising factor' in east Asian security.
North Korea's suspected plans for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
posed an increasingly grave threat to Japan and the region, warned the
agency, Japan's equivalent of a defence ministry, in its annual white paper.
This normally routine exercise in informing the public of the current state
of defence policy has extra significance this year as the Japanese
government is putting the finishing touches to a long-term overhaul of
defence policy, due next month, in which reductions in grounds troops are
envisaged. Understandably, the agency wishes to head off any drastic
decrease in its strength.
'Defence strength is not something that can be arranged overnight,' the
white paper said. The study was prepared before the death of President Kim
Il-sung, the former North Korean leader.
Mr Hirotsu Ota, a Defence Agency adviser, said there were no contingency
plans in the event of an attack by North Korea, but that measures would be
considered if Pyongyang went ahead with its missile plans.
North Korea would soon complete its Rodong-1 missile, whose range of 1,000km
put most of Japan within reach, the paper said. Even longer range missiles
were on the way, it warned.
Despite the end of the cold war the agency expressed caution about the
240,000 Russian troops stationed in the far east. Their future was
uncertain, linked to 'political and economic instability in Russia'.
The agency said Japanese forces were capable of defending Japan against a
small attack and holding off a large assault until the deployment of US
forces, under the US-Japan security treaty.

<TEXT>
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister and vice-premier, reacted coolly
yesterday to a suggestion by Mr Alistair Goodlad, British Foreign Office
minister, that the two countries put behind them past disputes over Hong
Kong's political reform and co-operate on other issues concerning the
territory, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Mr Qian also gave the impression of turning down a proposal by Britain's
foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, that they should have an exchange of
visits.
Mr Goodlad told reporters in Beijing yesterday that he had had a long
discussion on Hong Kong issues with Mr Qian's deputy, Mr Jiang Enzhu.
'I emphasised the need to put our past disagreements on constitutional
matters behind us and to work together on the important agenda of issues
that have to be addressed in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty in
the interests of building up the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,' Mr
Goodlad said.
Two hours later as Mr Goodlad was meeting Mr Qian, the Chinese foreign
minister broke custom by answering two questions from a Hong Kong reporter
about Mr Goodlad's remark. Mr Qian was asked whether China had said that, in
the absence of political co-operation, there could be co-operation on other
Hong Kong issues. Mr Qian said: 'We did not say things to that effect. If
there is to be co-operation there should be comprehensive co-operation in
all areas.' Asked about prospects for his talks with Mr Goodlad, Mr Qian
laughed and said he could not answer this when they had only just met.
Later the official Xinhua news service reported Mr Goodlad gave Mr Qian a
message from Mr Hurd proposing an exchange of visits or a meeting between
the two. Mr Qian reportedly replied 'what could be agreed on at present' was
that they should meet when they were both in New York for a UN General
Assembly meeting this year.
A possible reason for his coolness is that the Chinese took umbrage at
receiving a public sermon on the need to co-operate over Hong Kong.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of Construction is proposing to build an underground cable
box network that would be able to house fibre optic cable for the country's
planned information superhighway, the ministry said.
The project, estimated to cost Y40,000bn (Pounds 260bn), would be entirely
financed by public funds.
The ministry hopes to present a bill to the next regular session of the
Diet, the Japanese parliament. It hopes that the bill will be approved by
the end of the present fiscal year and that construction work will start by
fiscal 1995.
Japanese politicians and bureaucrats alike have been keen to promote
construction of an information superhighway along the lines of the national
information infrastructure promoted by Vice-President Al Gore in the US.
They have also recognised that multimedia could provide much needed new
businesses to promote future economic growth. The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, for example, believes multimedia markets will be worth
Y123,000bn by 2010.
The Japanese authorities are also concerned that Japan has lagged behind the
US in moving towards an advanced information society and have put
considerable efforts into catching up with the US.
Under the Construction Ministry's plan, the network would contain telephone
lines as well, enabling existing above-ground telephone poles to be
gradually abolished. The ministry hopes the bulk of the work can be
completed by 2020.
Telecommunications operators wanting to provide services using fibre optic
cable would be able to do so as long as they laid the cable in the box
network.
NTT, Japan's major domestic telecommunications company, has already laid
over 85,000km of fibre optic cable throughout Japan and plans to bring fibre
to homes by 2015.
The company has recently been moving aggressively to position itself as a
leading supplier of multimedia services by linking up with US companies
involved in multimedia.
Most recently it announced an agreement with Microsoft of the US, the
leading software company, to develop an interactive multimedia system.
However, the Construction Ministry's plan would, if realised, also provide
new entrants into the multimedia business an option of using a network that
is not under the control of a would-be competitor.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Japanese paper companies and a Japanese executive agreed to plead
guilty and have been fined more than Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) for anti-trust
activity, the US Justice Department said, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Mitsubishi, the Japanese trading house, its US arm Mitsubishi International,
Kanzaki Specialty Papers, a subsidiary of Japan's New Oji Paper, and a
former president of Kanzaki, are charged with conspiring to fix the prices
of thermal fax paper in the US market in 1991 and 1992. The charge followed
a two-year investigation by US and Canadian authorities.
Mitsubishi exported Dollars 5m of thermal fax paper to the US while Kanzaki,
which manufactures the paper in the US, made Dollars 40m in sales in the
Dollars 120m-a-year US market.
The anti-trust activity raised the price of thermal fax paper in the US
market by about 10 per cent, according to the Justice Department.
Of the fines, Kanzaki is to pay Dollars 4.5m in the US and CDollars 950,000
(Pounds 444,000) in Canada. Its former president will pay Dollars 165,000.
Mitsubishi will pay Dollars 1.26m, and its US subsidiary Dollars 540,000.

The BBC said yesterday it would spend Pounds 30m on a new relay station in
Thailand to improve reception of its World Service radio programmes in Asia.
The relay station, comprising four 250-kilowatt transmitters, will carry
broadcasts in up to ten languages and improve reception for more than 45 per
cent of the world's population, the BBC said. BBC radio signals are weak in
parts of Asia, and a growing number of Asians get news from television. Mr
Prasong Soonsiri, Thai foreign minister, signed an agreement for the relay
station with British diplomats in Bangkok yesterday. The transmitters should
start broadcasting before the end of 1996 and be fully operational by
mid-1997.

Taiwan has relaxed restrictions on the establishment of offshore banking
units (OBUs) in a bid to attract more operations and to help promote
syndicated loan business in the local market. Foreign banks can now apply to
set up an OBU without first having established a branch in Taiwan, an
official at the finance ministry's bureau of monetary affairs said
yesterday. Applicants need not be among the world's top 500 financial
institutions as before. 'They only need to prove they have prudential
management, a good business plan and the means to operate in Taiwan,' the
official said. The minimum capitalisation requirement has yet to be decided,
but will probably be NTDollars 80m (Pounds 1.9m). Taiwan currently has 38
OBUs, 19 of them run by foreign banks.

The German government is to lose its top international financial negotiator,
Mr Gert Haller, state secretary in the Finance Ministry, to the private
sector next year. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday that
Mr Haller - who acts as the 'sherpa' for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the
preparation of the Group of Seven world economic summits, and is the German
government representative on the EU monetary committee - is to join the
private Wustenrot building society and banking group as joint chief
executive from next January.
Mr Haller, 50, has been state secretary only since August last year, when Mr
Horst Kohler, his predecessor, resigned to become president of the German
savings banks association. Mr Waigel said Mr Haller had taken his decision
for personal reasons. He insisted there had not been 'any hint of a
disagreement' with him.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial production in the US rose 0.5 per cent between May and June - but
the increase mostly reflected greater use of electricity with unseasonably
hot weather. Excluding utilities, production rose 0.1 per cent from May, the
Federal Reserve said. Overall production was 5.8 per cent higher than in
June last year, having risen for 13 consecutive months. But the pace of
growth has ebbed in recent months.
Industrial output grew at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent during the second
quarter as a whole, against 8.3 per cent in the first quarter. This mainly
reflected a slowing down in car production, partly caused by capacity
constraints. There were wide variations in the performance of different
sectors. Production of business equipment rose 0.6 per cent from May, but
output of construction supplies rose only 0.2 per cent. Mining output fell
0.5 per cent. The overall industrial operating rate rose 0.3 percentage
points to 83.9 per cent last month, its highest level in five years.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a three-year framework
agreement with Poland that could result in up to Ecu1bn (Pounds 789m)in
loans from the bank for infrastructural projects aimed at integrating the
country with the European Union. Mr Wolfgang Roth, a deputy head of the
bank, says that the agreement marks a shift in thinking about Poland at the
EIB. Instead of treating Poland as a 'post-communist country building a
market economy' it is now viewed as a 'prospective member of the European
Union'.
According to Mr Roth, the EIB is prepared to lend around Ecu3bn to central
and eastern European countries over the next three years, with about a third
going to Poland. The highway building programme in Poland would be a prime
candidate for loans.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission bowed to political pressure from Germany yesterday
when it proposed to increase restrictions on export of beef from Britain
because of the threat of bovine spongiform encephalitis, or 'mad cow'
disease.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, proposed to limit exports of
British beef in carcase form to herds which have been free of the disease
for six years rather than the current two years. This would not affect sales
of boneless meat. Mr Steichen said he based his suggestion on scientific
advice offered by the Commission's veterinary committee. The commissioner's
draft is being referred back to the committee, which must accept his
proposal before it can be formally adopted.
The BSE problem is due to be discussed at a meeting of European Union
agriculture ministers on Monday. Germany has been threatening a unilateral
ban on British beef imports if the Commission does not tighten up
restrictions. But the British government believes it is time to start easing
the curbs placed on the beef trade since the outbreak of BSE six years ago.
It cites the sharp decline in the number of cases of BSE - a 23 per cent
drop in the number of cases in the first six months of the year - as
evidence that the disease is under control.

Germany to build a minivan assembly plant in Portugal.
Matra-Hachette, which builds Espace minivans for French car maker Renault,
argued that the Ford-VW joint venture should not have been cleared under
European Union competition rules because its capacity of 190,000 units a
year will dominate the EU market. Rejecting the complaint, the court ruled
that Matra-Hachette did not provide sufficient proof of its claim. The court
last year rejected another action brought by Matra-Hachette against an EU
decision to approve subsidies to the Ford-VW plant.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Cardoso's presidential hopes boosted by Real
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's presidential candidate and former
finance minister, appears to have significantly closed the gap on his main
rival since the introduction of the country's new currency, the Real, this
month.
Mr Cardoso negotiated the Real and other economic measures through Congress
before resigning to run for president. He needs the new currency to be seen
as effective in reducing inflation if he is to catch the front runner,
left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Before the currency was launched,
Mr da Silva led Mr Cardoso by 41 per cent to 19 per cent in opinion polls.
But a poll released yesterday, and conducted after the new currency's
introduction, showed Mr da Silva's support for the October election falling
to 34 per cent and Mr Cardoso's rising to 25 per cent. More important, the
Datafolha poll showed the two level on 43 per cent for the second round
run-off.
The findings backed up polls conducted before the new currency had time to
take effect, which suggested a swing to Mr Cardoso. The stock market, which
fears Mr da Silva would prevent liberalisation of Brazil's economy, gained
more than 2 per cent in early trading yesterday. This followed a near 5 per
cent increase on Thursday after another poll suggested Mr Cardoso had gained
ground in the populous state of Minas Gerais.
Mr da Silva and his Workers' party (PT) played down the poll's significance
and pointed out that Mr Cardoso was still behind in every state. Mr da Silva
has had a difficult week, fighting off corruption allegations against his
running mate Jose Paulo Bisol. The press claims may not matter in terms of
votes, but denial of them has taken up valuable campaigning time.
The latest poll also showed a sharp fall in opposition to the new currency.
The proportion of people believing themselves worse off because of its
introduction has more than halved to 20 per cent, while 67 per cent of
people said the currency was good for Brazil.
Inflation is expected to fall to a single figure this month. This compares
with an inflation rate of 50 per cent in June under the old currency, the
cruzeiro real.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Colosio's assassin 'acted alone'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The special prosecutor investigating the assassination of Mexican ruling
party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio has presented his final
report on the killing - and then promptly resigned as a public outcry
condemned his conclusions as insufficient and unbelievable.
The prosecutor, Mr Miguel Montes, said in his final report, which was
expected to close the case, that Mario Aburto, the confessed assassin, acted
alone when he shot Mr Colosio during a campaign rally last March in Tijuana.
This contradicted his preliminary report, which claimed that Aburto was part
of a conspiracy that included Tijuana members of Mr Colosio's own
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI).
Reaction to the new theory was swift and harsh. All leading political
parties, deep into their campaigns, criticised the report, with the
opposition claiming it was an attempt to close the case without scandal
before the presidential elections on August 21.
Public opinion polls show that Mexicans overwhelmingly believe that Aburto
did not act alone and that the government is unwilling or unable to find the
intellectual authors of the assassination.
In announcing Mr Montes' resignation, President Carlos Salinas stressed that
the case had not been closed. Instead, he said Mr Montes' replacement, Mr
Olga Islas de Gonzalez, would specifically look into whether Aburto acted on
orders of others.
Mr Salinas also set up a commission to review Mr Montes' work, the fourth
such panel the president has created in as many months in an attempt to give
the government investigation some credibility.
The lawyer representing Mr Colosio's widow Diana Laura in the investigation,
Mr Juan Velasquez, welcomed the resignation. 'A complete revision of the
case should be done to remedy the deficiencies of the investigation. . .
which were to produce absolutely subjective conclusions,' Mr Velasquez said.
He called Mr Montes' final report 'ridiculous'.
Mr Colosio's substitute as the ruling party presidential nominee, Mr Ernesto
Zedillo, also criticised Mr Montes' findings, even though a lone gunman
theory saves the PRI from suspicion that it participated in the
assassination. But most political analysts agree that Mr Zedillo simply
could not support an investigation that had lost its credibility.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Arab-Israeli peace process gathered pace yesterday as the US announced
the first public summit between the Israeli and Jordanian leaders and as
Israel made substantial overtures to Syria on the eve of a Middle East peace
shuttle by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
President Bill Clinton said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, would
meet King Hussein of Jordan in Washington on July 25. The two neighbouring
states have technically been at war since 1948.
The announcement, confirmed by Mr Rabin's office, came after Mr Shimon
Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the Jewish state recognised the
sovereignty of Syria over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Mr Peres made
the remarks in an apparent attempt to break the deadlock in talks before Mr
Christopher arrived in the region on his third shuttle this year.
Taken together, the two moves represent a significant further step in
Arab-Israeli negotiations. Mr Clinton said the summit would be 'another step
toward the achievement of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle
East'.
The US plans to lay on a full ceremonial fanfare for the occasion. Mr
Clinton said that in addition to their meeting, Mr Rabin and King Hussein
would be invited to address a joint session of Congress. They will also
attend a formal dinner at the White House.
In Israel the Rabin-Hussein meeting is expected to bolster both the
government and public support for the peace process.
The summit will be seen as one of the first concrete benefits from peace
talks with Palestinians and a step to ending Israel's regional isolation
despite a 13-year-old 'cold peace' with Egypt.
For Jordan the move marks the determination of King Hussein not to be left
out of the unfolding Middle East peace process and to press Jordan's
interests ahead of wider Arab co-ordination, particularly with Syria.
As an inducement to Jordan to move ahead in its peace talks with Israel, the
US is discussing possible debt relief measures as well as the supply of new
military equipment.
The announcement of the Rabin-Hussein summit came after Jordanian and
Israeli officials ended technical talks yesterday to prepare for formal
negotiations next Monday. The preparatory talks also laid the groundwork for
a meeting in Jordan on Wednesday between Mr Christopher, Mr Peres and the
Jordanian foreign minister to focus on economic relations and regional
integration projects.
Progress in peace talks between Israel and Jordan will marginalise Damascus
and put pressure on Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to compromise in talks
over the Golan Heights. Israeli officials said yesterday that Mr Peres'
acceptance of Syrian sovereignty over the Heights marked a 'far-reaching'
concession to Damascus. Israel annexed the strategic plateau in 1981.
They said Mr Peres had attempted to offer a ground-breaking opening in the
talks which have been stalled by Israeli refusal to say how much land it
would return and Damascus' refusal to specify whether it would agree to a
full peace including open borders, trade and embassies.
Mr Christopher will also meet Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, to review the implementation of the Israel-PLO
peace agreement. He said he would discuss 'the steps that I feel he must
undertake to establish the accountability necessary to reassure the donor
community'.
Mr Clinton said the Rabin-Hussein meeting was 'another step' on the long
road to an era of Middle East peace. 'I will do everything I can to make
sure the peoples of the region realise the blessings of peace that have been
denied too long to them.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / SPD, Greens agree risky coalition deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday agreed a minority coalition with
the left-wing Green party in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, a
risky venture whose survival depends on the support of the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the successor to the East German Communist party.
The coalition has been seized on by the SPD as a chance to prove that it is
serious about government. It also provides further evidence that the SPD may
agree to work with the Green party to secure a majority after the October
federal parliamentary elections. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, has
denied all such suggestions, but leading members of his party have argued
that a pre-election commitment to a so-called red-green coalition will
secure a larger majority for the two parties.
Meanwhile the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its more right-wing
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been falling
over themselves to present the arrangement with the former communists in
Saxony-Anhalt as ultimate treachery.
The SPD have fired back, pointing out that the CDU has agreed countless
coalitions with the PDS at local council level in eastern Germany and is
hypocritical to suggest that arrangements at state level are any different.
The two would-be coalition partners yesterday presented a 70-page document,
negotiated over the last 10 days, which outlines the coalition agreement.
The SPD will have six ministers, the Greens will take over the Environment
Ministry, and independent technocrats are being sought for the three
remaining posts.
'The longest road starts with the first step,' was the cautious verdict with
which Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD state premier designate, greeted the
landmark decision. He is likely to be elected premier on July 21.
Only days before the election on June 26, Mr Hoppner said he would not
consider any deals with the PDS, preferring instead a so-called grand
coalition with the CDU, which has 36 seats in the state parliament, one more
than the SPD.
However, a day after the election victory the SPD leadership in Bonn were
able to convince Mr Hoppner that a coalition with the Greens, who have five
seats, and horse-trading with the 21-seat PDS, however risky, was the only
chance the SPD had of proving that it was determined to win the October
elections.
Recent opinion polls have seen the SPD lose its earlier lead over the CDU
and many observers suggest the party will be hard pushed to recover lost
ground before the October elections.
The PDS has achieved impressive returns in state and communal elections in
eastern Germany, backed by voters angry about economic reforms, and it is
likely to manage to get back into the Bundestag, or lower house of
parliament, in the October elections.
Leading politicians in Thuringia, which neighbours Saxony-Anhalt to the
south and is still a bastion of CDU support, sought to play down the
spill-over effect of the red-green coalition. They argued that the differing
economic and political development of the five eastern states meant it was
unlikely the Saxony-Anhalt coalition would be duplicated.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Berlusconi's long run of luck hit by dispute: Resignation of
magistrates will embarrass Italy's PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the shadow of Italy's participation in the World Cup final, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, has become involved in a dangerous
confrontation between the executive and the judiciary.
The disagreement centres on a decree that drastically reduces the scope of
investigating magistrates to use preventive detention of those suspected in
cases of corruption.
The outcome could for the first time dent Mr Berlusconi's remarkable run of
popularity since he took office two months ago. The institutional conflict
also risks causing sharp divisions among Mr Berlusconi's allies in his
right-wing coalition. At the same time it could side-track the government's
attention from formulating economic policy with the budget plans promised
next Thursday.
The decree, signed into force late on Wednesday by President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, permits some 2,000 people under preventive detention to leave
prison. If it had existed 2 1/2 years ago, before the anti-corruption
investigations, none of the more than 600 accused of various crimes would
have entered prison. They would at best have been confined to house arrest.
The restriction on the powers of arrest was however only one of the reasons
behind Thursday's resignations of the anti-corruption team of Milan
magistrates led by Mr Antonio Di Pietro. They claimed the decree was
deliberately intended to curb their investigations - preventive detention
being necessary to stop tampering with evidence and people fleeing from
justice.
While there is considerable public sympathy for the government's move to end
what was seen as often arbitrary use of arrest, the government will not find
it easy to justify its tactics. A decree with immediate effect, which then
has to be cleared by parliament within 90 days, appeared an overhasty means
of dealing with an issue that was not top of the agenda.
Indeed, it could only be considered an immediate priority if the government
feared the magistrates might be about to make more high-profile arrests
affecting its supporters. This has been much rumoured in recent days,
following the breaking of a corruption ring among the Guardia di Finanza,
the financial police, that allegedly condoned tax evasion on a huge scale.
Mr Berlusconi also has much explaining about conflict of interest to do,
because the Milan magistrates who have resigned were investigating the prime
minister's Fininvest empire. The issue of arrest directly affected Mr
Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm, and
a close colleague of Mr Berlusconi. He has challenged an arrest warrant in
the courts.
Already government ministers are suggesting the decree can be altered in
parliament - especially that part saying crimes such as corruption against
the state do not warrant preventive detention. But Mr Berlusconi is unlikely
to alter the substance of the decree.
He recognises that Mr Di Pietro is one of the most popular figures in Italy,
as a result of his work unmasking corrupt politicians and businessmen. But
he also has opinion polls which indicate the public is no longer so
interested as before in the corruption issue; it was barely raised in the
March general elections.
The public reaction will be crucial, and the generally hostile response of
the press yesterday was perhaps not an accurate measure of opinion. A
compromise is possible, but if none is sought and the public comes behind Mr
Di Pietro, the populist Northern League will be the first to break ranks
within the government. Until now Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, has
been looking for firm ground on which to challenge Mr Berlusconi and reduce
his ever-growing authority.
This could be just such a pretext. Meanwhile Mr Berlusconi, will not make a
move until he sees how Italy fares in the World Cup. He is banking on Italy
winning.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Emu unlikely this century, says Vranitzky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's project for forging economic and monetary union (Emu)
by the end of the century will be 'very hard to fulfil', according to Mr
Franz Vranitzky, the Austrian chancellor.
Speaking during a visit to London this week, Mr Vranitzky took a cautious
line on the prospect of deepening political and monetary integration in the
EU, which Austria is due to join on January 1.
Mr Vranitzky, whose country closely follows Germany in its monetary
policies, said the EU should wait until after 1999 to establish Emu with a
relatively large number of member states. This would avoid the danger of a
'two-track' Europe - a development that would emerge if Emu went ahead with
a smaller group.
He said the 1996 intergovernmental conference planned to review the
Maastricht treaty should discuss 'a new institutional framework' for the EU.
But he indicated the practical consequences might be limited to a stronger
role for the European parliament and 'more flexibility in decision-making'.
Asked whether Austria's neutrality would allow it to join a common European
security arrangement, he confirmed Austria's interest in participating in 'a
system of collective security' but made clear this would not necessarily
entail a commitment to provide troops for any possible EU actions against
'peace-breakers' in foreign conflicts.
Austria would decide 'case by case' whether support for EU security moves
would involve the dispatch of troops or more 'technical' measures  -
logistic support or help with arms supplies.
Mr Vranitzky explained his caution about Emu partly by drawing attention to
problems of 'psychology' in replacing national currencies by a single
European currency. 'Austrians would definitely find it hard to see it (the
schilling) eliminated in a short space of time,' he said.
He added that this sentiment was similar to that seen in Germany and the UK
about the possible replacement of the D-Mark or sterling.
He said establishing a monetary union 'that deserves the description' would
require 'a minimum number of countries' as participants.
'I would prefer a larger number of countries. Otherwise we could arrive at a
kind of two-track integration process, which would not be an optimal
development.'
The number of countries likely to fulfil the Emu economic convergence
criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty was likely to remain rather low
by the end of the century.
As a result, he said, 'I really do think it will be necessary to talk about
monetary union later than 1999.'
Mr Vranitzky made his comments even though the Maastricht treaty rules out
any minimum number of EU states in 1999 as participants in monetary union.
In theory, this means that as few as two or three EU members could launch
Emu from that date, provided they fulfil the convergence criteria.
Austria is one of the few European countries which currently come close to
meeting all the criteria on inflation, interest rates, public sector debt
and budget deficits. Although Austria does not participate in the European
Monetary System, the schilling's central exchange rate against the D-Mark
has remained unchanged since the system started in 1979.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Back from the dead and aiming high: Bundeswehr successes
revive Volker Ruhe's ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They call the German Ministry of Defence the graveyard of political
ambitions. Five postwar defence ministers have been forced to resign
prematurely because of scandal, political failure or ill health. The only
man to survive and rise to greater things was Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former
chancellor.
Few doubt that Mr Volker Ruhe, the pugnacious Christian Democrat politician
who is the current incumbent, would like to emulate Mr Schmidt. He admits
that his fellow Hamburger is a role model, even if he is a Social Democrat.
And he has certainly proved he is a survivor.
Less than two years ago, Mr Ruhe's political career seemed to be in tatters.
Touted in the media as a possible heir to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he stood
at the party conference of the Christian Democratic Union to become one of
Mr Kohl's five deputy chairmen - and suffered the humiliation of coming
sixth, at the bottom of the poll.
It was a brutal setback for an ambitious politician, and one which caused
the chancellor no loss of sleep. For Mr Ruhe had allowed his ambitions to
become too obvious.
He was suspected of plotting for a future grand coalition with the Social
Democrats, and Mr Kohl suffers no rivals gladly. Ever since that day at the
Dusseldorf party conference, Mr Ruhe's star has been on the wane.
Yet this week he was still very much in office, exuding his old
self-confidence, having just pulled off a remarkable hat-trick. He had seen
the constitutional court give the green light for Germany's military forces,
the Bundeswehr, to serve on peacekeeping expeditions anywhere in the world;
he had persuaded the leaders of all three parties in the ruling coalition to
accept his controversial plans to slim the military to just 340,000 men, and
cut conscription from 12 to 10 months; and he had emerged from the latest
budget round with his expenditure virtually intact, after two years of
spending cuts.
On the face of it, it was no mean feat. And yet practically nobody in Bonn
is prepared to give Mr Ruhe the credit for it. For his success, above all in
winning the battle in the constitutional court, has a fatal flaw. It means
that the Bundeswehr is being given a role in the modern, post-cold war world
 -the chance to participate in international peacekeeping - at precisely the
moment when, largely thanks to Mr Ruhe's previous cuts, its morale is at
rock-bottom and its operational capacity is overstretched.
From the moment he took over the office, little more than two years ago, at
49, Mr Ruhe has been campaigning for the Bundeswehr to be allowed to serve
outside the Nato area. First, he tried to negotiate a deal with the Social
Democrats to change the German constitution. When that failed, he embarked
on a policy of deliberately sending men in uniform out-of-area, tempting his
opponents to launch a constitutional challenge.
He sent military doctors to support the UN in Cambodia. He sent military
observers in uniform to the former Soviet Union, and he allowed German air
crews to fly Awacs airborne reconnaissance missions to police the no-fly
zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina. He sent a German frigate to the Adriatic to
help enforce the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia. And he dispatched 1,700
men to Somalia to provide logistical support for UN blue berets.
The opposition rose to the bait, and ran to the constitutional court in
Karlsruhe to demand clarification. And this week the court gave its
blessing, with the proviso that the German Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, must normally sanction every mission. The government agreed
yesterday to summon a special session next week, to give retrospective
approval to the Awacs and Adriatic exercises.
But if Mr Ruhe deserves a share of the credit for the court decision, his
reputation on all other questions in Germany's defence community is mud.
'Even a Green minister of defence (committed to abolishing the armed forces)
would be better than Volker Ruhe,' one defence analyst said yesterday. 'He
doesn't give a damn about the Bundeswehr. He has systematically destroyed
the armed forces in a way which is without precedent.'
All the evidence suggests that morale in the Bundeswehr is plumbing new
depths. Parliament's ombudsman for the armed forces, Mr Alfred Biehle, said
in his last annual report that constant changes or cancellations in budget
commitments and structural decisions had 'shattered the credibility and
leadership ability of the political and military commanders'.
Mr Ruhe's first problem was that he never made any secret of where he wanted
to be: in the Foreign Ministry. And he has used his present position to gain
political popularity and profile with that end in mind.
From the beginning, he decided that the most popular political move would be
to reap the 'peace dividend' from the end of the cold war - by cutting his
own budget. First he tried to axe the Eurofighter, only to discover that his
partners - Britain, Italy and Spain - were not prepared to agree. So he had
to settle for a superficial redesign of the aircraft, which will almost
certainly end up costing more, not less.
His next mistake was to try to be too active in volunteering big cuts in his
own defence budget.
'Instead of asking the budget committee for more than he needed, and then
negotiating down to a sensible compromise, he actually offered them bigger
cuts than they were contemplating,' according to an impartial observer. 'The
budget committee simply wasn't prepared to give up its job, so it cut him
still more.' Real defence spending last year was reduced by some 28 per
cent. This year's budget freeze amounts to a token reprieve.
'Nobody would dispute that the Bundeswehr needs to be smaller,' a military
attache said. 'The budget is no longer enough to support 370,000 men.'
Yet from Mr Ruhe's point of view, that is still a success: he has reaped the
peace dividend. The cut in conscription also seems certain to be popular
with young voters and their families. He is determined to prove the
soothsayers wrong, and demonstrate that there is a political life in Bonn
after the Ministry of Defence.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Russia pinpoints revenue loss: Health services abuse funds,
regions fail to pay taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Glaring abuses of state funds by health services and the withholding of
taxes by a handful of big Russian regions were singled out yesterday as
reasons for Russia's inability to honour expenditure commitments.
A Finance Ministry report presented at a cabinet meeting to review the state
of the economy said the government had simply slashed expenditure to make up
for the failure to collect 40 per cent of tax receipts in the first half of
this year. That figure in itself is encouraging given the fact that only 30
per cent of taxes were collected in the first quarter of 1994.
One example of abuses of funds the government identified was that of medical
institutions which had spent the money not on health care but on financing
private business activities or buying cars instead of medical equipment.
Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, two semi-independent republics within the
Russian Federation, were the biggest non-payers of taxes among the regions,
together withholding more than Rbs400bn, compared to the budget's total
projected revenues of Rbs124,000bn.
The credibility of the government's own promises to combine reforms with a
fight against abuses has come into question following its recent decision
not to abolish quotas on oil exports as promised from July 1. This crucial
foreign trade reform, which would have increased tax revenues and removed a
big source of corruption, was postponed until at least January 1995 without
explanation.
But reformers within the government and the president's administration blame
the government's vulnerability to powerful vested interests, including the
handful of companies currently enjoying exclusive export rights and those of
officials who receive bribes in return for the allocation of quotas.
'This was too juicy a morsel to give up for certain interest groups,'
explains Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Boris
Yeltsin.
At yesterday's meeting - missed by Mr Yeltsin, who was said to be suffering
from a cold - Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin trumpeted the government's
achievement in driving inflation down to 6 per cent in June, although
officials have warned that it is likely to rise to double-digit figures by
the autumn.

FT  16 JUL 94 / WTO decision delayed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday decided to
postpone a formal decision on the future headquarters site of the World
Trade Organisation until next week. But trade diplomats say it is now almost
certain that Geneva will win the day over Bonn, the only other contender.
Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's Gatt ambassador, who is conducting the
consultations on the issue, told a meeting of trade officials yesterday that
four-fifths of delegations had expressed an official view. Other countries
are being given until noon on Monday and delegates will meet again next
Tuesday, when the final decision is expected.
Diplomats reported Mr Szepesi as saying there was a 'clear tendency' towards
one of the candidates. Though he did not say which, the assumption is that
most countries are opting to stay in Geneva, where Gatt now has its
headquarters. The Gatt secretariat is due to be transformed into the WTO on
January 1 next year.
A smiling Mr William Rossier, Swiss ambassador to Gatt, emerged from
yesterday's meeting to say Geneva's chances were 'completely intact'. 'We're
almost there,' said another senior ambassador who favours Geneva.
Some uncertainty remains because neither the US nor Japan has yet
pronounced.
However, France has publicly come out in favour of Geneva, a francophone
city, as have other French-speaking countries. Germany claims the support of
about 20 countries but, with the exception of Belgium, these are mostly
small developing nations.
The contest between Geneva and Bonn has been keenly fought, with both cities
offering multi-million-dollar packages of office accommodation and
diplomatic perks to attract the future WTO.
However, trade diplomats said yesterday that, following big improvements in
the terms and conditions offered by the Swiss, there was nothing to be
gained materially from moving to Bonn, and much to lose.
Other trade officials expressed fears that many Gatt staff would refuse to
move, disrupting the WTO's work.

FT  16 JUL 94 / US bonds limit rise for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its cautious recovery on the London foreign exchange
market yesterday, although it eased slightly against the yen in New York
last night under pressure from weaker US bond prices.
Earlier in the week, the US currency had fallen to fresh lows against both
the yen and the D-Mark after last weekend's decision by the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations not to announce any programme of dollar support.
The improved inflationary outlook in the US, which supported the bond market
on Thursday and early yesterday, spread to the UK, where the Bank of England
announced a long-dated conventional gilt auction after a period of shorter
term, non-conventional funding.
Share prices in the UK were also firmer, with the FT-SE 100 index closing
24.4 points higher at 3,074.8, bringing the total gain for the week to 112.4
points.
After closing in London nearly a pfennig firmer in London against the D-Mark
at DM1.5558, the dollar held its ground in New York trading, where it stood
at DM1.5531 last night. Against the yen, however, the dollar fell in London
to Y97.9050, and eased further to Y97.75 later in New York after a modest
retreat in bond prices. Analysts were sceptical yesterday, though, about
whether the US currency was experiencing anything more than a temporary
correction.
Investor sentiment towards the currency remains bearish.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Berlusconi defends release of corruption suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian authorities yesterday began releasing bribery and corruption
suspects from prison, as a controversial new decree limiting magistrates'
use of preventive detention took effect.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, angrily defended the two-day-old
decree after attacks by opposition politicians, magistrates and the press.
He said in Rome that the decree would 'prevent the country turning into a
police state'.
Italy's best-known investigating magistrates - the Milan-based mani pulite
('clean hands') team - said on Thursday they would resign from the
anti-corruption unit in protest. Magistrates in Genoa yesterday also refused
to handle cases affected by the decree, which bans the use of preventive
detention in bribery and corruption investigations.
It is estimated that the decree could affect up to 2,000 people in
preventive detention. Most of them, including a dozen top Italian executives
for whom arrest warrants were issued on Thursday, will be put under house
arrest instead.
Mr Bettino Craxi, former socialist prime minister under suspicion in a
number of corruption investigations, will also face house arrest, rather
than imprisonment, if he returns from self-imposed exile in Tunisia.
One of the first suspects released yesterday was the wife of Mr Duilio
Poggiolini, a former health ministry official who allegedly received bribes
from six drug companies in exchange for favours. She said she had
experienced 'eight barbaric months' in a Neapolitan prison.
The decree needs parliamentary support to survive and faces a rough ride
from the opposition and from Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, the
regionalist Northern League. The justice and interior ministers both
suggested yesterday that it could be amended.
'We don't issue decrees that are valid for eternity and cannot be
discussed,' said Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister. 'Everything can be
modified, as long as the basis of the decree
is not overturned.'
The prime minister said the decree had his full backing and that of the
whole cabinet.
In a reference to the Milan team, Mr Berlusconi said certain magistrates
'had become stars, and are disappointed if their faces don't appear on
television frequently. What better way to become the centre of attention
than to adopt this or that measure reducing people's liberty and putting
them in prison'?
Mr Antonio Di Pietro has led the two-year crusade against widespread
corruption in Italian business and politics which brought down the previous
regime and prepared the way for Mr Berlusconi to win office in the March
general election.
While Mr Di Pietro's prosecution of suspects in the first of the so-called
Tangentopoli ('Bribesville') trials has been followed by the public on
television, questions have been raised about the magistrates' use of the
media and the threat of detention to shame suspects into confession.

FT  16 JUL 94 / EU leaders choose Santer as the next Brussels president:
Luxembourg PM to succeed Delors despite misgivings of MEPs

<TEXT>
European Union leaders last night settled on Mr Jacques Santer, the prime
minister of Luxembourg, as a compromise choice to succeed Mr Jacques Delors
as president of the European Commission.
Mr Santer, a 57-year-old Christian Democrat, was approved by consensus at a
special summit in Brussels, despite misgivings in the European Parliament
and lingering resentment about the UK veto last month of Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, the Belgian premier and one-time favourite.
At a news conference, Mr Santer stressed that he had not sought the job of
president, but felt obliged to come forward as a compromise candidate. 'Just
because someone comes from a small country, that does not mean they cannot
become a big president,' he said.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a friend of Mr Santer's for 20 years,
said his appointment would not halt the process of European integration laid
down by the Maastricht treaty. 'We see no majority in the EU for stopping or
going back.' Mr John Major, UK prime minister, described Mr Santer as a wise
choice who was committed to free trade, free markets, decentralisation and
enlargement of the Union. 'He is well able to reconcile the conflicting
views around the European table.'
The appointment of the low-profile Luxembourger who has served as prime
minister since 1984 confirms the recent trend toward devolving power from
the Commission in Brussels to the member states - a process underlined by Mr
Kohl who said he did not see a centralised European state emerging in
future.
During his five-year term, Mr Santer will nevertheless have an important
role to play in preparing for the 1996 Maastricht review conference,
consolidating the enlargement of the Union to the Nordic and Alpine states
and laying the groundwork for European monetary union and expansion of
membership to the new democracies of Central Europe.
Mr Santer is the second Luxembourger to rise to the top executive post. Mr
Gaston Thorn, the former prime minister of the Grand Duchy, preceded Mr
Delors between 1980 and 1984. A finance expert, Mr Santer played a useful
role in preparing the 1986 European Single Act and the 1991 Maastricht
treaty.
His elevation marks the end of a dramatic contest to succeed Mr Delors, who
started as a relatively little known international politician, but who
became the driving force behind the Single European Act, the European
Economic Area and the project of the Maastricht treaty to create a single
European currency by the end of the century.
Mr Santer emerged as a compromise after better-known potential candidates
were either blocked or declined to come forward. Germany, which holds the
rotating presidency of the EU, called yesterday's special summit to break
the deadlock and avoid a crisis with the European Parliament, which under
the Maastricht treaty has the power to block the appointment.
Mr Kohl courted leading MEPs before the summit and at the news conference he
stressed on several occasions the importance of the parliament as an
institution alongside the member states and Commission. As a result, MEPs
seem unlikely to exercise a veto at their inaugural session in Strasbourg
next week, but they may complain about the selection process.
Mr Dehaene raised this issue before the summit, criticising the UK veto as
bad for Europe and warning that the EU could not operate on the basis of
vetoes. 'This will certainly leave marks . . . it is not about bilateral or
personal relations, but about the functioning of the Union.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Revenue to open up secret manuals for tax guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is to make public the secret tax manuals used by its
inspectors as the basis for their assessments, as part of the drive for open
government.
The manuals, which provide detailed guidance to inspectors on how to handle
all personal and corporate tax matters, have always been jealously guarded
internal documents.
Their appearance could make a substantial difference to the way taxpayers
and their professional advisers plan their tax affairs.
The Revenue confirmed yesterday that it would publish the manuals, but said
the details were still being finalised.
A timetable for publication had still to be decided, the Revenue said. It is
believed that the manuals will be made public over the next two years as the
existing editions are revised.
The move comes in the wake of the code of practice on government information
which became effective in April. It requires departments to publish
information, give reasons for administrative decisions and respond to
requests for information.
Tax professionals yesterday welcomed the decision. Some, however, expressed
scepticism over whether the most sensitive information on the interpretation
of tax and tactical advice to inspectors would be disclosed.
The Revenue said it would reserve the right to withhold information it
considered to be prejudicial to the administration or collection of tax, in
line with special exemptions to the code.
Information likely to be withheld includes legal opinions commissioned
internally, advice provided by officials to ministers and details of tax
avoidance and evasion schemes which come to its notice.
Previously, some out-of-date copies of the inspectors' manuals have found
their way into the offices of the larger accountancy firms, generally when
they have hired ex-Revenue officials.
Mr Roger White, head of tax at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'This is
undoubtedly a major step in the right direction.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Siemens gains stake in Thai rail contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture of Germany's Siemens group and Italian-Thai Development, the
leading Thai construction company, was yesterday awarded a turnkey contract
worth Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 705m) - excluding financing costs - to build
what is expected to be Bangkok's first urban rail system.
The consortium signed the agreement with Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC),
a subsidiary of Thailand's Tanayong property group. Tanayong has a 30-year
concession to build and operate two elevated rail lines with a total length
of 24km.
Bangkok has no mass transit network for its citizens other than buses, and
the city's traffic jams are notorious. But like all big transport projects
in the capital, BTSC's planned railway has been dogged by delays and
controversy. Successive governments have failed to cater to Bangkok's
transport needs or to reconcile conflicts between rival projects.
Financing for the BTSC project from Deutsche Bank, KfW, the International
Finance Corp and other lenders has yet to be finalised, and BTSC says the
conditional offer of a financing package from the German-Thai consortium
will expire at the end of August if negotiations are not completed.
But the project was given a boost this week when Mr Chatri Sophonpanich,
executive chairman of Bangkok Bank, South-East Asia's largest bank,
announced his support.
Mr Chatri's sister, Chodchoy, has spearheaded a protest against the elevated
railway on environmental grounds, although BTSC's supporters say the streets
of Bangkok are already so unattractive and polluted that the project will
not make much difference and may even reduce air pollution as the trains are
electrically powered.
Mr Wolfram Martinsen, president of Siemens Transportation Systems Group,
said just under half of the contract value would go to Italthai for civil
works, with the rest going to Siemens for the rolling stock, power supply
and other items. Trains would be provided by Siemens' subsidiary Duewag.
BTSC says the system, with 25 stations and 102 carriages in three-carriage
sets, will be able to carry 700,000 passengers a day.
'The elevated system will provide travellers with a new and exciting view of
Bangkok while carrying them above the traffic jams and floods which daily
waste our resources and drain the travelling public's energy,' said Mr Anat
Arbhabhirama, BTSC president.

units
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece is to privatise a minority stake in subsidiaries belonging to the
state-owned Public Petroleum Corporation (DEP), Reuter reports from Athens.
'The government has decided to float a minority share in subsidiaries of DEP
via the stock exchange without transferring strategic decisions to private
individuals,' said Mr Andreas Papandreou, prime minister.
Earlier this year Mr Manolis Daskalakis, DEP's managing director, said
between 20 and 25 per cent of EKO refinery and Hellenic Aspropyrgos Refinery
(ELDA) would be floated on stock markets in Greece and abroad, including New
York.
The part-sales, which would also include an unspecified percentage of DEP
itself, would begin by early 1995, Mr Daskalakis said. DEP's 1993 pre-tax
profits were Dr25.1bn (Dollars 108.2m) and the company is expected to top
Dr30bn this year.
Greece's socialist government, which came to power last October, has said it
is willing to float minority stakes in state companies but will retain
management of the enterprises.
A 25 per cent stake in Greek Telecommunications is scheduled to be floated
on to the stock market.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan invests heavily abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas investment by Taiwanese companies rose rapidly in the first half of
this year. The government approved Dollars 936.3m in investments by local
companies in countries other than China during the first six months of this
year, a 54 per cent jump from the Dollars 606.8m (Pounds 399m) recorded in
1993.
But January-June approvals for investment in China were sharply lower,
amounting to only Dollars 434.7m against Dollars 3.6bn for 1993, according
to the economic ministry's investment commission. Analysts attributed the
steep decline to China's economic clampdown imposed last year and tensions
generated by the March 31 killings of 24 Taiwanese on a pleasure boat tour.
It was also noted that China had largely discarded the preferential
treatment accorded to Taiwan companies in the form of tax breaks and other
incentives.
Meanwhile, government-approved inward investment in the first half climbed
49 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 639.1m. The petrochemical, food
and services sectors recorded the largest gains.
Analysts cautioned that the outward investment figures were an indicator of
investment interest by private-sector Taiwan companies but were skewed
because they do not include the substantial offshore activities of state-run
companies.
This makes it is difficult to discern the true impact of the government's
'Go South' policy launched last year to encourage Taiwan companies to steer
their investment plans away from China and its vagaries toward other
countries in the region.
South-East Asian countries continued to be a magnet for Taiwanese cash, with
Malaysia topping the list at Dollars 101.5m, up from Dollars 42.2m during
the first six months of last year. The commission approved investments of
Dollars 39.1m in Thailand, versus Dollars 19.2m in 1993.
An important beneficiaries of Taiwanese investment is Europe, officials
said, via the British Virgin Islands, from which Taiwanese may invest in the
EC tax-free. Investment in the 'other areas' category hit Dollars 637.9m in
the first half, up from Dollars 120.9m in 1993.
Parliamentary clearance for Taiwan's fourth nuclear power station has opened
the way for the government to award the Dollars 2.2bn contract for the
nuclear reactor.
Three international concerns - Swiss-Swedish concern ABB via its US arm
Combustion Engineering; France's state-run Framatome; and US firm
Westinghouse in partnership with public utility Nuclear Electric of the UK -
are vying for the project. A final selection is expected in August or
September.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Berlusconi economic plan given cautious approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italy's business community has given a cautious but positive response to the
first broad outlines of the Berlusconi government's economic policy.
The Milan bourse yesterday rose more than 2 per cent after the government's
decision on Wednesday to ease tax assessment procedures and introduce the
principle of a pardon on certain types of property development carried out
without proper permission. These are intended to be the two main vehicles to
raise an extra L5,000bn (Dollars 3.2bn) this year to keep the 1994 budget
deficit to L159,000bn as planned. But there will also be a spill-over effect
from these measures into 1995.
Economists yesterday preferred to withhold judgment on the policy outlines
until next Thursday when the government is due to unveil details of its 1995
budget.
The government has merely said it intends to reduce next year's budget
deficit to L140,000bn, below 10 per cent of gross domestic product. This
will be done by finding L40,000bn in spending cuts and new taxes - but not
by an increase in fiscal pressure. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, has
made it clear again this week he will not raise the overall level of
taxation which he regards as already too high.
Mr Lamberto Dini, treasury minister, said in unveiling his plans that the
government would be relying largely on holding down the increase in current
expenditure to 2.5 per cent in 1995. Continued disagreement over the nature
of spending cuts, especially in the health and pensions field, are still
delaying finalisation of the economic programme.
Indeed, the government had originally promised to reveal the outline
macroeconomic plan before last week's Group of Seven summit in Naples. The
release of the policy outlines on Wednesday was primarily intended to
reassure the financial markets which have become nervous about the
government's failure after two months in office to spell out its economic
policy.
Pushing the 1995 deficit down to L140,000bn signals the government's
awareness of the need for continued surgery on Italy's public finances. But
the debt stock is still only expected to level off in 1996 at 127 per cent
of GDP, double the norm set by the Maastricht treaty.
Despite promises of innovation, the main measures being used to raise extra
funds this year have been much discussed for several years. Previous
governments have shied away from making tax assessments more flexible for
fear they would undermine the system of collection and lead to corruption.
Equally, a pardon on the thousands of properties constructed without proper
permits has not been implemented for fear of endorsing development which has
blighted most city suburbs.
However, the government has recognised these measures will be popular with
its supporters and easy to implement. They also resolve serious outstanding
problems.
A backlog of more than 3.2m tax assessment cases involving L85,000bn has
accumulated as a result of rigid bureaucratic procedures. In return for
payment of a fixed percentage of the sum in dispute (10 per cent of sums
between L2m and L20m) matters can be settled immediately. This is a thinly
disguised tax amnesty, the ninth of its kind in the postwar era.
The illegal building pardon can be seen an attempt to come to terms with the
large number of property alterations and developments carried out without
proper permission often because bureaucratic procedures are so slow. The aim
is to regularise some, but not all.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Turks to protest at austerity measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's austerity programme is coming under growing pressure from labour
groups, with the main union federation calling a day of protest for next
Wednesday and the government facing demands to raise civil servants'
salaries.
The cabinet is today due to announce salary increases for the 1.6m civil
servants. Despite annual inflation running at more than 100 per cent,
economists say Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, will want to keep the
increase to below the 54 per cent projected in the 1994 budget.
Separately, Turk-Is, Turkey's main union federation, representing around
1.2m workers in the public sector, is to stage a day of protest on Wednesday
in the first sign of union opposition to the programme.
Public-sector wage restraint is vital to the success of the government's
fiscal adjustment plan, which envisages halving the public-sector borrowing
requirement to 9 per cent by the end of 1994. The programme, backed by an
International Monetary Fund standby credit of Dollars 742m, assumes a 15 per
cent real wage cut across the economy.
The government has still to pay rises to some 700,000 public-sector workers
under collective bargaining deals signed last year, when it was agreed that
wages would be indexed to inflation. The government wants the unions to
accept rises in line with future inflation, projected to fall sharply to 20
per cent by mid-1995.
'It's daydreaming, of course we will never go for such a proposal,' warns Ms
Seyhan Erdoydu, a Turk-Is official, 'World Bank or OECD projections are one
thing, but the government's own projections are never met.'
The government is hoping to appease union grievances, at least in the public
sector, by introducing unemployment insurance for those made redundant by
privatisation. This reform however, is currently frozen.
In addition to wages, the unions complain about the rise in value added tax,
and the government's failure to fulfil a pledge to provide a right to strike
for civil servants.
However, Mrs Ciller appears to be gambling that the unions, and the Social
Democrats, their allies inside the coalition, will opt to protect jobs
rather than push for higher wages.
In June parliament ratified on second reading the International Labour
Organisation convention on job protection, which the unions believe provides
a legal basis to challenge dismissals.
However, union militancy appears to be waning. Last year saw a sharp fall in
the number of days lost to strikes, with just 38 strikes in the first six
months of 1993 compared with 398 in 1991, according to union figures.
With the government meeting its fiscal targets in the first three months of
the programme, economists believe Mrs Ciller will want to hold the line on
wages, which may give her more room for manoeuvre in the autumn, when
parliamentary and union opposition to the austerity measures is expected to
intensify.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Germans march in Paris as allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since 1944, German armoured cars yesterday rolled down
the Champs Elysees, as part of the new Eurocorps' participation in France's
Bastille Day military parade - and won applause from those in the crowd who
were able to spot their distinctive military crosses.
After the parade, President Francois Mitterrand, who stirred domestic
controversy by inviting German as well as Belgian and Spanish troops, said
he felt 'emotion and joy' at having thus been able to help heal the wounds
of the last war, in which he was taken prisoner, and to point France towards
its future common European defence.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was 'happy to have been able to attend'
yesterday's march-past, adding that it was 'completely normal' that his
soldiers' participation should cause some criticism in France because 'the
traces of history do not disappear immediately'. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior
minister, complained earlier this week that the 50th anniversary of France's
liberation was the wrong moment to invite the Germans.
But in the last year of his presidency, Mr Mitterrand seems to have pulled
off a piece of political symbolism that has won approval, judging by recent
opinion polls, from most French people. The invitation to the Eurocorps, in
which Germans play a big role, is likely to set a precedent from which any
successor may find it hard to depart.
It was at the suggestion of Mr Edouard Balladur, the conservative prime
minister who is a candidate for the Elysee next year, that three Germans
identified with the July 1944 plot against Hitler attended yesterday's
ceremonies. They included Mr Manfred Rommel, mayor of Stuttgart and son of
Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel, the 'Desert Fox' who also commanded German
troops in Normandy and who shot himself after the failure of the July plot.
For Mr Kohl, the presence of German troops in Paris yesterday constitutes a
further step towards 'normalising' his country's military relationship with
its allies, following the legal ruling this week by the German
constitutional court that German troops could join their allies in
conducting peace-keeping operations outside the Nato area.
The 800-strong Eurocorps contingent, a fraction of the 6,000 troops in
yesterday's parade, included troops from Belgium and Spain, which along with
France, Germany and Luxembourg make up the five-nation force.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): PostScript
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fading short-term fortunes are visible pretty well across the whole range of
unit trusts and investment trusts. With markets around the globe turning
dreary to poor in the second quarter of the year, it is very hard to find
unit trusts that have achieved a return of 30 per cent over a year.
Our list three months ago contained dozens of such funds, especially in the
Far East and continental Europe. This time there are only six or seven, led
by Providence Capitol European with an impressive 48.5 per cent.
The much more typical picture is that of a fund which has shown a slightly
negative return over 12 months. All the sector averages for the UK and North
America are in this position - although this is a harsh test, because the
one-year figures bear the full burden of the gap between bid and offer
prices (usually about 6 per cent).
The outlook for the short-term performance numbers during the remainder of
1994 remains poor, because most stock markets around the world were rising
strongly during the third and fourth quarters of 1993. Unless unit prices
make very good progress from here, they will be slipping further and further
behind their year-earlier values.
Does it matter? Not in the sense that unit trusts (and investment trusts,
too) should normally be regarded as long-term investments. Over periods like
five years (and certainly over 10 years) nearly all funds are showing decent
profits.
But short-term timing can still be important. Last year was the biggest year
ever for net sales of unit trusts to investors, at Pounds 9.1bn, and there
was a surge of new investment trust issues, too, amounting to Pounds 3bn.
Most of the money that went in during 1993, certainly in the later months,
is likely to show a loss over one year.
Investors who subscribed back in 1992 did a great deal better. The average
unit trust returned about 27 per cent during 1993. The trouble is, only
Pounds 0.7bn was invested in unit trusts in 1992, a particularly poor year
for sales.
The old problem of feast and famine is being seen again. Investors dither
when the stock market is cheap, and are then lured in near the top. Another
generation of investors becomes disappointed.
The one-year investment trust figures are looking healthier than the unit
trust equivalents, with most sectors showing a positive return of 10 per
cent or so. However, the figures strictly speaking ought to be reduced by 3
or 4 per cent, reflecting initial dealing costs and spreads, to make them
comparable with the unit trust performance.
Meanwhile pressure from the continuing wave of new investment trust issues,
which has pulled in another Pounds 3bn in just the past six months, is
beginning to weaken the average discount to asset value for the sector,
though the damage has been modest so far.
Private investors, in fact, have still been buying collective funds on quite
a heavy scale in recent months, and the causes of the weakness in stock
markets have originated elsewhere, in the gyrations of international bond
markets.
If savers are learning the lesson that it is better to buy into weakness
rather than into a heady bull market, then they may improve their long-term
results.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Motors pioneer
steers clear of equities - Serious Riches / On holiday, John Madejski found
a new way to advertise cars for sale. It made his fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Madejski opens his own front door despite being the 85th richest person
in Britain, making him worth about Pounds 140m, according to the Sunday
Times' annual tot-up of the nation's 500 wealthiest people.
He neither inherited wealth nor made a fortune on the stock market. He did
what many Englishmen - for despite his exotic surname, Madejski has no
foreign blood - often complain they are not much good at: he started and
built up his own company, which has become one of the UK's most successful
private enterprises.
Hurst Publishing was founded in 1976 with Paul Gibbons, a colleague Madejski
had met on the Reading Evening Post where they both sold advertising in the
early 1970s. The company publishes Auto Trader, a magazine which anyone who
has tried to sell a car or buy one second-hand, is almost certain to have
come across.
The secret of the magazine's success was the introduction of a novel feature
into UK classified car advertising, and one which Madejski borrowed and
extended when on a holiday in Florida he saw a magazine using photographs of
the cars being advertised.
The initial start-up capital for Thames Valley Trader, as the magazine was
then known, was Pounds 2,000. 'We were this little tiny company, which no
one took seriously, vying against the Westminster Press, The Thomson
Organisation etc. We just had to turn our hands to everything, and were
literally working all the hours God sent to make sure the thing got off the
ground.'
The idea took off, and the company has now grown to employ 920 people, and,
along with GMG, with which Hurst formed an alliance in 1982, embraces 12
regional editions. The first overseas Auto Trader has just been launched
into the South African market.
Madejski has increased his stake in Hurst from 51 per cent at launch to 67
per cent today. The company made profits before tax of just under Pounds 5m
in the year to April 1993 - up from Pounds 2.3m the previous year, according
to the latest set of accounts returned to Companies House, with a dividend
of Pounds 3.4m paid to its two directors.
Madejski is also chairman of two other companies. He has a 57.6 per cent
holding in Goodhead group, the quoted printing and publishing company and
owns 89 per cent of Reading Football Club, which he saved from bankruptcy in
1990. Goodhead, which has been hard hit by the drop in advertising during
the recession, appears to be gradually recovering after streamlining and
focusing on its core businesses.
The companies absorb Madejski's interest, and he regards them as a better
investment opportunity and challenge than equities. 'It's a bit like the old
cliche: what does a stockbroker do? A stockbroker invests your money until
it is all gone. I prefer to put my money into things that I've got some kind
of control over.' Nevertheless, he has given his bank a portfolio of about
Pounds 500,000 which it manages for him.
The investment that gives him the most pleasure is his superb collection of
cars, ranging from the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental  - an elegantly
powerful coupe launced in 1991 - to a vintage Jaguar. There are three
Ferraris, the most prized of which is kept in a glass box on one side of the
indoor gym. He also owns a Rolls-Royce and another three Jaguars, including
the XJ220 model, which is one of a limited edition of only 218 cars. The
classic car market has taken a battering in recent years, and Madejski says:
'I probably paid too much for it, but one day it will be worth a lot of
money and will probably end up in a museum.'
The cars are in immaculate condition, helped by the fact that, apart from
the Rolls and Bentley, they are rarely used. 'I don't really like a car to
be driven, but I do like the beauty of it,' says Madejski - a claim borne
out by his failed attempts to drive out three of the beauties due to flat
batteries.
Although he does not need it, he took out an Abbey Life pension eight years
ago at a friend's suggestion, into which he pays Pounds 20,000 a year and
which he expects to be worth about Pounds 1m on maturity. This, the cars and
the property he owns - houses in Berkshire, London, Caversham and Henley -
should stand him in good stead were the businesses to fail.
He believes that hard work - 'I find it bewildering that some Lloyd's Names
expected to get something for nothing' - common sense and willingness to
delegate are the main ingredients of success. 'If you don't delegate, you
can't go forward. You can only do so much yourself.'
From time to time, he muses on the possibility of floating Hurst Publishing,
but is clearly emotionally attached to the company. 'It's a fabulous company
with super people and, quite frankly, I am very proud of it. It was the
business we nurtured and it's expanding all the time. While one is still
enjoying it, it seems a pity to relinquish it.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): India and
Japan are bright spots - Investment trusts / In a relatively quiet quarter,
new launches consisted mostly of specialised single-country funds, plus the
heavily marketed 3i
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last quarter has been a subdued one for the investment trust industry,
after the frenzied activity of the last few months of 1993 and the first
month or two of this year.
Investment trust share prices have taken a tumble, along with most world
stock markets, since the shock of the rise in US interest rates in February.
The FT-SE investment trust index has fallen by about 17 per cent since the
February peak, but is still up on the year.
Similarly, the average investment trust discount, which hit a 20-year low of
around 4 per cent in January, has widened to fluctuate in the band of
roughly 7 to 9 per cent over the past few months. At the beginning of July,
it was at the lower end of this range, and showed signs of possibly widening
further. However, to put this in perspective, in July last year the average
discount was more than 10 per cent.
'The second quarter has been relatively unexciting,' says Philip Middleton,
of brokers Smith New Court. 'The febrile conditions of the three months
before it have evaporated. But it was far stronger than most quarters I can
remember in terms of new-issue activity.'
New trust launches consisted mostly of highly-specialised single-country
funds - the last three months have seen the launch of the first ever
UK-listed investment trusts concentrating on India, South Africa and Italy,
for example.
The response to Fleming's India fund showed that there was still money out
there looking for a home, but investors have become far more selective. The
Pounds 84m the trust pulled in through a placing and public offer was short
of its original Pounds 100m target, but still a respectable total by any
standards other than those of the overheated market in the first couple of
months of this year.
Japan has been another bright spot in the past few months. Existing trusts
have been trading at premiums, and there have been a number of successful
new fund launches this year. Schroders raised Pounds 125m for its Japan
Growth Fund, which was modestly oversubscribed. Schroders' existing
expertise in the area - it runs several Japanese unit trusts - helped boost
investors' confidence, in addition to the widely-held view that Tokyo was
one of the few stock markets likely to see much growth this year.
The most heavily marketed new issue of the quarter has to be 3i, the venture
capital fund - something of an oddity in the investment trust sector.
It is the largest investment trust ever launched, with a total market
capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn at the offer price, although only Pounds
711m-worth of shares were offered to institutions and the public. Unlike
most new investment trusts, it has been operating for decades and came to
market merely to float its existing portfolio, rather than raise new money.
The quarter also featured a few disappointments. Murray Johnstone was forced
to abandon its planned launch of a smaller-company and venture capital
trust, after it had become clear during the initial launch period that there
was insufficient demand. Analysts blamed the problem on a combination of
factors, largely the generally unsettled market conditions and also a recent
flurry of smaller company fund launches. The imminent arrival of 3i on the
market may also have overshadowed Murray Johnstone's much smaller offering.
Johnson Fry had hoped to repeat the success of its two split-capital
utilities trusts with a third split-capital trust specialising in European
utilities. But rather than the Pounds 100m it hoped to raise, it attracted
only Pounds 15m, some of which was generated internally. One factor in this
disappointing result may have been that it sounded too similar to the two
European privatisation trusts, which have not been as much of an immediate
success as people had expected.
As usual, among existing trusts, some sectors did better than others in the
poor market conditions. Those which fell more than expected may now offer
good value, while those which held up better than average could look
overpriced for new investors.
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst with SG Warburg, warns in particular
that the share prices of many split-capital trusts are artificially inflated
at the moment. They have not fallen as far or as fast as the rest of the
market, and this has led to anomalies such as the gross redemption yields on
some income shares being less than those of gilts; whereas normally they
would be at least two percentage points higher, to reflect their greater
risk.
Aaron says this may be because people are buying solely for the immediate
yield, and not taking into account total returns. Philip Middleton agrees.
'It is a very inefficiently priced market. Most people don't understand
split-capital shares.'
Other high-income or income growth trusts have also held up relatively well
in the falling market, for similar reasons: the headline yield figure
attracts investors who do not look at all the relevant factors.
Market anomalies can work both ways, however. Middleton points out that some
general Far Eastern trusts could be worth a look at the moment, as they can
offer a substantial amount of Japanese exposure while trading at a fairly
wide discount, but specialist Japanese trusts are often at a premium.
The Quarterly Review's regular tables of the leading unit and investment
trusts, based on performance over the past five years, are on pages 30 and
31

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Investors take
a longer view - Unit trusts / Sales figures suggest a healthier attitude on
the part of savers, as competition grows to offer them more attractive
charging structures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Traditionally, the period after the end of the tax year is a relatively
quiet one for unit trusts.
Most unit trusts bought by private investors are in the form of a personal
equity plan (Pep) and, since the rush to use up annual limits tends to be
confined to the end of the tax year, that is the time when unit trusts sales
also tend to be highest.
Sales have fallen off since March when net investment in unit trusts topped
Pounds 1.37bn, making it the best March figure on record, but subsequent
investment has still been sizeable, dropping only to Pounds 976m in April
and to Pounds 726.4m in May.
Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, said the figures indicated a healthy change in saving
habits, as investors appeared to be ignoring short-term market movements and
investing for the long term.
Last year was a record for the unit trust industry, helped by prevailing low
interest rates, with net inflows of Pounds 9.1bn. Net investment of Pounds
4.2bn in the first five months of this year was still strong, despite - or
possibly because of - the dip in the UK market since February.
With sales still buoyant, competition continues apace, with the main
emphasis on charging structures and on dressing up an existing product to
sustain the interest of potential investors.
At the end of June, Fidelity packaged its existing Peps into a mortgage to
launch Fidelity Pep Mortgage Plan. Borrowers can either use a Fidelity Pep -
the company recommends three in particular - to bolt on to an interest-only
mortgage secured from one of 40 lenders who have said they will sell the
Pep; or they can choose Fidelity's package, with Bank of Ireland providing
the mortgage and Zurich Life the term assurance.
At the same time, Fidelity has changed the charging structure of its Peps by
lifting the three-year exit fees, from July 4, but by pushing up the initial
charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent from August 1.
When it pioneered the introduction of withdrawal fees on unit trust Peps, in
June 1992, and cut the initial charge from 5.25 to 2 per cent, it said it
wanted to avoid diluting the tax benefits of a Pep with a high initial
charge.
Other companies followed, including Gartmore, Guinness Flight, Scottish
Equitable and, most recently M&amp;G, which on January 1 abolished the initial
charge on its Managed Income Pep, but introduced five-year withdrawal
charges.
Gartmore has also lifted withdrawal charges on its unit trust Peps and
raised its initial charge from 2 to 3 per cent. The two gave the same reason
for the move: investors found the dual charging structure 'confusing.'
Fidelity also said that it did not want any penalties attached to the new
mortgage package; but both companies have also found that few investors have
been cashing in their Pep early.
Others may follow, although M&amp;G says that it has no intention of abolishing
withdrawal charges on the Managed Income Pep, and may indeed extend the
charging structure to other Peps. It says it has not found customer
confusion, but attributes this to the lack of an initial charge. M&amp;G's
Rachel Medill said: 'There is only one set of charges, so for us it is a
simple message. Two sets of charges may give investors the impression that
they are being charged twice.'
Fidelity's and Gartmore's 3 per cent initial charge is still competitive
compared with the industry average of 5.25 to 6 per cent, but it is confined
to unit trust Peps. Murray Johnstone's initial charge on its unit trusts is
1 per cent, and Lazard has not levied an initial charge on its unit trusts
since 1988. At the beginning of May, Invesco cut the initial charge across
the range of its unit trusts to 3 per cent.
Alan Wren, managing director of Invesco fund managers, made no secret that
the idea was to increase greater market share and attract longer-term
investors after two years of stagnation at Invesco, where funds under
management had not increased despite a market average growth of between 50
per cent and 100 per cent.
Although initial and annual charges are one factor in any decision to buy a
unit trust, performance is far more important in the long run. Here, Invesco
is on weak territory and says that one of its tasks is to improve
performance. With the exception of its Japan Smaller Companies fund, which
has a good record, many of its UK funds are to be found in the lower half of
the performance tables.
MORE MANAGERS PLAN TO EXPLORE EMERGING MARKETS
The Far East and emerging markets have been the main geographical areas
acting as a spur to new launches.
Hypo F&amp;C hopes to capitalise on future growth in the Japanese market with
its Japanese Growth fund, while Exeter Fund managers is using closed-end
funds to invest in the Far East through its Pacific Growth fund.
Save &amp; Prosper has turned its attentions away from the Far East to South
America with its Latin America Fund. Portfolio's Emerging Markets Fund aims
to take the pick of emerging market unit trusts through a fund of funds
trust.
OPTIONS SAFETY-NET RULES OUT PEP STATUS
There were at least two unusual ideas. John Govett, which has a range of
index funds, some using derivatives, launched the UK Safeguard Fund which
aims to replicate the performance of the FT-SE 100.
The use of options is meant as a safeguard against sharp falls, but it also
means that the trust does not qualify for Pep status.
Hargreaves Lansdowne, the Bristol-based independent financial adviser,
launched the Warrant Portfolio Trust, its first unit trust, which invests in
all types of these geared (and therefore risky) investments.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions
(28): Going at 50? It's trickier than you think - Taxation / The bulk of the
fund must be used immediately to buy an annuity, so the timing of the
purchase is critical. However, Inland Revenue rules do not normally permit
any delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When personal pensions were launched in July 1988, the government and life
offices spent millions advertising the flexibility of this modern product.
But in practice the Revenue's rigid tax rules and the pension providers'
restrictive contract terms create an investment environment where genuine
flexibility is sadly lacking.
There are three main trouble spots to watch out for.
Retirement annuity pensions
Until personal pensions replaced them in July 1988, retirement annuity
pensions (RAPs) were the main product for the self-employed and for
employees who did not have access to an occupational scheme. New RAPs were
not available after this date, but policyholders could continue to pay
contributions to existing contracts.
If you have an RAP but want to extend your investment choice, it is possible
to take out one or more personal pension plans, but the two types of pension
operate under very different tax rules and higher earners risk losing
valuable tax reliefs if they mix contributions.
Martin Korn, partner, financial services, with chartered accountants Blick
Rothenburg, said: 'Once you pay in to both policies, then the personal
pension contribution limits automatically apply to all contributions for
that tax year.
As the table shows, the RAP maximum contribution limits are generally lower
as a percentage of 'net relevant earnings' - the earnings on which your
pension premiums are based. But unlike personal pensions, RAPs are not
affected by the 'earnings cap' which restricts the earnings on which
contributions can be based to Pounds 76,800 for the current tax year.
According to actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, employees earning over the 'net
relevant earnings threshold' for 1994-95 who want to pay maximum
contributions should stick to the RAP or use the 'alternate year funding'
method whereby contributions are paid to the RAP in one tax year and to the
personal pension in the next. Any RAP tax relief lost during the personal
pension contribution year can be mopped up through the Revenue's 'carry
forward' rules, but you will need expert advice for this complex exercise.
There are other important differences between the two individual pension
plans. Korn said: 'Despite their attractions for higher earners, RAPs cannot
be used to opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) or
to take employer contributions. For both of these features you need a
personal pension.'
Company schemes
The driving force behind the personal pension bandwagon is the apparent
portability that they offer to young people who expect to change jobs and
want to take their pension plan with them.
In practice, however, problems arise when the new company offers membership
of an occupational pension scheme. In most cases it is best to join company
schemes in order to benefit from employer contributions, a guaranteed
pension linked to salary and generous family protection insurances. However,
under Revenue regulations, with a few minor exceptions, it is not possible
to belong to an occupational pension scheme and to continue payments into a
personal pension, due to the different tax rules.
Unfortunately, investors who stop payments in the early years to a typical
regular-premium personal pension plan, in order to join the company scheme,
will find that most of their personal pension contributions have been
absorbed by the provider's administration charges and the adviser's
commission.
To avoid this problem, use a fee-based adviser for the personal pension, so
that the plan is set up on a nil-commission basis; or pay a series of single
premiums, which avoids the high up-front commissions associated with
regular-premium plans. Both methods allow you to reduce, stop and restart
contributions without penalty.
If you are locked in to a commission-based regular-premium plan, most
providers are prepared to redirect the contributions into a free-standing
additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan. The FSAVC is used to top up
company pensions, and is governed by occupational scheme tax rules.
However, this option assumes that you can afford to pay contributions to the
life office as well as the company scheme. Moreover, while topping up
company pensions is a good idea, your first choice should always be the
employer's group AVC scheme, which is likely to offer better value for money
than the FSAVC due to economies of scale.
And at retirement . . .
Under personal pension rules, it is possible to retire at any age between 50
and 75. This may sound flexible, but in practice the rules are extremely
restrictive. Once the retirement date is reached, under most providers'
contracts, the bulk of the fund must be used immediately to buy an annuity
which provides the regular income for life. (The recent White Paper
suggested that this restriction will go in 1997, but details of the change
are not yet available.) Normally you cannot change your mind once you have
handed over your lump sum, and if you die the fund falls back into the life
office's coffers.
The level of income secured will depend partly upon the size of the fund and
partly on the prevailing annuity rates, which are broadly based on
long-dated gilt yields. Since these yields fluctuate significantly, the
timing of the annuity purchase is critical, yet the Revenue does not
normally permit any delay.
For wealthier individuals who are prepared to take a gamble, there are
options that allow the fund to continue to benefit from investment growth,
but if the fund value falls, so does your income.
A handful of providers sell annuities that leave the fund invested on a
unit-linked or with-profits basis; while a second option - phased retirement
 -allows you to divide your pension fund and buy, for example, three
separate annuities at age 65, 70 and 75, instead of using the entire fund to
purchase a single annuity. The delay in the final annuity purchase, which
has to be made by age 75, should secure a better income, because rates are
based on life expectancy, among other factors.
Staggered vesting replaces the one-off annuity purchase with a series of
annual transactions. This complex process can be very expensive, and you
lose access to the tax-free cash which is used to provide part of the annual
income.
If you are interested in these alternatives, expert advice is essential,
because you forfeit the guaranteed annuity income in return for the
potential of a higher income if investment conditions are favourable and
annuity rates improve.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions
(27): A way to keep your capital - Is a Pep better? / Eric Short compares
two tax-efficient routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT

<TEXT>
Annuity rates have bounced back from their 20-year low, but until recently
they had highlighted an aspect of personal pensions often overlooked in the
marketing of these contracts. It is not the cash accumulated under the
contract that matters, so much as the amount of pension the cash will buy.
Personal pensions are tax-efficient and offer considerable flexibility with
regard to contribution payments and choice of funds up to the time the
benefits are taken. But there are also certain drawbacks.
First, the assets held in a personal pension are locked in. You cannot get
hold of them before age 50 in theory, and much later in practice. This
inflexibility is of concern if you suddenly need money, as may happen if you
are made redundant or your business folds up.
Second, once the individual is free to take benefits from a personal
pension, only a quarter of the value can be taken as a tax-free cash sum.
The remainder must be used to buy an annuity - and here the disadvantages of
personal pensions become apparent. Annuity rates depend on prevailing
interest rates, sex and the age at which the individual buys the annuity.
The lower the age, the lower the income.
Someone taking benefits from a personal pension while still relatively young
is likely to find that what appears to be a sizeable cash sum buys a
disappointingly low income - even lower for a woman. But the problems do not
stop there. Income from the annuity is taxed as earned income, which for
most people means that the whole of the income is taxable, subject to
personal allowances.
Finally, someone buying an annuity is effectively gambling on how long he or
she will live. If they die within a few years, the balance of the invested
capital is lost so far as the children are concerned.
Individuals can partially protect that capital by taking out an annuity with
a spouse's benefit, or an annuity with payments guaranteed for a fixed
number of years. But this protection has to be paid for in the form of much
lower annuity payments. When annuity rates are already low, people will be
reluctant to take an even lower income in order preserve their capital.
Indeed, many are opposed to annuities in principle because of this
early-death factor - though the balance of the capital does not go into the
pockets of the life companies' shareholders, as is popularly supposed, but
to pay that growing number of annuitants who live until they are 80 and
beyond.
These disadvantages have led many people and their advisers to look at
personal equity plans (Peps) as a means of at least boosting income in
retirement, if not as an alternative to a personal pension.
True, contributions to a Pep are paid out of net income, but thereafter the
investment is as tax-efficient as a personal pension in the build-up of
funds, and more flexible and tax-efficient when it comes to the benefits.
Individuals and advisers who have been attracted to Peps like the idea of
being able to take income or capital, or both, at any time they please in
the form of tax-free cash.
For example, they may take just the income from the Pep fund, tax-free -
income that should rise as dividend payments rise - leaving the capital
intact to continue to grow, and perhaps to be passed on to the next
generation at death, thus avoiding loss of capital on early death. (Table 1
illustrates the provision of income from a Pep - on the assumption that Peps
have been available for the past 15 years.)
Alternatively, a person may boost his income further by using some of the
capital, though this would diminish the underlying fund. It is always easy
to convert capital into income, simply by purchasing an annuity. With the
capital from a Pep, one would buy a purchased life annuity, which provides a
higher after-tax return than a pension annuity bought with cash from a
personal pension.
Part of a purchased life annuity - the element deemed to constitute return
of capital - is tax-free, leaving only the interest element liable for tax.
By comparison, the whole of a pension annuity is taxable.
The average duration of payments into a personal pension is around 15 years,
because only in later life can most people afford to make substantial
contributions. Consequently, the shorter the time before benefits are taken,
the less will be the effect of tax relief on payments. So the older the
individual, the more attractive Peps become as a means of boosting income.
Table 2 compares a personal pension and a Pep. The latter provides a greater
cash sum, but less income, particularly at an older age, so a greater part
of the capital is preserved if someone dies shortly after taking the
benefits.
However, personal pensions and Peps are not mutually exclusive. You can
invest in both if you have sufficient means. An efficient financial planning
exercise would derive the best from each, and allow flexibility of income in
retirement.

2, Contributions of Pounds6,000 a year for 15 years are made and

automatically reinvested.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
4, The individual now needs to take income from the Pep.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
5, The current dividends from the fund are around Pounds16,900 a year.
The individual can take this income out of the Pep tax-free, so this is
equivalent to a gross income of around Pounds22,500, assuming basic-rate
tax of 25 per cent.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
6, This income is not dependent directly on the age and sex of the
individual, only on the investment period and performance.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
7, Dividends on the fund over the past 15 years have grown by 7.3 per
cent a year, compared with an annual inflation rate of 7 per cent over
the same period. However, current dividend growth is around 5 per cent.
So this income from the Pep should at least increase in line with
inflation over the long term.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
8, The fund of Pounds440,000 can continue to be invested, though its
future growth will be lower than before because dividends are not being
reinvested. But over the long term its value should increase.

1. If a contribution of Pounds6,000 net (Pounds8,000 gross, assuming tax
at 25 per cent) was paid over 15 years into a personal pension investing
in the same underlying fund, the corresponding value after 15 years
would be around Pounds587,000.
2. If benefits are then taken, the individual could take Pounds146,750
as tax-free cash, while the balance of Pounds440,250 must be used to buy
an annuity.
3. By comparison with a Pep, the individual invests in an annuity on
his or her life, increasing each year at 5 per cent. The annuity
payments are subject to tax. The position on taking the benefits would
be as follows:

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions
(26): Glad tidings from an ill wind - Alternatives to the life companies /
Non-life providers will hope to exploit the poor image of inflexible
products and mis-selling that has damaged the insurance companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies from outside the life assurance industry are now gearing
themselves up to make their second attempt at grabbing an important share of
the personal pensions business. In the past, however, they have failed to
overcome the barrier of investor indifference.
New hope for the non-lifers springs essentially from the so-called 'hard'
disclosure of commissions and charges on life policies, which comes into
effect next January. These non-life providers will also be seeking to
exploit the poor image of inflexible products and mis-selling which has so
badly damaged the life companies in recent months.
When personal pensions legislation was introduced in the mid-1980s, the
government went out of its way to ensure that the new pensions products
would no longer be confined to the life assurance closed shop.
It was expected that unit trust companies, building societies and banks
would all participate in the exciting new markets, providing an important
new layer of competition for the life companies.
But it didn't work out like that. Although new entrants appeared, most
providers of unit trust pensions, such as Fidelity or Midland Bank,
eventually either pulled out or switched to life assurance vehicles. Only a
handful, such as Gartmore, Invesco and NM Rothschild, are still in business
with niche products.
They found marketing difficult when they could not use the life assurance
distribution channels. Lower charges made the non-life pensions products
inherently attractive, but the market turned out not to be very
price-sensitive - a consequence of the life industry's ability to conceal
its costs.
Administration also turned out to be something of a nightmare for providers
such as unit trust companies, which are used to handling simple transactions
involving straightforward products.
While the life offices sold millions of personal pension plans, the non-life
companies could only gain a toehold in the market, albeit probably towards
the higher-value end of the spectrum. Fidelity had around 3,000 clients, for
instance, when it pulled the plug in 1993.
It is possible, however, that the sales techniques which proved so
successful for the life companies will now rebound against them.
One non-life provider which has remained in business, however, is the
intermediary and consultancy group Pointon York, which is using the
framework for self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) which were introduced
in the 1989 Budget. Sipps can be invested in a range of assets in a tailored
and transparent way.
Mr Nigel Goodhew, a Pointon York director, says that a Sipp is the right
product for between 5 and 10 per cent of UK earners, but that 'my problem is
how to get to them'. So far the whole Sipp market embraces only about 3,000
clients.
However, Mr Goodhew expects Sipps to get a shot in the arm from hard
commission disclosure and greater job mobility for executives. He thinks
there will be 50,000 Sipps in existence by the year 2000.
An unexpected new entrant to the personal pensions market last February was
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, which has extended its long-established
regular savings scheme (which is a particularly economical way of buying
shares in the investment trust) so that it can handle personal pension
plans.
Key features of the F &amp; C plan include low costs and flexibility, so that
there are none of the penalties that life companies can impose for reduced
contributions or missed instalments. However, savers are also likely to need
advice on how to handle the risks of a single stock market-based investment
in the years immediately preceding retirement.
In general, it is the absence of a developed infrastructure of fee-charging
advisers that has inhibited the growth of non-life personal pensions in the
UK. The question is whether the new disclosure climate will push the market
firmly enough in the non-life direction.
Fidelity is trying to tackle the market in a different way. It is drawing on
the experience of its American parent, which has successfully exploited the
trend towards company 'money purchase' pension schemes in the US.
So Fidelity has launched a unit trust-based company scheme, reckoning that
it is more practical to reach investors through their employing company than
directly through individual personal pension plans. The rather pessimistic
implication, however, is that Fidelity thinks it is always likely to be very
expensive to sell plans directly.
But a few more new entrants on the lines of F &amp; C might help popularise the
idea that life and pensions do not automatically go together.

(25): Family affairs - The choice for small businesses / Flexibility, cost
and the nature of your firm will be the deciding factors, but advice is
needed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Small businesses have several pension options, and the final choice will
depend on the required level of investment control, flexibility and cost.
Independent advice on a fee basis is essential for this market.
Small self-administered schemes
The most popular pension arrangement for family businesses is the small
self-administered scheme (SSAS). These are classed as occupational pension
schemes, and are extremely tax-efficient but can be expensive to run.
Membership, which is restricted to a maximum of 12, tends to be limited to
directors of the company. The trustees are chosen by the directors, but the
scheme also has to appoint a 'pensioner' trustee, approved by the Inland
Revenue, to provide advice on technical aspects and to ensure that, if the
scheme is wound up, the process meets with the Revenue's approval.
SSASs offer members a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary
(restricted for some higher earners), which is secured through the purchase
of an annuity at retirement. The purchase can be made at any time up to age
75. There is also a substantial tax-free cash lump sum at retirement,
death-in-service and death-in-retirement benefits. Spouse and dependants'
benefits are automatically included.
Permitted investments include quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments
such as unit and investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property.
Property is of particular interest to small companies, many of which use
their SSAS fund to purchase new business premises. However, this must be
done on an arms-length basis and a commercial rent must be charged.
The fund can be used to provide a loan to the company, again on arms-length
terms, and to purchase shares in the company. SSAS funds normally are exempt
from Department of Social Security rules that restrict self-investment to 5
per cent.
Although employees can pay up to 15 per cent of salary into the scheme, most
SSASs are funded purely by company contributions, since this reduces the
overall National Insurance bill. These contributions are tax-deductible and,
since they are based on the projected final salary at retirement, they are
virtually unlimited, although restrictions may apply in future.
Under Revenue rules, you can run only one SSAS at a time, which makes the
choice of provider extremely important. There are two main options: fully
self-administered, and 'hybrid' schemes. The former allow the administration
and investment to be run separately, whereas the two functions are combined
under a hybrid. Hybrid providers - the life offices - require a minimum
investment of about Pounds 5,000 a year in their own funds, although
contributions in excess of this can be invested by the client or his
stockbroker.
As a rule of thumb, the hybrid SSAS, which charges on a percentage basis, is
thought to be more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than Pounds
10,000 to Pounds 12,000. Where contributions exceed this amount, the
flat-rate fees charged on the fully self-administered SSAS start to look
attractive.
Advisers may also recommend executive pension plans (EPPs). These are
similar to SSASs, but the entire fund is run by the life office, and on
retirement the annuity has to be purchased immediately. Also, from September
this year, the Inland Revenue will impose restrictions on the maximum
contributions that can be paid into an EPP.
Personal pension options
If you are interested in a simpler and cheaper alternative to the SSAS, it
is worth considering a group personal pension (GPP) or self-invested
personal pensions (SIPPs).
GPPs are a collection of individual personal pensions. Maximum annual
employee and employer contributions are limited to 17.5 per cent of earnings
(more for employees over 35) and the proceeds are used to buy an annuity at
retirement, which can be at any time between age 50 and 75.
Normally, under the providers' contract conditions, the annuity has to be
purchased immediately the selected retirement age is reached, although the
recent White Paper on pension reform indicated that there would be greater
flexibility for annuities from April 1997. Most providers combine the
administration and investment functions, and insist that contributions are
invested in their own funds.
Self-invested personal pensions allow you to manage your own investments.
They can be used by individuals, groups of employees and Schedule-D
taxpayers such as partnerships.
The main attraction of the SIPP is its ability to unbundle the investment
and administration, to provide a clearer charging structure and greater
investment flexibility. With an SIPP, you can either run the investment
portfolio yourself or appoint your own stockbroker. This makes it possible
to change the investment manager while leaving the underlying administration
and legal structure in place - an option not possible under most
conventional personal pensions.
SIPPs follow the basic contribution and benefit rules for personal pensions
and, as with all plans, there is a monetary cap on the total earnings to
which contributions relate. This is Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year.
SIPP funds can invest in UK and overseas stocks and shares, unit trusts and
investment trusts, insurance company managed funds and unit-linked funds,
deposit accounts and commercial property. The last includes new offices for
the business, provided the property is leased back on a commercial basis. It
is possible for the SIPP to borrow on the strength of the pension fund to
help with property purchase.
SIPPs are normally run on an individual basis, but if the funds are grouped
together it can result in greater investment scope and economies of scale.
Inevitably the SIPP v SSAS argument comes down to a matter of horses for
courses. Andrew Hague, manager of the SSAS department at consulting
actuaries Barnett Waddingham, said: 'At present, we believe SSASs offer
greater flexibility, particularly on the investment scope, the higher
contribution rates and the timing of the annuity purchase.'
But John Moret, pensions manager at Provident Life, said that SIPPs had
other attractions: 'SIPPs offer greater simplicity, lower costs and,
probably most important of all, individual hands-on control of the fund. In
addition, while there are contribution limits on SIPPs, there are no limits
on benefits, as is the case with SSASs.'

(24): How not to fall into a trough? - The risk / Retire when the stock
market or annuity rates are low, and your pension will suffer. The industry
is seeking a solution to the problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consider the position of someone who retired on a personal pension the day
after the stock market crash of October 1987. Or, to take a more immediate
example of how personal pension holders are hostage to market forces: the
individual who retired earlier this year, when annuity rates, reflecting the
very low yields available on 15-year gilts, fell to their lowest level in
decades.
For two people whose retirements were separated by Black Monday of October
1987, said Mr Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal and General, 'the
difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.'
In an employer-sponsored defined benefit scheme, it is the employer who
bears the investment risk; and because benefits are paid out from a pool
over a very long period, fluctuations in market values are not usually
significant.
But the challenge that personal pension providers now have before them is to
devise investment strategies which help to minimise the volatility of
investment returns, while maximising returns from the highest yielding
securities. The same question of investment volatility applies to
increasingly popular money-purchase, defined-contribution schemes.
Moreover, the Labour party has indicated that it would like personal pension
providers to build into contracts a minimum guaranteed level of benefit into
contracts - a measure which would make a solution to the investment issue
imperative.
Mr Nigel Chambers, director at actuarial consultants Johnston Douglas,
argues that the answer for the individual who wants to protect himself
against a stock market crash just before retirement date is to 'make sure
you are not invested in equities'.
Indeed, most of the structures intended to reduce the investment risks of
personal pensions involve the gradual shift of the portfolio into
fixed-interest securities as the individual approaches retirement date.
Gartmore, the UK fund management company, has a product which invests 90 per
cent of an individual's pension fund in equities up until the 40th birthday.
Then, over the next 25 years, investments are gradually moved out of
equities and into fixed-interest investments - a process which accelerates
between the 60th and 65th birthdays. Thus, if yields on bonds have fallen
sharply, at least the individual will have the benefit of the sharp
investment gains on bond prices which should have accrued in the preceding
months.
An alternative solution was launched last year by Mercury Asset Management's
life insurance arm, Mercury Life. While it is initially available only to
prospective clients with Pounds 500,000 or more to invest - making it
suitable only for large group personal pensions or money-purchase accounts -
the technique shows promise for personal pension holders as well.
Using a complex formula that involves the use of equity derivatives, the
'guarantee fund' invests 99 per cent of all contributions in an investment
pool, while the remaining 1 per cent goes into a reserve fund. The reserve
fund uses derivatives to ensure that the individual will earn at least 90
per cent of the average daily market value of the units in the investment
pool, and retain those profits even if the stock markets fall sharply in
ensuing years.
Alternatively, some argue, the liability stream of a personal pension
requires the UK government to be much more imaginative and flexible in its
design of investment securities used to fund the budget deficit.
Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable, says: 'The
basic problem is the structure of the cash flow.' What is needed, he
suggests, is a very long-dated UK government gilt which pays no interest in
its early years - while the pension plan holder is still employed and saving
for retirement - but pays index-linked benefits in later years. Such a
security could be purchased with a lump sum on, say, an individual's 40th
birthday and accrue interest at, say, some margin above retail prices until
the 65th birthday is reached. The index-linked payments would operate
thereafter.
Mr Ritchie argues that the new instrument would ensure that final returns to
personal pension holders at least bear some relationship to the income
earned during a lifetime at work. Presumably, salary will have increased
broadly in line with inflation during the individual's working life,
matching the accrued interest he will earn on retirement.
Mr Ritchie is not alone in calling for new instruments to meet the
investment objectives of personal and money-purchase pensions. The
left-of-centre think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Studies, has also
called for the creation of a new instrument that would have a capital value
linked to an index of national average earnings.
So a broad spectrum of the pensions industry has at least recognised the
need to rethink the appropriate investment strategy. It remains to be seen
which solution will prove the most effective for policyholders.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions
(23): With care, you can pass some of it on - The beneficiaries / Most
personal pensions are set up under the provider's universal trust scheme. A
form with the application invites you to say whom you would like the death
benefits to go to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If you do not have access to a company pension scheme, the investments
accumulated under a personal pension or its predecessor, a retirement
annuity pension, are likely to represent your most important asset.
While the primary purpose of any pension plan is to provide the maximum
income in retirement, most people would also like to pass on as much of the
pension fund as possible to the next generation.
There are two distinct stages to consider here, namely: the contribution
period during your working life, when you are building up your fund; and the
benefit period in retirement, when you are drawing the pension income.
The contribution period
Personal pensions usually have a clearly identifiable value at any given
time up to retirement, and most providers guarantee to return the full fund
value on death before retirement. This is paid tax-free to the nominated
beneficiary.
Under a unit linked or unitised with-profits policy, where the contributions
buy units in a pooled fund, the value of your fund is simply the value of
your units. However, 'traditional' with-profits funds, still used by a few
personal pension providers and the most common choice for retirement annuity
pensions, were not unitised. Here the value of your fund on death before
retirement may be calculated in one of several ways.
Some providers return the value of contributions with interest paid at
various rates from 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Others return the value of
contributions without interest or make no return at all. However, if you
have one of these policies, do not automatically assume you have been
cheated. Low-return or no-return policies usually offer a higher return in
order to provide better pension benefits, while separate life assurance is
often sold to provide the death benefits.
Tony Tollerton, senior technical manager at Sun Life, warned: 'It is
important to maintain that life cover, even if you stop paying in to the
policy; otherwise, if you die, your dependants may receive little back from
the pension provider.' Tollerton advised individuals with older policies to
check the death benefits, and if necessary take out further life assurance
to top up the tax-free lump sum for dependants.
It is also important to check that your policies are written under trust.
Pension plans established in this way avoid potential inheritance tax (IHT)
liabilities, because any death benefits can be paid direct to the nominated
beneficiary rather than pass through the deceased's estate. Even where you
intend to pass on everything to your spouse, which normally would not
involve IHT, if you both die at the same time or within a short period of
each other, then your children may have to pay IHT on the benefits from the
pension plan.
Most personal pensions automatically are set up under the provider's
universal trust scheme, and an expression-of-wish form is included with the
application, which invites you to set out who you would like the death
benefits to go to. Under these trust schemes, the life office acts as
trustee and has discretionary power to make the payments to the appropriate
person in the same way as occupational pension scheme trustees operate.
Your beneficiary does not have to be a spouse or a dependent child, and if
you are unmarried you can nominate your mother or your common-law partner,
for example. However, Ian McKenna, partner with independent financial
adviser Blyth McKenna, stressed: 'It is vital to review the beneficiary form
at regular intervals. We have had cases where the original nomination was
not changed when a client got married and had children, so that when he died
the nominated beneficiary was still the client's mother or former
girlfriend.'
Normally in these cases the trustees would try to sort out the most suitable
beneficiary, but this could be a long, complex and potentially acrimonious
process, particularly where the individual had been married several times or
had children by more than one partner.
While universal trust schemes are common practice today, this was not the
case with retirement annuity pensions. If you have one of these older
policies, check whether you have nominated a beneficiary and, if not, ask
your adviser or provider to sort out a trust arrangement for you.
The retirement period
When you reach retirement, the bulk of your personal pension or retirement
annuity fund must be used to buy an annuity from a life office which
guarantees the regular pension income.
If you contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps),
the element of the fund which was built up from rebates of national
insurance contributions, known as 'appropriate rights', must be used to buy
an annuity that includes a spouse's pension if you die.
It is up to you what level of dependant's benefits you secure with the
annuity purchased by the rest of the fund, but any extra guarantees, such as
a spouse's pension, will reduce the annuity income by up to 16 per cent.
Apart from buying a spouse's pension, it is also possible to protect your
fund. Under a basic annuity, once you hand over your lump sum, it is gone
for good, even if you die shortly afterwards.
The alternative is to buy a guarantee that, if you die within the first five
years of retirement, the balance of your pension fund will be paid to your
beneficiary. A five-year guarantee is likely to reduce the annuity income by
about 1.6 per cent, while a 10-year guarantee, offered by some providers,
would reduce your pension by about 6 per cent.
There are other options at retirement for those who do not want to be locked
into a conventional annuity and wish to keep the fund fully invested.

/ Alison Smith examines the latest advice available to those who would
switch schemes
</HEADLINE>

A pilot study, showing widespread failure to meet proper standards in the
sale of a personal pensions to people transferring lump sums out of
occupational schemes, sent a tidal wave of shock through the financial
services sector last December.
Even as life companies insisted that they were not sharks mis-selling to
innocent clients, and that anyway standards had already been raised, City
regulators were considering how to ensure that potential customers felt it
was safe to go back in the water.
Immediately after the publication of the study, and well before any
proposals to improve standards had been implemented, the regulators were
sending past customers a 'don't panic' message. They stopped short of
banning pension transfer business, saying that in the right circumstances
personal pensions could work well; but the effect of the outcry caused by
the study was itself enough to act as some form of deterrent.
The two main elements of the regulators' plans have recently been announced,
but some of the proposals will not be in place for some time.
The most straightforward measure intended to prevent mis-selling was the
issue in May of advice from the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the
City's chief watchdog, directly to customers. This dealt with the questions
they should ask their financial advisers about pension transfers, or about
opting out of an employer's scheme into a private plan.
The leaflets, published by SIB and available from public libraries, citizens
advice bureaux and - SIB hopes - through other organisations, including the
Trades Union Congress and occupational pension schemes, are not DIY pension
kits. They do, however, highlight some of the issues that potential
customers should consider in deciding whether to go for a pension transfer
or opt-out, and they list some issues the financial adviser should have
raised in the course of giving advice.
One of the main messages is that, before you can decide, you need to ensure
that you know enough about your employer's scheme to be aware what you would
be giving up by transferring or opting out.
While personal pensions will still make sense for many people, good reasons
are needed to take out a pension transfer; and very good reasons are needed
to opt out of an occupational scheme.
Other important pieces of advice are that you should shop around and ask
about charges and commission, since these costs will affect the pension to
which you are entitled on retirement.
The checklists in the leaflets cover the questions which you need to ensure
that either you or your adviser, or both of you, have addressed. Broadly,
these are:
Have your personal circumstances - including your attitude to risk - been
discussed in detail, and do you realise that in taking a personal pension
you are taking an investment risk?
Has your adviser discussed benefits, such as early retirement, which you
might lose through leaving the scheme?
Have you discussed the decision with your spouse or partner?
Has your adviser explained the differences between occupational schemes
based on final salary and a personal pension?
But the regulators are not relying solely, or even mainly, on making caveat
emptor work more effectively in the personal pensions market. A report
published by SIB in March was directed at imposing tougher guidelines on
sales agents and advisers. It also proposed that customers should be allowed
a 'cooling off' period of at least 14 days, in which to decide whether to go
ahead with a transfer.
From the first day of this month, the new rules should prevent sales agents
and advisers evading their responsibility to give proper advice to clients.
They should make it much less likely that sales agents will say that they
were simply following a client's wishes or that their advice was overruled.
These explanations have sometimes been offered by sales agents in cases
where clients have acted against what seemed to be their best financial
interests.
Beginning later this month, the regulators themselves will require life
companies and independent financial advisers to tell them if such cases make
up more than a tiny proportion of their business, so that they can keep them
under particularly close supervision.
Other changes are a requirement that firms use a computerised system to
check the value of a lump sum which a client would take out of an
occupational scheme; and a requirement to produce a 'reason why' letter.
This letter, which would accompany every transaction, to explain the advice
given to the customer, would go to the investor and would also have to be
filed by the sales agent.
For the longer term, the report recommends that pension transfers and
opt-outs be treated as a special category of business. This would enable
regulators to consider whether a firm was suited to that specific activity,
and to discourage any that were merely dabbling in the area.
The impact of the changes will be assessed by the regulators in September
next year. But long before then, one hopes, individual customers will know,
from the quality of advice they receive, whether the reforms have worked.

(21): A good idea that fell to earth - The antics of sales agents and
reports of regulators' efforts to curb them have taken their toll on sales.
But the product may at last be reaching those to whom it is best suited
</HEADLINE>

It has not been a good year for personal pensions. Securities regulators
dropped a bombshell last December, when they revealed that a study by an
independent auditing firm had discovered that 400,000 to 500,000 people may
have been urged to transfer out of an employer's scheme into a personal
pension against their own best interests.
The affair has tarnished the reputations of some of the leading household
names in the British insurance industry. Norwich Union has had its
800-strong sales force suspended for retraining. Legal &amp; General and
Cornhill were fined hundreds of thousands of pounds for their failure to
control their sales forces; and every big clearing bank has halted its sales
of transfers from occupational pension schemes.
While the insurance industry struggles to sort out what type of compensation
may be due to each victim, increasing public cynicism suggests that the
five-year love affair with the personal pension may be cooling. Newspaper
headlines, detailing both the antics of unscrupulous sales agents and the
efforts of regulators to curb such activities have taken their toll on
sales.
After having sustained the insurance industry through the long years of the
recession, sales of new personal pension policies fell sharply in early
1994, according to data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
The number of new, single-premium personal pension policies - the type most
closely associated with transfers from occupational schemes - plummeted 44
per cent in the first quarter. Yearly premium policies also suffered, albeit
by a more modest margin. Total policy sales of this type fell to 286,000 in
the first quarter, from 335,000 in the first quarter of 1993, representing
the lowest figure for any quarter since 1989.
The data suggest that, in particular, the public is avoiding the traditional
with-profits personal pension policy, in which investment returns are
'smoothed' over the life of the contract by the insurance company. Sales of
annual and single-premium policies of this type fell to 142,000, from
204,000 in the first quarter, while unit-linked policies - the type sold
heavily through banks and building societies - took a more modest drop to
253,000 from 297,000 the year before.
Nor does the future look any more encouraging. From January, a tough new
disclosure regime will force sales agents to tell prospective customers much
more about how much each policy costs and how much the sales agent will earn
in commission.
Also, the Securities and Investments Board has cracked down on pension
transfers, setting rigorous guidelines intended to ensure that only those
who are actually better off with a personal pension are allowed to switch
out of their employers' scheme. Meanwhile, the National Association of
Pension Funds, the occupational pensions lobbying group, has called on
regulators to ban personal pension advertising showing 'telephone number'
calculations of benefits upon retirement.
Perhaps most important, the Department of Social Security has launched a
discussion paper for the introduction of so-called 'age-related rebates'.
This would end the system of National Insurance contribution rebates, which
have made personal pensions such an easy sell to young people by offering
them far more to opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme
(Serps) via a personal pension than they would receive if they remained in
it.
While the restructuring, due to take effect in April 1997, will encourage
each policyholder to keep his personal pension longer, it will undoubtedly
make the sales of new policies more difficult.
The implications of the sharp fall in sales are alarming, both for the
insurance industry and for government policymakers who have made personal
pensions a linchpin of their plan to devolve social security spending to
individuals.
So far, the government has shown no official sign that its commitment to
personal pensions is wavering. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
has reiterated his support for personal pensions, and said he will not
exercise his powers under the initial legislation to control either the
marketing of, or charges on, personal pensions.
But Treasury officials are said to be privately furious at the failure of
both the Department of Social Services and the self-regulatory bodies for
the retail financial services industry to control sales agents. The cost to
the public purse has been enormous.
Data from the DSS show that over Pounds 10.5bn in NI contribution rebates
were paid out between 1987 and December 1993, to encourage people to opt out
of Serps. However, because individuals can opt back in as they get older and
the tax incentives shrink, only a small portion of that expenditure will be
recouped in savings.
Moreover, the data show that significant numbers of personal pension holders
will actually be worse off in retirement than if they had remained in Serps.
Many are too old, or earned too little, to be entitled to NI rebates that
would buy them better benefits. For instance, DSS data show that, by April
1992, more than 296,000 men over the age of 45 and 206,000 women over 40 had
contracted out through personal pensions, even though they would have been
better off staying in Serps.
At that time, 49.9 per cent of all personal pension holders earned Pounds
8,000 or less. Rebates on earnings below Pounds 8,000, after taking account
of charges, offer pension benefits lower than those which could be obtained
by remaining in Serps.
Perhaps worst of all, the data suggest that little additional long-term
savings has been encouraged by personal pensions. By April 1992, only 40 per
cent of policyholders were contributing anything to their pension in
addition to the NI contribution rebate.
In the light of such damning statistics, the question remains whether
personal pensions have a future.
Ironically, the latest figures from the ABI show signs that perhaps the
industry is beginning to redeem itself by selling pensions to those for whom
they are truly the best, and indeed, only, alternative.
While a single quarter's sales cannot tell a whole story, regulators may
well be encouraged by what they see. All told, the data suggest that
finally, personal pension sales are being targeted at those for whom they
really are the best - and indeed, only - satisfactory way of making pension
savings.
First, the average annual personal pension contribution appears to be rising
to Pounds 940, from Pounds 800 a year ago. In 1989, the average contribution
was little more than Pounds 250 per year, a level at which, after charges,
little pension provision would be afforded.
Also, while the number of new policies is falling, premium income remained
broadly stable in the first quarter. Even if fewer people hold personal
pensions, the data suggest that those who do are those for whom personal
pensions are indeed a good deal.
Even more encouraging, renewed single-premium contracts - those to which a
new lump sum is added every year - actually rose in the first quarter, to
Pounds 257m, from Pounds 248m in 1993. These policyholders are more likely
to stay the course, and will not bear the punitive charges associated with
early terminations.
The tragedy of the personal pensions saga over the past year is that, for
many people, the product is a tax-efficient and effective way of ensuring a
reasonable standard of living upon retirement. The question is whether the
industry has the foresight to see that, by selling to those who cannot
possibly benefit, it risks alienating the public on whose goodwill its
survival depends.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Providers
favour Pep mortgages - What's new?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sudden impulse to promote Pep mortgages appears to have struck a number of
product providers simultaneously, immediately after a sharply critical
report on endowments from the Office of Fair Trading and shortly before the
arrival of compulsory disclosure of sales commissions.
Commissions on personal equity plans are much lower than on endowments,
typically 3 per cent plus a 0.5 per cent renewal commission. And, unlike
endowments, Peps do not involve heavy penalties if cashed in after a few
years. Peps are also being helped by the fact that most lenders have dropped
their insistence on assignment of savings destined to pay off a loan.
Legally, Peps cannot be assigned.
Scottish Provident's Precision Pep mortgage will consist of a unit trust
from SP's Prolific subsidiary packaged with a choice of insurance cover.
Investors can select up to five of the eight Prolific unit trusts qualifying
for Peps, paying in at least Pounds 50 per trust within the overall Pep
limit of Pounds 500 a month.
Charges on the trusts are an initial 5.25 per cent and an annual 1 per cent.
Investors will be able to switch the Prolific trusts held in the Pep free of
charge and the group will rebate any bid/offer spread.
The company says it will be up to investors to seek approval from lenders
for the use of the Pep to repay an interest-only loan. The onus will also be
on investors to check on the progress of their savings. Scottish Provident
says it will supply quotes on request but has no built-in review
arrangement.
Assuming 9 per cent investment growth and a 7.99 per cent mortgage rate,
Scottish Provident calculates that a non-smoking man, aged 35, with a Pounds
100,000 loan over 25 years, would pay Pounds 117 a month into the Precision
Pep, plus a term assurance premium of Pounds 30.95. This would bring the
total monthly mortgage payment to Pounds 773.84, including Pounds 625.89
interest net of tax relief to the lender.
Extra life, terminal illness and permanent disability cover add a further
Pounds 18.21 to the monthly payment, while a policy including critical
illness as well adds Pounds 43.45.
Among unit trusts qualifying for the Pep, Prolific UK Blue Chip was up by
2.75 per cent over one year to June 1, according to Micropal, and has grown
by 11.6 per cent a year since 1991. These figures were based on reinvestment
of net income, rather than the gross income available in a Pep.
Fidelity is selling its newly launched Pep mortgage either as a package with
life cover and a loan, or simply as a Pep acceptable to a list of 40
lenders.
The Pep mortgage offers a choice of 13 of Fidelity's unit trusts, focusing
on Fidelity Money Builder (a fund of funds), Fidelity High Income and
Fidelity UK Growth.
Over the past five years, Fidelity Money Builder has put on just under 9 per
cent a year, while Fidelity UK Growth has grown at close to 11 per cent
annually over the same period - both allowing for the Pep tax advantage.
Charges on the trusts are an initial 3 per cent and between 0.75 and 1.5 per
cent annually. (Money Builder carries an additional 0.5 per cent annual
charge).
The minimum monthly payment per trust in the Pep is Pounds 30, and there is
a 2 per cent switching fee which works out as a total switching cost of
between 3 and 3.5 per cent taking into account the bid/offer spread.
Five-yearly reviews are automatic, and investors will have the option of
paying off part of the capital with any surplus or of switching from the Pep
into a cash or gilts trust during the final years of the mortgage.
At launch, Fidelity's Pep mortgage package included a discounted-rate loan
from Bank of Ireland for up to 75 per cent of the property value, and term
assurance from Zurich Life at a 4 per cent discount.
For a man aged 35 paying off a Pounds 100,000 mortgage over 25 years,
Fidelity says the monthly Pep payment would be Pounds 97 (assuming 10.5 per
cent annual investment growth) plus a term assurance premium of Pounds
25.15.
Parents hoping to instil savings habits into holidaying children may want to
nudge offspring in the direction of a building society children's account,
possibly urging them to make careful comparison of the free inducements on
offer from different sources.
One of the latest in this category is Woolwich for Kids, which pays 4 per
cent gross on all balances and can be opened with Pounds 1. Add-ons include
membership of a Woolwich for Kids club, a twice-yearly magazine, a money-box
and birthday cards from Henry's Cat.
Existing club members who switch from an earlier version of the account to
the new account will automatically enter a competition with trips to Euro
Disney, Alton Towers or Thorpe Park as prizes.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Patience is
required in eastern Europe - Alternative investments / Starting in stamps
(4) / Although political volatility and related hazards may deter many
buyers, the region has the potential to be an interesting collecting field,

<TEXT>
The opening up of eastern Europe should inject some life into what has been
one of the more subdued sectors of the global stamp market. It has not
happened - yet.
There are ingrained problems which could take years to overcome. The
communist era created a mistrust in the postal history of these countries
among serious collectors - those spending Pounds 1,000 or more a year on
stamps. Many forgeries were produced, most of which were printed by the
authorities themselves. Sets of stamps were cancelled-by-order for sale
overseas, or specially created to celebrate some spurious event in order to
attract foreign currency. There were re-prints and re-runs.
In addition, the condition of stamps, stretching back to pre-communist days,
was not always of the quality taken for granted in the west, which speeded
up the deterioration of material and facilitated fakes.
There are few specialists in the region, and an overal lack of knowledge.
The political volatility there in the past five years has also acted as a
deterrent. Serious stamp collectors demand certainty. They are reluctant to
enter what could prove a philatelic minefield.
Some new collectors have been attracted by the political changes, but, to
date, they have been matched by traditional collectors who have seen the end
of communism as a natural break at which to disperse their acquisitions.
Supply and demand in this sector, always weak, seems to be in balance. So,
despite the fact that Russia is regarded as a 'classic' collecting area, you
can still accumulate a good holding of 19th century stamps from that country
for around 60 per cent of the cost of a comparable gathering of German and
French stamps.
That said, eastern Europe has the potential to be an interesting collecting
field. In pre-war days, Prague and Budapest, along with Vienna, were great
stamp-collecting centres. Experts from the main auction houses - Sotheby's,
Christie's, Phillips - and leading dealers like David Feldman, of Zurich,
and Stanley Gibbon have already visited the east to view the albums now
re-surfacing after decades in storage.
In the main, their visits have proved disappointing, with the albums viewed
often littered with fakes. But a stamp-collecting tradition is there, and
the philatelic world is well aware of the example of China (covered in
January's issue of the Quarterly Review). Increasing prosperity in that
country has made its postal history currently the most sought after in the
world. If eastern Europe, too, can produce a flow of new millionaires, its
stamps might well take off. For it is invariably nationals who create the
market for a country's postal history. The poverty in the east has ensured
that there have been few significant buyers of Russian stamps, for example,
although some emigrees in the US and Germany have maintained an interest in
eastern Europe.
By chance, the finest and most comprehensive collection of stamps from one
of the more interesting east European countries came up for sale at
Christie's in Zurich on June 15. Gary Ryan had been collecting the postal
history of Hungary for almost 50 years. Its dispersal (another auction is
scheduled for next year) should bring in over Pounds 1m.
The first part totalled Pounds 535,000, with a top price of Pounds 35,766
paid for the only 1867 50-Kreutzer pair used on a cover sent from Hungary to
Count Jean Palffy in France. Another rarity, the 'Magnifient 'Tab' Bisect',
the only cover from the town of Tab sold for Pounds 28,616. It is most
unusual because of the combination of stamps used to meet the 5Kr postal
rate between Tab and Pest, two 2Kr and a half of a 2Kr.
For many years Hungary was part of the Austrian Empire, which extends its
philatelic appeal to Austrian and German collectors. It also has an
interesting early history, and the Ryan collection contains pre-stamp covers
dating back to 1752.
A good omen was the appearance of more than 20 collectors from Hungary at
the auction. Like the other east European countries, interest in Hungarian
postal history comes only from committed collectors: this field has totally
escaped so far the investment element which played havoc with the stamp
market in the late 1970s - a havoc which only now is being laid to rest.
Of course, this does mean that there are bargains. You could amass a
seriously good collection of east European stamps for Pounds 20,000-plus.
For example, an early 20th century Russian stamp with an inverted centre
might cost Pounds 1,500. A similar rarity of the period from western Europe
might be 10 times that.
New buyers can acquire stamps in bulk quite cheaply. At Sotheby's general
stamp auction, on July 8, a complete collection of Bulgarian issues from
between 1945-1963 sold for less than Pounds 400, and a large Bulgarian
collection dating back to 1881 fetched Pounds 500-plus. And Bulgarian postal
history, with its ramifications as part of the Ottoman Empire, is one of the
more interesting.
Anyone of a romantic disposition may warm to eastern European stamps. There
are the nations that briefly issued their own postage in the distant past,
like Moldavia, which are now issuing them again. Moldavia has, in fact, a
classic following, especially for its 'Bull' issue of 1858, stamps that have
topped Pounds 10,000.
Turkestan, long part of the Russian Empire, and philatelically ignored,
could provide interesting items of postal history. The break up of
Yugoslavia offers a new collecting field, with links back to Turkish issues
of a century ago.
Russia could resume its place as a classic postal history, although it will
take time for collectors to buy with total confidence. For example, the
White Russians briefly isued their own postage in 1918, but around 85 per
cent of the stamps that have appeared on the market since are reckoned to be
forgeries.
East Europe offers the chance of valuable discoveries for the brave, but it
will take time for knowledge to grow on the back of prosperity for the full
potential of a fascinating postage to become more widely appreciated.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): Upset by fears
of inflation - The professionals / After a disappointing quarter, the four
differ in their views of what will happen next
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second quarter of 1994 proved difficult for most investors, including
the four fund managers who prepare our suggested portfolios.
Most were more positive at the end of the first quarter but have been
disappointed by continued inflationary fears which have held back bond and
equity markets.
The most cautious in April was Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford, who
warned that US interest rate rises had 'worrying implications for most
markets.' He raised his cash position to 15 per cent three months ago, and
is staying liquid now.
Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, admits: 'We had the
foresight to predict the necessity, the inevitability and even the timing of
the correction, but we underestimated its severity in respect of the retreat
in European bond and equity markets - most particularly in the UK.' He is
now more optimistic and argues that 'the much higher risk premiums now
priced into bonds and many equities are not justified.'
Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, says: 'In spite of the volatility we have
seen in equities during the last quarter, we continue to believe that the
economic fundamentals favour shares over bonds.'
The most bullish of the four is Paul Myners, of Gartmore, who says that 'not
only should investors hold stocks and bonds but, after recent setbacks, they
should seek to be fully invested.'
Howard Beaufort: 'The first half of the year has been a far from happy
experience for most investors. However, the second quarter has seen a
noteworthy stability in Far East markets including Japan, and our portfolio
has benefited both from this and from other strategic changes including a
reduction in the European equity content from 15 to 10 per cent.
'We are still very inclined to the view that what we have witnessed so far
this year is a significant correction rather than the beginnings of a major
bear market. Securities markets overshot on the upside last year because of
speculative leveraging and are now overshooting on the downside because of
deleveraging and its impact upon investor confidence.'
'Highest quality bonds now offer excellent medium-term value, and many
equities have the potential to enjoy higher multiples if they can deliver a
reliable growing earnings and dividends stream. But specific stock risk is
high in an environment of structural change, intense competition and weak
pricing power.'
Douglas McDougall: 'Three months ago, we commented that a tightening of
liquidity in the US was raising problems for all markets, and that equity
valuations around the world were high by traditional standards and
discounting a substantial economic recovery. We raised our cash target from
10 to 15 per cent, reducing each of the principal equity sectors tightly.
'This has proved a good decision, but the benefit was diluted by holding the
cash in US dollars, which we thought would benefit from interest rate
movements.
'Bond yields are now very high in relation to imminent inflation. The bear
market in bonds has been self-feeding as speculative holders have been
forced to sell. Bonds on the whole look cheap but may face further
difficulties while this liquidity squeeze persists. Equities are not cheap,
despite their falls, and may find it hard to make progress while bond yields
are so high.'
'Despite the weakness of most equity markets, we are not yet prepared to
reduce our cash position from 15 per cent. We do however feel that the case
for the dollar has weakened and will now hold half the cash in sterling.
Within the equity portfolio, we are moving 2 per cent from south east Asia
to the UK.'
Tim Howe: 'Economic recovery in Europe appears to be both stronger and
earlier than we had forecast and as a consequence, although interest rates
remain on a downward trend, the extent of their reduction is likely to be
less than we had previously thought. Elsewhere, with the exception of Japan,
the prospect of rising interest rates is real, As a result, we continue to
see little prospect of capital gain from fixed interest markets.
'In the UK, we feel that large internationally oriented stocks are likely to
outperform their smaller, more domestically biased brethren.
'At the end of the first quarter, we reduced our continental European
weighting and we are quite happy to hold our exposure there at a relatively
low level.
'We are happy with our US position but our holdings are biased in favour of
domestic stocks. In spite of political turmoil in Japan, we believe that
this market offers the most attractive prospects over the coming months and
we are increasing our weighting further.'
Paul Myners: 'Seldom have the fortunes of the world's major stock and bond
markets been so closely interlinked. Stocks are currently moved almost
entirely by bonds and bonds are broadly subject to the same force.
'The real question facing any private investor is: 'Do I own any long-term
assets at all in these circumstances?' The question of bonds or equities,
Asia or Europe, is this time far less important. All markets will rise or
fall by the same dynamic.
'We believe that the first leg down in markets was a reaction to a change in
fundamentals and was justified. Hence our decision to hold cash at the last
year end. Subsequent declines are an over-reaction, however, and present a
buying opportunity.
'The move in bonds overstates the inflationary threat. The relief for
equities is likely to come from lower bond yields; that is, bonds are likely
to lead equities. Furthermore, in most markets the relationship between
bonds and equities looks strained in favour of bonds.
'If we are wrong, bonds may not rise, but they are unlikely to fall much
further. In a static market, bond yields are sufficiently high to compensate
investors. In the case of equities, however, current bond yields could take
a further toll on valuation.
'Overall we do not believe any changes to our portfolio are merited this
quarter, although nimble investors should do better in bonds than equities.'
This feature is an allocation exercise, to see how four managers handle a
Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice.
They emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more)
rather than short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of
October 1990, and the portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning
of this month.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Fund managers
stay close to the benchmarks - Bonds / There is a broad view that government
bonds, in Europe particularly, must be close to their lows, though
conviction is lacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite some recent flickers of a revival in the fortunes of the world's
bond markets, the first half of 1994 has been a bleak period for bond
investors.
Since the US Federal Reserve reversed its easing policy by hiking short-term
interest rates on February 4, the world's bond markets have entered a
bearish phase, marked by high volatility and a decline in liquidity, which
have combined to create the most difficult conditions many traders and
institutional investors can remember.
In the UK, 10-year gilt yields had risen more than 2 1/2 points since the
beginning of January, to 8.64 per cent at the end of June. Longer-dated
gilts have fared even worse.
While there is now a broad consensus that bond markets, at current levels,
offer good value in theory, the lesson of the past six months has been that
other factors can override the dictates of economic fundamentals.
Although there has been sporadic talk of hedge funds moving back into bonds,
the current environment does not favour large bets on the direction of the
markets, due to the persistence of volatile trading conditions.
Instead, most fund managers are tending to stay close to one of the
benchmark government bond indices, such as J P Morgan or Salomon Brothers,
and trying to improve returns by 'spread-trading' - that is, taking
positions on the relative performance of two markets.
However, while battle-weary fund managers and traders still lack real
conviction, there is a broad view that government bonds, in Europe
particularly, must be close to their lows, that the unwinding of long
positions has taken its course and that it could be time to buy selectively.
There is certainly a case for arguing that the sell-off in bond markets has
been overdone relative to equities. Some analysts believe that high
expectations on corporate earnings in the US, based on ambitious economic
growth targets, may not come through. Further, the steepening of yield
curves across most markets makes it increasingly unattractive for managers
to stay in cash, earning short-term interest rates, for very long.
'I think we will see an appreciation of bond prices,' said Mr Rob Gambi,
manager, international fixed interest and currencies at AMP Asset
Management, the London-based fund management arm of the Australian insurance
company. 'But yields will not suddenly fall 200 basis points, back to their
lows earlier this year. It is not going to be a one-way bet.' Consequently,
the predominant strategies are likely to be defensive.
'Investors will start going into core markets (such as Germany), then
extending duration, and only then moving into high-yielding markets (such as
Italy),' said Mr Adrian James, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets.
He added that the first stage has been reached, with investors putting money
into the short end of the core markets. This has already caused the
differential between three-month and two-year rates in markets such as
Germany to start to narrow.
There has also been some improvement in the performance of core markets
recently. In June, the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were the
only markets in the J P Morgan government bond index to post positive
returns - though all returned less than 1 per cent.
'We had quite a lot of cash until the end of March and we have been
gradually putting money to work in the European bond markets, but we prefer
the core markets, specifically Germany,' said Mr Nick Henderson, head of
fixed interest at Gartmore, the UK fund management group. 'The inflation
dynamics are more favourable than elsewhere in Europe.'
'We see value in Germany over the US, particularly in the long end of the
yield curve,' said Mr Gambi. 'Inflation worries have been overdone and the
story on capital shortage has been overdone.'
He also thinks that the gilts market has been oversold, and that the yield
spread between the UK and Germany could narrow from its current level of
about 175 basis points to around 120 basis points.
Another attraction is the high real yields currently on offer in some
markets, for example Canadian government bonds are currently offering real
interest rates of about 9 per cent. At a yield spread of 200 basis points
over the US, the market also offers good relative value.
On the high-yielding markets, such as Spain, Italy and Sweden, investors
remain rather cautious. Although they are seen as offering good value,
investors have been concerned by the lack of liquidity in these markets
during periods of extreme volatility.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Building
a portfolio) (16): Targets are missed as the market turns down - There were
two purchases and two sales in a quarter that saw the portfolio fall
slightly
</HEADLINE>

The young man strapped me into the Sega R360 simulator - a space
capsule-like machine that looked so fearsome that even Sing Yu, my
normally-adventurous 12-year-old daughter, refused to go in it.
Soon, much to the amusement of an ever-increasing crowd, I was rapidly
moving upwards, downwards, sideways and upside down. At the same time, I was
using several of the controls to try to destroy a number of enemy vehicles.
At the end of the game, the machine came to a stop and the young man helped
me out of the capsule. 'Are you all right?' he inquired, anxiously. 'It's
the first time anyone has landed the capsule upside down.'
'Daddy,' said Sing Yu, 'you only managed to hit three of the targets - and
there were hundreds of them.'
My experiences in the Sega R360 are rather like my adventures in the stock
market during the past quarter. The portfolio has missed a number of its
targets, moved in several directions, and ended gently down. However, I did
warn in the last issue of the Review that I felt there would be a downturn
in the market. I therefore set stop-loss limits for the portfolio's
holdings. I also suggested buying-levels for certain shares, in the hope
that a market fall would bring them to more attractive levels.
Although there was a steep market fall, none of the portfolio's holdings
breached its stop-loss level. But my Market Eye share-prices screen did
bleep when Meggitt (an engineering company) and OIS International Inspection
Services reached the levels I had set for them as possible 'buys': 80p and
60-65p respectively. As mentioned in the spring Review, I was also keen on
market research group Taylor Nelson AGB.
But what could I do? The portfolio had ended the last quarter with only
Pounds 1,276 in cash: not enough to spread around three new investments.
Fortunately, by the time Meggitt's share price approached 80p, I had
received a copy of its annual report. The chairman's statement, dated April
27, mentioned that the market for Meggitt's products had 'continued to be
somewhat erratic'. As the portfolio has to adopt a relatively cautious
approach, I decided not to 'buy' any Meggitt shares.
If Meggitt looked as if it was finding business rather tough, it was likely
that some other engineering groups, too, might be experiencing similar
conditions. The portfolio had a rather heavy weighting towards the
engineering sector, with shares in EIS and Alvis, so I decided to sell all
the shares in EIS for 405p each in May.
EIS's chairman, in the company's annual report dated May 6, commented:
'Overall there is no sign of recovery in the demand for capital goods, and
the aircraft and defence manufacturing sectors remained particularly
depressed.'
Although EIS's 1993 profits were higher than in 1992, I felt it best to take
a modest profit on a holding originally 'bought' for 375p per share. Had I
sold at the time I wrote my last Review article (April 5), I could have
achieved a price of 433p.
I also contemplated selling Alvis shares, especially when the company
announced, on June 16, its interim figures. For the six months to March 31,
pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.24m, compared with Pounds 2.19m for the
similar period the previous year. These figures disappointed the market, and
the shares dropped 6p in one day. But they did not fall to my 50-52p
stop-loss level.
I feel Alvis is a share to be held for the longer term, particularly in view
of its large shareholding in the separately quoted Avimo Singapore. Also,
there remain many trouble spots around the world where Alvis's new versatile
wheeled utility vehicle ought to do well.
I was less patient with Pointon York BRI Director Dealings unit trust. The
portfolio bought units in January at 109.11p each. By the end of the last
quarter they had dropped to 101.29p. When they fell below 100p, I thought
the portfolio should sell, bearing in mind market conditions at that time.
The portfolio therefore sold its holding at the beginning of June for 96.01p
per unit.
These sales produced a useful level of cash, so the portfolio could take
another look at Taylor Nelson AGB. John Treasure, chairman of the company,
stated in the annual report (dated April 5): 'With increased confidence and
even stronger finances than last year, we aim to continue our planned growth
in 1994.' Operating profits for the year to December 31 were Pounds
4,149,000 - an increase of 41 per cent on the previous year. The portfolio
therefore 'bought' 8,000 shares at 30p per share.
At the end of April, when the last Review was published, OIS International
shares were 66p each - having fallen from 82p earlier in the year. When the
shares fell within my 60-65p buying range, it seemed clear that market
conditions would drive them even lower, so I waited until the market showed
signs of slightly more stability before 'buying' 6,000 at 55p each in June.
I still like Renishaw, mentioned in the last Review, but there are also a
number of other companies that I shall be monitoring for the portfolio, in
case further market falls present good buying opportunities.
The companies which, at lower levels, might have some appeal are Portals,
now that the De La Rue bid hopes have faded; Hi-Tec, the sports footwear and
leisure wear group; speciality chemicals companies Canning Group and
Yorkshire Chemicals; British Polythene Industries, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle
and United Biscuits.
Obviously, the portfolio has insufficient funds to buy shares in more than
one of these, unless it sold one or more of its current holdings.
Although Pentland's performance has so far proved rather disappointing for
the portfolio, hopefully, in the longer term, it might outperform. Allied
Colloids announced its full-year figures to April 2, on June 7 and confirmed
my faith in the company's strong management: profits up by 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 45.9m, in spite of a 15 per cent drop in interim profits. There was
also a forecast of 'better growth in profits' in the current year.
To safeguard the portfolio against any sharp falls in the market, I will set
stop-loss levels as follows: Allied Colloids (210-215p), Alvis (40p), OIS
(40-42p), Pentland (80p), William Ransom (38p), Taylor Nelson AGB (24p) -
although, in the event of any bad news, the shares could be sold before they
reach these levels.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund
has a small holding in Alvis, William Ransom, OIS and Pentland.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional
reports) (15): Tigers snared by Tokyo's rise and the dollar's ills
</HEADLINE>

Stock markets in south-east Asia suffered during the second quarter as a
result of Japan's rise. Moreover, since most of the region's currencies are
pegged to the dollar, the poor performances of both it and of the US stock
markets also affected these markets.
Hong Kong fell 6.3 per cent on the quarter, and while markets in Malaysia
and Singapore have risen from the levels posted at the end of March, the
FT-Actuaries indices suggest that Kuala Lumpur has declined by 24.1 per cent
and Singapore by 13.9 per cent since the beginning of the year.
While analysts regard the effects of the rise in US interest rates on
Pacific Rim markets with caution, the recovery in the US economy offers
encouragement for export-oriented countries such as Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, Singapore and Korea. Growth rates for the Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand economies are expected to be around 8 per cent, while Indonesia may
see its economy grow by 7 per cent.
Mr Nick Allan, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong
Kong, is also positive about India, where the economy is moving towards a
free market and the middle class is expanding.
Korea has emerged from a slowdown that began three years ago, and a rise in
external demand is expected to support growth. The rise in foreign
investment limits, from 10 per cent of a listed company to 15 per cent, may
also attract further foreign funds to the country. One worry is inflation,
which could prompt tightening by monetary authorities.
Most analysts maintain a cautious stance on Hong Kong and Taiwan, which have
been hit by the US tightening its monetary policy. These markets are also
vulnerable to economic tightening in China, where government officials are
becoming increasingly worried about the overheating of the economy. Taiwan,
however, is still expecting firm economic growth of around 6 per cent for
the year, which should provide an incentive for investors in the long run.
Meanwhile, Japanese investors have woken up to the fact that politics may
not affect markets. For the past six months, political instability has had
little impact on the Tokyo stock market, which rose 6.9 per cent on the
quarter, according to the FT-Actuaries World indices.
Since the beginning of the year, Tokyo has jumped 14.7 per cent; while the
increase is even more impressive in dollar terms, at 29.8 per cent. The
market has benefited from increased purchases by overseas investors, largely
from the US, attracted by heightened prospects of a recovery in the economy
and corporate earnings this year.
However, as US interest rates have gradually risen, on fears of inflation,
the level of liquidity flowing into Japan from international investors has
shown signs of decreasing. Investors wondering whether or not it is too late
to jump in will need to give the market a second look.
For those intending to move their funds in and out within a span of six
months or less, Tokyo may not offer the attractive returns it did for the
first half of the year. Domestic institutional investors have been slow in
following foreign funds into the stock market, and although many analysts
see the Nikkei's floor at around 20,000, an upward boost in the near term
seems remote.
Although political turmoil seems to pose little threat to share prices,
domestic investors are nervous about the continued strength in the yen and
potential sell-offs due to positions accumulated through technical trading.
The key to investor confidence will be the previews of interim corporate
earnings ahead of book-closing in September. The effects of the yen's
strength can also be expected to be quantified and discounted into share
prices.
Over a longer term, however, the potential recovery for corporate earnings
may give investors favourable returns. According to Merrill Lynch, in Tokyo,
on conservative estimates corporate earnings could grow by 152 per cent in
the next five years, against real economic growth of 2.7 per cent. This
suggests a 42 per cent potential rise in the Nikkei, with a large part of
the increase coming in the first two to three years.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional
reports) (14): US analysts are cautious on third-quarter earnings growth

Although the second quarter of 1994 had few of the nasty shocks that so
paralysed the US stock market in the first three months of the year, it
still proved a difficult period for traders and investors.
After staging a halting rally from April through to mid-May, share prices
turned tail in the closing weeks of the quarter. Between June 14 and June
30, the market lost all of the 6 per cent gain it had earned in the previous
nine weeks.
Those losses meant that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen for two
consecutive quarters for the first time since 1984.
By the close of trading on the quarter's final day, the Dow stood at
3,624.96, down 11 points points, or 0.3 per cent since March 31. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was at 444.27, having fallen less than two points
during the quarter; while the Nasdaq composite index, under pressure from
heavily-sold technology stocks, finished at 705.96, down 38 points, or 5 per
cent.
As in the first three months of the year, trading during the quarter was
dominated by rising interest rates. From the start, the market struggled to
make much headway amid concern that the Federal Reserve would tighten
monetary policy further in an attempt to cool down the overheating economy
and stifle inflation. When the Fed did raise rates, pushing the federal
funds rate from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent on April 18, share prices
dropped sharply.
Yet, within a week, the market psychology began to change. From fearing
another rate increase, Wall Street started to look forward to one, with
analysts judging that one more tightening of monetary policy would be enough
to appease the inflation-sensitive bond market without inflicting serious
damage on equity market sentiment.
Consequently, when the Fed raised rates again in mid-May, the stock market
rallied. At the time, investors assumed that the Fed had finished raising
interest rates, at least for the rest of the summer. Thus, over the next
month the Dow advanced 140 points, or 4 per cent, to peak at 3,814.83 on
June 14.
The gains were fuelled by the belief that long-term interest rates had
stabilised - the yield on the long bond was hovering around 7.35 per cent
for most of that time - and that the settled outlook for monetary policy,
combined with still-growing corporate earnings, would revive investor demand
for stocks.
Those quietly optimistic expectations, however, were overshadowed in the
final weeks by several external factors which conspired to drag prices lower
across the board. They were: rising commodity prices, which revived the bond
market's inflation jitters, the political crisis in the Korean peninsula,
and a weak dollar. The last of these inflicted the most damage, as the US
currency's plunge below Y100 against the yen sent stock and bond prices
tumbling, amid predictions that the Fed would have to raise interest rates
to protect the ailing dollar.
By the end of June, the growing feeling that the markets had overreacted to
the dollar's decline, and that another rate increase was not on the cards,
suggested the third quarter might get off to a positive start. Yet analysts
cautioned that the expected downturn in the economy during the second half
of the year would probably slow the rate of corporate earnings growth over
the summer.
In Mexico, the stock market plunged 19 per cent in the opening two weeks of
the quarter after US interest rates were raised, but then rallied strongly
in late April after US, Canada and Mexico signed an arrangement for fighting
exchange rate turbulence among their currencies. For the remainder of the
quarter, fears of higher US interest rates and continuing political problems
with the rebels in Chiapas held prices back, and the IPC index ended the
quarter at 2,262.6, down 150 points, or 6 per cent.
As on Wall Street, Canadian stocks were troubled throughout the second
quarter by rising domestic interest rates. Over the three months, the
Toronto Stock Exchange composite index fell more than 300 points, or 7 per
cent, to end at 4,025.25.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional
reports) (13): Long bonds and cash are recommended for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe was not a happy home for investors' money in the second quarter of
1994. Measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the continent's equity
markets fell by 6 per cent in local currency terms in the three months to
June 30.
The writing was on the wall three months ago. Among other professionals, Mr
Bert Jansen, of Paribas Capital Markets, said then that weakness in global
bond markets would hit continental equities, regardless of growing evidence
of economic recovery. He said, too, that European equities were overvalued
in absolute, and in relative, terms.
Country by country, the worst performer in the second quarter was France,
down 9.3 per cent. With the weakening dollar adding to its woes, the Paris
market was depressed by higher interest rates and rising raw-material
prices. Over the quarter, too, the weight of new equity issues, threatening
the sated institutional investor, was perceived earlier than in neighbouring
countries.
At the level of individual companies, arguments about investment in
cyclical, or defensive stocks, with markets in general going down, carried
less weight than they had in the first quarter.
Among the constituents of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, Daimler Benz and
Deutsche Bank, two of Germany's biggest blue chips, did almost equally badly
in the second quarter of 1994, falling by 13.5 and by 14.5 per cent
respectively. The automotive, engineering and defence combine was depressed
by an upcoming DM3bn rights issue; and the senior bank was weighed down by
its exposure to debt markets, property scandals and other corporate
debacles, and by talk of management changes.
However, some of the front-line cyclicals, which showed up well in the first
three months of this year, continued to outperform in the second quarter.
The restructured industrial conglomerate Montedison nearly topped the
Eurotrack 100 performance charts with a rise of 10.2 per cent in local
currency terms over three months, after coming a resounding first over six
months with a gain of more than 68 per cent, extending its recovery from a
low base. In the automotive sector, Fiat came first and Volvo fourth, with
gains of 14 and 9.8 per cent respectively.
The extremes of performance tie in with observations by Mr Peter J.
Sullivan, an assistant vice-president with Merrill Lynch in London. He
detects a clear conflict between the greater than expected economic
strength, indicated by high-yielding bond markets and a weak dollar, and the
forces that they set up to dampen the cyclical recovery.
Merrill Lynch has moderated its aggressive cyclical stance without
abandoning it: increasing its recommended weighting in utilities and
modestly reducing its commitment to Germany, which is very much based on a
strong cyclical recovery.
That, of course, is advice for institutional investors. Some of them,
unfortunately, are forced by trust deeds or their own trustees to be fully
invested. For private investors, strategists are recommending higher
holdings of cash and, given high bond yields and low inflation, up to twice
as much weighting in long-term bonds as in equities at the moment.
It is not all gloom for ordinary shares. Most economic growth forecasts on
the continent have been revised upwards during the second quarter - except
Italy - while inflation forecasts have been revised down.
In that connection, however, there are worries about commodity-based stocks,
strong recently on economic recovery prospects and on booming commodity
prices - Elf Aquitaine and Total, the French oil companies, and Union
Miniere of Belgium figured high in the Eurotrack second quarter charts.
The longer that bond yields stay at their present high level, goes the
argument, the more there will be questions about growth prospects. Also,
commodity-based stocks are the current favourite of hedge funds, which
pulled out of European bonds, with serious damage to the latter, from last
January onwards.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (12):
London looks to year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first half of 1994 has delivered a drubbing to UK equities that will not
quickly be forgotten, and the second quarter came to an end with little sign
of a change in the climate.
The problems, which started when the US Federal Reserve began tightening
monetary policy in February, continued to grind away, and share prices fell
as bond yields soared across Europe and in the US. The London stock market
fell by about 5.4 per cent over the second quarter, or some 16 per cent from
the peak recorded in early February.
The fundamental tension between bond and equity yields has undermined other
factors in UK equities, including signs of economic recovery and even the
steady flow of dividend increases from British companies. Equity strategists
have repeatedly pointed to the attractive valuations on good-quality
equities, only to see their words swept aside by renewed 'volatility' in
bond markets.
The slaughter in the UK bond market has been largely caused by developments
outside the UK. Constant worry about when the US Federal Reserve would
tighten again have effectively outweighed downward trends in Germany and
France. Britain, with its hopes for a final cut in base rates now replaced
by fears that the next move will be upward, has often seemed helpless in the
sway of decisions elsewhere.
Bears would warn that share prices have further to fall. Higher interest
rates may be just round the corner, and would affect a UK economic recovery
still struggling to reach the man in the street. Consumer spending is still
cautious rather than carefree, the housing market constantly disappoints,
and unemployment remains a serious problem.
The more rational underpinning for the bear argument, put by Mr Brian
Hilliard, of Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe
Generale, is that fears of inflation have not been allayed and that 'the Fed
will have to tighten policy further'. He sees the peak in US bond yields as
unlikely to arrive until the end of the year, and 'probably later'.
It is almost common ground in the UK stock market that equities will make no
serious recovery until the bond market settles down. And the bond markets,
in Europe and in the US, have had weakness in the US dollar added to their
problems.
However, even the most bearish analysts in London are prepared to put a time
limit on their bearishness. Most believe that the FT-SE 100 index will
recover ground before the end of the year as economic recovery, in the form
of higher corporate earnings and dividends, makes its presence felt.
economic recovery than most other countries in Europe. While this may imply
the likelihood of higher domestic interest rates, a beleagured government
can be expected to postpone them as long as possible.
For the investment fund manager, the UK market is becoming a test of nerve
rather than an area of rational endeavour. It is difficult to put cash into
a market that can still move through a range of 1.5 per cent in a single
session, and rise or fall by a net 2 per cent just by following gilt-edged
securities. But a steady level of daily retail business totals of Pounds
1bn-plus indicates that there is no shortage of institutional money waiting
for markets to settle down.
If the Group of Seven countries can agree to calm the dollar, and if global
bond markets can take a more rational view of inflation, UK equities have a
great deal of ground to make up. But a dividend yield of over 4 per cent is
unlikely to be neglected by investors for very long.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (11):
Accentuating the positive - Tokyo has risen while other markets have fallen,
and foreign investors have done particularly well. Is this the moment to put
money into one of the new Japanese funds?
</HEADLINE>

Japan, in the second quarter of the year, was one of the few markets to buck
the global decline. Fund managers overweight in Tokyo this year should have
a nice story for their trustees, or at least some significant paper gains to
set against losses on Wall Street, London and the main European markets.
Sterling- and dollar-based investors in Japan were helped by the strong yen
and continued buying by foreign investors.
The Nikkei 225 index marked a two-year high in mid-June, and showed a total
return in the quarter, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World indices, of
almost 8 per cent in sterling terms, and some 50 per cent more for
dollar-based investors.
Given Japan's high weighting in the world equity index, reading Tokyo
correctly has been a key factor for investment returns.
But who got the weightings right? Most fund managers keep their investment
decisions close to their chests, but if market gossip is anything to go by,
end-June valuations should be good for Nikko Securities, the Dutch Robeco
funds and Germany's Commerz International Capital Management. Commerz is
believed to have doubled its Japanese exposure at the end of March.
Against the negative total return globally for sterling investors in the
quarter (minus 0.5 per cent ), assuming weighted averages across the FT
world index, what should be the next move?
The terrible twins of fear and greed continue to drive most markets, and
fear is now in the ascendancy, not least because of chaos and confusion in
global bond markets and the associated concern over higher interest rates,
especially in the United States.
Brave new investors in Japan need to leave fear behind, and concentrate
instead on hope. The Nikkei has done well this year, especially for
non-Japanese investors, and a number of new Japanese unit (and mutual) funds
are about to be unleashed in both London and New York.
But is Japan right for tapping? Even greater political uncertainty comes
with the arrival of an untried socialist prime minister heading a coalition
government which has, in effect, given many of the levers of power back to
the long-ruling right-wing Liberal Democrats. The crucial trade talks with
Washington are getting nowhere fast, and the yen is ever-rising. On the
surface, this is not a good investment scenario.
But there are targets to aim at. The higher yen hits exports, but almost
certainly it will be an excuse for Japanese companies to become even more
efficient, to trim paternalistic work practices and to shed surplus labour.
The OECD's latest projection of economic growth sees real GDP output in
Japan rising sharply in 1995.
Another target is the Nikkei index itself. It has been fair weather so far
this year, but the end-June close of 20,600 is still little more than half
its high of 1989. Some optimistic Tokyo market-watchers think that, over
time, markets, like water, reach their own level; and that, in the long
haul, why should Japan, coming out of recession and with some encouraging
corporate profit forecasts, buck this trend? For non-Japanese holders, the
currency factor is also an important consideration.
A significant factor could be the non-Japanese investment overhang. A number
of American and (even more) European funds got into Tokyo at the top of the
market, and many are waiting to cash in at original investment levels, given
that the earnings yield is negligible. But other funds switched to Japan
earlier this year, and are in for the long haul and for the market (and
economic) recovery. As long as the Japanese currency remains strong, they
are likely to maintain global weightings in Tokyo.
Japan is certainly not without risk, but a strong combination of domestic
deregulation and a heavy Yen could transform the Japanese economy. The
Nikkei seems to have a floor at around the 20,000 level, but the upside
could be significant in the medium term.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Yesterday's
panic has helped to cool tomorrow's expectations - Homes / Houses may be
cheap. But John Plender explains why ownership is unlikely to be such a
rewarding investment in the foreseeable future as it was for those who got
their timing right in the 1960s and 1970s

The golden rule for investors in the British housing market is no different
from the golden rule in any other market. Although in the long run house
prices tend to rise broadly in line with earnings, timing is all-important
for those who hope for significant appreciation in the value of their home.
There have been three crashes in the housing market since 1973. The first
two, in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, appeared relatively painless,
because nominal house prices did not actually fall. Yet there were big
declines in real terms, after adjusting for inflation, especially in the
1970s.
Between the peak of the boom in 1973 and the depth of the market in the
latest crash, house prices showed negligible real growth. If, on the other
hand, you take the period from early 1970 to mid-1989, the increase in value
would have been more than 100 per cent. For most people that return would
have been further enhanced, because they financed the outlay largely with
borrowed money.
In terms of affordability, houses are now historically cheap in relation to
earnings. That is a good reason for anyone whose first consideration is not
investment performance to consider buying. But there is a fair chance that
housing will continue to look cheap. The factors that made it such a good
investment for so many people in the post-war period are no longer working
uniformly in its favour.
Superficially, the short-term outlook might seem conducive to a fillip. The
economy is, after all, in its third year of recovery; unemployment is coming
down at a much earlier stage than in the previous economic cycle; and real
earnings have recently been rising at an annual rate of close to 4 per cent.
A big overhang of supply has been reduced to more normal levels.
Because over a million of those who bought for the first time in the late
1980s still have negative equity - borrowings in excess of the value of
their home - the housing ladder has broken down. There is no demand from
these people for the homes of those on the higher rungs of the ladder. Nor
can they sell to the next batch of first-time buyers. One result is an
abnormally low volume of transactions for the stage of the cycle. Another is
that prices are underpinned by a shortage of supply. But there are now a
number of powerful factors militating against another boom, starting with
demography.
The number of first-time buyers is always a crucial determinant of the level
of demand in the housing market. Yet there is very little pent-up demand
from this source, because of the distortions created by the last boom. So
frenetic was the house-price spiral in the 1980s that the younger age groups
bought in a panic. UBS Global Research points out that, between 1982 and
1988, the proportion of 18-24 year olds buying their first home grew by 103
per cent, whereas the proportion of the 30-34 age group buying first homes
grew by only 35 per cent. In other words, young people brought forward their
purchases. Demand that might normally have been expected to emerge now has
already been unleashed.
Demographics will also act as a damper on the market in the longer run.
After hitting its peak in 1964, the baby boom tailed off sharply. This
implies that the number of people in their twenties will shrink through the
rest of the decade, thereby further reducing the pressure of demand.
A second constraint on price rises stems from changes in the tax system. Tax
relief for mortgage interest was a political shibboleth in the Thatcher era,
and, since the value of the relief was capitalised in house prices, it
operated as a subsidy for existing home owners at the expense of first-time
buyers. In the 1990s the level of mortgage on which the relief is available
has been capped at Pounds 30,000, causing its value to fall in real terms
with inflation, while the relief itself was reduced in April from 25 to 20
per cent, and will shrink to 15 per cent in April 1995.
Yet it is not just the specific tax arrangements for home ownership that
matter. Any general reduction in post-tax incomes is important, since
lenders relate the size of their mortgage advance to the post-tax incomes of
the borrower. Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, has estimated that
the reduction in mortgage interest relief is equivalent to a  1/4 per cent
rise in the mortgage rate; and that the more general decline in homebuyers'
mortgage servicing capacity, due to the latest bout of fiscal tightening, is
equivalent to a total increase in interest rates of 1 3/4 per cent.
When taken together with the rising cost of fixed-interest mortgages, which
have responded to the upward pull of yields in the gilt-edged market since
February, this acts as a powerful restraining influence on prices. So, too,
does the renewed caution of building societies and banks. Having been burned
in the boom, they are lending on a lower percentage of the value of houses
than in the 1980s.
In London, admittedly, where City bonuses are finding their way into
investment in housing, prices in some areas have risen sharply. Yet the City
is now caught in a squall, as interest rates rise again, and building
societies have been revising downwards their assumptions about house-price
increases across the country. Meanwhile, a more active market in private
rented accommodation has emerged.
For the moment, the speculative investment premium has gone out of the
housing market. That may not mean that the British psyche has been fully
purged of the urge to own. But short of another general bout of inflation,
which can never be ruled out, home ownership is unlikely to be such a
rewarding investment in the foreseeable future as it was for those who got
their timing right in the 1960s and 1970s.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Don't laugh
when the penny drops - Tightwad's tips / Even if we have no need to watch
the coppers, it's fun. Here's a primer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You know me, or someone similar. My Christmas cards last year carried
generic 2nd class stamps - the blue ones last sold on October 31 1993. I
suspect I have enough, bought at 18p, to get me through next Christmas too.
But, you may object, what's the point of saving a penny each time you send a
letter? The way I see it, each stamp is a discounted security which, if used
12 months after I bought it, will have given me a 5.5 per cent tax-free
return.
Yes, I'm a tightwad. Like many FT readers, I can afford not to watch every
penny, but I do. Part of it is involuntary - inherited from parents who
haven't forgotten the 1930s - but a large part of it is a mixture of fun and
sheer cussedness.
Why should you pay more for something than you need to? Why not save on
small things to justify splashing out on big ones?
Watching the pennies is still no substitute for making the pounds in the
first place, but the skills honed in scrimping do not go amiss when much
larger sums are at stake.
Mean, perhaps, but not mean-spirited. We are certainly not talking about
asking 'who had the peas?' when paying the restaurant bill. In fact, many of
the tightwads I know are also the most generous people around. They get
their kicks from making 'victimless' economies, from beating the system
rather than being cheap with their friends and family.
Here are basic tips for the tightwad:
Make the most of 'free' cash. Use it for as long as you can without paying
for the privilege. The credit card - used wisely - is your main weapon here.
Make purchases with cards at every opportunity, and pay the bill off in full
just before the due date. You not only will write fewer cheques, but the
account statements give a concise summary of your expenditure.
Make the most of your own cash. If it is going to lie idle, even for a short
period, make sure it's earning as much as possible. Have your salary paid
into a higher-interest account, rather than a current account. Arrange a
regular transfer of your foreseeable monthly outgoings just before the
largest payment (perhaps the mortgage) is due to be paid.
Keep an eye on competing savings rates, but remember that chasing the last
penny can backfire. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester depositors who had seen the
building society's savings rates slip in league tables might have been
tempted to shift their money elsewhere. Those who did would have missed the
sweeteners originally proposed under the Lloyds Bank takeover.
Don't pay an annual fee for a credit card, unless you can guarantee
sufficient volume to make worthwhile the collection of Air Miles (National
Westminster Visa) or Profiles (Barclaycard). Certainly, if you're paying an
annual fee and not getting a perk like that, apply for a free card now.
Every tightwad should have one of the Co-operative Bank's free-for-life Visa
cards as the ultimate insurance against having to pay a fee. The downside of
the Co-op cards is that they have a considerably shorter period during which
you can pay off your bill in full and avoid interest charges.
So the tightwad strategy would be to use the Co-op card only often enough to
meet the annual requirement, and make other free cards your workhorses. If
you have the self-discipline to use credit cards only as a free means of
deferring payment, you should go for as many as you can get.
This provides a buffer against the creeping introduction of annual fees  -
although the entry of transatlantic giants GM and MBNA into the UK market
seems to have spiked the clearing banks' confident assertion a few years
back that the free card was doomed. Multiple cards are also a protection
against an unforeseen adverse change in your financial circumstances.
They also, however, allow you to take the tightwad strategy a step further,
by using the cards in rotation to gain the greatest advantage of each one's
interest-free period. Obviously, once you exceed two or three cards, there
are diminishing returns both in terms of money (a postage stamp can wipe out
your 'savings', so pay free by bank giro) and the time involved to keep all
this straight.
Pay attention at the supermarket check-out. You might be surprised how often
the price in the scanner's computer does not tally with the one posted on
the shelves. In less than two years, I have caught errors on six separate
occasions. And, yes, it is worth calling the manager and complaining over
pennies. It may not make any financial difference to you, but think of the
pensioner who is being similarly ripped off.
It is illegal to charge more than the posted price, and trading standards
officers are very interested in evidence of this practice, especially when
there appears to be a pattern. The satisfaction of 'gotcha' and 'gotcha
again' is usually enough for me, but when one local supermarket was fourth
time unlucky (and I was getting to know the manager and his team very well
indeed), he insisted that I take a Pounds 5 gift voucher.
Know your rights. If anyone tries to levy a surcharge for payment by credit
card without having that policy clearly posted, as required by law in the
UK, inform them that you will be notifying the trading standards officers.
The surcharge should evaporate.
Stock up on unperishable staples when they are on sale.
Share special offers. I don't want these 'free hamburger' coupons, but
someone will. The same applies to petrol station tokens, supermarket
receipts, newspaper vouchers etc.
Be charitable tax-efficiently. Use give-as-you-earn, Gift Aid and covenants.
Let the government top up your gift.
Remember, above all, not to take penny-pinching too seriously. Your life
will almost certainly run out before your money does, so enjoy them both.

Emerging markets have been the glamorous part of the world stockmarket scene
recently. And like many glamorous ideas, they have proved dangerous to their
fans. The Baring Emerging Markets World Index, which rose by over 80 per
cent between January 1993 and its peak in February 1994, has since fallen by
12 per cent. And some individual markets, such as Turkey, have more than
halved.
Does this mean that investing in these markets was just another short-lived
fad?
The answer is almost certainly no. The basic arguments in favour of having a
stake in emerging stock markets remain as strong as ever. The fact that they
have recently been the victims of their own popularity shows two things.
First, investors normally exaggerate, which is why markets tend to move in
cycles of boom and bust, rather than a sober straight line. Second, it is
foolish to expect immature markets to respond to vast new capital inflows as
if they were as mature as the US.
WHY INVEST?: The power behind emerging stock markets lies in their
economies. Most of them are in what used to be thought of as the third
world: countries whose economies were relatively undeveloped, with
correspondingly poor inhabitants. Some, such as Hong Kong and Singapore,
have already shown how dramatic the catch-up can be. Now others are claiming
their place in the sun. The two biggest blocs are round the Pacific rim in
south-east Asia, and in South America.
But the picture is not static. China's renaissance will mean dramatic
changes to the world economic order. New economic liberalisation has brought
India into the frame.
Not all emerging economies are equal. The great pull of the south-east Asian
countries is that economic growth there is far faster than in the developed
countries of the US and Europe. The countries of eastern Europe certainly
have scope to catch up with the west, but they have yet to display the
capacity to do so. The same doubts apply to most parts of Africa.
Backing the right economies is the first prerequisite for successful
investment. It is also obviously necessary to pick the right industries in
which to invest: in many countries basic infrastructure - roads, telephones,
electricity and power - are the priority. But picking stock markets which
are capable of absorbing large quantities of investment is almost as
important for the investor.
Even relatively developed stock markets can seize up when too many people
want to buy shares at once. London, for example, suffered from a severe
logjam in early 1987, when the settlement and share registration systems
could not cope with the flood of business. Investing in India produced
similar problems early in 1994, even though India has a longstanding
tradition of stock market investment. Countries in eastern Europe do not
even have a developed corporate sector in which to invest, let alone a
developed stock market through which to do it.
The enormous enthusiasm for Pacific Rim markets in 1993 preceded a sharp
shake-out in early 1994. And fund managers promptly turned to South America,
India, and almost any country where they could find a new 'story'. But
long-term growth prospects in Asia remain better than in most other areas.
And any private investor wanting a stake in emerging markets should be
thinking long term.
HOW TO INVE
The first point to consider is what proportion of your total portfolio it is
sensible to commit to emerging markets. Some risk-analysis models suggest,
surprisingly, that putting a small percentage of your total portfolio into
emerging markets both increases the return and reduces the risk.
For a middle-of-the-road investor, around 5 to 10 per cent is probably a
maximum. If you are close to retirement, you might sensibly decide that the
short-term risks are too great for any involvement. If you are young with
few liabilities - or investing for your grandchildren - you can sensibly
consider a higher proportion.
Direct investment is not an option for anyone without special knowledge and
strong nerves. So the next choice is between global funds, regional funds
and single-country funds. As a general rule, the more specialised the fund,
the higher the risk. But it is also important to pick fund managers who
understand the local market.
This is hard for the novice. One possible solution to the problem is to pick
funds which invest in other funds. City of London Emerging Markets unit
trust has shown considerable success in following this strategy. And the new
Portfolio Emerging Markets trust intends to follow a similar approach.
The snag to all funds-of-funds is that the investor is paying a double layer
of management charges. But if the investment strategy works, it can be worth
the cost.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): A long time

Getting the Japanese market right is an art that too often eludes western
fund managers.
After Wall Street and European markets had cracked in October 1987, many
pundits predicted that Tokyo was bound to crack too. In fact, it carried on
up for two years. Then, when some western pundits were beginning to argue
that the peculiar nature of the Japanese market meant that it could defy
gravity forever, it did crack.
Even now, the Tokyo market is only half its level at the end of 1989. Since
mid-1992, it has been making half-hearted attempts to pick itself off the
floor. And, although the yen's strength has meant that foreign investors
have done reasonably well out of Tokyo lately, the great leap upwards has
stubbornly failed to happen.
What marketing managers responsible for unit and investment trusts like best
is a stock market that has already risen strongly and is still going up.
There are not many of those around at the moment. So they are settling for a
second best: a market whose signal failure to perform so far can be used as
evidence of its enormous potential. Several of the big fund management
groups have launched new Japan funds recently.
How plausible is the story? Japan is the world's second largest stock
market. Indeed, before its fall, it briefly toppled the US from the premier
position. So for any professional investor to have no exposure to Japan
indicates extreme pessimism. This year, some fund managers with a global
brief have had an unusually high proportion of their money in Japan; others
have had none. Generally, foreigners are far more bullish of the Japanese
market than the locals.
The bullish argument is that Japan's economy has been out of synch with
those of the other major economies, but that increased domestic consumption
is finally getting growth going again.
Rising consumer spending power is reinforced by high public investment. And
despite the domestic political upsets, the only real worries are the
over-vigorous yen and the continuing trade dispute with the US.
Japanese shares already look very highly rated on past corporate earnings.
But unusually high fixed corporate overheads mean that relatively small
increases in sales can translate into large increases in corporate profits
and earnings.
Investing directly in Japanese shares is not a realistic proposition for
personal investors. But there is a fair choice of both unit and investment
trusts specialising in Japan. Normally we would suggest that investment
trusts were a better vehicle. But heavy investor demand means that shares in
many Japanese investment trusts are looking pricey: most investment trust
shares are now selling at discounts to their asset values, but some Japanese
trusts are still at premiums. Until that anomaly vanishes, unit trusts could
be a better bet.
It is worth remembering that many fund management groups operate both unit
and investment trusts. So if you like a particular manager's approach, you
may have a choice of vehicles.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Waiting for the
dollar - Overseas investment 4 / The US / If the currency were to
strengthen, it would magnify any growth in the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

If you want to invest in the United States, there are a number of different
ways of going about it. But at the moment, many investors may see it as a
very big 'if'.
Nigel Sidebottom, a portfolio manager at stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray,
says he and his colleagues took the decision more than a year ago to
withdraw their most aggressive portfolios from the US altogether. More
conservative portfolios still have a small amount of US exposure, but
Sidebottom says he can see little reason to increase that in the foreseeable
future.
The US is further ahead in the economic cycle than the rest of the developed
world. Rapid growth has slowed down, and the Federal Reserve Bank has
already raised interest rates by 1.25 percentage points. Bond and stock
markets have been jittery, with equities following the bond market's every
move, and reacting badly to negative economic news, but showing little
response to more positive data.
US investors have been sending huge amounts of money abroad - American fund
managers were largely responsible for the soaring stock markets in east Asia
at the end of last year. Since those markets started to drop, however, much
of the money has been withdrawn. Some of those funds may be finding their
way back into US stock markets.
But if interest rates continue to rise, the same investors who stampeded
into domestic and overseas equities during the past year or two, driven out
of deposit-based investments by the meagre rates, may start a stampede in
the opposite direction - which would not bode well for share prices.
One brighter point for overseas investors is the possibility of the dollar
strengthening after a prolonged period of weakness. This would magnify any
stock market growth, and could even make a stagnant market profitable. On
the expectation of that, some fund managers are keeping money in the US, or
even increasing their weightings. However, the dollar has not shown much
sign of strength yet.
UK investors who look at the evidence and decide that the US is a good home
for at least part of their portfolio at the moment have an enormous choice
of collective investment vehicles. There are more than 100 unit trusts in
the North America sector, offering a wide range of specialisms, including
currency bear and bull funds, index-trackers, reverse index funds, special
situations, recovery funds and biotechnology, as well as general trusts.
North American investment trusts are thinner on the ground: there are only
seven in total, four of which are specialist smaller companies funds. There
are also a few predominantly or entirely US-invested funds in other sectors,
such as Lazard's North American Gas trust and the River &amp; Mercantile
American split-capital trust.
For the average investor who does not have a strong view on US market
prospects, a sensible approach could be to pick a general international fund
with some US exposure (most have between 5 and 25 per cent in the US), and
leave the precise asset allocation up to the professionals.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Locations that
make sense - Overseas investment 2 / The offshore route / Don't be too
parochial about taking opportunities not available from onshore funds, and
at little or no extra regulatory risk
</HEADLINE>

Unit and investment trusts are widely used ways of investing overseas. But
overseas should not be confused with offshore, though one of the plusses of
what are called offshore investment funds is the greater choice of foreign
investments.
Offshore, as used in the investment fund industry, relates to where the fund
itself is located for tax and regulation, rather than the location of what
it is investing in.
Put your money in, for example, Schroder Global Emerging Markets, a
UK-authorised unit trust investing in some of the world's most far-flung and
racy stock markets, and that is overseas investment, but not offshore. But
park your savings in Fidelity's Sterling Money Funds, which invest in
plodding UK deposits, and that is offshore investment, because the funds are
set up as investment companies in Bermuda.
With its exotic locations, scandals such as Barlow Clowes and associations
with tax-evasion, offshore investment has had something of a shady image.
And it is true that a lot of offshore funds are not as well regulated as
onshore unit and investment trusts, and many offshore centres in which funds
are based do not offer compensation arrangements on a par with those of the
UK should anything go wrong (fraud, bankruptcy, incompetent or negligent
investment management or administration).
But UK investors should not be too parochial. A growing number of investment
funds being launched and promoted to UK investors are based offshore -
typically in Luxembourg, Dublin or the Channel Islands - for perfectly
sensible commercial reasons, rather than anything underhand. Many,
particularly those from well-known investment management companies, offer
attractive and legitimate opportunities not available from onshore funds at,
in practice, little or no extra regulatory risk.
From Italy to Columbia, the offshore world offers a greater choice of funds
investing in individual, smaller stock markets than UK-based unit and
investment trusts. In addition, investors wanting to back a particular
European bond market, such as those of France or Germany, will find such
funds offshore, but not onshore.
Currency funds are another investment that is only available offshore. What
are known as single-currency funds allow investors to speculate on the
movements of individual currencies without investing in foreign shares or
bonds. Managed currency funds are for investors wanting to play currencies
but leave the choice in the hands of an investment manager.
Derivative-based investment is also more readily available offshore. Real
bulls of Japan can buy Japanese warrant funds offshore; or for nervous
investors there is a wide choice of funds with money-back guarantees.
Offshore is also the home for the infamous hedge funds, including George
Soros' Quantum Fund.
Tax evasion may well be the reason why some people invest offshore. But
offshore funds also offer some perfectly legal ways of deferring or even
avoiding tax.
The main tax plus is that offshore funds pay their income gross. Onshore
unit or investment trusts, by contrast, pay income net of basic-rate tax.
That difference means that, with offshore funds, non-taxpayers do not have
the hassle of claiming tax back. Equally, taxpayers can have the full use of
a fund's gross income until they make their tax return.
It is also possible to postpone, or even avoid tax, through investment in
offshore 'roll-up' or accumulation funds. As their name suggests, the funds
roll up their income. Tax is only due when the holding is sold. Investors
who wait until they are in a lower tax bracket, perhaps after they retire,
can benefit from a lower tax bill.
The wheeze may prove less attractive than it sounds, however, because any
capital gains from roll-up funds are also treated as income for tax
purposes. Nevertheless, for investors who plan to move, work or retire
abroad, such funds can be a way of escaping the UK tax net altogether.
So what should investors looking to take the plunge offshore consider?
Can I buy the same or an equivalent UK-based unit or investment trust? If
so, are the potential tax benefits of going offshore enough to offset any
potentially greater risks or hassles? Bear in mind, too, that most unit and
investment trusts can be held in a personal equity plan (Pep) for tax-free
income and capital gains. Offshore funds, by contrast, are not Pep-able.
Are you really likely to benefit from a roll-up fund? If not, and you still
want to go offshore, look for what is known as a distributor fund, whose
returns are effectively subject to the same tax regime as (unPepped) unit
and investment trusts, except that income is still paid out gross.
Stick to the bigger, less exotic offshore centres. The UK regulators say
that Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda have investor protection
arrangements at least as good as those in mainland UK (including
compensation schemes), while Luxembourg and Dublin are also considered
relatively well-regulated.
Look for funds with what is known as 'Ucits' status or SIB-recognition.
Ucits relates to a common European minimum standard for regulation;
SIB-recognition means the UK's chief financial services regulator has looked
over the fund and approved its promotion to UK investors.
Buy through a UK-authorised financial adviser. That should increase your
chances of getting compensation if something goes wrong.
Try to stick with the big-name, blue-chip managers that you have heard of.
You will probably feel more confident that your money is in safe hands. And
they are more likely to have a UK contact point, which should make the
administration of your investment easier.
The costs of offshore funds - management, administration and dealing - can
be more opaque than those on unit and investment trusts. Beware of
simplistic comparisons. Quoted charges may be lower, but overall costs can
work out higher than on onshore funds.
Watch out for comparisons between the performance of offshore funds and, in
particular, unit trusts. Offshore fund performance figures will tend to look
unfairly favourable, because they do not include dealing costs and assume
the reinvestment of gross income.
Be aware that offshore funds are often denominated in foreign currencies -
most commonly dollars - and of the associated risks and any costs. When you
repatriate your investment, if sterling has appreciated against the currency
the fund is denominated in, you will lose out. This is aside from any
currency exposure the fund itself may have had. In addition, check what, if
any, costs - administrative and exchange - are involved if, say, you are
handing over sterling to invest in a dollar-denominated fund.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Economic cycle
favours smaller companies as Britons dive in - Overseas investment 3 /
Europe / The continent is just hitting the trough of recession, and interest
rate cuts are still expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British investors have been pouring money into Europe with gusto so far this
year. The two European privatisation funds from Mercury and Kleinwort Benson
pulled in more than Pounds 1bn between them, as well as a number of smaller
issues.
The economic arguments for investing in Europe at the moment are simple.
Most of Europe is just hitting the trough of recession, and interest-rate
cuts are still expected, which is usually a good environment for stock
market growth. The privatisation programmes in France and Italy are also
attracting interest.
However, so far investors have mostly been disappointed. Upheavals in world
bond markets have had a knock-on effect on European stock markets, among
others, and rate cuts have not been coming as steadily as hoped - but the
consensus is still that Europe offers more attractive prospects than many
other parts of the globe.
Smaller companies have been popular this year, as most European economies
are at the point in the economic cycle when these are most likely to
outperform. There are many specialist European smaller company investment
and unit trusts.
Nigel Sidebottom, investment trust portfolio manager at Gerrard Vivian Gray,
says he has been buying TR European Growth, which specialises in smaller and
medium-sized companies. The trust raised an additional Pounds 60m with a
conversion share issue earlier this year, after trading at a premium for
some time. Fleming European Fledgling has also raised extra cash recently,
and a small new fund, Piper European Smaller Companies, was launched.
Unit trusts in this area include Henderson European Smaller Companies, run
by the same management group as TR European, as well as funds from Baillie
Gifford, Invesco, Schroders and Save &amp; Prosper.
Yields in Europe tend to be low, unless you choose a bond fund, where some
yields can be very high, but capital performance has been poor recently.
Most investors with an international portfolio would want to include a bit
of general exposure to Europe, particularly the mature economies of most of
the EU member countries, as well as Scandinavia and Switzerland. But the
Europe accessible to ordinary private investors is growing all the time. The
adventurous can now look to Poland and Hungary for a more exciting ride, or
to the emerging markets of southern Europe, such as Greece and Portugal.
These are higher-risk areas, but with potentially higher rewards.
The added attraction of investing in a predominantly EC-oriented fund is
that it should be Pepable up to the full annual allowance of Pounds 6,000
per person. But funds like CSFB's Central European Growth fund, and the
Baring Emerging Europe trust, which are invested almost entirely in
unapproved stock markets, are not Pepable at all.
James Higgins, of independent financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says
it has been hard to find a good reason to put clients into Europe since most
of them were so disappointed by the Kleinwort European Privatisation issue.
One of the few areas where he has been actively investing new money is
southern Europe, using the Mediterranean investment trust.
James Bevan, a director of BZW Portfolio Management, recommends that more
sophisticated investors optimise the return on their portfolios by looking
at the correlation between different markets.
A high correlation means that markets are likely to respond in similar ways
to prevailing conditions - to hedge your bets, you should invest in markets
with low correlations, so that if one does badly, the others are likely to
do much better. 'Diversity can significantly reduce risks without impairing
anticipated performance,' says Bevan. Countries with low correlations with
the UK include Italy, Denmark, and Sweden, while Switzerland has a high
correlation. Taking other factors into account, BZW portfolios are
overweight in France, Italy, Sweden and the UK, and underweight in
Switzerland. 'We have made a number of changes to our sector and country
allocations in the past month, the effect of which is to adopt a more
defensive portfolio mix while European rate cuts are on hold. This drawing
in of horns is because the outlook for markets is less good.'
BZW favours the banking and pulp and paper sectors in Europe, but is
negative on utilities. This might explain the disappointing response to the
recently-launched Johnson Fry European Utilities split-capital investment
trust, which attracted only Pounds 15m.
Other fund managers achieve good results by ignoring country weightings and
macro-economics, focusing instead on which stocks offer good value and
growth prospects. Fidelity's Anthony Bolton uses this approach for the
Fidelity European Values investment trust, and European unit trust.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Buy a stake in
other people's economies - It's not just a way of spreading risk, says
Gillian O'Connor, in this introduction to a sequence of articles on
investing overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the canniest investors seldom invest overseas. They like to be able
to keep an eye on the businesses they are backing. That's fine for a
stockpicker as talented as American sage Warren Buffett. But most
professional investors believe in getting a spread of investments in their
portfolios: that means both different types of business and businesses in
different countries.
Putting some money overseas is a well established tradition in Britain. Our
oldest investment trust is called Foreign and Colonial. Foreign investment
is not just a form of risk-spreading: it is also a way of getting a stake in
economies which appear to have better prospects for growth than Britain. And
it allows investors to participate in industries which do not exist in
Britain.
For example, the Japanese economy and stock market is out of synch with
those of other main world economies: the decline came later than it did in
the US and Europe, and enthusiasts for Japanese shares argue that they now
offer the same kind of potential as UK shares did early in 1993.
Or, suppose there is a world commodity boom. Since Britain does not produce
commodities, the immediate effect would be a rise in the cost of imports,
and ultimately inflation. But if British investors have shares in the
overseas companies which do produce commodities, they will participate in
their prosperity.
UK pension funds and insurance companies had a substantial proportion of
their assets overseas, even when exchange controls made foreign investment
an expensive hobby. Since the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, their
overseas interests have increased.
American investors have been slower to move abroad - understandably, given
the importance of their own economy. But US pension funds have belatedly
admitted that it makes sense for them to put at least some of thir eggs in a
foreign basket. And in 1993 American private investors joined the rush to
invest abroad, mainly through mutual funds. One large US broker has
recommended all its private clients to have a fifth of their investment
portfolios overseas by the end of this century.
The growing American interest in foreign stock markets has two consequences
for British investors. The sheer scale of American buying power means that
US investment fancies tend to be self-fulfilling, particularly in smaller
stock markets. But if that buying slows or reverses, the departure of the
investment 'tourists' can have a devastating effect on the markets they have
patronised. US pension-fund money is generally expected to be in for the
long haul, while mutual-fund investors may prove more fickle.
Most British firms which manage money for private clients have long
recommended some overseas exposure, and tend to allocate specific chunks of
client portfolios to overseas markets. Fund managers will suggest different
portfolio splits for different clients. Very broadly, the greater your
desire for income from your investments, and the more worried you are about
risk, the smaller the overseas chunk. Normally that means that, the less
affluent you are or the nearer you are to retirement, the more parochial you
need to be.
The table of benchmarks shows how one fund manager splits funds for
different types of client in a 'neutral' world: ie, one in which he does not
expect big changes in currency or stock markets. In practice, the actual
allocations will usually differ substantially from the benchmarks for
strategic reasons.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Small sums are
not cost-effective - Overseas investment 1 / How it works / More investors
are by-passing pooled funds. They must do some homework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY

<TEXT>
The staggering success of two recent launches of investment trusts
specialising in Europe is a testimony to investors' willingness to spread
their portfolios across foreign fields.
The subsequent performance of these trusts has, alas, not lived up to
expectations. And that may well leave people wondering whether there is any
advantage in by-passing collective investments and choosing instead to
invest directly in foreign equities.
There is some evidence of a growing demand among private investors to go
down the direct investment route. 'We could see there was a gap in the
market at a time when there was increasing interest in Europe,' said Jeremy
Lyon, of European Stockbrokers, launched last year.
The firm's aim is to make dealing in European shares almost as easy as
buying and selling ICI or Marks and Spencer. It acts on behalf of 40 to 50
brokers across the country, to give their private clients access to Europe.
As well as providing an execution-only service, the firm offers research to
brokers.
While SEAQ International, in London, can deal in a number of European
stocks, it was set up to deal with large institutional orders. European
Stockbrokers, however, can deal in smaller sums of money, and in stocks
which are not quoted in London.
Apart from the currency risk, always an extra factor whichever way you
choose to invest in foreign markets, the biggest problem facing investors is
the extra costs. Dealing in small amounts is not cost-effective. Mr Lyon
recommends a minimum deal size of Pounds 5,000.
It is the movement and custody of share certificates that adds to the cost.
Investors do not normally receive share certificates. This may make UK
investors uneasy. In practice, it is something will have to get used to,
even in the UK, with rolling settlement and later the new Crest electronic
settlement system.
There is a delivery charge for moving stock from one custodian to another,
or for recording a change of ownership within one custodian. Then there is
an annual holding charge, which will pay for the processing of dividend
payments and of important company documents: for example, those relating to
a rights issue or capitalisation.
Killik &amp; Co, as an example, charge their normal commission rate of 1.65 per
cent up to Pounds 10,000, minimum Pounds 50, on European stocks held through
Euroclear, one of the main depots for holding bonds and equities. In
addition, there will be a small Euroclear charge when you buy, plus an
annual charge of Pounds 20 per stock.
But some stocks, such as most Swiss ones, cannot be held through Euroclear.
In this case, the initial charge for delivering the stock from one custodian
to another could be around Pounds 40 to Pounds 50, with a further annual
charge of Pounds 40 to Pounds 50. Killik's dealing commission is also higher
for these shares, at 2.5 per cent on the first Pounds 5,000, 1.5 per cent on
the next Pounds 5,000, subject to a minimum of Pounds 75.
'It is important that investors find out what the settlement charges are for
the stock they want to deal in before they deal' said Matthew Orr, of
Killik. He reckons that a minimum deal of Pounds 10,000 should be the norm
in many cases.
Getting an efficient rate of exchange for dealing is also an important
consideration, according to David Plucinsky, of Fidelity Brokers. 'Investors
should find out how their broker handles foreign currency. We have accounts
in 26 different currencies, and can easily switch from one currency to
another. We allow clients to pay for their deal in foreign currency, which
can often mean they get a better rate of exchange,' said Plucinsky.
He also warned that investors should be aware of the different settlement
periods in different markets, which mean they can sometimes wait a long time
before they receive their cash when they sell - notably in France and Italy.
There are also pitfalls if shareholders do insist on holding certificates
for foreign shares. Banking individual dividend payments in foreign currency
can be expensive if you do not have a cash account through your broker.
Another problem is that company documents will be sent out in the local
language, whereas English-language translations are available if shares are
held through an account with the broker.
Being an American-owned firm, Fidelity is naturally geared up to dealing in
US stocks. Fidelity's Paul Salariya is keen to stress that there really is
no mystery to buying and selling US stocks. In fact, from the investors
point of view it is like placing an order for UK shares.
There is a sliding scale of commission, subject to a minimum of Dollars 38.
The commission covers all charges, including holding stock in 'street name'
(roughly equivalent to a nominee account) and dividend collection. You have
to have a Fidelity money market account and sufficient funds before you
place a purchase order.
Another big American firm which has now set up shop on this side of the pond
is Charles Schwab. Its dealing commissions are almost identical to those of
Fidelity. Schwab does allow investors to take delivery of share certificates
if they wish.

FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Yes, the market
is quite sane - Keynote / Whereas 1993 was a year for speculators, 1994 will
turn out to be a year for investors, though they may not yet realise how
fortunate they are

Are the markets crazy? It is a time of the economic cycle when it sometimes
seems that way. Just as the economy is recovering nicely, and the eternally
tantalising blend of steady economic growth and low inflation appears to be
attainable, the securities markets start to throw a wobbly.
Last month the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, accused the City of being
schizophrenic in refusing to invest in accordance with its own benign
economic forecasts (let alone the rosy view of the Treasury). Private
investors, meanwhile, have been left to wonder why, by mid-year, UK share
prices had fallen by close to a fifth from their highs. Healthy profit gains
and decently firm dividend declarations have not been enough to offset a
strong but in some respects puzzling underlying downtrend.
The London stock market has been falling since the beginning of February,
and the second quarter of the year saw several important further lurches
downwards. The All-Share Index was down 6 per cent during the April-June
period, and the fall was pretty consistent across the market, with no extra
resistance by the tiddlers represented in the SmallCap Index.
Of course, politicians don't complain when the markets rise in the middle of
recessions, in apparent anticipation of recoveries that are still around the
corner. Nor should they grumble (though they would not be human if they
didn't) when securities prices sink back in conditions of decent economic
growth.
The rate of return on capital is low when few want to use capital except
governments. So it is fundamentally good news that a strongly-recovering
demand for financial resources is pushing up the returns that investors
receive. Private-sector borrowers now want to put capital to productive use.
For the benefits, look for example at the recent sharp recovery in annuity
rates, which is excellent news for people retiring this summer (though
galling for pensioners who were forced to purchase annuities at last
winter's trough for rates).
However, as the current return on securities rises, so their prices drop, as
a matter of simple arithmetic. Dividends on shares have not been able to
rise fast enough this year to offset the increase in the yield basis.
The shift has been seen most clearly in the government bond market. During
the second quarter the yield on long-dated fixed-interest gilts jumped from
7.7 to 8.7 per cent. Crucially for equities, there was a jump - though only
of about half that size - in the yield on index-linked gilts, which ended
the April-June quarter returning almost 4 per cent.
These rises in bond yields have put intolerable pressure on the equity
market, which started the quarter with a dividend yield of just 3.7 per cent
(the average paid by the 860-odd constituents of the All-Share Index).
Historically, the All-Share has almost always yielded more than index-linked
gilts. The last time the yield premium disappeared was just before the 1987
stock market crash. This time the reaction has been nowhere near so violent,
but down share prices have had to go.
Incidentally, the same influences of rising interest rates have affected the
residential property market. A surge of activity generated last winter by
the availability of cheap fixed-rate mortgage finance appeared to have
petered out by May as the cost of this money jumped.
Short-term interest rates, it is true, remained unchanged during April-June,
with bank base rates staying at 5 1/4 per cent. But the sharp jump in
longer-term rates means that monetary conditions have in effect become
tighter, whatever
Kenneth Clarke and his sparring partner Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, may have desired.
And the consensus is that base rates have now hit bottom. The next move will
be upwards, maybe later this year, maybe early in 1995.
Is this unintended tightening all Kenneth Clarke's fault? The British
government is certainly a big borrower, but of course this is far from being
a purely domestic problem. Governments across Europe borrowed Dollars 400bn
in 1993, and the total will be only slightly smaller this year. In Sweden,
institutional investors have been going on strike, saying that they can
absorb no more government paper. Bond yields in Italy and Spain have soared
much higher than in the UK.
Looking still further around the globe, the economic (and political)
imbalances between the US and Japan are becoming disruptive. As the Japanese
hoard their surplus savings, the deficit-ridden dollar is sinking and dollar
interest rates are being forced higher.
The details are complicated, but as I said more simply in this space three
months ago, the market climate has changed. Whereas 1993 was a year for
speculators, 1994 will turn out to be a year for investors, although in the
short term they may not realise just how fortunate they are.
The past three months have been notable, for instance, for the numbers of
aborted new flotations on the London stock market. Promoters (often venture
capital houses trying to get out at the top) have not been able to get the
fancy prices for poor-quality companies which were easily obtainable until
the market cracked. Many buyers of overpriced rubbish last winter will wish
they had had a keener sense of true value.
No, the markets are not crazy. But the logic of their movements is often not
apparent until long after the event. In the meantime, investors should
understand that they now have the ability to trade their capital more
dearly. The prices may be down but the value is better.

FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buying drives FT-SE Index to
3,050 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buyers from continental Europe were out in force in London again yesterday,
driving share prices ahead against a background of strong gains in bond
markets following benign retail sales figures from the US. Confidence in the
recovery in the UK economy, encouraged this week by the latest producer
price data, has been emphasised for overseas investors by sterling's
weakness against the German D-Mark, according to market strategists.
The closing reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,050.4, for a gain on the day
of 45.1. Equity chartists pointed out that the Footsie had recovered an
important testing level, which was last seen in the first half of June. The
December futures contract, which had prepared the ground for the explosion
in the stock market, reached 3,078 in after hours trading.
The stock market was very firm from the opening and extended its gains on
favourable trading comments from Marks and Spencer, the leading British high
street retailer. Interest in the retail sector was also kindled by the bid
by Tesco, second largest UK food retailer, for Wm Low, the Scottish food
group. After market hours, Sainsbury, the most likely name to contest
Tesco's move, said it would make a statement 'in due course', thus whetting
market appetites for a bid battle.
The first peak of the day came when the FT-SE gain moved to 30 points after
the news that US retail sales had risen by only 0.6 per cent in June. This
reduced worries over the strength of the US economic recovery, and therefore
over the danger of a tightening of Federal Reserve policy.
But the final boost came from a strong rise in German bond futures which
caused UK gilts to move ahead very sharply, leading to exhaustion of three
recent taplet stocks. Led by a rapidly expanding premium on the Footsie
December future contract, the stock market powered ahead in the final
minutes of the session. Further encouragement came from the gain of 30
points in the Dow Industrial Average early in the new session on Wall
Street.
Traders admitted that London marketmakers have been caught out by the sudden
bullish turn in the market and that share prices had been subjected to a
powerful 'squeeze' as the big securities houses struggled to buy stock.
However, it was clear that the relative weakness in sterling has rendered UK
stocks very attractive to the overseas buyers who have been making the
running this week.
At the same time, London benefited from the relaxation of tensions in the
dollar following both the US retail sales figures and also comments from Mr
Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank.
Trading volume, as measured through Seaq, the electronic trading system,
increased to 733.2m shares, with non-Footsie business making up a moderate
55 per cent of the total. On Wednesday, 720.8m shares traded were worth
Pounds 1.43bn in retail, or genuine customer business.
Oil shares continued to forge ahead on the back of strong buying from the US
but most other dollar stocks lagged the market as the US currency remained
uninspired. There were gains among defence industry stocks as the market
absorbed the latest plans for the UK armed forces. However, leisure and
consumer sectors stood out, as expectations of revived personal spending in
the UK took hold.

FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rank upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rank Organisation, jumped 13 to 404 1/2 p, in heavy trading of
7.1m after analysts upgraded full year profit expectations, following robust
interim results.
Profits rose by Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 127.9m ahead of market expectations,
and market watchers pointed to the stronger than anticipated contribution
from Rank Xerox in which Rank holds a 49 per cent stake.
Smith New Court lifted its full year forecast by Pounds 27m to Pounds 362m
and urged investors to buy the stock. Nomura lifted its forecast by Pounds
20m to Pounds 360m.
NatWest Securities also raised its forecast and is now predicting profits of
Pounds 343m.
Thorn EMI, closed unchanged at 1074p having spent most of the session lower
on concern that it might not announce demerger plans at today's annual
meeting.
Fading worries of a summer price war among tour operators boosted Airtours 8
to 470p.
Food and drinks group Allied-Lyons gained 13 to 566p after forming a joint
venture with Kunick to launch outlets that combine eating and video and
gaming machines. Kunick improved  3/4 to 14 1/4 p.
Retailer Marks &amp; Spencer lifted 10 1/2 to 416 1/2 p after an upbeat annual
meeting and a recommendation from chart analysts at James Capel who saw a
target of 480p over the next few months.
Glaxo rallied 6 to 557p on relief that the pharmaceuticals group was getting
out of financial management and disbanding its in-house investment arm
following big losses in bonds. There was strong speculation that PDFM, the
investment arm of UBS, was poised to take on a significant amount of Glaxo's
portfolio.
Media conglomerate Pearson recovered 26 to 625p on hopes that its venture
with Time Warner and MAI will win the franchise for the new fifth TV
channel. Some analysts cautioned that although it had a very good chance it
would be trying to take a slice of an advertising pie that was already
keenly contested. The shares also benefited from some positive analysis from
Hoare Govett and talk of a recommendation from Goldman Sachs.
Bank note printer De La Rue rose 22 to 951p as rumours resurfaced that the
the company might secured a contract for printing US dollars. De La Rue
declined to comment.
A firmer oil price boosted Enterprise Oil and BP. The former improved 11 to
431p, while the latter hardened 6 1/2 to 402p.
Defence related issues rose strongly after the UK government announced
defence orders worth about Pounds 2.4bn.
Engineering group Vickers, which secured an Pounds 800m order to supply 259
battle tanks firmed 4 to 174p. Ship builder Vosper Thornycroft which is to
supply seven minehunters to the Royal Navy jumped 22 to 729p. British
Aerospace, now lead contractor on the mid-life upgrade for the Tornado
aircraft, added 7 at 490p.
Others to benefit included Smiths Industries 6 up at 439p, VSEL, 6 up to
855p, and GEC, 8 ahead at 286 1/2 p.
British Steel was boosted by a profits upgrade from its broker UBS. The
shares put on another 4 to 159p as the securities house raised its
current-year profits estimate by Pounds 80m to Pounds 350m and penciled in
profits of Pounds 850m for the year 1997/8. UBS cited evidence of recovery
in European steel markets, and a positive trading statement earlier this
month from stainless steel company Avesta of Sweden, in which British Steel
holds a 40 per cent stake. NatWest Securities raised its forecast to Pounds
400m on Wednesday.
A stock overhang in Blue Circle, which this week hosted a successful
analysts visit, left the shares trailing 2 to 317p. Utilities were boosted
by the strong performance in bond markets. Thames Water aded 8 to 459p,
while Severn Trent finished 11 ahead at 500p. South West gained 15 to 510p.
Electricity stocks were also helped by the decision of the electricity
regulator not to reform the electricity pool pricing system. Norweb jumped
17 to 651p, while Northern Electricity advanced 17 to 676p.

FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full-year profits from Great Universal Stores were largely as forecast but
the accompanying statement failed to include the long anticipated share
buy-back. Disappointed analysts downgraded recommendations and the shares
tumbled 21 to 566p on exceptionally high turnover of 7.2m.
Profits came in at Pounds 518.9m against forecasts of Pounds 517m and last
year's Pounds 475m. The final dividend increased to 9p from 7.56p
previously.
Nevertheless, with analysts estimating the cash pile at around Pounds 1.5bn
the main shock was that the company declined to buy back some of its shares.
Buy-back hopes have seen the share price tick up by 6 per cent in the past
five trading days and traders expected profit-taking to continue if strong
hints of a buy back were not given.
BZW took the stock off its buy list with analyst Mr Tony Shiret saying 'They
need to do something more positive about realising shareholder value.' And
Hoare Govett moved its recommendation to overvalued while shading its
current year forecast to Pounds 575m. Analyst Ms Emma Burdett said: 'Clearly
there is disappointment that there was no buy-back. Medium term it remains a
possibility but any move may now be discounted in the share price.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailer bid battle looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retailers were enlivened by an affair that started the day looking like
a gentlemen's arrangement but ended with the prospect of a full-scale
takeover battle. Supermarket chain Tesco made a 225p a share agreed bid for
Dundee-based chain William Low; shares in Low topped the bid, prompting
immediate speculation of rival bids.
Analysts cited J. Sainsbury as having an interest because of its relatively
small presence in Scotland. But the market was stunned by an announcement
from the group that it was 'reviewing' the bid and would make a formal
statement shortly. This was followed, after the market closed by a formal
statement that Sainsbury's was 'requesting in formation from Wm Low and is
considering its position'. Mr Bill Myers, retail analyst with Yamaichi said:
'I am very surprised - if it goes ahead it will be the first time ever that
Sainsbury's has made a hostile bid.' There was also talk of Argyll, owner of
Safeways supermarkets, making an offer although the group said there was 'no
foundation at all in the idea. ' Low's shares soared 67 to 226p, Argyll
gained a penny to 236p, Sainsbury's rose 10 1/2 to 399 1/2 p and Tesco 10
1/2 to 232 1/2 p.

FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets moved ahead strongly in heavy trading towards the close
of official business yesterday, writes Terry Byland. Dealers said that the
impetus had come from sudden demand for German bond futures, but this
quickly produced demand for UK bond and equity futures.
At the official close of trading, the FT-SE September future contract stood
at 3,070, a premium of 23 points to the cash market, with fair value now at
around 5 points. Later trading saw a further gain.
The demand from continental European buyers was sparked off by the
favourable response to the latest retail sales figures from the US, and from
the gains in US Federal bonds which followed the announcement.
In traded options, there was increased activity in the FT-SE contract on the
impending expiry of the July option series volume jumped to 17,265 from just
over 12,000 in the previous session and the Euro FT-SE option recorded 5,033
deals. The sector as a whole traded 51,056 contracts against 31,343 on
Wednesday. Among the individual stocks, Hanson topped the actives list with
8,372 contracts. Food stocks, alerted by Tesco's bid for Wm Low, attracted
attention, Tesco trading 3,167 contracts, Argyll 3,260 and Storehouse 1,509.
Sainsbury, regarded as a potential rival bidder for Wm Low, traded 1,028.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds and dollar lift Dow
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A sharp rise in bonds and a rally in the dollar helped US share prices post
big gains across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 34.97 at 3,739.25. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 4.68 at
453.41, while the American Stock Exchange Composite finished 2.31 higher at
430.04 and the Nasdaq composite up 4.61 at 723.96. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 321m shares.
After three days of minimal movement from blue-chip stocks, share prices
took off yesterday, fuelled by a surprising rally in the recently-depressed
bond market. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up
almost 1 1/2 points, and its yield was down to 7.537 per cent. The gains in
bonds were prompted by a variety of factors, including rumours of a US
military invasion of Haiti (later denied by the Pentagon), strong retail
demand, and short-covering by dealers.
The key factors in the bond market's advance, however, were yesterday's
economic releases. First, the latest weekly jobless claims data showed a
bigger-than-expected rise in the number of people claiming state
unemployment insurance and then the June retail sales figures came in
slightly weaker than forecast.
Together, the data cheered fixed-income investors because it suggested that
the economy might not be as strong as feared, and therefore, that the
Federal Reserve might not raise interest again to slow it down. Stock market
investors were delighted by the drop in long-term interest rates as measured
by the 30-year yield. Another modest rise in the value of the dollar - which
climbed to Y98.56 and DM1.5541 in late New York trading - also lifted share
prices.
Chrysler rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in early trading after the
company announced record second quarter profits of Dollars 956m, up from
Dollars 685m a year ago. Later in the day, however, profit-taking made the
stock give up its gains, and Chrysler ended down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 49
3/8 . General Motors and Ford, which are also expected to report stronger
earnings for the quarter, were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 1/4 and down
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 , respectively.
JP Morgan fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 61 after reporting second quarter
earnings of Dollars 350m, down from Dollars 431m a year earlier, in the wake
of disappointing securities trading revenues.
A broad range of cyclical, technology and blue-chip stocks were in demand,
with IBM up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 1/4 , Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 51 5/8 and AT&amp;T up Dollars 1 1/8
at Dollars 54 1/2 .
Talk that the collapse of the merger between CBS and QVC might spark
takeover interest in CBS lifted the television group's stock Dollars 5 1/2
to Dollars 313 3/4 . QVC, which is the subject of a Dollars 44 a share offer
from Comcast, rose Dollars 1 7/16 to Dollars 43 7/16 as investors bet that
Comcast would have to raise its bid to be successful.
Canada
Toronto prices posted a strong overall advance in line with New York. The
TSE-300 composite index added 55.19 points, or 1.33 per cent, to close at
4,195.74, as winning issues led losers by 462 to 260. Volume rose to 62.88m
shares valued at CDollars 782.6m compared with 56.15m worth CDollars 665.1m
on Wednesday.
Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices were higher, with the management group up
3.17 per cent to lead the way. The mining group was up 2 per cent, consumer
products, financial services and energy were each up more than 1 per cent on
index, while industrial products was up nearly 1 per cent and golds showed
little change.
Alberta Energy reported solidly higher six-month earnings, and the stock was
up  3/8 to CDollars 22 1/2 .
Ranchmen's Resources, up  1/8 to CDollars 7 1/2 , said it has increased its
1994 capital spending budget to CDollars 40m from CDollars 30m, largely
because of the higher price of oil.
Videotron gained  1/2 to CDollars 12 3/4 despite reporting slightly lower
nine-month earnings.
Brazil
Share prices in Sao Paulo closed up 4.57 per cent in heavy trade boosted by
renewed upbeat sentiment over Brazil's presidential race.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-traded shares ended up 1,756 at 40,165
points. In Rio, the ISENN rose 3.8 per cent to 15,335 points.
Volume was 245.3m reais (Dollars 265.2m). Stocks have rallied 10.8 per cent
since the introduction of the new currency.
Prices bounced back from losses earlier this week on hopes based on a poll
that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso can win the forthcoming presidential
election.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: June was depressing month for European
equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets were depressed throughout June owing to pressure on
the dollar, which resulted in a 3 per cent decline in US Treasury bond
prices. International investors increased their selling pressure, says Mr
James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which compiled the data.
Consequently, turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International in
London, as a proportion of that in continental domestic markets, rose to
16.6 per cent in June, from 16.3 per cent in May and 15.8 per cent in April.
Overall, European turnover fell by 3 per cent last month from the May
figure. France showed the biggest individual gain, turnover rising by some
23 per cent as the market index fell 6.4 per cent, Mr Cornish notes.
Good gains were also seen in the Netherlands and Germany, with the latter
seeing a rise of 9.5 per cent after a poor showing in May. Against the three
month average Germany remained 10.5 per cent down.
Among the month's disappointments, Switzerland eased by 17 per cent as the
general index declined by 4 per cent. However, Italy was the major loser,
turnover here losing 40 per cent, and the market index almost 6 per cent as
sentiment began to turn sour over the new government's ability to tackle the
budget deficit.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Afternoon data help
consolidate bourse recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower than expected US retail growth figures, the reaction in US and
European bond markets and better news from Swiss pharmaceuticals were all
influential as bourses rose for the second day in succession, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's experience was a measure of the day, the Dax index rising just
1.62 to 2,055.62 in official floor trading, as turnover eased from DM5.4bn
to DM5.5bn, but spurting in the afternoon on the Ibis, screen-based system
to end the day at 2,070.71.
Bund futures led the way up, the September contract breaking through
resistance at 93.50 to register a gain of 70 basis points near the end the
day.
There was some response in senior blue chip prices, Allianz ending the
afternoon at DM2,470, up DM50, and Daimler adding DM11.20 at DM737.20; but
the big three chemicals, near their highs for the day, were still subdued
following Wednesday's sell-off.
Dealers said that there was more interest in second-rank blue chips.
Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, rose DM14 on the session to DM921 after
relative weakness recently, and Continental, the tyremaker, put on DM8 at
DM244.50.
ZURICH recovered its confidence in a rebound led by pharmaceuticals after
first half figures from Sandoz. The SMI index rose 53.1 or 2.2 per cent to
2,528.3, with the firmer dollar and the latest US economic data enhancing
the mood.
Sandoz registered rose SFr11 to SFr659 after it reported first half sales
growth of 2 per cent in Swiss franc terms. While this was at the lower end
of expectations, analysts noted that the market was relieved that the
statement contained no negative surprises.
Ciba registered rose SFr11 to SFr732 as it forecast that 1994 group net
profit would rise, in spite of the weak dollar.
Roche certificates recouped SFr100 to SFr5,500. The shares had fallen by 10
per cent over the previous two sessions after Roche unveiled its own six
month sales figures on Tuesday.
Nestle rose SFr42 to SFr1,112 but analysts said there was no specific news
to account for the 3.9 per cent rise.
MILAN climbed 2 per cent, content that preliminary indications of the
government's economic plan were in line with expectations and boosted by
short covering ahead of the end of the July account today. The Comit index
rose 13.86 to 701.21.
Trading picked up, with stronger demand by funds and institutional investors
prompting hopes of an imminent return by retail investors.
Ras led insurers higher, rising L1,650 or 6.8 per cent to L25,650, on the
view that the sector was oversold in preparation for the Ina privatisation
and that it will benefit from a government reform of pensions.
Banks were also strong with Credito Italiano rising L100 or 4.9 per cent to
L2,130. BCI also put on L100 to L2,130: earlier this week, James Capel
commented that the shares were cheap and that, in terms of earnings recovery
potential, BCI looked interesting.
Telecoms continued to recover from recent losses with Sip up L125 to L4,360
and Stet L165 higher at L5,540. The sector's strength spilled over to
Olivetti, L70 higher at L2,510, and Pirelli which added L45 to L2,685.
Falck, the steel group, picked up from a 5.5 per cent fall to finish L100
lower at L5,002 on news that its chairman had been arrested in connection
with investigations into alleged bribes paid to fraud squad officials.
Rinascente, the retail group was L194 higher at L9,722 as its managing
director was arrested as part of the same investigation. About 50 arrest
warrants were said to have been issued for businessmen and fraud squad
officers.
AMSTERDAM rose modestly with volatility still present ahead of today's
expiry of options. The AEX index gained 2.53 to 388.84.
Firm prices were was seen all round, although investor interest was tamed by
the lack of corporate news. Elsevier impressed with a Fl 3.00 rise to Fl
157.40 while the chemical groups, Akzo and DSM, also featured, rising
respectively by Fl 1.60 and Fl 1.40 to Fl 196.60 and Fl 131.80.
DSM was recommended by James Capel even although the second quarter results,
due early next month, may not repeat their good first quarter performance,
owing to restructuring charges. Nevertheless, Capel suggested that after
losses in 1993, the company could report earnings per share of around Fl 20
by 1996.
MADRID offered a relatively moderate reaction to its own bond market gains,
the general index closing 1.26 higher at 302.66 in turnover of Pta26.8bn
after a rise of 123 basis points to 90.85 in the September bund future.
Banesto offered some comfort to stale bulls of the rescued banking stock,
recovering Pta80 to Pta980 as BCH rose Pta50 to Pta2,625 and Santander
Pta105 to Pta4,920.
However, Repsol refused to react further to crude oil prices after its gains
on the Nigerian oil workers strike, losing Pta50 at Pta3,960; while Sarrio,
the paper group, fined by the European Commission for alleged cartel
practices, lost Pta22 at Pta528.
TEL AVIV resumed its recovery from a 1994 low of 148.01 last week after a
fall of 2.7 per cent on Wednesday, the Mishtanim index recovering 6.59, or
3.9 per cent to 174.76.
WARSAW tumbled on profit-taking after seven consecutive gains, the Wig index
closing 655.8, or 5.9 per cent lower at 10,407.1 in turnover down 25 per
cent at 1,000bn zlotys.
Some brokers said that the market had advanced by more than 40 per cent over
the previous two weeks, that a correction was long overdue and that it was
likely to deepen early next week.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa makes gains

South African shares made reasonable gains in the afternoon helped by an
improvement in the futures exchange. The overall index was up 33 at 5,506,
the industrial index added 39 to 6,307 and the gold index lost 4 to 2,101.
Traders said that further gains would depend on Wall Street's performance,
the direction of the dollar and the movement of South African listed
companies on Nasdaq overnight.
Among the main movers De Beers and Anglos both gained in spite of a stronger
financial rand, the former adding R2.25 to R109.25 and Anglos R4.50 to
R229.50. Vaal Reefs shed R1 to R409 rand.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
Kuala Lumpur advances 2.2%

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage buying lifted share prices after the yen fell slightly against the
dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 177.63 to 20,718.04 after a low of 20,565.41,
and a high of 20,780.26 in the last 20 minutes of trading, gaining strength
in the afternoon session on bargain hunting and arbitrage buying.
Volume totalled 292.8m shares against 314m. Some foreign investors were seen
taking profits, while financial institutions and investment trusts were the
main buyers of the day. However, many investors remained on the sidelines,
due to lingering uncertainty over the course of the yen.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.99 to 1,664.52 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.66 to 302.47. Advances led declines by 767 to 271 with
143 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.87 to 1,352.11.
Buying centred around shares linked to the consumption recovery, and oil
exploration in Vietnam. Buy-backs of export oriented, high-technology stocks
which had been sold off due to the high yen also supported the index.
Mitsui, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y880 on its resource
development in Vietnam. Marubeni, another trading house, closed Y13 higher
at Y550. However, Mitsubishi Oil, whose discovery of a second oil well in
Vietnam triggered the recent interest in the theme, fell Y20 to Y1,180 on
profit taking.
Department store shares were bought actively on hopes of an increase in
consumer spending. Tokyu Department Store rose Y54 to Y829 and Daimaru
gained Y32 to Y893.
Some banks were weaker in spite of arbitrage buying. Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y10 to Y3,180 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y20 to Y2,030.
Electricals were higher. Sony gained Y200 to Y6,060 and Hitachi rose Y10 to
Y1,020. Car electronics makers were stronger on reports that the government
will push for car navigation systems. Kenwood gained Y32 to Y955 and Alpine
Electronics added Y90 to Y2,300.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 192.58 to 23,148.41 in volume of 35.1m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets turned in mixed performances.
KUALA LUMPUR saw foreign demand for Malaysian blue-chip stocks, which sent
the composite index 2.2 per cent up through the psychological 1,000-point
level. The index finished 21.23 higher at 1,010.80. Tenaga Nasional and
United Engineers each jumped 70 cents to MDollars 14.0 and MDollars 10.90
respectively while Telekom Malaysia firmed 60 cents to MDollars 19.50.
MANILA rose sharply at the close, spurred by PLDT's rebound in New York and
bargain-hunting in other issues. The composite added 47.07 or 1.9 per cent
to 2,557.83 as PLDT climbed 3.2 per cent to 1,440 pesos after jumping
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 on Wall Street.
SYDNEY advanced 1.5 per cent, through the psychologically important 2,000
barrier in volatile trade, lured higher by a rally on the futures market.
The All Ordinaries index closed 29.1 firmer at 2,007.7.
Brokers said rumours of a large institutional investor doing some portfolio
buying also gave the market impetus.
BHP put on 50 cents or 2.8 per cent to Dollars 17.94 amid speculation that
it was about to embark on a major offshore takeover.
HONG KONG stepped back after the strong rally of the previous two days,
surrendering sharp early gains to profit-takers. The Hang Seng index fell
20.63 to at 8,808.28, after an early peak of 8,944.31 in turnover that was
little changed at HKDollars 3.84bn.
TAIPEI's early gains were reversed by late profit-taking amid worries that
the central bank might tighten monetary policy next week. The weighted index
fell 13.62 to 6,304.61, off a 6,392.88 high.
WELLINGTON shrugged off political uncertainty to close slightly firmer,
although late selling trimmed the rise. The resignation of Ms Ruth
Richardson, the government MP and former finance minister, raised the
prospect of a snap election. The NZSE-40 capital index closed up 3.58 at
1974.1 in turnover of Dollars 42.3m.
BOMBAY was lower as buying eased on the last day of account in specified
shares amid rumours that bourse officials might levy a 20 per cent margin on
cash shares. The BSE 30-share index lost 37.89 to 4,093.63.
SEOUL extended early losses which stemmed from profit-taking in most sectors
and the composite index fell 3.26 to 958.71. Recently strong
smaller-capitalised shares lost momentum after the Securities Supervisory
Board said it would crack down on stock price manipulations.
SINGAPORE was little changed but the broad market's tone was improved with
pockets of buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrials index
closed 5.85 higher at 2,189.78, with banks, properties and most shipyards in
demand.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Modest rise for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours of a US invasion of Haiti and a firmer tone to the Treasury bond
market helped the dollar finish stronger yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Analysts said the US currency had also benefited from a technical
bounce-back which did not signal an interruption of the recent downward
trend. The dollar is currently about 6 per cent lower against the yen and
the D-Mark since the beginning of June.
The US currency finished in London at DM1.5457 from DM1.5383 and at Y98.28
from Y98.1550.
The D-Mark had a quiet day with trade muted by holidays with the French
market closed for Bastille day.
The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 4.80 per cent from
4.90 per cent for a four day money market pact it will launch on Friday.
The dollar's firmer tone helped the sterling index rise to 79.2 from 79. The
pound finished slightly higher against the D-Mark at DM2.4174 from DM2.4089.
Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.564 from Dollars 1.566.
For dollar bulls, the best news lay in the firmer tone of bond markets, both
in the US and Europe. In recent months, one of the factors behind D-Mark
strength - and dollar weakness - has been investors selling holdings of
European bonds and putting the proceeds into D-Mark deposits.
'If this is a turn in the bond markets, it should be positive for the
dollar,' said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW. 'Anything that
takes upward pressure off the D-Mark would have to be good for the dollar.'
Part of the improved tone of bond markets may be attributable to improved
interest rate expectations. Contrary to the rumours of an imminent and
aggressive Fed tightening, which gripped markets on Wednesday, the December
eurodollar contract rose by 13 basis points to finish at 94.07. This
movement suggests the market is becoming less bearish in its interest rate
outlook.
Mr Turner said a firmer dollar required that the Fed either moved to a
restrictive monetary stance, from the more neutral position currently; or
that evidence emerged about a slowdown in the economy, which would vindicate
existing policies. The performance of the bond markets suggests the market
believes it may be getting the latter.
Before the Haiti rumours emerged, the dollar had failed to gain any support
from the release of the June retail sales figures which rose by 0.6 per
cent, in line with market expectations. May retail sales figures were also
revised down so the case for higher rates was, if anything, diluted.
Of more encouragement for dollar bulls - and testifying to the confused
state of the market - was the White House mid-session review which said the
US was approaching full capacity slightly faster than expected. Mr Adrian
Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, commented: 'If the
White House is thinking it, then almost certainly the Federal Reserve is
thinking it too.'
The dollar received some support from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president. He told a lunch in Frankfurt that 'the world economy has an
interest in an internally and externally stable dollar.'
But he made clear that 'the prime responsibility for the dollar's strength
lies in the US itself. The thesis current at the beginning of the seventies
 -it's our currency but your problem - is clearly too short-sighted,' the
Bundesbank president said. 'It didn't do the US much good at the time
either,' he added.
The dollar received further support later from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, when he said the US wanted a stronger dollar and would
work with the Fed to achieve it.
Mr Cunningham said there were certainly investors who felt the dollar
offered reasonably good medium term value at current levels. But it remained
vulnerable on the downside against the yen, he said, so long as the US
administration continued its tough talk on trade issues with Japan - most
recently from Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US undersecretary of Commerce.
The Swedish krona weakened after hearings in parliament's finance committee
failed to provide the market with any assurance that the government has a
workable strategy for reducing state debt. The krona closed in London at
SKr4.961 against the D-Mark from SKr4.34.
The market was more positive in its response to to Italy's deficit proposals
to cut L5trn this year and L40trn next year. The lira finished slightly
firmer at L990.5 from L992.5.
Although volumes were less buoyant than on Wednesday, short sterling futures
continued their recent recovery. The December contract traded 38,678 lots to
finish 15 basis points higher at 94 from 93.85. Euromarks were also firmer,
with the December contract finishing at 95.12 from 95.05.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.091bn assistance
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn. Overnight money traded
between 4 and 5 5/8 per cent. German call money eased slightly to 4.80/4.85
per cent from 4.90/5 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee hit by a Dollars
188-a-tonne 'correction'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices staged a sharp correction yesterday when the London market
responded to a late downturn in New York on Wednesday. The September futures
contract at the London Commodity Exchange slipped by Dollars 188 to Dollars
3,805 a tonne in moderate trading.
'A lot of the business has been liquidations,' said one trader, 'people are
getting out of the market and staying out to watch developments.'
In the final minutes of trading on Wednesday night, arabica coffee futures
at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York suddenly went into
reverse, turning a 20-cent rise into a 4-cent fall on the day at Dollars
2.41 a pound. If the London market had fallen by an equivalent amount,
nearby positions would have lost over Dollars 500 a tonne.
London traders said the New York market was setting the tone for trading. It
declined again yesterday, the September position reaching Dollars 2.39 a
pound by midday.
The sell-off was heavily influenced by technical chart activity and by
worried speculators who thought the market might have seen its peak. Rumours
that Brazil was about to re-open registrations prior to starting exports
again added to the uncertain mood in the market. Brazil halted exports
earlier this week in order to assess the frost damage to next year's crop.
In the meantime, several coffee companies announced increases in their
consumer prices in response to the recent rapid run-up in the futures
markets. In the US, a division of Nestle raised ground coffee prices by 13
per cent and in Germany roasters hiked some prices by 28 per cent.
But Mr Alexandre Beltrao, executive director of the International Coffee
Organisation, said the price rises should not affect consumption as coffee
remained a cheap drink.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Delegates optimistic following
'constructive' rubber pact talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates from key natural rubber producing and consuming nations concluded
three days of informal talks yesterday expressing optimism that a global
pricing pact could be achieved this year, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
The high-level working group meeting in Kuala Lumpur was held ahead of
UN-sponsored talks in Geneva in October to renegotiate the International
Natural Rubber Agreement.
'The informal talks have been constructive. I am optimistic that we can
reach an agreement in October,' said European Union delegate Mr Derrick
Taylor.
The working group comprises rubber producers Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand, and the top three consumers, Japan, the EU and the US.
Delegates said UN rubber pact negotiating president Mr Peter Lai also
appeared optimistic that a deadlock over pricing would be resolved at the
Geneva talks.
The rift between growers and consumers over the key pricing issue blocked
efforts to conclude negotiations on a new Inra in Geneva in April.
Consumers, led by the United States, want no change in the reference price,
which has remained at 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram since the
first pact was agreed in 1979. The reference price is used to calculate when
buffer stocks can be bought or sold in the market. Producers say inflation
and the rising costs of production since 1979 both warrant an increase in
the reference price.
'We both understand each other's positions better now after having frank
talks,' Mr Taylor said. Other delegates thought the same. 'Both sides seem
to be more sympathetic to each other's position,' said one. But he added
that producers were still seeking a higher reference price.
Malaysia, the world's third largest producer of rubber, has said a higher
reference price would encourage small growers to stay in business and ensure
long-term supplies. It argues that rubber's present strength could be
temporary.
The talks were held as the International Natural Rubber Organisation's
buffer stock manager was selling rubber in an effort to arrest a recent
sustained rise in prices.
The EU last week demanded early and substantial sales from Inro's buffer
stock in order to have maximum market impact. Buffer stock manager Mr Aldo
Hofmeister responded by selling an undisclosed amount of rubber in several
markets, beginning last Friday, from its warehouses in Britain, China,
Malaysia and Indonesia. Mr Taylor hoped that rubber prices would ease
following Inro's intervention. 'EU member nations would think it is
illogical to pay for a buffer stock if it does not work,' he said.
Rubber prices should settle down 'in a week to 10 days', said Mr Hofmeister.
Inro's sales have so far failed to contain its five-day moving average
price, which rose on Wednesday to 233.35 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
kilogram from 232.93 cents.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockpile sales quotas for July and August under Garnaut disposal scheme
have now been met, and September and October are coming under pressure. This
is seen as a bullish sign ahead of resumption of Australian wool sales ten
days from now. Semi-official and trade forecasts agree on the probability
that next season will be a good one, with price averages usefully above this
season and no chance of a return to the low points of 1993. Holidays in wool
using countries mean that trading conditions at present are dull and there
is also caution among manufacturers and retailers in assuming that prices
will rise to new peaks from the start. Dollar weakness tends to cause some
softness in the pricing of semi-manufactures and merchanted wool just at
present

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper's break out pulls other
base metals higher - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices broke up out of their recent ranges at the London Metal
Exchange yesterday afternoon, pulling other metals higher.
Fresh speculative interest fuelled a rise that triggered stop-loss buying
orders above Dollars 2,475 a tonne for three months delivery. The price
closed at Dollars 2,482.50, up Dollars 35, before being trimmed back to
Dollars 2,478 in after hours trading. Some traders expectations of a further
decline in LME warehouse stocks were supportive.
ALUMINIUM tracked copper but was not able fully to match its gains as there
is a sizeable resistance area stretching up towards the Dollars 1,550 a
tonne level for the three months position, which closed at Dollars 1,52.50,
up Dollars 10.
Three months ZINC finally broke above Dollars 1,000 a tonne as the bullish
enthusiasm of copper and aluminium spilled over. Stop-loss buying took the
price up to the day's high, with final business at Dollars 1,006, a Dollars
12 gain.
LEAD was also steadier, although three months metal continued to meet
stubborn resistance near the Dollars 600-a-tonne level. It finished at
Dollars 596, up Dollars 4.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp industry awaits Canadian
labour board ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Columbia's Labour Relations Board is to issue a ruling today on a
dispute between wood pulp mills and their unions that could have an
important bearing on world pulp prices and on the investment climate for
forestry companies on Canada's west coast.
The board will decide whether to allow employers to negotiate a new labour
contract with their 12,000 workers on a mill-by-mill basis, or to bow to the
demands of the unions for the retention of the present system of
industry-wide collective bargaining.
No matter which way the board's decision goes, industry executives and
analysts say the odds are high that subsequent talks on a new labour
contract will end in deadlock. Mr Ross Hay-Roe, analyst at Equity Research
in Vancouver, said that 'we stand a high probability of some sort of
shutdown'.
Canada accounts for more than a quarter of world pulp production, with the
bulk of output coming from British Columbia. Fears of a strike at BC's 19
mills have contributed to an unexpectedly steep spiral in pulp prices this
year. Producers are about to raise the price of northern bleached softwood
kraft pulp, the industry staple, to USDollars 620 a tonne, from about
USDollars 390 last autumn.
Many pulp mills have begun to ration sales. According to a trader at MC
Forest, a Vancouver-based subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi, demand is
especially strong from South Korea, Italy and northern Europe.
The labour board decision comes on the heels of numerous initiatives by the
left-of-centre provincial government that have left the BC forestry industry
deeply demoralised. They include moves to protect a higher proportion of
forests from logging, tighter regulations on forestry practices and other
environmental restrictions.
Employers contend that mill-by-mill bargaining is required to introduce more
flexible work practices, rather than to squeeze wages. 'It's one of those
watershed issues for the major companies,' an executive at one Vancouver
group said. He predicted that if the decision went against the industry,
companies would 'become a lot more selective about what they put their money
into here'.
The stakes for the two unions that represent the mill workers are also high
as they struggle to adapt to competition from countries where costs are
lower.
The unions' dilemma was illustrated at a loss-making Newfoundland newsprint
mill operated by Abitibi-Price earlier this week. Workers decided to let the
company close one newsprint machine, with the loss of 370 jobs, rather than
agree to reopen their labour contract to accommodate more flexible work
practices.

Aluminium producing countries taking part in the unprecedented international
agreement to cut global production have not been able to find a formula that
would enable Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to be included.
Only delegates from the original six participants - Australia, Canada, the
12-nation European Union negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US - are
to attend the monitoring meeting in Canberra, Australia, on July 20 and 21.
There is also some disquiet in the aluminium industry about the degree of
Russian commitment to the agreement. Its two senior negotiators at previous
trade talks, Mr Georgi Gabounia, a deputy minister in the Ministry for
Foreign Economic Relations, and Mr Igor Prokopov, head of the country's
aluminium industry association, are believed not to be attending the
Canberra meeting.
However, one delegate suggested Mr Gabounia's absence was because he had
been promoted and it was hoped that both men would be replaced at the
meeting by people of equivalent stature.
Russia undertook to cut its annual aluminium production by 500,000 tonnes in
two stages, the second 200,000-tonne tranche was to have been completed by
the end of this month. Some delegates suggest the most sensitive issue at
the meeting next week will be the question of how much Russian production
has been cut so far and what the other countries can do to impress upon the
Russians that they should stand by their commitments. There are indications,
however, that the Russians have started to supply production figures to the
International Primary Aluminium Institute, the London-based organisation
which collates statistics for the industry.
At a meeting last January, delegates estimated that world-wide annual output
cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years were needed to bring the
aluminium market back into balance. Since then western companies have
announced planned cuts of more than 1m tonnes and stocks have begun to fall.
Prices have responded by jumping by about 50 per cent and recently touched
the highest level for 40 months.
Nevertheless, the European industry in particular remains disappointed that
some important aluminium producing countries not represented at the trade
talks have failed to make cuts. It has been pressing for Brazil, the Gulf
States and Venezuela to be invited to future talks on the grounds that their
reluctance to share the industry's pain by cutting output by about 10 per
cent is understandable because they did not take part in the original
discussions.
However, US trade delegates strenuously resisted any broadening of the
scheme on the advice of Justice Department lawyers, who are worried about
anti-trust problems. The more countries involved in the scheme, the more it
might look like an illegal cartel, the lawyers argue. It was for this reason
that Japan, one of the biggest aluminium consuming nations, was excluded
from the negotiations although it asked to join in.
Two Gulf Arab aluminium producers said yesterday that they had no immediate
plans to change their combined output of about 690,000 tonnes annually,
reports Reuter from Manama, Bahrain.
But Mr Gudvin Tofte, chief executive of Aluminium Bahrain (Alba), said the
company's management was watching the market before making any decision on
whether to change Alba's current output of around 445,000 tonnes per year.
'We are watching the situation day by day. . . watching the price and what
other producers are doing,' he said. 'Based on these developments, we will
adjust our output. We will wait and see for a while.'
Another Gulf Arab producer, Dubai Aluminium Company (Dubal), said it would
maintain its current output.
'Dubal is not planning a cut in its current production of around 245,000
metric tonnes annually,' said Chief Executive Edward Ian Rugeroni.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries sharply higher on solid
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Retail demand, short-covering by dealers, a dollar rally, news of higher
weekly unemployment claims and rumours of a US invasion of Haiti all
combined to push US Treasury prices sharply higher across the maturity range
yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/16 at
84-27/32, yielding 7.537 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up
5/16 at 99 15/32 , to yield 6.015 per cent.
Prices firmed from the start, with traders reporting solid demand from
retail accounts in the wake of a modest dollar rally. The early gains soon
forced some dealers to cover their short positions.
Sentiment was aided by the announcement that weekly state unemployment
insurance claim rose by 19,000, a much bigger increase than forecast, and
the news that retail sales rose by 0.6 per cent in June, a slightly smaller
increase than expected. The data encouraged those investors who believed the
Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to slow the economy down, and
spurred further buying, especially later in the session.
Earlier in the day, prices had risen on a rumour that the US had invaded
Haiti. Political unrest and the involvement of the US military in conflict
abroad usually buoys Treasuries as investors rush to buy more secure
investments. Although yesterday's rumour proved false, it was enough to
provide investors with another reason to buy government bonds.
European government bonds rallied strongly, boosted by the strength in US
Treasuries, as the more positive mood of recent days continued.
However, the gains came in thin, futures-driven trade, with the French
market closed, and analysts were sceptical about how long the rally will
last.
'Confidence has returned with a better outlook for interest rates and
inflation and some institutional investors have come back to the markets
relatively cash-rich. But it also has the elements of a classic bear
squeeze,' said Mr Sanjay Joshi of Daiwa Europe.
German bunds rose strongly in afternoon trading, on the back of US
Treasuries and supportive comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the
Bundesbank.
Although the dollar regained some ground against the D-Mark, bunds continued
to benefit from the German currency's safe-haven status.
Mr Tietmeyer said the decoupling of international capital markets based on
interest rate developments would not be easy, 'but when the fundamentals are
right and a policy of stability is clear then it is by no means ruled out'.
Mr Michael Buerk of Citibank said: 'These remarks are a sign that a key
German official is hopeful, if not over-optimistic, that some decoupling
might take place.'
UK gilts rallied in late trading in line with bunds, and after the Bank of
England announced that three tranches of existing government bonds had been
exhausted.
Today, the Bank is expected to announce details of its next auction, which
analysts expect to be of seven to 10 years.
Contrary to recent market recoveries when high-yielding bonds have
outperformed the core markets, Italian and Spanish bonds tracked Germany at
more or less stable yield spreads while the Swedish market weakened further.
'This is a sign that the long-term divergence trend remains intact,' said Mr
Kirit Shah international bond strategist at First Chicago.
The yield on the Swedish nine-year benchmark bond breached the
psychologically important 11 per cent level to close some 18 basis points
higher at 11.05 per cent.
The 10-year yield spread over Germany widened by nearly 30 basis points to
425 basis points.
The market was hit by a rise in the year-on-year inflation rate, an
inconclusive special meeting of the parliamentary finance committee, and a
lukewarm reception for the government's latest T-bill auction.
Although Sweden's month-on-month inflation rate was unchanged, the
year-on-year rate rose to 2.6 per cent in June from 2.3 per cent in May.
Bonds also derived little support from the finance committee meeting, called
in response to the recent falls in Sweden's financial markets.
Meanwhile, at its auction of three, six and 12-month bills the National Debt
Office managed to sell only SKr10.54bn of the SKr12.5bn offered.
Italian bonds tracked the other markets and closed more than a point higher,
but failed to deliver the performance some had hoped for following
Wednesday's announcement of the government's fiscal plans. The budget
targets for 1994 and 1995, and plans to offset this year's deficit by
L5,000bn, had been discounted in the market.
'Details were conspicuous by their absence,' said Mr Ken Wattret of Midland
Global Markets. 'The rally in the Italian market will be on hold until the
details of the government's three-year fiscal plan are published next week.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Nikkei 300 futures fail to
find favour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Dwindling trading volume in futures contracts on the capitalisation-weighted
Nikkei 300 index is causing concern among Japanese financial officials.
The Nikkei 300 contract, listed on the Osaka Stock Exchange last February
eventually to replace the price-weighted Nikkei 225 index, has failed to
attract investor interest. OSE officials are now considering measures to
revitalise trading, including a cut in the minimum trading unit.
Daily trading volume of the Nikkei 300 futures has been below 10,000
contracts since July 5, when volume hit the lowest level on record at 6,891
contracts. In value terms, daily turnover averaged around Y70bn last month,
almost 94 per cent lower than that of the Nikkei 225 futures, also traded on
the OSE.
The Nikkei 300 was introduced after fierce debate over the negative impact
of the Nikkei 225 futures on the main cash market. Some financial
authorities claimed that the price-weighted index was easily manipulated,
and arbitrage trading between the futures and cash markets was responsible
for the volatility in the underlying cash market.
In spite of the new contract's launch, most traders and investors have stuck
to the more familiar Nikkei 225 futures, and the Nikkei 300 index itself has
yet to become a stock market benchmark.
Mr Sadakane Doi, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said
the securities industry would strive to interest investors in the Nikkei 300
futures, adding that many securities industry executives wanted to nurture
the index.
Meanwhile, Mr Goro Tatsumi, the association's Osaka representative, called
for support from the finance ministry to promote the Nikkei 300 index
futures.
Earlier this year, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange was given
the licensing rights to trade futures and options contracts based on the
Nikkei 300 index.

<TEXT>
OM Group, the Swedish company which runs derivatives exchanges in Stockholm
and London, yesterday reported a surge in pre-tax profits in the first half
to SKr158m (Dollars 21m) from SKr100m in the same period last year as
turnover rose to record levels.
OM has been riding the recent heavy growth in derivative trading through its
OM Exchange in the Swedish capital and the OMLX exchange in London.
Average daily turnover rose in the first half to 133,891 contracts - a
record for a six-month period - from the daily average of 92,553 contracts
for all 1993 and 83,437 for the first half of last year. Operating revenues
rose to SKr289.5m from SKr190.6m and operating profit more than doubled to
SKr128m from SKr61m.
In May, OM decided to sell its financing businesses and pull out of a plan
to participate in founding a new Swedish bank. The sale of OM Finans has yet
to take place, but OM included costs of SKr8.4m in its first-half expenses
incurred in the aborted bank project.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Canadian dollar sector revived by deals
aimed at retail buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After several days dominated by large offerings aimed at institutional
investors, the pattern shifted yesterday, as a spate of deals targeted at
the retail investor emerged in the Canadian dollar sector.
There has been a revival of interest in the sector, due largely to a heavy
schedule of nearly CDollars 2bn-worth of redemptions of outstanding bonds -
including a CDollars 650m Alberta deal - next month.
Many Benelux-based investors are looking for Canadian dollar bonds in which
to reinvest following the redemptions, particularly since Canadian dollar
yields are now higher than those for Belgian and Luxembourg franc bonds.
Until yesterday's rush of CDollars 375m-worth of new issues, there had been
little activity for about a month, but the forthcoming redemptions coupled
with a strengthening of the Canadian dollar encouraged borrowers to return
to the market, dealers said.
Canada's Federal Business Development Bank and Germany's L-Bank both
launched three-year deals, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Goldman
Sachs respectively, while Norddeutsche Landesbank launched a five-year
offering via Hambros Bank.
At the longer end, Societe Quebecoise D'Assainissement des Eaux, a
provincial crown corporation, launched a 10-year deal, which would usually
be rather long-dated for retail investors. However, the 10 per cent coupon
is attractive to these buyers, who have been looking for this type of coupon
for some time.
Dealers said that institutional investors are not looking at the market, and
anyway would typically prefer larger, more liquid offerings.
In the sterling floating-rate note market, a unit of SG Warburg added Pounds
75m to an outstanding Pounds 150m issue. the offering pays a discounted
margin of 28 basis points over Libor.
Pohang Iron &amp; Steel filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission a
shelf offering of up to Dollars 700m in debt securities and common stock,
Reuter reports.
The Korean steel producer said the proceeds from the sale would be used for
general corporate purposes including capital expenditures, debt refinancing
and overseas investments.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: US regional banks top market
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clutch of US regional banks exceeded market expectations with
second-quarter figures reported yesterday, reflecting stronger loan demand.
Bank of New York saw net income jump by nearly half to Dollars 176m, or 87
cents a share, from Dollars 118m, or 57 cents a share, in the second quarter
of 1993.
The bank's net interest income was 9 per cent higher than a year earlier,
thanks to a slight increase in its lending margin and a shift to
higher-yielding assets, such as credit card outstandings.
Wachovia, based in North Carolina, also beat most estimates, with net income
of Dollars 134m, or 78 cents a share, compared with Dollars 123m, or 70
cents a share, last year.
Asset growth and lower loan loss provisions accounted for the advance, the
bank said. Average loans during the quarter grew by Dollars 2.7bn, or 12.7
per cent, it added.
First Union, meanwhile, recorded a 5 per cent increase in loans compared
with the previous three months, a rise of Dollars 2.2bn.
Net interest income was Dollars 775m, up from Dollars 708.2m a year before.
Net income of Dollars 229.6m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, compared with Dollars
226.7m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, a year before, ahead of market
expectations.

Westinghouse

<TEXT>
CBS, the US television network, signed up three additional stations owned by
Westinghouse Electric as affiliates, in the process repairing some of the
damage done by the defection of eight other affiliates to Mr Rupert
Murdoch's Fox network in May.
Westinghouse and CBS also announced they would seek to extend their
ownership of broadcast television stations through a new joint company, to
be majority owned and managed by Group W, Westinghouse's broadcasting
company.
In addition, the two companies announced joint ventures in programming and
advertising sales.
For CBS, the deal brings VHF stations in three important US markets:
Philadelphia, the fourth-ranked market in the country, Boston (6th) and
Baltimore (22nd). CBS already owns a Philadelphia station, which will be
sold. Two of the stations are switching from NBC, with the third from ABC.
The deal has been under discussion for two months, the two companies said.
In recent days, CBS has dropped a proposed merger with home shopping group
QVC, which would have taken it into cable television, raising questions
about the future of its earlier strategy of relying on broadcast stations.
For Westinghouse, the joint ventures with CBS will provide extra resources
to expand Group W's operations. Mr Michael Jordan, the group's recently
appointed chief executive, has resisted selling the unit as part of an
overhaul of the troubled manufacturing group.
As part of yesterday's deal, Group W and CBS will form a joint programming
unit, to provide material to their own stations and others. The partnership
will not take effect until November 1995, when existing regulations end.
Group W will also own the majority stake in a new company formed by merging
the two group's advertising sales operations.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said the deal
'further demonstrates our commitment to the network/affiliate system and our
firm belief in the future of broadcasting.'

Dollars 650m merger

Nextel Communications, the US digital mobile communications company, is to
merge with OneComm, a leading western states provider of dispatch
communications services to fleet vehicles. The deal has been valued at over
Dollars 650m.
Nextel operates an extensive radio network for taxis and fleet vehicles.
Last year, it acquired mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola, and
announced plans to create a national network, using new digital technology
from Motorola.
The new technology will provide mobile telephone, messaging and paging
services, as well as dispatch services.
In recent months, Nextel has launched its digital mobile communications
services in northern and southern California.
OneComm is offering similar services in Colorado. Nextel said the services
would be available in New York, Chicago and Seattle later this year, and
that it would further expand operations in 1995.
Mr Brian McAuley, Nextel president and chief executive, said: 'Upon
consummation of the merger, Nextel will be authorised to provide service in
areas that are home to over 210m Americans. That's over 80 per cent of the
US population and includes 47 of the top 50 markets in the country.'
Under the terms of its agreement with OneComm, Nextel will issue
approximately 22.4m shares to OneComm shareholders in exchange for
approximately 21m OneComm shares.

Technology Resources Industries (TRI), the holding company for Cellular
Communications Network (Malaysia), Malaysia's largest mobile phone carrier,
has announced 95.6 per cent year-on-year growth in pre-tax profits, to
MDollars 105.97m (USDollars 40.9m), for the first half of 1994.
The results were well within market expectations of between MDollars 95m and
MDollars 120m.
Group turnover grew 49 per cent to MDollars 367.1m compared with a year ago,
and after-tax profits were up 120 per cent to MDollars 69.9m. The stock does
not pay a dividend.
The company recorded an extraordinary gain of MDollars 126.1m on the sale of
its non-telecommunications subsidiaries. Cellular Communications (Celcom)
contributed the bulk of profits, supplemented by smaller contributions from
the Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) subsidiary.
Analysts were pleased with the results, but expressed concern about the
company's disclosure policies. Earlier this year, UBS (East Asia), a member
of the Union Bank of Switzerland group of companies, had to postpone an
international offering of USDollars 400m in TRI euroconvertible bonds, after
European fund managers objected to discrepancies in profit forecasts.
In the accompanying prospectus, TRI had forecast MDollars 128m in pre-tax
profits for the full year 1994. However, many securities houses were
anticipating a figure of more than MDollars 300m.

<TEXT>
Charoen Pokphand (CP), the Thai multinational that is one of the largest
foreign investors in China, said yesterday it was bidding for the right to
establish a network of Seven-Eleven convenience stores in China.
CP group has run the Seven-Eleven franchise in Thailand since 1989, and now
controls a network of 320 stores. The Seven-Eleven name belongs to Southland
of the US, which is in turn owned by Japan's Ito-Yokado.
CP said it was submitting a bid to Southland for the franchises in various
zones of China. Bids must be in by the end of September.
CP's likely rivals in the bidding include the Seven-Eleven franchise-holders
for Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively Dairy Farm and the President group.
Dairy Farm, the food retailing side of Jardine Matheson, already has a
franchise for Guangdong province in southern China, and has set up several
Seven-Eleven shops in Shenzen.
Of the new China zones on offer, Shanghai is regarded by retailers as one of
the most promising. Southland is also considering introducing the
Seven-Eleven name in Indonesia, CP executives say.
Asians are increasingly using modern retail chain stores instead of markets
or individual shops. In Thailand alone, CP expects the number of
Seven-Eleven outlets to rise from 320 to 400 by the end of this year, to 500
next year, and to 1,000 by 1997. CP also runs Makro cash-and-carry
superstores in Thailand in a joint venture with SHV of the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, Dunkin' Donuts (Thailand) said it planned to invest Dollars 3m in
Vietnam over the next two years. It has just been appointed priority
franchisee for the country by Dunkin' Donuts of the US.
Siam Commercial Bank says it has received approval from the Thai central
bank to link up with the CP group to open a joint-venture bank in Hanoi,
Vietnam, AP-DJ reports from Bangkok.

TRI's chairman and majority shareholder is Mr Datuk Tajudin Ramli, a Malay
businessman and protege of the influential former finance minister Mr Tun
Daim Zainuddin. TRI and MHS are near completion of a demerger exercise,
after which MHS will purchase a 32 per cent stake in Malaysian Airlines.

The holding is being bought from subsidiaries of Genting, the Malaysian

Genting recently voiced its concern about the Philippine government's plan

Australian corporate profits are expected to have risen by about 17 per cent
in the year to June 30, down from the previous year's 29 per cent profit
surge, according to a survey by Barclays Australia, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
Earnings by industrial companies for 1993-94 will sharply outperform those
by resource companies, the Barclays Australia Investment Services (Barcep)
consensus earnings forecast said.
Industrial earnings are expected to rise 21 per cent, while resource
earnings are seen down 12 per cent, according to the survey, compiled of
projections from 28 brokers. Many Australian companies will soon begin
reporting annual results.
Barclays research director Mr Martin Archer attributed the earnings slowdown
to a consolidation among many companies following a sharp turnround in the
economy.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Generating an appetite for
foreign cash - China's Huaneng group is looking to the NYSE for fresh funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's Huaneng group, the country's largest power generating organisation,
has emerged as perhaps the most aggressive Chinese company seeking foreign
capital abroad, with planned listings in New York of two of its
subsidiaries.
Huaneng officials make no secret of their appetite for foreign capital to
fulfil ambitious expansion plans to the end of this century. They include
adding 15,000 megawatts of capacity to the existing 14,500MW under its
control.
In addition, its coal mines will be extended to produce 30m tonnes by the
year 2000, and a coal port will be equipped to handle 38m tonnes annually.
An ambitious railroad-building programme is also planned.
Mr Cao Leren, the group's senior engineer, describes as a 'breakthrough' the
prospect of the Huaneng International Power Development Corporation and
Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company being among the first direct
Chinese listings in New York.
'We need a tremendous amount of money to carry out our plans,' Mr Cao says.
The Huaneng official estimates that funding requirements will reach Yn150bn
(UDollars 17.4bn) in the six years to the year 2000. Of this total, the
company will contribute one-third from its own resources. Another one-third
will be raised domestically, much of it in the form of loans from the
newly-established State Development Bank.
This leaves a further one-third, or about Dollars 6bn, to be raised
internationally, either through share issues, bonds or BOT
(build-operate-transfer) equity ventures.
The group recently established China's first organisation specifically
designed to channel funds into BOT projects. Called the BOT Investment and
Development Corporation, its first project is a toll-road in partnership
with Beijing municipality.
The Huaneng group is also pursuing an innovative strategy in its New York
listings. Under the guidance of CS First Boston, Shandong Huaneng Power
Development hopes to raise some Dollars 400m through a public offering of
23.4m American depositary shares (ADS).
These will be a new class of shares, known as 'N' shares, which will be
offered to investors in the US, Europe and Asia. 'N' shares are similar in
concept to the 'B' shares listed on China's fledgling exchanges, and which
are denominated in dollars for foreigners (China's yuan is not convertible).
Each ADS will represent 50 ordinary 'N' shares.
The company, under a new electricity tariff schedule, is aiming for a return
of 15 per cent of its fixed net assets after costs and taxes. This is in
line with guidelines set by the central government for a reasonable rate of
return on equity investments in infrastructure projects in the power sector,
under BOT-type schemes.
Shandong Power operates four power stations with total capacity of 1,200MW
in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing. Huaneng International Power, 60
per cent-owned by the Huaneng group, runs power stations in coastal areas
with about 6,100MW under its control.
The China Huaneng Group grew out of a decision in 1985 to establish a
conservation fund to convert oil-fired power stations to coal, and to build
thermal stations. In 1988, Huaneng became a group and is now one of China's
10 biggest companies.
At the end of 1993, assets totalled Yn46bn against liabilities of Yn39.3bn.
Borrowings amounted to Yn35bn, of which about one-third was hard
currency-denominated. Net profit for the year was Yn2.2bn, double that of
1992.
In all, the group comprises 11 corporations and some 200 associated
companies, concentrated in the power sector. However, it is also involved in
real estate, trading and finance. Two of its power-operating companies are
listed on Chinese exchanges, one in Shanghai and the other in Shenzen.
Mr Cao, however, believes that foreign listings are 'much more meaningful'
for a company of Huaneng's size and diversity than a listing in Hong Kong,
where nine Chinese entities have been listed, or on one of the mainland
exchanges. This, he says, is because the pool of capital is so much larger.
Mr Cao seems confident - in spite of nervousness in the markets and
indications that investors are having second thoughts about opportunities in
China - that Huaneng will be well received. The two companies seeking
listings, he observes, are both engaged in power generation in a country
where there are 'serious shortages of electricity'.

US paper and forest products groups continue to report mixed second-quarter
results.
Boise Cascade yesterday showed a decline in second-quarter losses, to
Dollars 19.2m, or 86 cents a share, from losses before special charges of
Dollars 22.1m, or 85 cents, in the same 1993 quarter.
Louisiana-Pacific, meanwhile, reported record second-quarter earnings, at
Dollars 81.0m or 75 cents a share, up from Dollars 65.7m, or 60 cents, in
the 1993 second quarter.
Second-quarter sales at Boise Cascade were Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars
974m a year ago.
The company said most of the sales improvement stemmed from recent
acquisitions in its office products business, and from rising demand in its
building products sector. That sector's earnings also improved because the
price of logs, the raw material for building products, moderated during the
quarter.
However, operating losses in Boise Cascade's paper segment deepened during
the quarter. The company said average prices for its largest-volume grades,
uncoated free sheet and newsprint, were down about 6 per cent.
Weak prices, it added, were only partly offset by lower unit manufacturing
costs and increased volume.
Sales at Louisiana-Pacific rose to Dollars 775m from Dollars 597m a year
ago.
'Although the quarter started off slowly, as questions about interest rates
put some building products buying decisions on hold, business picked up
steadily during the quarter,' said Mr Harry Merlo, chairman.
'As we enter the second half of the year, numbers for housing starts,
building permits and existing home sales are strong,' he said.
Mr Merlo said the company's pulp market had also improved dramatically over
a year ago, with the prices of some grades rising by as much as 75 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Further slide in trading
revenues at JP Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The upheaval in world financial markets touched off by a series of US
interest rate increases in recent months led to a further fall in trading
revenues at JP Morgan, the US bank, in the second quarter of the year.
The bank's earnings from trading dropped to Dollars 228m in the three months
to June, less than half the average quarterly income of Dollars 514m seen in
1993, a record year.
The bank said it had not suffered any significant losses in particular
markets, but had seen 'modest positioning losses' in some fixed income,
foreign exchange and swaps markets.
The lower income levels also reflected a decision to reduce its exposure at
a time of market turmoil, the bank added.
The lower trading income, which compared with Dollars 520m in the same
quarter of 1993, was the main factor behind a fall in non-interest revenues
to Dollars 926m, from Dollars 1.1bn in the same period a year earlier.
Net interest revenue rose by 27 per cent to Dollars 540m, due mainly to the
receipt of Dollars 35m of past due interest on Brazilian bonds together with
Dollars 50m of interest on income tax refunds.
After-tax profits were bolstered, though, by a Dollars 225m gain from the
previously announced sale of part of the bank's interest in Columbia/HCA,
the US hospital group.
As a result, JP Morgan was able to report net income of Dollars 350m, or
Dollars 1.73 a share, compared with Dollars 431m, or Dollars 2.12 a share,
in the same period a year earlier. The annualised return on equity slipped
from 23.5 per cent to 14.8 per cent, as shareholders' funds grew further to
Dollars 9.7bn, from Dollars 8bn a year before.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, said that trading with customers had
remained at the high level of last year's second quarter, in spite of the
fall-off in trading income.
He pointed to advances in income from investment management and operational
services, as well as gains from equity sales, as an indication of the bank's
efforts to diversify its earnings.
For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 695m, or
Dollars 3.43 a share, down from Dollars 726m, or Dollars 3.59 a share, in
the first half last year.
In New York yesterday, JP Morgan's shares fell Dollars  1/4 to close at
Dollars 61 on mild disappointment at the results.

The board of Trans World Airlines, the troubled US carrier that has seen
five senior executives resign this year, yesterday said it had set up a
company-wide task force to 're-make' the airline.
Employees and management would work together to reorganise the company in an
effort to cut its operating costs and improve its ability to compete, it
said.
The suggestion had come from the heads of the airline's three labour unions
and its senior management.
TWA emerged from bankruptcy last November with 45 per cent of its shares
owned by employees. Yesterday Mr Jeffrey Erickson, who was brought in from
Reno Air as chief operating officer in April, said the employees were
committed to creating a successful airline.
United Airlines, the US carrier bought out by its employees this week,
yesterday named Mr John Edwardson, a former executive with Northwest
Airlines, as president. Mr Edwardson, who is chief financial officer of
Ameritech, the regional telephone company, will work with Mr Gerald
Greenwald, United's new chairman and chief executive, who has no airline
experience.

Videotron, the Canadian communications group developing cable television
franchises in southern England, recorded lower profits for the first nine
months of fiscal 1994, mainly due to problems with its Montreal broadcasting
unit.
The Canadian cable-TV business continued to grow and was profitable, and the
UK cable and telecommunications operations reached 11 per cent of
Videotron's total consolidated revenues. For the first nine months ended May
31, consolidated net profit was CDollars 19m (USDollars 14m) or 12 cents a
share, down from CDollars 22m, or 15 cents, a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 487m, up 8.7 per cent.
Videotron said heavier depreciation stemming from expansion of the UK
operations also reduced consolidated earnings.
Alcan Aluminium plans to sell its two North American building products
divisions, with annual revenues of USDollars 425m, to Genstar Capital.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Woolworth counts cost of change
 -Diversification has not been a success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Winfield Woolworth, the farm boy from upstate New York who founded the
Woolworth empire in 1879, was known as a brilliant retailing entrepreneur.
His skills are badly missed at the company that bears his name today.
With annual sales of nearly Dollars 10bn, Woolworth still ranks as one of
the world's biggest and best-known retailers. For years, however, it has
been struggling unsuccessfully to keep up with retail change in the US and
overseas.
On Wednesday, the company was forced to acknowledge the extent of its
financial difficulties by slashing its quarterly dividend from 29 cents a
share to 15 cents, the lowest level since 1987.
This was just the latest, however, in a series of troubles afflicting the
company.
Last year Woolworth undertook a huge restructure in an attempt to bolster
its flagging performance. It closed 970 stores across North America,
including half its traditional general merchandise stores and a third of its
Kinney shoe stores, at a cost of Dollars 726m before tax.
Even ignoring the restructuring charges, operating profits slumped from
Dollars 574m the previous year to just Dollars 73m in 1993. The company
blamed disappointing sales and the need for heavy markdowns to clear goods.
It reported net losses for the year of Dollars 495m compared with net
profits of Dollars 280m the previous year.
The poor performance has continued into the current year: first-quarter
losses worsened from a restated Dollars 24m net loss last year to Dollars
38m, dashing hopes that the restructuring alone would be enough to bring
profitable growth.
Once a bastion of US corporate respectability, Woolworth astonished Wall
Street and the US business community two months ago by revealing that
employees had fiddled the previous year's quarterly results to make losses
look like profits.
An investigation into the deceit failed to attribute blame, but it resulted
in the resignation of Mr Charles Young, the chief financial officer, and the
demotion to vice-chairman of Mr William Lavin, previously chairman. Mr Lavin
remains chief executive.
Last month Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded
Woolworth's debt from A minus to triple B plus with a negative outlook,
citing weakness in the company's general merchandise and Kinney shoe store
operations, and concerns about continued reliance on Kinney's Foot Locker as
the main driver of profitability.
The root cause of Woolworth's problems lies in its failure to find a winning
formula to replace the five-and-dime variety store concept on which it was
founded. The format has been in decline for 30 years amid a trend towards
more specialised retailing, though the pace of decline has varied from
country to country.
As long ago as the 1960s, Woolworth saw the way things were going, and
adopted the policy still in place today: using the cashflow from the mature
general merchandise store operations to finance an expansion into specialty
retailing. It was one of the first big retailers to enter the discount store
business with its Woolco chain, and it bought the Kinney shoe store
operation in 1965.
Woolco, however, was not a success. Woolworth built up big debts to support
its expansion but it was in too competitive a market, and the US chain was
closed in 1982. At the same time, Woolworth sold its British general
merchandise store chain to help fund its expansion into niche retailing.
In the years since, the specialty retailing operations have mushroomed.
Today, Woolworth owns more than 7,400 specialty stores operating under 40
different names in North America, Europe, Australasia and Asia. They include
the Foot Locker sports shoe stores, the Silk &amp; Satin lingerie stores, the
Northern Reflections women's casual wear stores, and the After Thoughts
handbag and accessory stores. The result is that Woolworth, best known for
its variety stores, is now the world's biggest specialty retailer.
However, as with Woolco, the diversification has not proved a financial
success. The only specialty retailer to have made a significant profit over
the years is Kinney Shoe, the subsidiary that runs the Foot Locker stores -
and its contribution to operating profits slumped from Dollars 360m to
Dollars 126m last year.
Overall, operating profits from the specialty store operations, before
restruc-turing charges, fell from Dollars 418m to Dollars 136m last year,
with Kinney accounting for the bulk of both figures. With the fashion for
sports shoes giving way to more rugged footwear, analysts are now asking
whether Woolworth's only successful diversification is in decline.
In a sense, Woolworth's decision to slash the dividend is part of its
response to these fears. The size of the pay-out had long looked
unsustainable in the light of the company's financial performance, and
halving it will leave the company with more money to invest in specialty
retailing.
The company also tried to reassure investors by putting Mr Ronald Berens,
previously head of Kinney Shoe, in charge of all its specialty retailing
operations worldwide.
Even so, the languishing share price says the market has little confidence
in the future. The wonder of Woolworth is that it is still around after all
these years: but to many investors, it is a retailer whose time has come,
and gone.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Tyco to acquire Kendall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tyco International, a diversified US manufacturer, is to acquire Kendall
International, a maker of disposable medical products, in an all-stock deal
valued yesterday at Dollars 1.38bn.
The acquisition will give Tyco, formerly Tyco Laboratories, a bigger
presence in a market that it estimates to account for annual sales of
Dollars 20bn in the US, and Dollars 50bn worldwide.
Some 80 per cent of Kendall's revenues, which in 1993 amounted to Dollars
816m, are in disposable medical products, from wound care items, used in
hospitals, to therapeutic hosiery sold through retail outlets.
About 17 per cent of the company's sales come from outside the US, with
local manufacturing and distribution facilities in Europe, the Far East and
Latin America.
Tyco, more than half of whose Dollars 3.3bn sales come from fire protection
systems, derives only Dollars 80m of its revenues from medical products at
present.
The merger is part of a move by Tyco to 'translate our manufacturing
expertise in packaging into higher margin products in the disposable medical
products market', said Mr Dennis Kozlowski, chairman and chief executive.
The combined business would be grown in the US and internationally, in part
through other acquisitions, he added.
Tyco said the transaction would not dilute its earnings per share, partly
because it planned to buy back 2.9m of its shares after the deal was
completed.
However, Tyco's shares slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 45 1/2.
Kendall's share price was up Dollars 3 to close at Dollars 54.

Ontario Hydro, the world's fourth-largest power company, is making its first
incursion into Latin America.
In association with Chilquinta, a Chilean electricity company, it has bought
a 60 per cent stake in Edelsur, one of Peru's formerly state-owned
electricity businesses. Edelsur covers the southern half of the capital,
Lima.
The consortium, known as Ontario Quinta, bid more than Dollars 212m for a
controlling stake.
The northern sector, Edelnor, was sold for Dollars 176.5m to a
Peruvian-Chilean-Spanish consortium. The principal partners are Spain's
Endesa, and Enersis and Chilectra of Chile.
Perelec, a third consortium made up of Electricite de France and SAUR, both
of France, Houston Industries of the US and Peru's Banco Wiese's investment
arm, bid only for Edelsur, but their offer was some Dollars 75m lower than
Ontario-Quinta's.
The nationwide generation and distribution company, Electroperu, will also
be sold.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Macy's agrees to Dollars 4.1bn
Bloomingdale's merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bloomingdale's and Macy's, two of the best-known names in US retailing, are
to be brought together in a Dollars 4.1bn deal. Their owners said yesterday
the merger would create the biggest department store group in the US.
The board of R. H. Macy, owner of the Macy's chain, announced it had given
in to six months of courtship by Federated Department Stores, owner of the
Bloomingdale's chain, and agreed to a merger.
The combined company will have more than 300 department stores spread across
the US, though it is likely that a small number will close where they
overlap. Annual revenues will exceed Dollars 13bn.
R. H. Macy has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
January 1992.
Until recently, it had hoped to submit a plan for a reorganisation that
would bring it out of bankruptcy under existing management. In January,
however, Federated Department Stores made an unusual takeover bid for R. H.
Macy by acquiring Dollars 449m worth of its highest-ranking debt from one of
the creditors. The purchase gave it a powerful say in the company's future.
Since then, R. H. Macy has been trying to convince creditors that they would
be better served by a plan that ensured the company's independence.
The argument, however, has been won by Federated, which offered creditors a
Dollars 4.1bn package comprising Dollars 378.3m in cash, Dollars 1.9bn in
debt, and Dollars 1.8bn of equity in the new Federated/R. H. Macy entity.
Subject to their boards' approval of a definitive merger agreement, the two
companies will now submit a joint re-organisation plan to the US bankruptcy
court by August 1.
Since the plan is supported by all the main creditors, including the
bondholders' committee, approval is unlikely to be withheld.
The companies hope the merger will be completed next January.
The new entity will be headed by Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and
chief executive. However, he will be joined on the board by four Macy
directors, including Mr Myron Ullman, current chairman and chief executive.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chrysler profit tops
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler yesterday provided the latest evidence of the robust recovery in
the US automobile industry when it announced record profits for the second
consecutive quarter.
The results were at the top end of Wall Street forecasts and cheered
investors, who bid the group's stock up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in
early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in the session, however,
the share price slid back to Dollars 49 3/8 for a net loss of Dollars  1/2
on the day.
Chrysler's strong second quarter took the group's first half profits to
Dollars 1.89bn, up from Dollars 1.22bn a year ago. It said it earned Dollars
956m, or Dollars 2.61 a share, in the second quarter, up from Dollars 685m,
or Dollars 1.55 a share, a year ago.
The results beat the previous record of Dollars 938m, or Dollars 2.55 a
share, achieved in the first three months of this year.
Sales and revenues jumped 19 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 26.3bn, due
primarily to strong US demand. Sales between April and June totalled
709,158, up from 625,295 in the previous three months.
Chrysler is the first of Detroit's 'Big Three' automobile manufacturers to
report its second-quarter results. Industry analysts expect Ford and General
Motors to post similarly strong earnings. They point to rising sales in the
healthy North American market and the recovery in Europe. Carmakers are also
benefiting from cost-cutting measures.
The impact of Chrysler's cost-reduction efforts is evident in the
improvement over the past year in the group's measure of profit-per-vehicle,
which jumped from Dollars 810 in the second three months of 1993 to Dollars
1,300 in the latest quarter.
The domestic market has been so strong that Chrysler has struggled to meet
demand for its most popular vehicles. Ford and GM have also struggled to
supply dealers.
Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said yesterday the group was 'carefully
adding increased capacity' over the next three years.
The group's share of the North American car and truck market was 15.4 per
cent, unchanged from a year ago.
Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported
second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 44m, unchanged from a year ago. The
group also announced yesterday it had contributed another Dollars 600m to
its pension fund, and was on target to wipe out its unfunded pension
liability - for long a restraint on its stock and credit rating - by the end
of this year.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sandoz shows 'solid' growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday reported
first-half sales up 2 per cent to SFr8.22bn (Dollars 6bn).
The figures suffered from the weakness of the US dollar and strength of the
Swiss franc. In local currencies, growth was described by the company as
'solid' at 8 per cent. The turnover was at the low end of expectations,
although Sandoz registered shares increased SFr11 to SFr659.
No profits figures were disclosed. First-half trading figures will be
released at the end of August.
Sales at the pharmaceuticals division fell 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn. In local
currency they increased 4 per cent if divestments by Biochemie, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, were excluded. Biochemie sold a Spanish antibiotics
plant at Santa Perpetua de Mogoda to Gist Brocades in July last year.
The nutrition division reported sales up 29 per cent to SFr1.15bn, an
increase of 38 per cent in local currencies. Sandoz said the strong increase
was mostly the result of acquisitions. Sales of Gerber Products, the US
baby-food manufacturer Sandoz is buying for Dollars 3.7bn, were not
included.
The chemicals operations reported sales down 8 per cent from SFr1.31bn to
SFr1.21bn, a fall of 2 per cent in local currencies. Excluding the
divestment of Alphen, the plastics additives company sold to Schenectady
International of New York in December, sales increased 1 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Popular, the big Spanish bank majority-owned by foreign institutions,
has turned in a resilient performance for the first half of 1994.
Pre-tax profits were Pta44.1bn (Dollars 350m), a 4.6 per cent dip on the
same period a year ago. After lower tax, net income was 1.9 per cent higher
at Pta30.2bn.
Net interest revenue fell 2.8 per cent to Pta79.8bn, reflecting the sharp
drop in interest rates between the two six-month periods and the resulting
squeeze on margins.
The net interest fall was less than some analysts had predicted and
suggested the possibility of more buoyant results in the second half of this
year.
Popular's balance sheet strength was underlined by total assets of
Pta3,038bn at end-June, 6.1 per cent up on December 1993 and 4.7 per cent up
on June 1993.
Popular's loans and discounts portfolio grew by 3.4 per cent in the half
year and by 7.2 per cent over the past 12 months. The ratio of
non-performing loans to total risks fell to 2.79 per cent, down from 2.90
per cent at end-March and 2.93 at end-December.
Popular is the first of the big Spanish banks to report interim figures and
its performance appears to set a strong standard for the results season.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computers group, has agreed to sell the financial
holding company of its Triumph-Adler office products subsidiary in Germany
to a consortium of German banks and investors for an unspecified sum.
However, the Italian group is retaining ownership of TA Vertriebs, which is
responsible for research, development and marketing of Triumph-Adler's range
of typewriters and office equipment in Germany and elsewhere.
Olivetti stressed yesterday that it would retain control of the
Triumph-Adler brand-name, and has increased the equity capital of TAV to
DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) to stimulate its activities.
Talks on the sale have been going on since the end of last year, and the
deal should be formally confirmed at a Triumph-Adler shareholder meeting in
August.
IMM, the consortium buying Triumph-Adler, said it would continue to
manufacture typewriters from the company's Frankfurt factory, and had agreed
a long-term contract for production and distribution with TAV.
But the consortium also plans to reorganise Triumph-Adler's activities into
selected new areas, so as to develop the group into a 'diversified holding
company for medium sized companies in stable markets'.
Both Triumph-Adler and TAV, which have suffered losses in the past few
years, are expected to record profits for 1994.
Triumph-Adler's typewriters were market leaders in the 1970s, at which time
it was owned by Litton Industries, the US group.
In the mid-1980s the company was owned by German motor group Volkswagen.
Olivetti took over the Nuremberg-based company in 1986 but attempts to
launch a Triumph-Adler computer came to nothing.
Triumph-Adler employs just 620 and lost DM70m in 1993 on sales of DM300m.

<TEXT>
The German insurance group Allianz is considering a bid for a majority stake
in Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, according to an Austrian newspaper
report.
Citing unnamed sources, the Vienna newspaper Standard said a delegation of
Allianz officials would meet Austrian finance ministry officials today in
Vienna for exploratory talks. A spokesman for Allianz in Munich declined to
comment on the report, citing German insider trading laws.
An offer by Allianz would add a new twist to the battle over Austria's
second largest bank, which is already being sought by CS Holding, the Swiss
banking group, and a consortium that includes Commerzbank of Germany,
Italian insurer Generali and various Austrian companies.
The government, which owns 49 per cent of Creditanstalt equity and 70 per
cent of its voting stock, wants to sell part of its holding before the end
of the year.
At current stock market prices, the government's stake in Creditanstalt is
worth about Sch14bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
Austria's finance minister Mr Ferdinand Lacina, a social democrat, is known
to favour the CS Holding bid because it would make Creditanstalt part of a
strong international banking group.
CS Holding, the Swiss financial group built around the Credit Suisse bank,
has promised to retain Creditanstalt's independence if its offer is
accepted.
However, the prospect of a large Austrian bank becoming a subsidiary of a
Swiss bank has aroused strong national opposition to the offer.
The Conservative People's party, the junior coalition partner, favours the
Austrian/Italian/German consortium.
In these circumstances, a bid by Allianz could be seen as the best solution
for both sides and therefore an acceptable compromise. It would be Allianz's
first move into banking.
Mr Lacina has postponed his decision until after the parliamentary elections
in October, and has asked outside experts to evaluate the various offers in
the meantime.

FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales rise 16% at Schering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group, said turnover in the first
half of 1994 had risen 16 per cent over the same period a year ago and would
be 12 per cent higher for the year as a whole, totalling DM4.6bn (Dollars
2.82bn)
However, Mr Giuseppe Vita, chief executive, warned that the company would
have to double its present 5 per cent profit margin over the next five years
if it was to keep abreast of its US competitors.
The improved turnover was due partly to a strong yen but mainly reflected
better sales across a range of pharmaceutical products, including
contraceptive pills and Betaseron, the first effective treatment for
multiple sclerosis.
The company, which is now focused exclusively on pharmaceuticals following
the sale of its agrochemicals division, gave no details about profits so far
this year. Full results for the first six months would be released at the
beginning of August, the company said.
The group said earlier this year that first-quarter earnings had risen 2 per
cent to DM124m and forecast that earnings for the year would match last
time's DM254m, 3 per cent down on the year before.
In the first two months of 1993, turnover had risen by 21 per cent over the
year before but the company said this jump was relative to low sales in the
same period in 1993, when health reforms in Germany had dented sales.
Continued uncertainty about health reforms in various countries, including
the US, would put pressure on pharmaceuticals producers, but 1994 sales of
Betaseron would reach the DM300m already forecast, the company said.
Schering's turnover totalled DM5.36bn last year but this included the
agrochemicals division, which was put into a 40/60 joint venture with
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, at the beginning of this year. The
improved 1994 turnover forecast is based solely on sales of pharmaceutical
products.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Druck gains 14% to Pounds 5.36m - Export
growth leads the rise in orders as sales to Japan double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Druck Holdings, the Leicester-based manufacturer of electronic pressure
measuring and control devices, yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.36m for the year to March 31, up from Pounds
4.69m the previous year.
Turnover grew by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 27.9m) with exports
accounting for about three-quarters of sales.
Earnings per share advanced by 12 per cent to 53.7p (48.1p) and the board is
recommending a final dividend of 7.1p (6.6p) making a total of 10.8p (10p)
for the year.
Mr John Salmon, chairman and chief executive of the USM-quoted group, said
Druck had again 'strengthened its competitive position in the measurement
and control of pressure throughout the world by the continued development of
new products and the establishment of new markets.'
Operating profits increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 4.82m)
and the operating margin edged up to 17.4 per cent (17.3 per cent).
Druck, the main operating company, increased its contribution to group
profits by 30 per cent on turnover which grew by 14 per cent.
Orders increased by 13 per cent with export orders growing by 16 per cent to
Pounds 24m. The main contributions to the increase in orders were from
Japan, where exports more than doubled, and to the rest of the world where
orders grew by 29 per cent.
The group spent Pounds 1.8m on research and development during the year and
ended March with net cash of Pounds 1.7m having used its strong positive
cash flow of Pounds 2m to eliminate gearing.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Barbour Index shares fall 16p on profit dip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Barbour Index, the Windsor-based specialist information services
group, fell by 16p to 198p after it announced a 15 per cent fall in annual
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.42m to Pounds 2.91m.
The directors had warned in January that its results for the 12 months to
end-April would 'be somewhat below those of last year'.
Sales for the period decreased by 4 per cent to Pounds 11.5m compared with
Pounds 12m and earnings per share were 16 per cent down from 13.8p to 11.6p.
Mr Brian Griffin, the executive chairman, said that a 19 per cent rise in
second half profits had been achieved by strict cost control and a small
rise in turnover.
The total dividend is raised by 6 per cent from 8p to 8.5p via a proposed
final payment of 5.8p (5.45p).

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure's Pounds 12m beats City
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanley Leisure Organisation, the Liverpool-based betting shops and casinos
group, reported a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to a record Pounds
12.4m for the year to May 1.
The result, which compared with Pounds 8.1m, was nearly Pounds 1m ahead of
analysts' expectations. The shares closed up 14p at 333p.
Turnover rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 265.2m (Pounds 218.5m).
Earnings per share were 44 per cent ahead to 18p against 12.5p restated for
January's Pounds 21m rights issue. A proposed final dividend of 3.5p lifts
the total to 5.25p (4.21p). Dividend cover is 3.16 times on post-tax profits
of Pounds 8.44m.
Stanley now owns 419 betting shops and 19 casinos. Of the 66 shops bought in
the year, 49 were the Selwyn Demmy chain in Scotland. Acquisitions, which
also include two casinos, contributed Pounds 884,000 of the Pounds 15.38m
operating profit and Pounds 14.47m of the Pounds 265.2m turnover.
One casino and two small groups of betting shops have been bought since the
rights issue - which was 98.83 per cent taken up - at a cost of only Pounds
3m. Cash balances improved to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 3.63m overdraft). Gearing
fell to 10 per cent (37 per cent) on increased shareholders' funds of Pounds
123m (Pounds 92.7m).
Stanley, which renegotiated a five-year Pounds 45m revolving credit facility
in March, remains cautiously acquisitive. Mr Leonard Steinberg, the
chairman, said it would continue to use sensible prices and potential for
improvement as the criteria for further buying. About Pounds 4m was spent on
upgrading shops and casinos.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prism Leisure ahead 38% but warns on first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prism Leisure Corporation, the USM-quoted computer games and music group,
yesterday reported a 38 per cent profits rise, but a warning that trading in
the first quarter of the current year had been 'somewhat disappointing'
pushed the shares down 5p at 167p.
Mr Geoff Young, chairman, said the Christmas quarter remained the company's
most significant trading period.
Pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to April 2 rose to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds
1.33m) on turnover 24 per cent higher at Pounds 19.4m. Earnings per share
increased to 14.2p (10.4p) and a recommended final dividend of 3.03p makes a
total for the year of 4.18p (3.27p).
Mr Young said the computer games division, and in particular the
merchandising operation, once more performed strongly. The audio and video
side however, had a difficult year, with turnover reduced.
The German subsidiary had a good year, with both turnover and profits up,
while Prism's pub quiz offshoot made a marginally lower contribution than in
previous years, but still 'performed creditably', said Mr Young.
In its first full year within the group, Paul Lamond - mainly trading in
board games - performed in line with expectations and contributed 'a useful
profit'.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shares in Ideal Hardware set at 225p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ideal Hardware, which is coming to market through a placing with
institutional investors, were priced yesterday at 225p, valuing the company
at Pounds 47.5m.
Ideal started trading in January 1987 and has grown into one of the largest
independent distributors of computer data storage products. It has between
10 and 15 per cent of the rapidly expanding distribution market in the UK
for disc, tape and optical drives.
In the year to April 30 pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 1.58m)
on turnover of Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 45.5m).
On the basis of historic earnings per share of 15p last year, the placing
price represents a p/e of 15.
Yesterday the directors said that, in the absence of unforeseen
circumstances, they expected to pay an interim dividend for the six months
to October 31 of 3.4p and to recommend a final dividend of 5.2p.
On this basis the shares will have a gross dividend yield of 4.8 per cent,
based on the placing price.
Under the flotation terms 7.47m shares, representing 35.3 per cent of the
issued capital, are being placed by Charterhouse Tilney with institutional
and other investors.
The placing will raise Pounds 16.8m after expenses, including Pounds 2.5m
for the company, which will help fund the purchase of larger premises.
Some 6.14m shares are being sold by existing shareholders. Mr Konrad
Goess-Saurau, one of the company's founders, is selling the bulk of his 26.2
per cent stake. Following the flotation, executive directors will hold a
little less than 53 per cent of the expanded capital.
The shares are expected to begin trading next Thursday.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Excalibur raises Pounds 5.5m to fund
expansion in music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Excalibur Group, the precision engineering and giftware company, yesterday
announced the acquisition of Lifetime Europe, a music and video distributor,
to be funded through a 1-for-4 rights issue.
Excalibur will make an initial consideration of Pounds 500,000 for Lifetime,
plus a further sum of up to Pounds 3m. The rights issue, fully underwritten
by Samuel Montagu, is expected to raise Pounds 5.5m net, pricing the shares
at 40p, which closed down 2 1/2 p yesterday at 46p.
Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said the acquisition would complement
Excalibur's presence in the budget music market. Lifetime showed turnover of
Pounds 2.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 540,000 in the year to December.
Excalibur also plans capital expenditure of Pounds 8m over the next two
years. Mr Griffiths said it was necessary to invest in the company's two
core divisions, precision engineering and consumer products, following a
restructuring programme and the disposal of loss-making operations.
In April Excalibur sold Premier Chain, its jewellery chain business, to its
management.
The precision engineering division, which contributed 50 per cent of
turnover, has an order book of Pounds 17m and has won a four-year contract
with LDV (formerly Leyland Daf Vans) for power and manual steering systems.
The division will receive an injection of Pounds 5.9m over the next two
years - Pounds 3.9m to increase capacity and Pounds 2m on plant replacement.
A further Pounds 2m will be spent on the consumer products division.
Gearing, which stood at more than 100 per cent in the last balance sheet,
was 95 per cent at the April 30 year-end. Indebtedness related to gold
bullion has been reduced by Pounds 4m to Pounds 266,000 during the year.
Excalibur reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 6.2m,
for the year to the end of April on turnover down from Pounds 61.6m to
Pounds 54.4m. The losses reflected goodwill of Pounds 3.3m written off
following the disposal of Premier Chain. Profits before exceptionals were
Pounds 2m against losses of Pounds 400,000.
Losses per share fell from 10.5p to 2.8p with adjusted earnings per share of
3.2p, compared with losses of 1.8p. A final dividend of 0.4p (0.3p) has been
recommended making an increased total of 0.65p, against 0.5p last time.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Furniture side helps Hampson to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in sales in the furniture division of Hampson Industries, the West
Bromwich-based diversified industrial group, contributed to a 75 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.42m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds
4.23m in the year to March 31 1994.
The increase in profits was achieved after charges of Pounds 1.39m, which
included a goodwill write-off of Pounds 937,000 following the closure of
Clearway Aluminium, the only division in the company involved in the
construction industry.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.39m to Pounds 6.28m with continuing
operations up 34 per cent at Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 4.95m). Turnover advanced
to Pounds 91.5m (Pounds 79.1m) with Pounds 90m (Pounds 78m) from continuing
operations. Gearing at the year end was reduced to 26 per cent (46 per
cent).
Mr Ray Way, chairman, said the group's financial position continued to
strengthen and borrowings were 'well under control'.
The furniture division, Ian Walker Furniture, hit by sterling's realignment
last year, saw margins restored and sales increase to help push operating
profits in the consumer goods division up from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 1.53m
on turnover of Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 33.3m).
International demand helped sales at Erlson Engineering, a supplier of
turbocharger components, increase by 18 per cent while hardening commodity
prices and better customer demand helped trading conditions in the aluminium
refining division. Total operating profits for the industrial goods division
rose from Pounds 4.59m to Pounds 4.71m on turnover of Pounds 43.1m (Pounds
37.8m).
Mr Way said diversification was essential in the precision engineering
division where margins continued to be under pressure and order intakes were
down because of cuts in defence expenditure. A programme was under way to
shift the customer base of Bellhouse Hartwell and BHW (Components) and
penetrate the civil sector.
A final dividend of 1.5p (1.2p) makes a 2p (1.6p) total. Earnings were 3.06p
(0.96p).

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Peel Holdings rises to Pounds 10.2m -
Shares fall 12p to 298p on disappointing growth in net asset value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peel Holdings, the property company that owns the Manchester Ship Canal,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.2m for the year to March 31,
up from Pounds 9.4m in 1993.
The shares fell 12p to 298p, reflecting a lower-than-expected increase in
net asset value per share, which rose only 13p to 328p, despite the recovery
in the UK property market.
The results followed the announcement last Friday that the Court of Appeal
had quashed planning permission for Peel's proposed Pounds 200m shopping
centre at Dumplington, Greater Manchester. But the company remains
optimistic that its appeal will be successful.
The Dumplington development was at the centre of Peel's eight-year battle to
gain control of Manchester Ship Canal. This site remains on the books valued
at Pounds 18.1m, but Mr Peter Scott, managing director, said this was a
comfortable 'fall-back value.'
Turnover during the year fell marginally to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds 68.1m),
with total net rental income rising from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 43.2m,
despite Pounds 2.52m of fresh annualised voids.
The company's portfolio is currently carrying voids of Pounds 5.2m, and this
was reflected in an external valuation of the office and industrial
properties, which lowered their values by 16 per cent and 19 per cent
respectively, compared with the last external valuation in 1991.
Overall, however, property values rose by Pounds 9.7m, due to a 28 per cent
increase in values of out-of-town retail centres, and increases in overseas
property.
The company has also reinstated a property development programme, but it is
proceeding only where sufficient pre-sales and pre-lets can be achieved. It
has only Pounds 10m tied up in development projects.
The port operations contributed operating profit of Pounds 3.8m, but
suffered a further Pounds 1.22m from voluntary severance costs.
The company's net debt has increased by Pounds 33m to Pounds 369.1m, as a
result of the buy-out of the minority shareholders in Manchester Ship Canal
last year.
Gearing amounts to 116 per cent, but interest payable fell from Pounds 37.2m
to Pounds 36.1m, due to lower interest rates.
Last November, the company issued Pounds 37.4m of 8.59 per cent long-term
bonds, and its fixed average borrowing cost is now 10.05 per cent.
The recommended final dividend of 3.2p makes a total of 4.5p (4p) for the
year. Earnings per share were 6.11p (2.41p).

spur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First-quarter sales for Marks and Spencer, the retailer, in north America,
continental Europe and east Asia were up on last year and particularly good
in Hong Kong and the International Franchise Group, Sir Richard Greenbury,
chairman, told the annual meeting.
He added that sales in the UK were 'up to expectations'.
The group is to open two new stores, in Paris and Valencia, in the autumn
and is investigating the possibility of moving into Japan and China.
The pace of expansion in the UK was 'accelerating', said Sir Richard, with
plans for capital expenditure of more than Pounds 1bn over the next three
years. In the past year capital expenditure reached 'a new high of Pounds
350m.' the group had 'the biggest footage expansion programme in (its)
history'.
M&amp;S shares rose 8p to 414p.

Invesco has so far raised Pounds 19m from a placing of shares in its Japan
Discovery Investment Trust.
The size of the trust has been capped at Pounds 70m, with the minimum set at
Pounds 20m. The public offer, which opened yesterday, ends on July 29 and
dealings begin on August 8.
The new trust will invest in smaller Japanese companies for long-term
capital growth. The Japanese investment trust sector has been the focus of
substantial enthusiasm so far this year.
Earlier this month, Schroders' new Japan Growth Investment Trust, investing
in a broad range of companies, was oversubscribed by Pounds 2.8m after
raising its full Pounds 125m. Fidelity Japanese Values, a smaller companies
trust, raised Pounds 105m.
Invesco already runs two Japanese unit trusts, and the new investment trust
will be managed by its existing Tokyo-based fund managers.
Shares are issued at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares.
Issue expenses have been capped at 4.9 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sage enhances market position with
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sage Group, the Newcastle-based accounting software company, has
significantly enhanced its market position and product portfolio through the
acquisition of Multisoft Financial Systems for an initial Pounds 4m in cash.
Sage will make additional payments to the vendors of up to a maximum of
Pounds 2.5m subject to sales performance in the period up to September 30
next year.
The acquisition, which will be paid for out of cash balances, will
supplement Sage's traditional market strength in providing personal computer
accounting software mainly for small businesses.
Multisoft is a leading supplier of accounting and business software for
medium and larger companies and is currently developing a new range of
software designed to be run on the 'open-system' client/server networks
which are being rapidly introduced in larger companies. This new software
will be launched later this year.
Commenting on the deal, Mr David Goldman, Sage's chairman, said, 'We regard
the acquisition of Multisoft as being very important in terms of our overall
strategy. This move consolidates our coverage of the UK accounting market. I
am particularly excited about the client/server capability which Multisoft
will bring to the group.'
The accounting software market for multi-user network systems for medium and
larger companies is characterised by more expensive, higher added-value
products which are tailored to the needs of the customer. There is no
dominant supplier in this large segment of the market at present.
Multisoft, which employs 72 people in Alton, Hampshire, was set up in 1983
and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1990. It has an installed
client base of more than 8,000, of which 45 per cent are companies with
annual turnover of more than Pounds 8m.
In the year to June 30, Multisoft's operating profits grew sharply to 'not
less than' Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 58,000) on sales of about Pounds 5m
(Pounds 4.48m). The net assets being acquired have a book value of Pounds
1.2m.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sheridan leaves Samuel Montagu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christopher Sheridan, who has been chief executive of Samuel Montagu for
ten years, is to leave the merchant bank at the end of next month.
He is to be replaced by Mr Keith Harris, a former Morgan Grenfell and Drexel
Burnham Lambert merchant banker who is currently managing director of the
corporate finance arm of Apax Partners, the venture capital group.
HSBC, the Hong Kong and Shanghai banking group which acquired Samuel Montagu
when it took over Midland Bank in 1992, said that Mr Sheridan was leaving by
mutual agreement.
The company said that Mr Sheridan, 51, was leaving the company 'at a
successful point in its history' though it has had its share of problems in
recent years. Last October it was ordered to pay Pounds 172m of damages and
costs to British &amp; Commonwealth, the failed financial services group.
It is also facing a Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the
flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1991 in which the bank acted as
adviser to Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Harris, 41, started his career with Orion Bank, joining Morgan Grenfell
in 1980 and moving to New York in 1985 to head its US operations.
In 1988 he was appointed managing director of the international corporate
finance arm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street investment bank that
collapsed in 1990.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnum Power, which designs built-in uninterruptible power supply units
(Bi-ups) and is planning a USM flotation through a placing with
institutional investors, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.23m for the
year to May 31, on turnover of Pounds 59,000.
The prospectus for the flotation, which was issued yesterday, also shows
that the company lost Pounds 155,000 in the year to May 31 1992, which the
following year rose to Pounds 482,000 on turnover of Pounds 10,000 as the
company developed its technology.
However, Magnum's directors express their confidence in the prospectus that
there is 'potentially a large market for Bi-ups, which is currently served
by the manufacturers of external uninterruptible power supply devices.'
Bi-ups can be built into electronic equipment, such as personal computers,
to protect against the loss of valuable data and equipment damage if the
primary power supply fails.
Magnum was founded in 1990 by Mr Vincent Lavin, chief executive, who claims
to have invented Bi-ups the previous year, and Mr Ian Irvin, finance
director.
The flotation is sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AB Foods gets approval for reorganisation

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court has given approval for the proposed reorganisation of
Associated British Foods, the milling, baking and food products group, in
spite of concerns raised by the Charity Commission.
ABF said yesterday that courts had ratified the decision of the trustees of
the Garfield Weston Foundation to approve the restructuring, which is
designed to improve tax planning of the Weston family trusts which control
the company.
The Charity Commission, which had raised initial concerns about the
proposals, was not party to the court hearing, which was held in private. It
said yesterday that it noted the decision. A second court hearing to
sanction the ABF scheme of arrangement will take place on July 27.
The company said its plans would go ahead as proposed, with dealings in
shares of Associated British Foods to commence on August 1, ABF preference
shares repaid on August 5, and interim dividend of 8.5p on September 1, and
a special dividend of 10p per share on October 14.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Beazer pays Pounds 31m for Mowlem Homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beazer Homes, the recently-floated former Hanson subsidiary, has bought the
housebuilding arm of John Mowlem, the construction and airports group, for
Pounds 31m.
Mr Dennis Webb, Beazer's chief executive, said the acquisition 'fits in well
with our strategy to increase our volumes and market share, particularly in
the south-east'.
Mowlem announced at the time of its Pounds 63m rights issue last March that
it planned to focus on its contracting and scaffolding business, and would
sell John Mowlem Homes, along with part of its stake in London City Airport.
John Mowlem Homes is a specialist housebuilder with a substantial
middle-market presence in the south-east and south-west of England, where
Beazer is comparatively weak.
The acquisition was priced at a marginal premium to John Mowlem's Pounds
30.2m book value for its housebuilding arm, but the subsidiary also has
Pounds 1.8m cash.
After flotation Beazer held cash resources of Pounds 74.5m, so it is in a
position to build up further John Mowlem's land bank, in addition to funding
its intention of expansion into Wales and north-western England.
John Mowlem had a land bank of 2,250 plots at June 30 and incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 1.4m in the year to December.

<TEXT>
McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services
company, has agreed to pay about Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m) for Xerox Computer
Services, a division of Xerox Corporation of the US which markets software
for manufacturing applications.
The company said the acquisition would give it a 'strong presence' in the US
and expand its range of computer applications with an integrated
manufacturing software package - called 'Chess' - already installed in 200
sites.
XCS had revenues of Dollars 20m last year and about 200 staff will transfer
under the deal.
MDIS was floated on the London stock exchange in March of this year. The
flotation, which valued the group at about Pounds 250m, was one of the
largest in the information technology sector this year.
MDIS specialises in applications software and software tools. On a
post-flotation pro forma basis, the company had pre-tax profits of Pounds
21.3m in the year to December 1993.
Mr Jerry Causley, MDIS chief executive, said: Chess complements our existing
offerings to what we see as a global market.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud shares fall on 23% decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jones Stroud (Holdings) reported pre-tax profits down 23 per cent at Pounds
5.01m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 6.51m. The Nottingham-based
textiles company blamed difficult trading and closure costs.
The shares lost 33p to close at 270p, a new low for the year.
Turnover edged up from Pounds 70.9m to Pounds 71.7m. The pre-tax figure was
struck after Pounds 315,000 costs of closing the US division of Jones Stroud
(Australia).
Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said that some subsidiaries were reporting
improved results because of reduced costs but the market for stretch yarns
'has yet to reach a satisfactory level'. This would have an adverse effect
on interim results.
He added that it was too early to forecast results for the year, but 'we
will be very disappointed if they do not exceed those of last year'.
Earnings per share came out at 19.12p (24.85p). The final dividend is being
held at 5.5p for an increased total of 9p (8.8p).

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US food pioneer dies in crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Payton, the 50-year-old founder of many of Britain's best-known
US-style restaurants, died in a car crash on Wednesday night.
Mr Payton came to the UK from Chicago in 1973 and set up the Chicago Rib
Shack, Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J Beans food chains.
He revelled in the fact that he had initially faced cynicism from many
British financiers over his plans to serve American style food to the
British.
However, he recently won over the City when My Kinda Town, the company
comprising his restaurant chains, was floated in May. The company currently
has a market capitalisation of Pounds 32m.
The company was launched on the stock market as a means of buying out the
group's main backers and Mr Payton himself raised about Pounds 4.5m from
share sales.
More of his recent attention had been focused on his 16th century
Leicestershire mansion, Stapleford Park, which had also been launched as a
country hotel.
The restaurant business expanded at an extraordinary rate, and Mr Payton was
never short of new ideas, with recent additions to the stable coming in the
form of Chicago Meatpackers, Tacos and Salsa]
His ambitions did not stop with the UK. By the time of the flotation, his
chain covered 29 restaurants and bars in 17 cities, ranging from Belfast to
Beirut.
Mr Payton retired from the board of My Kinda Town at the time of the
flotation, leaving a company which made about Pounds 2m last year.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rank declines to Pounds 16.3m -
Restructuring charges of Pounds 111.6m but City pleased with result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rank Organisation yesterday reported an interim pre-tax profit down from
Pounds 96.1m to Pounds 16.3m after restructuring charges totalling Pounds
111.6m. But this was well above City expectations and the shares closed 13p
higher at 404 1/2 p yesterday.
Rank, whose interests include Butlin's holidays, casinos and the Hard Rock
Cafes, said that after three difficult years there was an improvement in
underlying trading in the first half.
Before charges, profits were up 41 per cent to Pounds 127.9m. The company
had previously adopted a more cautious view of the recovery.
Pre-tax profit for the 28 weeks to May 14 was after a charge of Pounds
49.6m, relating mostly to the closure of the video distribution business,
and after the group's Pounds 62m share of Rank Xerox's restructuring costs.
Profits from Rank Xerox, before restructuring costs, were up 38 per cent to
Pounds 94.6m.
An improvement in video duplication lifted profits in the film and
television division from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 24.5m. The group said it
expected a strong second half from the video duplication of the film
Jurassic Park.
The Pinewood film studios also enjoyed increased operating profits. Odeon
cinemas saw admissions rise 4 per cent and prices 1 per cent. The group
expects to benefit in the second half from the cinema success of the film
Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The holiday division's profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 7m. The
number of holidays sold was up 12 per cent in the first half. Bookings for
the summer, however, are only slightly up in volume and 3 per cent by value.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the group's older holiday
customers were adversely affected by low interest rates.
The recreation division, which includes bingo clubs and casinos, saw
operating profits increase from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 34.2m, Bingo profits
were level with last time. Casino admissions were up 3 per cent and spending
per head was 5 per cent higher.
The leisure division, which includes Hard Rock Cafes and holiday resorts,
saw operating profits fall from Pounds 22.3m to Pounds 20.4m.
(Pounds 972.4m), including discontinued operations of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds
75.5m).
The interim dividend is 4.25p. Last year, the group paid a full year's
dividend at the interim stage, with an enhanced share alternative. It said
the equivalent pay-out at the halfway stage last time would have been 4.03p.
Losses per share were 3.4p (earnings 5.4p). After adjustment for Rank Xerox
restructuring costs, earnings were 7.8p (4.9p).

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Kitty Little pays FFr75m for L'Amy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kitty Little, the USM-quoted consumer goods manufacturer, is acquiring
Groupe L'Amy, France's largest maker and distributor of sunglasses and
spectacle frames, for FFr75.2m (Pounds 8.9m).
The cash acquisition is funded by a placing of 29.8m new ordinary shares at
30p. The company is also raising Pounds 9.5m through a placing and 3-for-2
open offer of 31.6m shares at 30p for working capital.
Kitty Little's shares were suspended at 41p on April 11.
Mr Warren Kanders, chief executive, said the company also planned to join
the main market and change its name to Eyecare Products.
The deal is expected to give Kitty Little a larger share of an eyeware
market worth Pounds 5.9bn in western Europe and Pounds 8.2bn in the US.
Under a lengthy financial reconstruction L'Amy made provisions of FFr105m
last year to cover the cost of overhauling its core business. Before
provisions, operating profits for the 1993 year were FFr4m (FFr14m losses)
on sales of FFr568m (FFr636m).
Mr Martin Franklin, chairman of Kitty Little, blamed the problems on
debt-financed acquisitions, which have since been closed.
Nevertheless, he predicted the enlarged group, with a market capitalisation
of Pounds 24.7m, would expand with strategic alliances and more efficient
production.
Under the terms of the acquisition, which brings with it designer brands
such as Lacoste and Nina Ricci, the Pounds 8.9m raised by the placing will
be used to acquire loans of FFr225.3m owed by L'Amy to various banks.
The banks will also receive Class A warrants for an aggregate of 4m new
ordinary shares, exercisable at 100p per share. Another tranche of warrants,
also exercisable at 100p, will be issued to banks providing on-going
medium-term facilities of FFr16.3m.
Dealings are expected to begin on August 9.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Talks over Wembley refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A syndicate of 22 banks owed Pounds 152m by Wembley, yesterday said that
they had begun discussing plans to refinance the debt-burdened stadium and
greyhound tracks operator.
The banks, led by Barclays and Schroders, are expected to scrutinise
proposals made to the Wembley board by three investor groups.
The groups are: Apollo Advisers, a US investment group led by Mr Leon Black;
Allied Entertainments, the promotions business controlled by Mr Harvey
Goldsmith; and Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, who are City
entrepreneurs.
All three proposals envisage an injection of new equity while retaining the
current management.
Although the banks are not expected to decide on a prefered package for some
weeks, the Wembley board is said to have indicated that it favours the
proposal drawn up by Mr Johnson and Mr Osmond.
Wembley has been made aware of possible conflicts with concert organisers if
Mr Goldsmith's promotions company is chosen to refinance the group.
Concern has also been raised over a possible shareholder backlash if the
stadium - widely regarded as the home of English football - is seen to be
refinanced by US investors.
Officials acting for Mr Johnson and Mr Osmond, whose previous deals included
the successful reverse takeover of PizzaExpress, have already begun due
diligence at Wembley.
Their plans are thought to centre on a debt-for-equity swap and rescue
rights issue.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates in Pounds 55m land deal with
L&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, is to pay
Pounds 55m for Legal and General's 32 acre portion of the Winnersh Triangle
business estate near Reading, Berkshire, in its largest property purchase in
more than five years.
The acquisition will give Slough control of a 75 acre business park, with a
total of 1m sq ft of built office and warehouse space.
The L&amp;G site was developed in the early 1980s and has 556,000 sq ft of
space, with a current rent roll of Pounds 4.37m from tenants including Mars,
Hewlett Packard and ICL.
The purchase price puts the property on a yield of 7.96 per cent, and Mr
Derek Wilson, group managing director, said the property was let on long
leases and was 'not significantly over-rented'.
Mr Wilson said there would be management benefits from taking on the entire
site. L&amp;G is being paid Pounds 12.5m in cash, with the remainder being paid
through the issue of 5.36m new Slough shares.
Slough has concentrated primarily on developing sites in its existing
portfolio, rather than buying new properties, and it currently has 120,000
sq ft of new property under construction.
Within the Winnersh site, there is a further 12.5 acres where more
development is planned.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Unbroken growth for Great Universal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Universal Stores, the mail order and financial services group, has
extended its 46-year record of consistent growth with a 9.4 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 518.9m for the year to March.
But the shares slipped 25p to 562p on news that the company had no plans to
spend its Pounds 1.46bn cash pile.
Since GUS enfranchised its 'A' shares last year there has been speculation
that it would buy in some of its shares, or pay a special dividend.
Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said that a buy-in was 'under review' but
stressed that it had not been 'fully explored'. He added that the group had
looked at potential acquisitions, but the vendors were asking too much for
goodwill.
Dividends are being increased by 18 per cent to 13p, with a final of 9p, but
cover remains above 2 1/2 times with earnings per share up 9 per cent at
34.3p.
Last year, strong growth in operating profits offset the fall in returns
from the cash holding, which was due to lower interest rates. Operating
profits rose 17 per cent to Pounds 414m, and would have been Pounds 3.8m
higher at constant exchange rates, but net interest receivable fell to
Pounds 101.8m (Pounds 117.2m).
Mr Pugh said the improving trend had continued into this year with sales and
pre-tax profits in the first two months 'somewhat ahead' of the comparable
period. But the company cautioned that consumer demand remained 'selective'.
All the group's trading divisions turned in higher profits last year, with
the home shopping contribution up 21 per cent at Pounds 194.2m, on turnover
up 5 per cent at Pounds 1.95bn, and the finance businesses turning in Pounds
67.3m (Pounds 53.3m) at the operating level.
Rent on its investment property portfolio rose to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds
51.4m) with the value rising 17 per cent to Pounds 850.3m. Profits from
Burberrys and Scotch House jumped 44 per cent on sales of Pounds 200.9m
(Pounds 170.6m), helped by strong growth in the Far East.
Trading cash flow was down from Pounds 229.9m to Pounds 55.2m due largely to
a Pounds 127m jump in debtors, particularly at the General Guarantee
Corporation finance subsidiary. The cash pile slipped to Pounds 1.46bn
(Pounds 1.5bn). BZW forecast profits of Pounds 575m this year for earnings
per share of about 38p.

charge in the current quarter.
The restructuring plan, announced yesterday, will reduce Digital's workforce
by about 20 per cent to 65,000.
Digital had been expected to take drastic actions to cut costs since the
company reported heavier than expected losses of Dollars 183m for its third
quarter, ending in March.
Digital has been struggling for several years to come to terms with
declining sales of its traditional minicomputer products and an
industry-wide trend toward lower profit margins and has recorded losses of
more than Dollars 3bn over the past three years despite substantial cost
cutting.
Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive, said that the actions announced yesterday
would further reduce annual costs by about Dollars 1.8bn. He expects Digital
to record profits from operations by the end of the calendar year.
The new restructuring plan will accelerate workforce reductions, which had
previously been expected to occur over a two-year period. Digital is also
expected to dispose of some of its business units. The company said further
announcements would be made on Monday.
Mr Palmer said that Digital's two plants in Scotland would not be
significantly affected by the restructuring.
Earlier this month the company revealed it was in talks with Quantum, a US
disc-drive manufacturer, about the sale of parts of Digital's data storage
business.
About 60 per cent of the Dollars 1.2bn fourth quarter restructuring charge
will be related to job cuts, with the balance covering facilities. The
company will also write off assets of Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m.
The management restructuring is Mr Palmer's third attempt to increase the
efficiency of Digital's operations.
The company has established two divisions; Computer Systems and Components,
plus an Advanced Technology Group to develop products and identify market
opportunities. Each business unit will include engineering, manufacturing,
marketing and sales operations and be responsible for its own financial
performance.

<TEXT>
If there was one thing that Mr James Millar liked emphasising to visitors to
Wm Low's Dundee offices it was the contribution the headquarters made to the
local economy, writes James Buxton.
'We obtain almost all our professional services locally,' the chairman would
say. 'Even the taxi driver taking you to the station is benefiting. None of
that would happen if we were part of a group based in London.'
So it is poignant that the loss of Wm Low's independence will involve the
closure of its headquarters and probable redundancy for many of its 300
staff.
The takeover will mean the disappearance of a historic name from the
Scottish business scene. It also means a reduction in the modest number of
Scottish quoted companies.
Wm Low was founded in 1867 by two Dundee families. By 1914 the chain had
grown to 80 stores. Mr Millar, a terrier of a man, became managing director
in 1981, upgrading the supermarkets and expanding into northern England.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union
Congress, said yesterday he was disappointed to see 'another Scottish
company bite the dust'. But it was better for Wm Low to be taken over than
to see it closing stores.
Dundee can absorb the loss of Wm Low's head office, despite unemployment of
11 per cent. But it badly needs some good news after last year's rancourous
industrial dispute and closure at the Timex electronics plant.
As for the customers, one said: 'The staff at Willie Low's are the nicest
and most polite of the supermarkets I go to.' Would she keep shopping there
when it became Tesco? 'Yes I would.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / London United claims rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claims on the insurance subsidiaries of London United Investments, the
financial conglomerate which crashed four years ago, could climb to Dollars
10.8bn (Pounds 6.9bn), according to the companies' administrators.
Insurance liabilities faced by the subsidiaries - known as the KWELM
companies - have increased to Dollars 6.2bn, compared with Dollars 4.7bn a
year ago. An additional reserve - a so-called 'special margin'  - has also
been increased by Dollars 900m to Dollars 4.6bn. The insolvency of the KWELM
companies is regarded as the biggest in the history of the insurance
industry.
The companies underwrote relatively high risk liability business,
specialising in the insurance of North American companies and professionals
against legal awards. Most of the business was written through HS Weavers
(Underwriting) Agencies between 1972 and 1990.
Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, administrators of the
insolvency scheme, said 'recent developments in the US liability market'
were responsible for the higher losses.
The companies had been hit by legal awards against the manufacturers of
silicon breast implants and against accountants, as well as by asbestos and
pollution-related actions, said Mr Hughes.
Despite the increased liabilities, the administrators expect eventually to
be able to pay 40 cents for each dollar claimed, the same percentage payout
estimated a year ago.
'We have collected some Dollars 90m more cash than we forecast last year,
reflecting good progress with reinsurers,' explained Mr Hughes.
The administrators have set aside Dollars 563m as a first payment to
creditors. Payments will be made by September 30.
Claimants on policies sold by Kingscroft Insurance and El Paso Insurance
will receive 8 cents in the dollar. Those on Lime Street will receive 9
cents, on Walbrook 4 cents and on Mutual Reinsurance 5 cents.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Caught in the superstores'cross-border crossfire: Andrew
Bolger explains why the William Low chain has become a bid target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland has become one of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds in the
war raging through the UK food retailing sector.
It has been targeted both by aggressive discount retailers, wooing canny
consumers, and the larger UK supermarket groups such as J. Sainsbury and
Tesco, both of which have relatively small market shares north of the
border.
This competitive crossfire was cited yesterday by Mr James Millar, when the
63-year-old chairman of William Low explained why his board was recommending
that the group - which he joined 35 years ago - should accept Tesco's
takeover bid.
Mr Millar said his Dundee-based group had prospered during the 1980s, buoyed
by the growth of the Scottish economy and the retail sector. But recent
price deflation, and continuing pressure on margins and sales, had exposed
the group's small size - and consequent inability to benefit from the
economies of scale enjoyed by its larger competitors. Like-for-like sales
were running 5 per cent below last year's level.
Mr Millar said: 'The Tesco offer represents better value for shareholders
than Wm Low could achieve as an independent retailer, as the harsher retail
food market and our lack of scale limit our prospects for profit growth over
the next few years.'
Tesco is certainly comfortably ahead of Wm Low on a variety of performance
indicators: sales per sq ft; sales and profits per employee; and return on
capital employed.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, said he saw considerable potential for
improving the performance of Wm Low's stores by introducing its own lower
prices and product ranges, alongside a Pounds 35m refit programme. Excluding
rationalisation costs, the deal was expected to have a neutral effect on
Tesco's earnings this year (which ends in February), but should make a
positive contribution thereafter.
Tesco said there was a strong fit between its 16 Scottish stores and Wm
Low's 45 outlets in Scotland and 12 in the north of England. This deal would
give Tesco a larger presence in Scotland at a single step, without adding to
industry capacity. The combined group would have 13.7 per cent of the
Scottish market - second only to Argyll Group, which owns the Safeway and
Presto stores.
The City generally welcomed the deal, although some analysts questioned how
well Wm Low's typically smaller stores would fit into Tesco's portfolio.
Only 16 of the Wm Low stores are above 20,000 sq ft. Tesco said it had been
developing an interest in smaller superstores, and 30 of the William Low
stores were more than 15,000 sq ft.
One analyst said the deal represented both an opportunity and challenge for
Tesco. While giving it Pounds 500m of additional annual sales and scope for
profit enhancement, the changes to the stores' identity, products and prices
would have to be carefully timed. He added: 'The question of overcapacity
does not go away - and the question of what to do with the smaller stores in
the portfolio will have to be resolved.'
Tesco said it was pleased to be maintaining the progress reported at its
annual meeting in May, when it said sales were more than 3 per cent up in
existing stores and more than 10.5 per cent higher in total.
Although profit margins for the first half of the year were unlikely to be
enhanced, progress was being made on margin management.
This deal may well put an independent Wm Low out of the reckoning, but the
fierce struggle for profits and shares in the UK retail food market looks
set to continue.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Rules on capital held by banks to reflect new derivatives
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision yesterday proposed new rules for
banks which will require them to hold far more capital against increasingly
complex derivative instruments.
'The (Basle) Committee's review indicated that the current approach may
produce insufficient capital for certain kinds of instruments,' the Bank for
International Settlements said.
It noted that current capital requirements were designed for traditional
interest and currency swaps rather than the commodity and equity derivatives
'which are rapidly growing segments of the market'.
The proposals also suggest that more capital should be required for
longer-term derivative positions which can cause hefty losses for the banks
in volatile market conditions.
The Basle Committee, a division of the BIS, said it was seeking comments on
the proposals by October 10 and hoped to implement them by mid-1995.
However, the higher capital requirement will be offset by an amendment to
the Capital Accord of 1988. This will sharply reduce the amount of capital
banks have to hold for off-balance sheet transactions which can be 'netted'
with a single counterparty.
According to the Bank of England, this rule could reduce the capital
requirement of a 'typical' bank portfolio of interest rate and currency
swaps by 25 to 40 per cent.
The Capital Accord of 1988 sets out international standards for banks aimed
at insuring they have enough capital to withstand risks.
The new netting arrangements, which had been proposed last year, will force
banks to set aside capital only for the 'net' exposure, that is, the
difference between the value of all the transactions with a single
counterparty.
The arrangements will only help banks in countries, such as Britain and the
US, whose bankruptcy laws recognise netting.
Thus, banks which may have several offsetting transactions with each other -
such as a series of interest rate or currency swaps - will only need to have
enough capital for a small portion of the total value.
However, the Bank of England said yesterday that UK and other EU banks will
not be allowed to take advantage of the new rule until it becomes part of an
EU Capital Adequacy Directive next year.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Shareholders criticise BT management: Broker's survey asks
opinions of 15 largest institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has found that several of its largest
shareholders are either unenthusiastic or critical of its senior management,
after a survey conducted through its stockbroker.
The shareholders said the exercise was conducted within the past two weeks
through Cazenove, BT's broker, which promised them anonymity.
Yesterday BT confirmed that 'structured interviews' had taken place with 15
of its largest institutional investors, based on a faxed questionnaire.
'Some of the responses were good, some indifferent, and some could be
described as giving cause for concern,' a spokesman said. He added, however,
that he was confident there was no criticism of named individuals.
The survey did, however, ask for opinions about three executives: Sir Iain
Vallance, chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Hepher, managing
director, and Mr Robert Brace, finance director.
Five shareholders were contacted by the Financial Times. One said he had
expressed general disappointment with the senior management.
Another said: 'We told them we viewed Sir Iain as sort of a figurehead and
we are not really too sure about exactly who is running the company.'
A third shareholder said that while he rated Sir Iain as doing a reasonable
job under difficult circumstances, he could venture no opinion on the other
two named executives because he was unsure what they did.
Shareholders were also asked questions covering six areas of BT's business:
profits, dividends, regulation, competition, cable and overseas activities.
One BT executive said the interviews were motivated partly by concern at the
steep fall in BT's share price in the first half of the year, and a belief
that City confidence in the company needed to be boosted. BT's share price
fell by nearly a quarter between February 1 and July 1.
BT conceded it was the company's first such approach to its large
shareholders, but declined to disclose the results or to say whether the
survey had been authorised by the board.
The shareholders said they were taken aback at the style of the survey,
which they felt had been clumsily handled.
'It's a very odd way of conducting your shareholder relations,' said one
investor, arguing that in recent years BT has been aloof from its largest
investors, sometimes leaving years between visits to its largest
shareholders.
City analysts noted recent initiatives by BT including an analysts' briefing
by line managers on BT's response to local competition from new cable
operators.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Concern over Channel 5 plans: New TV service may be
available to only 50% of population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision on readvertising the licence to run a new Channel 5 was yesterday
postponed until September by the Independent Television Commission amid
concern that the government may have damaged the venture's financial
viability.
The delay came as the National Heritage Department unveiled compromise
proposals allowing the channel to go ahead using existing technology, but
with its audience reduced from levels envisaged earlier.
The limiting of the channel's coverage keeps open the possibility of the
eventual launch of up to 12 new digital channels. Four of these would be
national, with the others allowing for regional variations. Digital
technology increases the number of channels that can be transmitted and lets
viewers receive programmes on much wider screens.
All the proposals are for channels using over-the-air transmissions, rather
than satellite or cable.
Yesterday's move is the government response to the ITC's announcement in
February that it wanted to readvertise a Channel 5 licence. The commission
turned down the only bid for the licence 18 months ago, mainly because of a
lack of shareholder commitment to the consortium involved.
The channel could be a combination of a national schedule of evening
programmes, supplemented by local city television for several hours a day.
The ITC said yesterday it was concerned that one of the two frequencies
originally approved for Channel 5 would no longer be available. This would
reduce coverage from the original 74 per cent of the population to about 50
per cent.
'This can only make the prospects for successfully launching Channel 5 more
difficult than they would otherwise have been,' said the commission.
The commission said it would consider, with a view to deciding in September,
whether the latest plans 'do form the basis on which the ITC can proceed to
readvertise the licence and, if so, when and on what terms'.
The original Channel 5 plan envisaged using two spare frequencies - channels
35 and 37 - to give the 74 per cent coverage.
The new plan reserves channel 35 for the launch of four digital national
television services. This means some areas of the country, such as
Manchester and the north-east coast, would be unable to receive the new
Channel 5 service unless new frequencies, subject to international
permission, are found.
The government said that up to 53 per cent coverage was guaranteed for
Channel 5. This could rise to above 60 per cent if the use of extra
frequencies was approved by neighbouring countries.
Under the government plans, the four present television channels, plus
Channel 5, would automatically be given a digital channel. This would allow
'simulcasting' - the simultaneous transmission of programmes on both digital
and existing technology.
Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive, said the government had given no
indication of the timing of the legislation needed to introduce digital
television or of the introduction of digital services.

FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The regulator's decision not to liberalise the wholesale electricity market
will be regarded as a climb-down by large energy users. Big industrial
companies had been pressing for the right to buy electricity outside the
pool and for changes to the bidding process by which pool prices are set.
Offer has given them neither. Yet the regulator's overall conclusion that
the costs and risks of tinkering with the present arrangements outweigh the
likely benefits has merit.
Changing the system of marginal pricing - whereby all generators receive the
highest bid required to meet demand - would not necessarily lead to cheaper
electricity. At present small generators which have signed long-term gas
supply contracts put in artificially low bids to be sure of constant
business. Bidding practice would change if generators were held to their
individual bids. These smaller generators would have to guess where to pitch
their bids to be sure of winning business. National Power and PowerGen,
which have more flexible plant and are almost always the marginal bidder,
would find such a system easier to play. Their market power might actually
increase.
The decision not to allow large users to buy outside the pool is, on the
surface, harder to defend. But Offer is right to worry about maintaining
volume and transparency in the pool. Since the two large players have the
advantage of a range of fully-depreciated generating capacity, they might
anyway have picked up the best of the outside contracts.

FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to see why Rank merits a premium rating. The stock has strongly
outperformed the market over the past year. One reason was a widely-held
belief that the leisure group would benefit disproportionately from the
economic recovery. Another was a belief that Rank would make a handsome
profit from selling its 49 per cent investment in Rank Xerox to Xerox.
Yesterday's interim results provide little support for the first argument.
Operating profits from the businesses Rank manages itself were only 9 per
cent up on the same period of last year. Margins barely advanced. That
hardly looks like profits making a strong cyclical recovery. Moreover, the
longer-term outlook for these managed businesses is not especially rosy. The
video duplication side, a star performer in these results, will gradually
decline as video-tapes are overtaken by compact discs and electronic
delivery of videos. The bingo business, where profits were flat in the half,
appears to be suffering against the competition. Similarly, the holiday
operations are stuck in a low-growth market, as Britons are increasingly
travelling abroad for their holidays.
It is true that Rank Xerox was a bright spark, increasing its profit
contribution before restructuring costs by 38 per cent. But a quick sale to
Xerox does not look likely. For a start, the US photocopier giant does not
have enough cash. Even if it did, much of the profit from a sale would be
gobbled up in capital gains tax.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sleeping giant of the stores sector seemed finally to have woken up last
year when it enfranchised its shareholders and hinted it might return some
of its cash mountain to investors. But judging by yesterday's annual
figures, at least, GUS has turned over, yawned and nodded off again.
Expectations that the company would launch a buy-back programme or special
dividend were dashed and GUS's shares fell 4 per cent on the disappointment.
Such a response seems myopic given the strength of GUS's trading
performance. All divisions made good progress, with the mail order arm again
shining through. But shareholders have been salivating at what could be done
with GUS's underutilised balance sheet, which boasts Pounds 1.5bn of cash
and Pounds 1bn of freehold and long-leasehold properties. How the likes of
Hanson would gear up from such a base scarcely bears contemplation. GUS,
though, seems committed to some more dull plodding which will frustrate its
more avaricious shareholders. Lower interest receipts are already dampening
GUS's figures. Buying more gilts hardly constitutes the most attractive use
for surplus cash.
That said, GUS's conservatism has its merits, as is demonstrated by 46 years
of increased pre-tax profits with no calls on shareholders during that time.
There seems little reason why the company cannot continue in the same vein
making it the most reliable of investments. Indeed, investors wondering
whether to put their money into cash, gilts, property or equities should
look no further. In GUS, they get all four in one.

FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco's tasty titbit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By valuing William Low on a multiple of 5.6 times historic earnings and a
yield of 6.2 per cent, it was clear that the market had given up hope for
the Scottish grocery chain. Thankfully for Low shareholders, Tesco thinks
otherwise. By annexing the 57-store chain to its empire, Tesco will double
its market share in Scotland overnight. It should be able to make quick
efficiency gains by knocking out Low's head office and rationalising its
distribution network. Tesco could also lift sales by pushing its own cheaper
products through the stores. The economies of scale are such that Tesco can
offer a 33 per cent bid premium and still promise the deal will enhance
earnings next year. The transaction is like the food retailing acquisitions
of old. Tesco has performed this trick several times before.
Indeed, the purchase makes so much sense that it would be surprising if the
logic did not appeal to others. J. Sainsbury, in particular, has been
expanding in Scotland but has run into obstacles. Stricter planning rules
have made it hard to buy greenfield sites while competitors, such as Argyll,
have bid up the prices of available plots to keep Sainsbury out. Buying a
big chunk of infrastructure in Scotland must appeal, given its most
northernmost distribution centre is outside Manchester. The possibility of
Sainsbury launching a hostile bid seems remote. But it is certainly puzzling
why Low's financial advisers, Baring Brothers, which conducted such an
effective auction for the toy-maker Spear, did not try to entice Sainsbury
into the frame as well.

Sir Crispin Tickell, formerly Britain's UN ambassador and now head of Green

Translated from their own Russian by two Westminster scholars, it goes like
this:
The rise of Zhirinovsky goes to show
That evil's not confined to Uncle
Joe;
And Russia learns the lesson, sad
but true,
Democracy produces bastards, too.

If Mohammed won't move to the mountain, then the mountain must shift
instead. Dissatisfied with the number of business types willing to trek
across London to St James's Square, the Royal Institute of International
Affairs is next Monday heading east, to get nearer its putative corporate
audience.
At the Bank of England's first 'Chatham House in the City' meeting, the
speaker will be Celso Amorim, foreign minister of Brazil, a country the
institute sees as an 'emerging market'. Admission is 'by ticket only' and
would-be participants were supposed to apply by July 4.
As of yesterday, however, the lecture was far from being a sell-out.
Presumably because, as the old Brazilian adage has it, 'Brazil is the land
of the future - and always will be'.

If you can't beat them, get them to join you. So must think Britain's Union
of Communication Workers, which has hired Lowe Bell Political, part of Sir
Tim Bell's public relations outfit, to lobby backbench Conservative MPs
against the government's plans for partial privatisation of the Post Office.
Sir Tim built his reputation by working for the Tories. He helped the Coal
Board beef up its PR campaign during the 1984 coalminers' strike. Nor should
we forget his key role in all Baroness Thatcher's general election
victories.
Thus who better, reasons the UCW, to persuade disgruntled Tory backbenchers
of the need to keep the Post Office public? And Sir Tim's advice comes
relatively cheaply too - an initial three-month contract costing 'in excess'
of Pounds 10,000 a month.
Watch closely who poses Post Office questions in the Commons, after the

Craving another international organisation is understandable; going after
two more may be thought a trifle greedy. Not only does Geneva want to play
host to son of Gatt - the new World Trade Organisation - now it wants to
become the world's environment capital as well.
The Swiss parliament has voted SFr75m to transform the old seat of the
League of Nations into a 'House of the Environment'. The Palais Wilson, on
the shores of Lake Geneva, is intended to be home for the European arm of
the United Nations Environment Programme - which has its headquarters in
Nairobi - as well as a number of other environmental non-governmental
organisations.
Behind the cash is the Swiss hope that the UN can be persuaded to keep in
Geneva the secretariats dealing with biodiversity, climate change,
desertification, toxic waste and endangered species. But it has a fight on
its hands. Bonn is fighting tooth and nail to get the WTO.
Yesterday Switzerland upped the ante, saying as part of its WTO bid package
it would allow Islamic diplomats - for all international bodies - to
register two wives, against the current practice of permitting just the one.
Geneva's hopes of remaining a centre for international affairs have recently
taken a bashing; it's lost the UN Commission for Sustainable Development and
much of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs to New York. Perhaps it
should content itself with the WTO and have done with it.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: What is wrong with Mr Santer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the mismanagement on Corfu three weeks ago, there was always a chance
that the re-launched process for selecting the European Commission president
at today's special summit in Brussels would result in an unsatisfactory
compromise. That risk seems about to become reality. In the wake of
Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the German government has made a
vigorous effort from the EU chair to find a candidate capable of rallying
unanimous assent. Mr Jacques Santer has emerged as the favourite to be
nominated today, mainly because no one has strong grounds for turning him
down.
The Luxembourg prime minister may be regarded as a safe choice.
Unfortunately, he is an insufficently compelling one to be agreed without a
proper debate on the future running of the Commission. Rather than select
now a less than inspiring successor to Mr Jacques Delors, the heads of
government would be well advised to wait until the autumn. A delay in the
timetable set out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl might look like a setback. But
it would allow time for the appropriateness of Mr Santer and alternative
candidates to be openly discussed. In particular, it would permit a useful
period for mandatory consultation with the European Parliament.
In an editorial on April 27, the Financial Times suggested that the
Commission president would need to combine the qualities of an effective
administrator, an economic tactician able to help generate growth and jobs,
and a visionary who could steer a Union that is widening as it becomes more
integrated. The FT has also consistently argued that the secretive procedure
for allocating this important office is undemocratic and should be reformed.
If Mr Santer fulfilled in an ideal fashion the above three criteria, the
shortcomings in the method of choosing him could perhaps be overlooked. He
has shown competence running the Grand Duchy since 1984, and has plenty of
experience of Euro-diplomacy. However, Mr Santer cannot be considered an
optimal candidate for a job whose holder could play a vital role in shaping
the Union up to the end of the century. The choice of a figure representing
the lowest common denominator of member governments' wishes, selected under
a process that exacerbates Europe's democratic deficit, would mark a wrong
turning.
The Commission presidency raises some exacting questions for Mr Kohl, the
chairman of today's meeting. Mr Kohl has frequently underlined the need to
increase the powers of the Strasbourg assembly, a goal only partly achieved
with the Maastricht treaty. Initial soundings from newly elected MEPs
indicate that Mr Santer is likely to receive at best an unenthusiastic
endorsement. If Mr Kohl were to take the assembly inadequately into account
during the consultation procedure laid down by Maastricht, that could damage
both the chancellor and the chances of constructive relations between the
parliament and the European Council.
Today's summit will also require adroitness from Mr John Major. The UK prime
minister will not want to deploy Britain's veto for a second time, not least
because Mr Santer's appointment could serve Britain's interest of trimming
the Commission's sails. However, other governments might realise the danger
that a quick decision could turn out to be the wrong one. Any participant at
today's summit with misgivings about Mr Santer's candidature should be
encouraged to speak out. It is still not too late for a better choice.

FT  15 JUL 94 / When neighbours make good returns: The yen's rise is
encouraging a strategic shift by Japanese industry into other Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most important - and least noticed - consequences of the yen's
recent rise has been to drive Japan into a fresh trade and investment
assault on its Asian neighbours.
Its economic advance into Asia, which began with the first round of yen
appreciation in the late 1980s, is entering a new phase. The US and Europe
stand helpless, watching their share of Japanese investment decline and
Japan's economic dominance of Asia increase.
Asia overtook the US as Japan's largest export destination in 1991 and last
year Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US
for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US
than to Asia; now the balance is the other way.
Japanese direct investment in the rest of Asia has followed a similar
pattern, a short way behind export growth. Its investments there rose more
than threefold from Dollars 2.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 7.3bn in 1993, roughly
one-fifth of Japanese investment worldwide.
Japanese investment in Asia will nearly double, as a share of overall
foreign investment, to 37.5 per cent this year, according to a recent survey
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. At this rate, Asia will
by the end of the decade overtake the US as the largest recipient of
Japanese direct investment, believes Mr Chi-hung Kwan, senior manager at
Nomura Research Institute (NRI).
One of the latest leading Japanese companies to bolster its presence in the
region is Toshiba, the electronic machinery maker, which recently asked four
of its domestic telecommunications equipment component suppliers to decamp
from Japan to its plant in Huanzhou, an industrial port in eastern China.
This is the first time it has asked its suppliers to move wholesale into
Asia, a change in strategy motivated by its managers' realisation that
Japan's economic fortunes are becoming increasingly linked with those of its
quickly industrialising neighbours.
Until recently, the group used its 14 plants there as satellites, explains
Mr Kazuo Ishiguro, the group's Asian manager. Their job was to assemble
Japanese-made components cheaply and re-export them to Japan, the US and
Europe.
Like many Japanese companies, Toshiba responded to the yen's sharp rise in
value after the 1985 Plaza accord, which was aimed at curbing the value of
the dollar, by shifting the lowest technology parts of its production
outside Japan.
Now, Toshiba also assumes that Asia will be its fastest-growing market for
at least the next decade, not merely the pool of cheap production it was in
the 1980s, says Mr Ishiguro. He predicts Huanzhou-type operations will be
the new pattern for Toshiba's investment in the region.
A growing number of Japanese companies can be expected to follow Toshiba's
example and add component suppliers to their basic assembly plants in the
region, believes Mr Yoshio Sakakibara, Asian director of the Japan External
Trade Organisation (Jetro).
'Across Asia, Japanese companies are looking to increase their local content
ratios, because the size of the market is increasing,' he says. There is a
second, more basic factor. Many seek to step up local content to avoid heavy
import duties on part-assembled products. This was, incidentally, one reason
for the wave of Japanese investment in Europe a decade ago.
Japan's industrial advance into east Asia has been led by sectors in which
assembly forms a high share of costs, such as consumer electronics - as a
result of which Japan last year became a net importer of colour televisions
for the first time - home appliances and cars. Automotive component
suppliers have yet to join the exodus on the same scale.
Notable examples include consumer electronic giants Matsushita and Sharp in
Malaysia, which have become so deeply embedded in the local economy that
their combined local sales account for 6 per cent of the country's gross
domestic product, according to Jetro.
Toyota, Hitachi and Sony have all in recent months opened new plants or
announced expansion plans in Thailand, to sell to the local market. Japanese
banks have followed their industrial customers so that the rest of Asia last
year overtook Europe to become the second-most important foreign destination
of Japanese banks' foreign loans after the US.
So far, Japanese companies have reaped rich rewards from their Asian
onslaught, all the more welcome when their domestic market has been
struggling through the longest recession in postwar years. According to the
Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the operating profits of manufacturers'
Asian offshoots, as a percentage of turnover, averaged 4.8 per cent in 1991,
well above the 0.9 per cent average for overseas subsidiaries.
Japan's economic influence in the rest of Asia has grown so strong that its
neighbours are now under pressure to peg their currencies to the yen, rather
than the dollar - the first step towards the formation of a yen bloc, argues
the NRI's Mr Kwan.
A yen bloc in Asia might seem, to many, a distant prospect, given that the
region's political and economic differences are even greater than between
Europe Union countries, which are struggling to establish a currency bloc.
Yet even without a yen bloc, Japan's tilt towards Asia will help give the
region a 'force, coherence and structure that will change - and profoundly -
not only the global balance of economic, industrial and financial power, but
also the international balance of political power,' predicts Mr Kenneth
Curtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia.
Japan's economic advance on Asia does, however, face barriers. These include
corporate Japan's understandable caution, regional political instability -
illustrated by the worries over North Korea's even less predictable new
leadership - and the tentativeness of Tokyo's attempts to deepen diplomatic
relations in the rest of Asia.
Mr Susumu Taketomi, the IBJ's chief economist, believes the growth rate of
Japan's Asian investments will be constrained by companies' unwillingness to
break the social taboo against making redundancies at home. There will be,
he predicts, a reorganisation of Japanese investments within the region,
away from relatively high-cost areas such as Hong Kong into cheap ones such
as southern China.
Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia will continue to rise, but Mr
Taketomi believes the overall volume of trade will grow fast enough to
defuse serious political problems of the kind that bedevil Japan over its
surplus with the US.
'This surplus is healthy for Asian countries. They will probably succeed in
upgrading their industrial structure so that they will show a surplus at the
end of the century. Japan was in a similar situation in the 1960s,' he says.
Forty years later, Japan will be the prime candidate to absorb the coming
explosion in Asian exports, he predicts.
The government has played a cautious role in supporting Japan's economic
advance into Asia by trying to deepen diplomatic relations with the region -
partly in response to the weakening in Tokyo's relations with Washington
brought by the end of the cold war.
Until recently, Japan's Asian strategy was one-dimensional. It consisted of
disbursing 60 per cent of its annual overseas aid budget - the world's
largest - to the region, a hangover from postwar reparations. But Japan's
support for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec), set up five
years ago partly on a blueprint drawn up by Tokyo's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, has enabled it to make a slightly wider
diplomatic contribution. Tokyo will host the third summit of Apec leaders
next year, and is backing the Asean Regional Forum - a body formed to
discuss security in the region.
However, Japan still has some way to go to win its neighbours' complete
trust. A claim made in May by a former justice minister that the 1937
massacre of Nanking, an infamous Japanese wartime atrocity, never happened,
created serious diplomatic damage, undermining especially South Korean
government efforts to persuade other Asian countries of Japanese
credibility.
It also sent shivers of alarm through Japanese company subsidiaries across
Asia, according to some of their Tokyo-based colleagues. None of them
reported a significant drop in sales as a result, but the incident showed
that Japan's inexorable economic advance into Asia will not always be
smooth.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: More rubbish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recycling household rubbish may be environmentally damaging. It can also be
very expensive. Those are the clear messages of yesterday's report by the UK
parliamentary select committee on the environment. They are long overdue and
need a response.
Recycling is one of the UK government's most popular environmental policies.
People love to be told that their efforts can save the planet. Children,
inspired by school projects and television programmes, insist their parents
take bottles to the bottle bank rather than sneaking them into the bin.
The case for recycling metals, particularly aluminium, is well established,
according to the waste industry. Metals can be easily extracted from rubbish
tips with magnets and melted down.
But some recycling may well consume more natural resources, particularly
energy, than it saves. The virtues of recycling glass and paper are not
always clear cut. The case for recycling plastics, despite technological
improvements, is hotly disputed.
Such calculations are complex. They depend partly on assumptions about
energy consumed in collecting waste. They also depend on the value assigned
to conserving resources, be they renewable, like trees, or not. Such
estimates should still be made. If there is no environmental benefit, there
is no reason to pay the considerable costs of some recycling schemes.
In the government's attempt to devise a policy on waste disposal, it has
failed to make thorough comparisons of the environmental merits of the rival
methods: recycling, landfill, and incineration. Nor, in urging people to
minimise waste, has it estimated the costs of doing so. It is in danger of
adding an expensive - and quite probably counter-productive - strand to its
environmental policy.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rifkind's miracle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen years after Margaret Thatcher came to power, and nearly four years
after she left office, Thatcherism has at last penetrated the British armed
forces. It had been applied at least partially to defence procurement in the
1980s; but not until this year did the Ministry of Defence, with some help
from the Treasury and the private sector, manage to discover more than
Pounds 750m of unnecessary annual expenditure on support services, all of
which can be saved without in any way affecting the efficiency and fighting
quality of frontline forces.
That, at least, is what Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, asked the
House of Commons to believe yesterday, when he unveiled his defence costs
study, entitled 'Front Line First'. In fact, he almost made an announcement
of cuts worth Pounds 750m a year, to which he was committed by the 1993
Budget statement, sound like an increase in defence spending. First, he
listed all the procurement projects which have been on hold since last
December, and which would have had to be cancelled had the savings in
support services not been found. Then he went on to announce extra items,
for which money had been miraculously found because the savings identified
actually went beyond what the Budget statement required.
Some of these 'enhancements' will simply reverse the effect of earlier cuts,
for instance by taking a frigate and a submarine out of mothballs and
putting a squadron of Harrier aircraft back in the front line. Others are
genuinely new, such as a big increase in operational training for the army
and airforce, some Pounds 60m-worth of command, control and communications
equipment for a new joint rapid deployment force modelled on the French
Force d'Action Rapide, and a probable purchase of submarine-launched cruise
missiles from the US.
The savings, Mr Rifkind stressed, could be found because he and his staff
were given eight months to look for them, and because they enlisted the help
of people within the armed forces, down to middle-rank officers and below,
as well as senior Treasury civil servants and private sector executives. A
broad theme of the exercise is decentralisation, with budgetary
responsibility devolved downwards to junior officers.
All this sounds thoroughly laudable, but if such large sums were really
being wasted, one can only wonder why on earth it was not done much sooner.
Inevitably the suspicion arises, and has been voiced by both retired and
serving officers, that risks are being taken which were hitherto considered
unacceptable. To take one example, will not a concentration of all
headquarters facilities in one place render the whole British defence effort
vulnerable to a single act of terrorism?
The real weakness of the study, however, is its lack of reference to any
strategic assumptions about the mission of Britain's armed forces. Mr
Rifkind holds that no such reference is necessary, since frontline strengths
are unchanged and are designed to fulfil commitments already outlined in
last year's white paper, 'Defending Our Future'. But that white paper only
outlined them in very general terms, and fell well short of being the
re-examination of Britain's military requirements, starting from first
principles, which the fundamental geopolitical changes of the last five
years would surely justify. Britain has yet to carry out an exercise
comparable to last year's 'Bottom Up Review' in the US, or this year's Livre
Blanc in France. It still needs one.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Power to the people: Charles Leadbeater and Andrew Adonis
examine the need for a reform of democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Democracy is leading a double life. Two and a half thousand years after its
emergence, the virtues of contested elections and open debate are only just
reaching parts of eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Yet in democracy's
heartlands, the developed liberal democracies of the west, there is malaise.
Dissatisfaction with governments' performance is widespread. Parliaments
often look like antiquated, self-serving talking shops. Leaders struggle to
acquire credibility. Political parties are losing members.
The media are often more effective in mobilising public opinion, for
instance over Bosnia, than are political parties. Independent think-tanks
and research groups often formulate more creative policies than parties or
the civil service.
In the era of Internet, telephone phone-ins and spreading experiments with
electronic democracy, the 19th-century procedures of parliament and the
council chamber have become anachronistic. Liberal democracies are
increasingly run by oligarchies of professional politicians, only loosely
constrained by occasional elections.
The result is that the relationship between politicians and the people they
represent has become tenuous. Most people can imagine forming a lasting
relationship with the place they live in, the company they work for, friends
and partners, and even products they regularly consume. But few people can
imagine forming an engaged, active and trusting relationship with
politicians.
This public disillusion could generate growing apathy. To restore public
confidence that politicians are fit to lead society, politics will have to
reform itself, by becoming more transparent and responsive.
Democracy changed in the past, most notably in the 19th century, with the
extension of the franchise, the development of local government and the
creation of political parties. It needs to change again, to give clearer
control over the holders of political power to more people. A period of
reform is needed to develop the role of direct democracy as a counterpoint
to established channels of decision-making.
Three moderate and specific measures to give citizens more direct say in
politics would start to rejuvenate the established democracies:
Voter Vetoes. Apart from Switzerland and a few US states, referendums are
not used regularly to inform government decision making. The referendum was
widely discredited in Europe by its use in Nazi Germany. Politicians dislike
referendums because they take decisions out of established hands.
A Voter Veto would overcome these objections. It would amount to an advisory
referendum on legislation passed at a national or local level. Once laws
were passed by parliament, for instance ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, a referendum could be held if more than 2 per cent of the electorate
signed a petition calling for a vote. The outcome would be purely advisory,
but the prospect of such a vote would act as a check on hasty or unpopular
decisions. In the UK the debacle over the poll tax may have been avoided had
the country employed such a simple democratic check on the power of the
executive.
Voter Juries. The jury commands public respect as the centrepiece of a fair
justice system, which works because hundreds of thousands of citizens a year
give their time to make it work. The jury principle could be applied to
politics.
At a national level two juries of 20 randomly selected adults could be
convened each year to deliberate upon issues such as whether universal
childcare should be available for the under-fives and how it should be paid
for; or whether there should be a law of privacy against press intrusion.
Their decisions would be advisory, but under the law establishing the
political jury system the government would have to take into account the
findings. At a local level Voter Juries could advise councils on issues from
planning to policing and housing.
Voter Feedback. Governments should start experiments with local electronic
democracy, so-called electronic town halls. Telecommunications and
entertainment companies have launched a number of experiments with
multimedia technology, to test the commercial prospects of using
telecommunications to provide interactive links between televisions and
computers.
Advanced communications will play an increasing role in politics everywhere.
But at the moment the most likely beneficiaries are the rising band of rich
commercial-populist politicians, such as Ross Perot in the US and Silvio
Berlusconi in Italy. To avoid multimedia being corralled by political
leaders keen to promote themselves, there should be a matching public policy
to test multimedia's potential for open democratic decision-making.
A public policy to promote electronic democracy could usefully learn from
the 'televote projects' in Oregon and Hawaii, in which voters were sent
packages of information and argument before a televised town meeting, at
which viewers could register votes electronically.
From California to New Zealand, democratic experiments with the new
communications technologies are under way. Europe should join the pack.
A fuller version of these arguments is in articles by Andrew Adonis, Geoff
Mulgan and Charles Leadbeater in the current Demos Quarterly, from 9
Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AP

FT  15 JUL 94 / Bretton Woods (50 Years): Managers, not police - Mahbub ul
Haq continues the anniversary series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAHBUB UL HAQ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Lord Keynes and Harry White were to rise from their graves, would they
recognise their own creations? The chances are rather slim, for the Bretton
Woods institutions have drifted far from their original vision. Keynes
proposed a fund equal to one half of world imports, to enable it to exercise
a major influence on the global monetary system. Even the more conservative
White proposed reserves equalling one-sixth of world imports.
Keynes also regarded balance of payments surpluses as a vice and deficits as
a virtue, since deficits sustained global effective demand and generated
employment. Moreover, at the heart of the global monetary system were to be
fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates.
Today, the International Monetary Fund controls liquidity equal to only 2
per cent of world imports. Deficit nations, particularly in the developing
world, come under tremendous pressure for adjustment, but surplus nations do
not. Finally, fixed exchange rates collapsed in the early 1970s and
subsequent attempts to introduce a modicum of stability have proved largely
futile.
The World Bank did help raise market funds at lower cost, with longer
maturities, and for purposes that private markets would not have touched. It
also introduced the International Development Association in 1960, to
provide cheap loans to poor nations. Yet recently its net resource
transfers, including IDA funds, have been negative, to the tune of Dollars
1bn to Dollars 2bn a year. Private lending to developing countries has
increased rapidly, but three-quarters of it has been to about 10 relatively
better-off economies in Latin America and south-east Asia.
Two aspects of this 50-year evolution are particularly worrying. First, the
Bretton Woods institutions are no longer institutions of global management:
they police the developing world instead. The Group of Seven leading
industrial countries and the private capital markets have taken over the
global job.
Second, while founders of the Bretton Woods institutions were searching for
expansionary economic policies, world leaders have now become more
preoccupied with inflation than with jobs (though the pendulum is beginning
to swing back once more).
The developing countries have, unfortunately, had to live with the
consequences of the more deflationary agendas of the industrial world. The
emphasis has too often been on adjustment via demand contraction rather than
supply expansion. Also, the wrong items have usually been cut. There are
many low-priority budgetary items. Yet education and health expenditures
have often been trimmed ahead of military expenditures, and food subsidies
to the poor slashed in preference to subsidies to landlords and
industrialists. The staff of the Bretton Woods institutions do not normally
seek such outcomes, but they should have offered stronger resistance.
What reforms would help reposition these institutions for the 21st century?
There does need to be a global institution to ensure sound macro-economic
management and global monetary stability. It should be able to perform five
functions:
Help stabilise global economic activity.
Act as a lender of last resort to financial institutions.
Calm financial markets when they become disorderly.
Regulate banks and institutions with an international reach.
Create and regulate new international liquidity.
At least the first four functions must be played by the IMF if it is to
reclaim its role in the global monetary system. Four cautious steps would
start it in the right direction.
First, there should be a new issue of some SDR 30bn-50bn in reserves. This
is appropriate now, when inflationary pressures are low, primary commodity
prices have hit bottom, most industrial countries are reducing budget
deficits and an extra dose of global liquidity might help fuel world
economic recovery.
Second, the Compensatory and Contingency Financial Facility (CCFF) of the
IMF should offer full compensation for shortfalls in exports. Its loan
period also needs to be extended. Even more important, there should be no
policy conditionality.
Third, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements, the IMF
should gain some regulatory control over international banking.
Fourth, the IMF must acquire a greater role in global macro-economic
management, by exerting influence over the policies of major industrial
powers.
The World Bank is the finest institution for advising developing countries
on economic growth, but it needs to develop greater sensitivity and
expertise in linking growth to human lives. It must also find new ways of
recycling resources. Real IDA availability per poor person has been
shrinking, greatly limiting the bank's options. There will need to be more
innovative ways of raising finance to address global poverty.
Finally, the bank must consider restructuring its own debts. It has advised
all other creditors to restructure their debts, but refused to reschedule
its own, citing its charter and concern about its credit rating. The result
is that the bank will end up recycling the servicing of its own past
lending, rather than transferring new resources.
Two broader points must be made. One is that any proposal for a merger of
the IMF and the World Bank would be extremely unpopular in the developing
world. Rightly or wrongly, there is a lot more goodwill for the World Bank
in the developing countries than for the IMF.
Second, the United Nations needs to be reborn as a force for peace, rather
than just a police force. Since conflicts are increasingly within nations
rather than between them, sustaining peace requires socio-economic
development. Also necessary is a far broader consultative process than is
offered by the G7. For these purposes an Economic Security Council should be
established within the UN which should supervise the policy direction of all
international economic institutions, including the Bretton Woods twins.
The founders of the Bretton Woods institutions and the UN were neither
inhibited nor timid 50 years ago. But where is our creativity now regarding
the future shape of global economic governance? It is time to begin
designing the global institutions of the 21st century.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Filling in the pink spaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The patience of those of us whose pulses race at the prospect of Mr Tony
Blair becoming lead-er of the Labour party is being tested. The young man's
stubborn insistence on starting and ending every discussion with a
declaration of values and principles is costing him dear. In England, where
most of the electorate lives, abstract discourse, the deployment of grand
perspectives, is regarded with suspicion. It is the sort of thing you expect
from the French.
Indeed, Mr Blair is turning out to be an awkward repository of our
expectations. His series of protracted lectures may be the best way of both
winning the Labour leadership and positioning the party for a two-year
assault on the Conservatives, but it stretches the nerves of those who are
doomed to sit in the back of the class. They fidget and look out of the
window. The hot summer sun beckons. Do they have to go on hearing why they
should not present the tutor with a false choice on this or that political
conundrum? They ask themselves the question common to all participants in
seminars - 'what am I doing here?'
At his most persuasive, Mr Blair sounds as if, running for professor in a
theological seminary, he would appear to dismiss as outmoded the choice
between chastity and depravity. In truth, the case for purity would be made.
The trouble is that not everyone would know it. You would find it buried
inside a wrapping of verbiage that suggested, to those who wanted to have it
both ways, that they could. Thank heavens he would not go into detail.
Yet my enthusiasm for the prospect of a refreshment of British politics by a
reconstructed Labour party remains undiminished. Mr Blair is the only active
politician who is displaying the potential to be an agent of reconstruction.
There is no serious alternative. We must presume that Labour realises this.
Nothing should be taken for granted in a democratic contest. An upset is
extremely unlikely, but not impossible. If, by some mishap, the party gets
its sums wrong and chooses either of the other contenders, we can forget the
whole matter.
Labour led by Mrs Margaret Beckett or Mr John Prescott would stand as little
chance of forming a government as did Labour under Mr Michael Foot. We would
have to concentrate on the frustrating task of improving the Tories,
gritting our teeth at the prospect of enduring their misgovernance until the
millennium.
The electorate will see how deep Labour's comprehension of these political
realities runs when the result of the leadership election is announced. The
sensible assumption is that Mr Blair will be declared leader of the
opposition next Thursday and, probably, prime minister in 1996 or 1997. What
difference would that make to the way we wash our socks? The putative new
leader gives the following reply in the New Statesman this week: 'Think
about the huge amount of constitutional reform with the Freedom of
Information Act, the Bill of Rights, the changing of the constitution in the
House of Lords, the Scottish parliament, a Welsh assembly, regional
government, quangos.' Britain would sign the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty. Trade union recognition rights would be granted. 'These
are not minor or irrelevant changes. Labour has a huge radical agenda in
this area,' said Mr Blair.
He - Labour - also has an agenda, some of which is radical, for the
management of the economy, education, participation in the European Union,
and welfare. Mr Blair has spoken at length on each of these. The trick is to
brush aside the false-dichotomy preambles and pull apart the wrapping of
placatory verbiage. Then we can see what is a specifically Labour or Blair
proposal and what is an attempt to persuade his party to accept what the
Conservatives have put in place.
Mr Blair has adopted the economic strategy of his shadow chancellor, Mr
Gordon Brown. This relies heavily on the promotion of education and
training. So does the government. Labour would, uniquely, introduce a
minimum wage, of an unspecified amount, and tax the very rich, at an
unspecified rate. As to Europe, Mr Blair's tone is friendly, the
government's suspicious. There is less division on matters of substance. Our
great pink hope dances round the issue of a single currency, insisting, as
does Mr John Major, on full convergence of the participating economies
before Britain's opt-out can perhaps become an opt-in. Political reform is
urgent, he says. He proposes looking at the involvement of both the European
and national parliaments in European decisions.
Acceptance of the social chapter is special to Labour; for the rest Mr
Blair's positive but cautious approach to a changing Europe would not offend
Mr Douglas Hurd or Mr Kenneth Clarke. Only hardline Eurosceptics could take
offence; Europhiles in all parties should approve of the language, while
appreciating, with Mr Blair, the immensity of the task of persuading the
rising generation of Europeans of the validity of what he calls the European
'project'.
Wednesday's lecture on welfare was the most outspoken to date. 'I quite
understand the resentment of every taxpayer who has to pay Pounds 20 a week
in taxes to keep 3m unemployed,' said Mr Blair. He spoke of helping people
to help themselves, as did Mr Bill Clinton in his presidential campaign.
'Work and welfare go together,' said Mr Blair; '. . . welfare must enhance
duties and responsibilities and not be a substitute for them.' Talk of
removing the poverty trap that acts as an incentive to stay on the dole is
part of mainstream politics, common to all parties.
Mr Blair was, however, speaking to a Labour audience that history suggests
might regard such thinking as an act of betrayal. So he sweetened the pill.
Using President Clinton's very words, he argued that the Conservatives'
trickle-down philosophy has been discredited. 'Britain is more unequal and
divided than it has been for a generation.' That is the stuff to give the
troops. Better yet, it was not followed by a mindless promise to shell out
even more to the poor. Mr Blair's contribution this week was to specify the
principles, although not the specific means, by which the welfare rolls
might be diminished. 'The benefit system must find as many exits from
dependency as possible,' he said. Great. We must now presume that when he
becomes leader he will tell us how.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Estonia has set good currency example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ARDO HANSSON and Professor JEFFREY D SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Philippe Legrain, 'Baltic states' varied roads to
freedom' (June 21) included a misinformed criticism of Estonia's currency
board system, in which the exchange rate of the Estonian kroon is pegged to
the D-Mark, and the central bank abjures domestic credit expansion. Legrain
alleged that Estonia's currency arrangements were leading to high inflation
and currency overvaluation. This is an odd charge, since similar currency
systems, such as in Argentina and Hong Kong, have underpinned price
stability.
Legrain seems to have extrapolated from a single month's price increase, 8.9
per cent in March, to reach broad and unfounded conclusions. The March price
increase resulted mainly from the elimination of subsidies on various
service-sector prices, such as public transportation. Since March, Estonia's
inflation has been among the very lowest of the post-communist economies,
registering just 0.7 per cent in the month of June, and just 5 per cent for
the entire second quarter.
The fact is that the currency board has performed as expected, as we have
shown in a detailed comparison of the Baltic state's monetary arrangements.
The Estonian currency board has provided a firm anchor to Estonia's traded
goods prices, which cover a large proportion of Estonia's small open
economy. As expected, non-traded goods prices have risen faster than traded
goods prices, partly as the result of the end of price controls, and partly
as the consequence of rapid productivity improvements in the tradeable
sector, which have pushed up Estonia's wages in D-Mark or dollar terms.
The kroon is hardly becoming overvalued as a result of these wage increases,
however, especially since dollar wage levels were remarkably low at the
start of Estonia's reforms. Estonia's average industrial wage is currently
about Dollars 120 a month, making Estonia highly competitive in attracting
foreign capital, especially as an export platform to western Europe. This is
why European, and especially Scandinavian, investors are setting up
production operations in Estonia at a remarkable pace.
What Mr Legrain failed to recognise is that Estonia's currency stability and
strict monetary discipline have contributed to solid investor confidence,
low interest rates and renewed economic growth, the highest in the Baltics
and perhaps the highest of all the economies in transition in 1994. It is no
wonder that Lithuania changed over to Estonia's currency board arrangements
in April, and that Latvia has also recently abandoned its floating exchange
rate policy in favour of a pegged exchange rate, though without the firm
backing (and thus the main benefits) of the stricter currency board system.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Europe should follow US on petrol
pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADAM SEYMOUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate over the relative healthfulness of unleaded petrol (Letters,
July 11 and 13) contains no reference to the example of the US, where the
problems of urban motor pollution have been more severe and the attempts to
address them more rigorous than in Europe.
As of January 1995 the US refining industry will be required to produce a
new green gasoline for highly polluted urban areas. Two of the
specifications for this green gasoline limit its benzene and overall
aromatics content, to combat the proliferation of airborne carcinogens and
ground-level ozone. The Bonn proposal to restrict benzene ('Bonn threatens
action on petrol pollutant', July 7) has, therefore, a precedent and one
which is far more comprehensive.
The specifications for US green gasoline are the result of a three-year
research programme in which government and the oil and auto industries
collaborated. Another example which the EU and European industry may do well
to follow.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Glasgow versus Glyndebourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS MCLAUGHLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest David Murray's review of the new Glyndebourne
production of Mozart's Don Giovanni (Arts, July 12). The last time elements
of this audience voiced noisy disapproval also involved a Mozart piece -
Peter Sellars' version of Die Zauberflote. When this production came to
Glasgow in 1990, however, it received a most enthusiastic welcome at the
city's Theatre Royal.
It is to be hoped that director Deborah Warner will take heart from this. An
imaginative treatment of a much-loved Mozart masterpiece, even if
controversial, may find a more sympathetic reception from a different
audience.
Perhaps Ms Warner should persuade Glyndebourne Touring Opera to take her Don
Giovanni into its repertoire. I live in hope that she might measure the
reaction of the opera lovers of Glasgow against the louts of Glyndebourne.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Myth of technology and
competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr KIRSTY HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was most welcome to read Guy de Jonquieres' arguments against the
high-tech bandwagon (Economic Eye, July 11). Myths about high technology
have become very influential, leading the European Commission, among others,
to argue that improved performance in high technology is a central route to
increasing competitiveness. This view is not consistent with the evidence.
Assessing trade performance in the 1980s on the basis of export shares and
the net trade balance, it can be shown that - of the six largest economies -
the three with the best trade performance were Japan, Germany and Italy,
which had their best performance respectively in high, medium and low
technology.
The two worst performers, the UK and the US, had their best performance in
high technology. The US's competitiveness deteriorated in particular in
medium-technology products.
Innovation is not the sole determinant of competitiveness - it is not
equivalent to R&amp;D, nor is R&amp;D equal to high technology. One of the UK's
problems is the managerial failure to translate R&amp;D into innovation rather
than too low a level of R&amp;D. At the same time, many small and medium-sized
enterprises innovate without doing formal R&amp;D.
Not only is competition in high-tech sectors not the key route to
competitive success, it is becoming increasingly costly. Increased costs and
increased competition equal lower profits. Consequently, since the 1980s,
companies have increasingly chosen to collaborate - with many international
joint ventures in R&amp;D occurring between US, Japanese and EU companies. One
outcome of this is a process of technological levelling, the outcome of
which will be a much greater emphasis on factors other than R&amp;D in
international competition.
These developments pose great challenges for technology policy in the EU and
in individual countries - at present these challenges are not being taken
up.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Big electricity users not paying too
high a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Electricity users have enjoyed price cuts since privatisation four
years ago. The regulatory body, Offer, confirmed this in its recent annual
report. Despite this, the Chemical Industries Association says that large
users are paying too much ('Big electricity users 'suffering high price
rises' ', July 13).
The association claims that there are no incentives for 'cost-reflective
supplies to large users'. But their own figures, quoted in your report,
demonstrate that this cannot be true. They appear to be paying just over
3.5p per unit and they are able to secure this price because they are free
to choose between suppliers in an increasingly competitive market place. In
comparison, I suspect that small business users, who will not be able to
shop around until 1998, would be delighted to pay 3.5p.
The large users are right about the charges imposed by the monopoly
transmission and distribution businesses. Cost-cutting there would benefit
all users.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: Will the axe fall on Aix? - The festival is facing the
biggest crisis in its 46-year history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A beautiful old town, perfect summer weather, traditional Provencal food, a
relaxed atmosphere and good music: welcome to Aix-en-Provence, where the
1994 festival opens tonight with Die Zauberflote. It is the sort of festival
environment which north Europeans can only dream about, and helps explain
why Aix attracts a large, faithful clientele.
But this year is different. France's premier music festival is facing the
biggest crisis in its 46-year history. The programme has shrunk to just one
opera production and 12 concerts - a stark contrast to the boom years when
60 events were normal. The deficit stands at more than FFr10m (Pounds 1.2m).
There are no sponsors. As if these ills were not enough, a backstage
accident in May damaged Aix's open-air theatre.
The festival blames its problems on the recession and says the French
government is doing nothing to help. 'We want to stay in the club of
international festivals, renowned for quality and innovation,' says the
administrative director, Herve Grillet. 'We have a strong image abroad. But
the government doesn't want to acknowledge this. Provence is far from Paris,
and in a centralised state, that's not good for us.'
This year's FFr26m budget was only drawn up in January and represents a 30
per cent cut. Grillet points out that while the government subsidises the
Paris Opera to the tune of FFr500m, it refuses to raise its grant to Aix
above FFr5m. Double this would barely dent the nation's culture budget, but
would make a crucial difference to Aix.
For its part, the government says the festival's deficit is the result of
poor financial controls and declining artistic appeal. 'If we give more
money, we want to know the festival will reach a wider range of people,'
says Stephane Martin, director of music at the ministry of culture. 'In its
present form, Aix is expensive and elitist.'
Martin said each festival performance this summer was being supported by
FFr225,000 of government money. 'Aix doesn't have a public funding problem -
we've actually increased the subsidy. The problem is the artistic side. The
festival needs to reduce its dependence on opera, raise its volume of
activity and develop ideas which will interest the public.'
Behind Aix's current disarray lies an illustrious history. The festival was
founded in 1948, with Gabriel Dussurget as artistic director and Hans
Rosbaud as chief conductor. From the start, Mozart was a pillar of the
repertory, augmented by Haydn, Monteverdi, Gluck, Rossini, Rameau and
Strauss. Thanks to Dussurget's talent-spotting, some of the best-known
singers of the postwar era began their international careers at Aix. The
festival became the French equivalent of Glyndebourne or Salzburg.
Since 1981 the artistic director has been Louis Erlo, who also runs the
Opera de Lyon. Although musical standards have remained high, the festival
seems to have lost its way. Encouraged by a Socialist victory in local
council elections in 1989, Erlo changed the festival's statutes and expanded
the budget. The assumption was that France's Socialist government would
raise its subsidy and sponsorship would increase. However, the culture
minister at the time, Jack Lang, was unimpressed with Erlo's policies, and
the recession chased away sponsors. The deficit began to mount.
The election of a centre-right government last year only widened the gulf
between Aix and Paris. It now looks as if the festival will have to await
the result of next year's presidential and local elections before its future
can be resolved. If the centre-right wins the presidency and regains control
of the Aix council, more money should be available. It would also speed up
the appointment of a successor to Erlo, whose contract expires in 1996.
Most observers agree the festival needs an injection of new blood. 'The
programme is not what you would expect from a festival which charges a top
price of FFr890,' commented a senior figure in the French opera
establishment. 'If you charge that much, you expect a more imaginative
choice of repertoire, and artists who are more appealing.'
But for the time being, Erlo's position is secure. He has retained the
support of influential local figures such as Mme Edmonde Charles-Roux, owner
of the newspaper Le Provencal. The Aix council has agreed to service the
deficit and look after the theatre, specially constructed each summer in the
courtyard of the archbishop's palace.
This year's festival may look skimpy, but most visitors come for the place
as much as the programme - the special Provencal light immortalised by
Cezanne, the balmy climate, the cobbled squares and, of course, the sound of
Mozart wafting through the air.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: Several cheers for San Francisco - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The San Francisco Ballet is America's oldest classical troupe, and it has
marked its 61st year by playing a season at the Opera Garnier. Several
cheers, say I, for a company that has been much improved by Helgi Tomasson -
whom we remember as a leading dancer with Balanchine - its director since
1985.
The ensemble, as I saw it in Paris at the weekend, looks serious, skilled.
(I hereby abandon my suspicion that America had declared a secret but
vicious war on the EU by sending such awful and subversive troupes to Europe
as the Washington Ballet and Bill T Jones and his ghastly crew). Nothing
quite lived up to quality of the first work on view, Mark Morris's
Maelstrom, made for SFB this year, but the impression given by two
programmes was eminently satisfying.
The Morris piece is daring - who but a madman, or Mark Morris, would make a
ballet to Beethoven's Ghost trio? - and, against all odds, utterly
persuasive. Three good San Francisco musicians play the trio in the pit. The
stage is sublimely lit by James Ingalls, so that the dancers glow in Martin
Pakledinaz's claret-coloured outfits against a cloudy back-drop, and Morris
allows himself to be led by Beethoven. Unlike most choreographers who take
on 'great' scores and bring to them preconceived ideas worthy of an
axe-muderer, Morris finds ways of showing us what he hears Beethoven saying.
So the dance flows over the stage, ideas are transferred between dancers,
formal devices match step and musical phrase. At times one thinks, as Morris
makes a point yet again, 'Beethoven does that with much less fuss', but the
sum effect is unemphatically noble and apt. For the haunted largo assai,
Morris pulls off his most skilled effect, using a complex step, the
gargouillade, as a signature movement. Extending it, or hinting at it, he
matches what the music is doing. His way with balletic language throughout
is easy, unforced. The piece is a joy.
The company danced admirably in Maelstrom, which was as well, since there
followed an attack by Helgi Tomasson on Kurt Weill songs which turned its
cast into zombies. The idea behind Nanna's Lied was, I surmise, to bring
back the dear old days of UFA films and the Berlin of Georg Grosz. The
result is novelettish, Dr Caligari paying a house call on Mills and Boone.
Gloomy sets - dark, mad sloping walls, of course - and An Innocent Girl
falling for a bit of rough, then being driven to prostitution (that usual
jaunt of the period). She has, things being what they are, to loose her all,
apparently to Nosferatu. Fatuous as drama, the ballet offers sub-MacMillan
couplings to the sound of Weill songs in performance slack, unidiomatic.
(Surabaya Johnny done over by an hysterical yodeller). Better forgotten.
Better still, abandoned on the nearest tip.
The Balanchine works were Bugaku and Who Cares?. Neither is very important;
both were done with understanding and given an individual flavour - though
not so strong as to smother the real taste of Balanchine. Bugaku's
eroticism, the happy Gershwin bounce of Who Cares?, were well served, and I
greatly admired Elizabeth Loscavio as she sailed through Embraceable You and
My One and Only, her dancing fresh, classically true, floating sweetly on
the music.
Tomasson's real creative identity is that of a dance-maker in Balanchine
fashion. (I recall early pieces in New York as featly made). His Quattro
Stagioni uses Vivaldi's interminable scratchings and twitterings (surely
more like eight seasons?) for an academic divertissement which shows off his
dancers well. Pretty set and Empire costuming from Santo Loquasto. Pretty
dances. Pretty performances from the girls; light-footed leapings from the
men. The piece is craftsman-like, agreeable, slightly anonymous, a happy
display of the company's good dance manners.
Quite what Agnes de Mille's Rodeo is nowadays I am not sure. It completed
the repertory for Paris - the token bit of ethnic charm, perhaps? - but it
looks more than ever like Oklahokum. The cowboys, the cowgirl, the friends
from Kansas City: all so jovial, all so open-air, all so likely to be found
in dear old Quaintsville. I don't think Rodeo can be danced today. The San
Francisco cast is careful, as one should be when handling an antique, but
the piece is actually a fake.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: The RSC's 'Tempest' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is widely assumed that the RSC offers high standards of accomplishment in
acting, yet several RSC stagings in recent years have shown an extremely
mixed bag of performers. Take, for example, the current production of The
Tempest, directed by Sam Mendes, which opened last year in Stratford and
which has just transferred to the Barbican Theatre. Few actors have a
technique more immaculate than its Prospero, Alec McCowen. Ariel is Simon
Russell Beale, who is forever expanding his range and style by allowing
himself to be cast in dissimilar roles (for Mendes alone he has played
Ariel, Richard III and Thersites in Troilus at the RSC).
So far, so impressive. But Ferdinand is Mark Lewis Jones, whose tight, small
voice is not always audible even in the stalls, who often sounds
strangulated on emphatic words, and who seems to have learnt no kind of
legato delivery in speaking poetry. But Jones certainly has talent; four
years ago, I much admired his ardent Tristram in the Lyric Hammersmith's
Morte d'Arthur. Either the RSC has cast him beyond his capacity or it no
longer has the kind of voice coaches who could help him. Let no one readily
assume that the RSC is an all-round ensemble of vocal accomplishment any
more.
But enough of this. Sam Mendes's Tempest is an intelligent, lucid, rather
schematic affair, with plenty of novel touches; and it has been somewhat
revised since its Stratford premiere. Ariel no longer spits in Prospero's
face when he is finally released, but simply gives him a long, cool glare.
None the less, Beale's interpretation - reminding us of Ariel's reluctant
servitude to Prospero and of his lack of human emotions - remains the
production's most innovative feature. His Ariel is glacial, ponderous, even
baleful. Very arresting, but not wholly persuasive. There is a mellifluous
lyricism in his account of Ariel's songs that nowhere enters into the rest
of his performance; the words 'merrily, merrily' come implausibly from his
lips; and Prospero calls him 'dainty' and 'my bird' to no avail.
As for Prospero, McCowen performs him with the excessive precision, measure
and control that have been the hallmarks of his performances in the last 10
or more years. His every word commands attention, his every phrase inspires
respect, and he reaches two highly impressive peaks with his rendition of
'Our revels now are ended' (spoken with a beautifully weary bitterness) and
the abdicatory 'Ye elves of hills' (uttered with increasing warmth, as if
looking for a new human tenderness in life after magic). Everything is
fresh, but also freshly packaged. This Prospero is so much master of himself
that he robs the play of half its tension.
David Troughton's laborious Caliban, as ponderous and livid as Beale's Ariel
though made of opposite ingredients, successfully catches the beautiful awe
of 'The isle is full of noises'. But if Shakespeare had wanted Prospero's
daughter to be played with the pedestrian manners of Sarah Woodward, he
would not have called her Miranda, (which means marvellous, amazing,
wondrous). Too much of the clowning of David Bradley's Trinculo and Mark
Lockyer's Stephano is imposed on the play, rather than drawn out of it. The
stranded nobles are a pretty dull lot; and the toy-theatre masque, with its
mechanical deities, is anti-poetic.
The production is, however, larger than the sum of its parts. Paul Pyant's
lighting and Anthony Ward's designs beautifully display the architecture of
the play; I love the contrast of the yellow soil, the deep-azure sea, the
clouded, blue sky - and then, as Ariel departs forever through a door, the
sudden glimpse of a radiant white beyond this world. The grand plan of the
play is here - but not all its inner life.
In repertory at the Barbican.

It was, of course, entirely predictable that if two series about sport and
health should suddenly turn up, the broadcasters would ensure that they
would clash head on so that those really interested would have to use the
VCR to record one or the other. Those involved in The Contenders on BBC1 at
7.00 include hurdler Sally Gunnell and cyclist Chris Boardman. Those
involved in Body Heat at 7.00 on ITV include Chris Boardman and Sally
Gunnell. The BBC programme is concerned today with the effect of diet upon
performance. The ITV programme is described as 'a competitive fitness
series'. BBC Proms 1994 begins on BBC2 and Radio 3 at 8.00 with Andrew Davis
conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers, the Philharmonia
Chorus, and the BBC Symphony Chorus, all participating in Schoenberg's
cantata 'Gurrelieder'. The soloists include soprano Karita Mattila, mezzo
Ann Murray, and tenors Neil Breeden and Philip Langridge. For those who
prefer their culture less highbrow, Fancy A Bit celebrates the humour of the
seaside postcard (8.45 Radio 2).

FT  15 JUL 94 / Management: From boardroom to classroom - Tim Dickson on a
programme that lets Britain's movers and shakers see what life is like in
local communities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HRH The Prince of Wales and Julia Cleverdon make a powerful combination.
What other double act could persuade 80 top business people (many of them
chief executives of Britain's biggest companies) to defy this week's rail
strike and sultry weather for a worthy three-hour seminar in central London?
An almost full house at St James' Palace, though, was what the heir to the
throne and chief executive of Business In The Community achieved on
Wednesday when the likes of British Aerospace's chief executive Dick Evans,
Tesco marketing director Terry Leahy and National Westminster Bank chief
executive Derek Wanless reported back on recent visits to inner-city
schools, housing estates and homelessness centres around the country.
Launched in 1990 as a means of widening the commitment of top managers to
corporate community involvement, BITC's Seeing Is Believing initiative was
originally intended as a one-off experiment. The outings just completed,
however, were the ninth in the series and organisers say the exercise has
proved very successful in enabling the nation's commercial movers and
shakers to see the challenges at first hand, and in demonstrating to them
the beneficial impact on community projects of corporate money and time.
Community involvement has won a host of new corporate converts over the last
decade. Membership of BITC has expanded steadily and the issues are
increasingly aired these days in the annual reports of large public
companies.
Even so not all the sceptics are convinced, motives and strategies in many
cases remain confused, and the sheer scale of social and economic
deprivation can induce feelings of despair. One significance of Wednesday's
seminar was that small business creation and enterprise agencies - the focus
of much of BITC's effort 10 years ago - were barely mentioned.
The real value of the session was the opportunity it provided to pool
impressions, set priorities and draw up tentative action plans for the
future.
At least one participant alluded to the loneliness and isolation of top
executives and said he was grateful for the opportunity to see 'the real
nature of the street'. He confessed that his 'team' of fellow executives had
been predisposed to see homelessness as an exclusively public-sector
preoccupation. But the 'eye opening' visit convinced him and others that the
problem was closely related to mental health, demonstrated that most young
people on the streets are determined to escape their plight, and suggested
to them that homelessness and joblessness were part of a vicious spiral of
poverty.
Perhaps the most touching request for support came from children on a
Plymouth housing estate, whose placards called on their distinguished
visitors to provide equipment for a play area. Burger King, whose general
manager-Europe David Geddes witnessed the mini 'demo', subsequently obliged.
The Plymouth team's lobbying 'clout' may be of greater strategic
significance. Led by BAe's Evans, they have agreed to approach the Ministry
of Defence with a view to releasing unused dockyard space for local business
development. The clear message articulated by this group is that private-
and public-sector businesses alike have a responsibility to help regenerate
the local economy when they 'retreat' from a region.
Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux Breweries, offered an upbeat
account of the impact of private-sector involvement on the Pennywell estate
two miles from the centre of Sunderland. Close to the bottom of most UK
unemployment leagues, Pennywell had been depicted in the media as a sort of
north-east equivalent of Al Capone's Chicago and a haven for drug dealers.
But thanks to the efforts of local people - backed up by local business -
Nicholson claims the whole area 'is unrecognisable from what it was five
years ago'.
The Vaux boss outlined three principles for successful action: the
establishment of a partnership between all the influential locals; the
outlining of a vision to which everyone could aspire; and the setting up of
projects aimed at realising that vision. 'It became obvious to us that lots
of people had been pursing their own agendas,' says Nicholson. 'By looking
at the horizon rather than at the end of our noses we realised that we all
had the same objective: to make Pennywell a place of which we could be
proud.'
The business case for corporate community involvement, meanwhile, was
articulated by NatWest's Wanless. He admitted that until three years ago the
bank's efforts were motivated largely by philanthropy, but that such
activities are now more fully integrated and the benefits measured.
NatWest's initiative to spread financial literacy in secondary schools, he
explained, was equipping young people with the concepts of lending and
enterprise and producing potential customers of the future. Participation in
projects improved staff problem solving, leadership and communication skills
(and was linked to the bank's appraisal).
Other themes to emerge from Wednesday's discussion were:
A widespread conviction that skills, time and other 'human' resources were
more important gifts than money.
The importance of finding a leader to co-ordinate the often confusing array
of local initiatives (integral to the success of the Sunderland project).
The value of short placements in companies for jobseekers.
The potential to involve a greater proportion of the workforce (notably by
'gearing up' their out-of-office activities with office time).
The strong focus on education (school visits, teacher placements, mentoring,
encouraging employees to become school governors).
The need to overcome apathy (particularly where projects fail to touch the
lives of those they are supposed to help).

FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology: Satellite sales - Emiko Terazono continues a
series on electronic retailing with a look at Japan's used-car auction
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A black BMW 525i flashes on to the screen and within seconds the
three-year-old car, which has been repaired in four places, is bid up to
Y3.21m (Pounds 20,400) from the initial price of Y3m. After 25 seconds, it
is sold to a dealer 700 miles away from Tokyo.
The blinking numbers and beeping noises are not part of a new video game,
but of Aucnet, Japan's first satellite-linked, used-car auction network. The
control room, situated in the company's head office in central Tokyo, hooks
up more than 3,000 used-car dealers around Japan. They buy and sell 3,500
used cars through the system a week, about 5 per cent of Japan's overall
used-car auction sales.
The still photograph images of the cars along with full details of repairs
and other relevant data are sent to the subscribers' computer terminals via
satellite. The bidders use joysticks to register their bids, which are
transmitted to the control room's IBM host computer through a telephone
line. 'It's easier than a video game,' says Koji Sasaki, director of Aucnet.
While the conventional used-car auction involves taking the car to a
designated area, the system has allowed dealers to trade used cars while
sitting in their offices, cutting costs for space, transport and personnel.
The potential seller can hedge the risk of losing money on costs if the car
is not sold, while also retaining the merit of keeping the vehicle as
merchandise on the premises until a buyer appears.
And although conventional auctions have been limited to local areas, giving
rise to around 140 local used-car auction exchanges around Japan, the
network has managed to create the country's first national auction network,
linking dealers all over the country.
The company was founded in 1984 by Masataka Fujisaki, who owned a computer
software company and a used-car dealership. After finding auctioning for
used cars time- and cost-consuming, he devised a plan to auction used cars
through an electronic network.
The initial attempt was made by sending members laser discs with the
photographs and information of the cars through parcel delivery and
conducting an auction through a telephone-linked computer network. However,
the deliveries of the discs would sometimes be delayed; and the discs,
vulnerable to rough handling, would often be broken or cracked.
In 1989, with marketing and financial help from Orient, a consumer credit
company, Fujisaki hooked up with Japan's first commercial communications
satellite, launched that year. The satellite speeded up the bidding
procedure and lowered costs for the company. Last year Aucnet linked 320
used-motorbike dealers around the country and has started motorbike auctions
once a week.
However, not everything went smoothly from the start. There was initial
opposition from the nation's used-car dealers' association, which feared
Aucnet would threaten the existence of the local auction exchanges. It
launched an 'anti Aucnet committee' and threatened to eject any member who
joined the satellite network.
The association was eventually forced to accept Aucnet after many of its
dealers joined despite its campaign, and the network's membership has grown
sharply from the initial 500 in 1989.
While only dealers can become members, individuals who want to sell their
vehicles can participate via the company. Last year 100 cars belonging to
individual owners were sold through the system every month.
The key to Aucnet's success, says Sasaki, is the speed at which the
information is processed through the system and transmitted to the bidders.
But another important element has been the company's rigorous inspection and
evaluation standards of the used cars. Aucnet officials had to convince
members that the certified inspectors (who rated the used vehicles) were to
be trusted and that members could buy the cars unseen.
Aucnet currently has 120 inspectors nationwide, who rate the cars on a scale
from one to 10, and provide a bidding minimum which reflects the car's
state.
The company's innovative system has been reflected in its profitability. It
initially invested Y1.5bn in the computer system, and broke even in 1989.
The company went public on the over-the-counter market in 1991, and last
year, thanks to the popularity in used cars due to the prolonged recession,
its pre-tax profit rose 25 per cent to Y1.14bn on a 15 per cent increase in
revenue to Y4.73bn.
The company derives its revenues from sales of the satellite receivers and
computer terminals to leasing companies, which in turn lease the equipment
to members. Registration, inspection and photography fees for the used cars
and brokerage fees when a deal is completed are also part of Aucnet's
income.
Sasaki says there is room in the domestic market for Aucnet to expand. Only
15 per cent of the 20,000 used-car dealers are Aucnet's members, and there
are regions where the system has not penetrated.
The company sees the potential in applying its satellite network to other
sectors which have inefficient auctioning processes, such as flowers, real
estate and meat.
Meanwhile, Aucnet hopes to crack the US used-car sales market, which is said
to be five to six times as big as the Japanese market. The company, which
obtained a patent for its system in the US in 1989, has set up a US
subsidiary in Atlanta, Georgia and wants to start auctions from September.
But it may take a while for Americans to become used to buying second-hand
cars unseen. Sasaki says that it may take two to three years for the concept
to be accepted. And Aucnet faces competition from other satellite auction
operators, such as Independent Car Auctions, a UK car auctioneer. It has
recently tied up with Manheim Auctions, a leading US automobile auction
company, to set up a satellite service.
Sasaki says he is not worried about the competition due to Aucnet's domestic
success. However, he admits that Japanese and US used-car buyers look for
different things in a used car and a data and rating system will need to be
adapted.
'Japanese are picky about how a car looks, and hate small scratches and
dents. US consumers are more conscious of the vehicle's basic functions,' he
says.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Management: 'Global web' still not free of tangles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposition that multinational companies are fast going 'stateless' has
grabbed the imagination of business leaders and government ministers over
the past five years. From Akio Morita, the legendary founder of Sony, to
Robert Reich, a Harvard economist who is now US labour secretary,
policy-makers have become wedded to it.
From their different points of view, the 'stateless' image depicts a
paradoxical new world in which multinationals, though beyond the reach of
individual governments - and, in some respects, of international
institutions - are becoming 'insiders' everywhere.
There are several facets to this supposedly universal trend, which Morita
christened 'global localisation' and which - in theory - allows
multinationals to get the best of both worlds: exploiting global economies
of scale while also maximising their responsiveness to local markets and
sources of expertise.
The most evident facet is the siting of factories in foreign countries, such
as the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) semiconductor plant which Japan's NEC
announced last week will be built in either Scotland or California.
More significant, because of their higher value-added and skill content, is
the location of research, design and development (RDD) centres not just at
home but in international networks - what Reich has called 'global webs'.
This gives companies access to localised technical skills around the globe.
A further facet is the transfer away from a company's home country of some
of its global divisional headquarters. The best-known example occurred in
1991, when IBM shifted its network systems business from the US to the UK.
To Reich and other analysts, this new world has already arrived. In a series
of publications in 1990-91, when he was still at Harvard, he argued that the
nationality of a global company's ownership no longer mattered. Like
manufacturing, he claimed, research, design and development were now being
sited with almost total disregard to a company's 'nationality'.
It was obvious at the time that Reich was exaggerating, and that
multinationals are not locating their RDD units, or their divisional HQs,
anything like as freely around the world as their factories. Nor are all
such moves permanent: IBM's new management has since repatriated its network
systems HQ to the US.
But Reich's cry that 'ownership is unimportant' has been echoed ever since
by government ministers in liberal economic regimes desperate to encourage
foreign inward investment, notably Britain.
Until now there has been no authoritative statistical study which showed how
far Reich was exaggerating. Given the complexity of the subject, no single
study can be conclusive or unquestionable. But a brave first stab has now
been carried out by John Cantwell, an economist at Reading University.
His study has not yet been published. But when he presented his data for the
first time last month at a symposium in Stockholm of top international
economists, technology and business academics, it was heralded as
'remarkable' by Michael Porter, Harvard's leading professor of business
strategy and national competitiveness.
By examining the extent to which US patents granted to 280 big US and
European companies over various periods between 1920 and 1990 resulted from
work in their domestic or foreign units, Cantwell has created a rough but
very detailed impression of the geographic location of what he calls their
'technological activity'. He uses this odd phrase to encompass patents
arising from production engineering, as well as from RDD.
His study challenges the Reichian myth in several senses. First, it shows
that US multinationals still conduct the vast majority of their
technological activity at home, not abroad; during the 1970s, less than 7
per cent of their patents arose from work done abroad and in the 1980s the
proportion was less than 9 per cent.
Second, Cantwell shows that big American companies have only just regained
the degree of internationalisation which they achieved between 1920 and
1939, before many of them retreated from their foreign RDD operations
because of the second world war.
Third, the study suggests that although European companies carry out more of
their technology activity abroad, their rate is still only 30 per cent, and
there has been little overall increase since the 1950s. Only Dutch, German
and Swedish companies have increased their proportion sharply. The Italian
rate has halved since the 1960s.
Cantwell himself makes all sorts of caveats about his study. For instance,
it shows relative geographic shifts between home and abroad, not absolute
changes (foreign activity can rise even if its ratio falls); and some of the
territorial shifts - possibly half - result from takeovers of foreign
companies, not from new technological activity.
He also says that Reich is right to the extent that much of the foreign RDD
within very select leading companies is changing character. From being
mainly local adaptation of basic technology developed at home, it is
shifting to the origination of new knowledge. As Reich's 'web' analogy
suggests, some of this is being developed jointly by several centres of
expertise.
The fact remains that, except within leading Belgian, British, Dutch and
Swiss companies, home country activity is still of overwhelming importance.
Reich's 'global webs' are very much the exception. It is an open question
whether they will ever become the rule.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The convenience of using frozen soft fruit, such as raspberries, is offset
by problems such as the length of defrosting time, the loss of the fruit's
shape and handling difficulties.
Distillerie du Perigord, a French company, says it has introduced a new
fruit processing method which firms up the fruit, increases its shelf life
to a year and heightens its flavour.
The process begins with an analysis of the fruit's sugar content, acid
content and permeability. The fruit is then dipped in sugar at low
temperature, put into an alcohol solution and flavoured with spices.

   THE SUMMER CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Virtual reality in the home has come a step closer with the launch of the
VFX1 headset by Forte Technologies, writes Richard Rosen from the Summer
Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.
The unit incorporates a pair of colour LCD displays, one for each eye, each
measuring 0.7 inches. This gives an effective viewing area equivalent to
watching a 35-foot screen from 35 feet. Each screen has an individual lens,
which can be focused - a useful feature for people who have taken their
glasses off. When in use, it measures the amount of head movement from the
wearer in all three planes and calculates where you are looking.
The headset, which weighs less than 2lbs including stereo speakers, uses its
own 8-bit PC ISA card for output and works independently of the standard PC
display. It will be launched worldwide in October at a price of about
Dollars 900.

Apple, the California-based computer company, is set to release a new
operating system for its Macintosh personal computers later this summer.
The new system, known as Macintosh System 7.5, includes more than 50 new
features and technologies to make the computer more productive and easier to
use. These include an interactive guide to assist users, some features to
streamline and speed up basic tasks and a simplified way to exchange
information between Macintosh and MS-Dos or Windows systems.
The system includes PowerTalk, which allows users to send electronic mail,
share files and forward documents. It also includes the QuickDraw GX
technology for high-quality printing and graphics.
Macintosh system 7.5 will run on computers with at least a 68020 processor.
On a 68020, 68030 or 68040-based Macintosh computer, the system requires at
least four megabytes of Ram to run the core elements and at least eight
megabytes of Ram to use PowerTalk and QuickDraw GX. The new release will be
compatible with most Macintosh applications software currently available.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology: Banana genes to be split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ice cream bananas may be on their way to Europe and North America. Red,
apple and finger bananas, too.
These are names of unusual short-lived varieties of the yellow fruit that
last just long enough for the lucky inhabitants of the tropics to eat.
The rest of us have to make do with the Cavendish variety which can survive
a long journey by sea and accounts for almost all the Dollars 6bn (Pounds
3.9bn) a year European Union and US banana markets.
Imports of exotic banana varieties could rise if research by UK drug company
Zeneca and DNA Plant Technology (DNAP) of northern California comes to
fruition.
The two companies announced a research collaboration this month to find a
way of slowing the rate of ripening in bananas. The work will combine DNAP's
genetic engineering expertise with Zeneca's knowledge of banana physiology.
Bananas ripen as a result of the action of the simple chemical ethylene,
which acts as a hormone in the fruit. The work will try to identify which
gene is responsible for controlling the release of ethylene and turn it off.
Banana aficionados may revel in their new found choice of varieties, but the
real benefit is likely to be felt among growers and buyers of the Cavendish
variety, according to Chris White, editor of London-based magazine
Eurofruit.
'The genetically-engineered banana might be used to raise quality in regions
where there are production problems. Yield could improve, too, making
cultivation worthwhile in previously uneconomic areas,' he says.
DNAP says that slow-ripening Cavendish bananas should also taste better and
even be more nutritious.
As with many fruits, bananas are harvested while immature and left to ripen
in transit. With adjusted genes, they could be allowed to ripen naturally
before being cut down.
Consumers will have to wait until early in the next decade before reaping a
new harvest from the shelves of their local shops: Zeneca says that a
product is unlikely to reach supermarkets before then.

FT  15 JUL 94 / People: Welcome mat for Jones at ABPI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor Jones, former director of research, development and medical in the UK
at Wellcome, has resigned. He is leaving the board to become director
general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
The move should add considerable weight to what has been a lacklustre
association with a poor reputation for promoting the cause of the British
drugs industry. Jones is a scientific heavy-weight and fine communicator.
'The UK's pharmaceuticals industry has much to do. But if we can get it
right, this country will remain the best place to do pharmaceuticals
research,' Jones says.
His departure from Wellcome represents the end of a debate at the top of the
organisation about how best to manage international pharmaceuticals
development.
The company has been struggling with two large development organisations:
one in the UK where Jones was in charge and one in the US where David Barry
was vice-president research and development. Barry has recently become
director of medical affairs for the whole company.
'It was clear that we had to have a single focus. John Robb (chief executive
and chairman), looked at the two approaches and decided to go for David's.
It was a difficult decision, but I'm not at all bitter. Wellcome has a super
R&amp;D portfolio which I hope David will be able to make grow.'
Jones says the main difference between them had been over whether to use
clinical groups - in effect a team approach - or whether to give greater
importance to a central leader. 'There wasn't an argument between us. We
both agreed development had to be done internationally,' he said.

FT  15 JUL 94 / People: BET - Payne promoted, Mackenzie leaves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Clark, chief executive of BET, yesterday promoted his long-time protege
Keith Payne to a new post as director of finance, planning and development
at the business services group.
Clark says the 51-year-old, who joined the main board last year as director
of strategic planning, is the ideal candidate to oversee the progressive
expansion of the company's activities, particularly distribution services in
North America and Europe.
The two worked together previously at Core-mark International, a US
marketing and distribution company, where Clark was chairman and Payne
senior vice-president of operations. Before that, they were colleagues at
Singer International, where Clark was president and Payne chief financial
officer.
When Clark joined BET in 1991, he invited Payne to join him; together they
were credited with reducing group activities to four core areas: business
services, textiles, plant services and distribution.
Payne will combine the roles of finance director and planning co-ordinator -
posts which were split when BET embarked on its three-year divestment
programme.
'We've finished that programme, and now we're moving into a growth phase I
want to put the jobs back together,' Clark said yesterday.
He also paid tribute to Bob MacKenzie, the current finance director, who is
'leaving the group to pursue other business opportunities'. Mackenzie, 41, a
former chief executive of the International Leisure Group and financial
controller at Hanson, played a central role in reducing BET's Pounds 800m
debt mountain.
'This is an amicable agreement following the completion of the three-year
turnround phase of BET's recovery programme,' said Clark.
Industry analysts, however, questioned the wisdom of yesterday's reshuffle
and suggested BET might be better served if the finance and planning
departments remained separate. 'Mackenzie made a very considerable
contribution to BET's revival,' said one analyst. 'His departure is a loss
to the group.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / Property: Green belt in danger of buckling - Paul
Cheeseright on pressures on the use of land in the UK's West Midlands region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planners in the West Midlands are waiting for Mr John Gummer, the UK
environment secretary, to deliver his regional planning guidance, the
document which will lay down the broad patterns of land use for the next 20
years.
The West Midlands Forum of Local Authorities has given Mr Gummer its advice:
it is anxious to regenerate the cities. The authorities have been expecting
his response since April. He is probably still pondering the provision which
ought to be made for new housing. But his guidance, when it comes, has
broader implications than that.
Mr Gummer has made clear his opposition to more out-of-town shopping
centres. Beyond that, the guidance should make clear the government's view
on how to balance the claims for economic development inside and outside
urban areas. The guidance should set out how to cope with the trend towards
decentralisation which has seen companies moving operations from larger
centres to smaller ones.
In that context, a crucial element is the treatment of the green belt, the
area around the towns and cities where, if there is property development,
there has to be a very good reason for it.
Planners and property companies share, in general terms, the view that
cities need a green belt around them.
'A key factor in achieving a pattern of sustainable development will be to
maintain the region's two green belts. They are major regional assets that
provide environmental benefits as well as aiding regeneration of the areas
they surround,' the West Midlands Forum advised Mr Gummer.
'Like most sensible people we understand the general requirement - to
prevent the coalescing of big urban lumps,' said Mr Anthony Glossop, chief
executive of St Modwen Properties, referring to how Walsall on the
north-east side of the Birmingham-Black country conurbation might sprawl to
meet Cannock to the north.
'The green belt has been around since 1947. It has a valid role. It needs to
be applied sympathetically and reviewed from time to time - which it is,'
said Mr Nick Mason-Jones, managing director of Bryant Properties.
It is these questions of application and review which stir the most
argument, pitting the planners and environmentalists, against the market.
'We're saying that the emphasis throughout the West Midlands should be about
urban regeneration,' said Mr John Finney, one of the planners at West
Midlands Forum. That means that the green belt should be protected, that
development should be drawn back into the cities rather than allowed outside
them.
But that is easier said than done. The West Midlands planners would like to
draw development in to the north and west of the region, to the Black
Country and Staffordshire, where the local economies are weakest. However,
the commercial pressures for space are more evident on the south and east of
the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation.
'There is a danger of overheating in the south and south-east, where there
is the greatest pressure on areas of attractive landscape,' said Mr Finney.
Ideally, planners want more activity to strengthen the north and west, while
relieving the south and east.
This, paradoxically, might put more pressure on the green belt. 'There is
little, if any, land on the periphery of the conurbation that is not
designated green belt. Over the past decade this has resulted in growth
pressures jumping into the surrounding shire counties,' says Mr Joe Valente
of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, chartered surveyors.
The shire counties are now resisting growth. The effect will be to direct
more growth into the metropolitan districts, 'some of which will have to be
located within existing green belt areas,' said Mr Valente.
It is the perception of the demand for space and the pervasiveness of the
existing green belt which underlies the industry's demands for relaxing the
green belt. The level of demand is difficult to quantify but, at Arlington
Securities' Birmingham Business Park, south of the city and on land
extracted from the green belt, space was being taken in the depths of
recession as decentralisation continued.
Mr Jim Johnston, Arlington's regional director, noted that companies such as
Hewlett Packard, Honeywell, Norwich Union and Fujitsu Fulcrum, had moved or
were moving from the inner city. Business park rents are lower than those of
the central city, but the gap is narrowing.
Inevitably, companies are governed by their own interest rather than that of
the planners when they take space. To forbid development in one place is not
to secure it for another. 'If it's not allowed to take place in Worcester,
will it take place in Dudley?' asked Mr Valente.
The West Midlands Forum is trying to have the best of both worlds. To
satisfy business demands to get out of town, it has adopted a policy of
premium industrial sites, to make good the deficiency of larger,
high-quality sites in the conurbations, recognising that some of these sites
may have to be in the green belt.
The premium sites policy provides a safety valve; it gives away a little of
the green belt, but keeps the mass. However, the West Midlands Forum
observed that 'the property industry tends to equate premium industrial
sites with the standard B1 Business Park, that is primarily out-of-town
office development in campus form'.
That is unacceptable to the planners who argue that 'only those activities
which could not be located within existing urban areas will be permitted.
However, development must be complementary to, rather than competitive with,
urban regeneration'.
There is plenty of potential dispute within that definition, establishing
what Mr Glossop called 'the difference between principle and practice'. The
more flexibility on green belt boundaries, the less the trouble with the
industry and the more the trouble with environmentalists. Perhaps Mr Gummer
will clarify how much room an elbow needs.

Bruno Magne's appointment as managing director of France Telecom UK is
further evidence of the ambitions of the French state telecom company's
British ambitions.
In common with several leading continental telecoms operators, France
Telecom last year established a UK subsidiary to exploit the now liberalised
market for data telecoms and private corporate telephone networks, gearing
itself particularly to large companies with substantial European traffic.
France Telecom has more than 100 staff in the UK, and boasts 250 customers
in the corporate telephone network sector alone. Most of its customers are
in the City, and last week it opened a network centre in Docklands.
Magne has been with France Telecom for 27 years, latterly as director of
technical support and quality improvement for its core network. 'My
challenge is to ensure we offer effective local and global business
solutions to our clients in the UK and look for new opportunities,' he says.
Since the UK is Europe's most open telecoms market - and far more open than
the French - he ought not to be short of them.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Cuts Treasury driven, says Labour: Backbench Tories applaud
defence paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of making cuts in the armed forces
to meet the Treasury's demand for financial stringency rather than for
operational reasons.
But backbench Conservative MPs, some of whom have expressed concern on this
issue in recent months, applauded the defence report, arguing that it would
enhance military effectiveness in the long term.
Mr Donald Anderson, a Labour defence spokesman, welcomed some of the
proposals in the document, including an enhanced role for the Territorial
Army and the creation of a rapid deployment force. But he questioned why, if
the cuts were justified, they were not part of the last defence review in
1990.
He claimed that the principle of cutting support services was undermined by
the fact that more than 70 per cent of Royal Air Force personnel sent to the
Gulf had been deemed support staff. 'Does that not show how spurious is this
distinction between support services and front line in a modern, integrated
service community?' he asked.
Tory MPs were satisfied with the statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, believing that the government was reducing waste rather
than operational effectiveness.
'They have sucked out a good deal of the fat and they have been very clever
by getting a lot of suggestions from people in the business,' said Sir Jerry
Wiggin, a Tory member of the Commons defence committee. 'They have broken
down the legacy of empire.'
Sir Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister, said: 'The concern all along
is whether we would lose any defence capability. Instead, we've had an
enhancement.'
A number of MPs were concerned that the Ministry of Defence would faces
further cuts in the forthcoming public expenditure survey. However, Mr
Rifkind has privately told MPs that he has an unwritten agreement with the
Treasury that defence will not be the target of further cuts.
A number of Tory and Labour MPs were concerned that their constituencies
would suffer job losses, and some Tories urged the government to reverse
specific proposals. Mr David Shaw was particularly concerned at the proposal
to transfer the Royal Military School for Music from Deal in his Dover
constituency. 'To remove the royal school . . . would tear the heart out of
the constituency,' he said.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Rosyth deprived of warships and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rosyth naval base in Fife is to lose its warships and be downgraded to a
naval support establishment, under the plans announced yesterday by Mr
Rifkind.
Although the base has escaped the closure which had earlier been feared,
there will still be considerable job losses and a serious impact on the
local economy.
Mr Rifkind said one of the two squadrons of minehunters now based there
would be moved to the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde while the other
would move to Portsmouth. The ships at Faslane would be nearer their
operational area, while the ships moving to Portsmouth mainly operated off
England and Wales.
Rosyth will retain the option of being an operating base if necessary and be
used for defence research, storage, accommodation and support for the
adjoining naval dockyard, which is unaffected.
The civilian workforce will fall from 1,300 to 600, and the number of
service personnel located there will be cut from 1,800 to 300. Mr Rifkind
said about 70 jobs would be created at Faslane.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said Scotland would 'bear its fair share,
but no more' of the job losses announced in the review. He said hundreds of
manufacturing jobs in Scotland would be secured by defence orders made
possible by the review.
Fife Regional Council dismissed the diminished role for Rosyth as
unacceptable. It said the base would be the target of resistance for trade
unions and local authorities, which are meeting to plan their campaign
today.
The council believes that last year the naval base was responsible for
securing 4,000 jobs outside the base in the local economy, to which it
contributed Pounds 180m. It believes that only 1,000 jobs will be sustained
by the scaled-down operation and its economic contribution will fall to
Pounds 75m.
Unemployment in the Dunfermline area would rise from 11 per cent to 15 per
cent after the cuts, the council said.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said last night:
'What kind of naval base will Rosyth be with no ships based there? A naval
base without ships has the same long-term prospects as a pub with no beer.'

Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, yesterday called for a government
inquiry into how Tory MPs who are members of Lloyd's left syndicates before
they made big losses.
He urged the prime minister to look 'into the way that a member of your
cabinet, Lord Wakeham (the leader of the Lords), and other leading
Conservatives in 1988 were taken off selected Lloyd's syndicates which later
suffered three years of catastrophic losses.'
Mr Hain asked: 'Were they the beneficiaries of insider information while
millions of pounds of losses were dumped on ordinary Lloyd's investors?'
Mr John Major said Mr Hain, who he criticised for making inferences against
Conservative MPs under privilege of parliament, should bring forward any
information suggesting impropriety.

Ways of extending the purchaser-provider structure of the 1991 health
reforms to the dental service are being considered by the government, Alan
Pike writes.
A green paper published yesterday envisages introducing a system under which
health authorities would purchase dental services at local level. They would
agree contracts with dentists to obtain services reflecting specific local
conditions and the state of oral health in the area.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said: 'The government believes that
there would be clear advantages if the system of payment for dentists could
be made more sensitive to local needs and priorities for dental care. That
was the thrust of our changes to the wider NHS, and the benefits there are
now tangible.'

The plan announced yesterday represents a hard-won victory by defence

idea of joint or 'tri-service' facilities.
The ministry has had to contend with the staunchly independent traditions of
the three services, as well as some more practical objections.
Under the new principle - referred by the ugly new word 'jointery' - there
is to be a tri-service hospital and a tri-service staff college. Joint
arrangements will be promoted in areas such as flying instruction, music
lessons and veterinary care.
Operational commands are by definition 'tri-service' as most wars are fought
on land, sea and air. A permanent tri-service operational headquarters will
be set up at Northwood, north-west of London.
Ministry officials believe a single establishment to oversee operations in
conflict zones will be better than what one called 'the current ad hoc
approach of setting up such a headquarters only in response to a developing
crisis'.
Senior officers are known to have doubts about concentrating operational
command in one, potentially vulnerable spot, however.
Plans to bring the services together in a 20,000-strong Rapid Deployment
Force, including men from the Parachute Regiment, Royal Marine commandos and
RAF aircraft, are expected to receive a warmer welcome.
The ministry has decided to make the naval hospital at Haslar, Hampshire a
joint institution and to close the hospitals at Aldershot, Hampshire, and
Wroughton, Wiltshire. All secondary medical care will be concentrated in a
tri-service agency.
A joint staff college is to be established by 1997, where officers will be
sent on 10-month courses in tactical and operational doctrine.
The ministry may use the Army school at Camberley, Surrey or the historic
naval college at Greenwich, south London.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Aftershock reverberates across the industry: Cuts to cause
pain nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's defence cuts will have a painful and long-lasting impact on
employment in several parts of Britain, in spite of efforts to spread
redundancies across the services and around the country.
In the words of an official involved in planning the exercise: 'There is no
downside for defence, but there is a downside in the consequences for
individuals.'
The number of staff at the Ministry of Defence's head office in London,
which has been cut since 1990, will fall faster, with the closure of two
buildings - Northumberland House and the Metropole building.
The number of employees in London was already scheduled to fall to 5,200
next year from 12,700 in 1990. It is now expected to fall to 3,750 by 1998.
The ministry's procurement executive, at present in the throes of
wide-ranging cuts, will lose another 500 staff, bringing the number of
employees at its new site in Abbey Wood, Bristol, to 9,000 or fewer.
The biggest single source of job losses will be reductions in the number of
depots and streamlining the provision of spare parts.
Air force personnel account for 2,150 of the 6,350 job losses in this
category and civilians for another 3,100. The government has not spelt out
in detail where these personnel cuts will arise.
Some 17 depots of various sizes, ranging from a naval supply establishment
at Exeter to an Army engineering park in Stirling, have been earmarked for
closure, with the loss of 1,500 jobs. It remains unclear where exactly the
remaining redundancies will come.
The air force is to make more use of civilians for elementary flying
instruction, and two bases used for flying lessons - at Scampton and
Finningley - will be closed by 1996-97.
Instructions in several other skills, from language training and driving to
parachuting, will also rely more heavily on civilians.
This would account in part for the 1,500 jobs the RAF is to sacrifice to
'civilianisation' over and above rationalisa-tion of the depot system.
Another large category of victims which has yet to be fully explained is
provided by the 1,300 civilians who will lose their jobs because of
'rationalisation of science and technology'.
All the ministry's non-nuclear science and technology organisations are to
be merged in a single executive agency, built on the framework of the
existing Defence Research Agency, but also including the Chemical and
Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down. A decision to merge the
forces' recruiting offices with the civilian Employment Services Agency will
probably cost the jobs of most of the 1,450 people who currently work in
military recruiting.
Streamlining medical services will cost another 1,000 jobs, spread equally
between the services.
Around the country there was considerable dismay about the cuts. Mr Bernard
Frowd, chief executive of Exeter City Council, said: 'The closure of naval
supply establishment is a great blow to Exeter. It means the loss of 290
jobs.
'We have already been told 260 jobs are to go in the Pay and Records Office
by 1996. This is 550 jobs in the public sector. Put this together with
redundancies in the private sector, British Gas, British Telecom and we are
facing job losses of 1,000 over the next couple of years.'
He said the latest job losses would push the unemployment rate in the Exeter
travel-to- work area - which covers 450,000 people - from 8 per cent into
double figures. 'We have received no government relocations and we get no
help from the European Union in the form of regional assistance. With the
cutbacks in the Plymouth dockyard, Devon has been very hard hit.'
In Bristol there was less dismay but only because the immediate job cuts
appear to be less than feared. Not all the 900 job cuts in the Procurement
Executive will affect its new Abbey Wood headquarters, under construction in
north Bristol.
There had been fears that the Naval Support Command which has a main site in
Bath, employing about 2,500 and supporting thousands more in the area, would
be transferred or closed. But all the white paper had to say was: 'We are
examining which elements of the headquarters need to be collocated, and the
most suitable site in the Bath/Bristol travel to work area.'
Mr Darren Parker, the industrial development officer of the Western
Development Partnership, said: 'Bristol may seem to have got off lightly,
but any job losses are serious, when you consider that in defence
manufacturing 7,000 jobs were lost between 1987 and 1993. This is 32 per
cent of all jobs in this sector in the area.'
As well as the main cuts in defence establishments, the MoD is to close
firing ranges at Kirkcudbright, in southern Scotland, Pendine in Dyfed, and
Lavington, Wiltshire.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Equipment orders survive the surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All three services are to get new equipment as a result of announcements
yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, but most of the orders had been expected
regardless of the cuts which accompanied them.
The value of the orders placed and invitations to tender was more than
Pounds 5bn, Mr Rifkind said.
Two additions to the MoD's list were an order for Paveway 3 laser-guided
bombs and an intention to buy submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles if
agreement can be reached with the US government and manufacturers.
Both are being ordered in the light of experience in the Gulf war, where
'smart' munitions proved extremely effective. The Paveway is manufactured by
Texas Instruments, but British Aerospace has substantial work on the weapon,
which is dropped from Tornado ground-attack aircraft. McDonnell Douglas and
Hughes of the US manufacture the Tomahawk.
The Royal Navy is to get two Landing Platform Docks as replacements for the
Fearless and Intrepid assault ships, which are due to be retired. Mr Rifkind
announced that the expected invitation to tender for the amphibious landing
vessels would be issued soon.
Among UK shipyards, only Swan Hunter on Tyneside, in receivership, or VSEL
at Barrow, in Cumbria, have facilities for such vessels.
An invitation to tender has also been announced for a second batch of up to
six Trafalgar class nuclear hunter-killer submarines, to replace the navy's
ageing Swiftsure submarines. The competition for the order is expected to be
between VSEL, the traditional submarine manufacturer, and Yarrow on the
Clyde, which is owned by GEC.
The Ministry of Defence said that the order was both to sustain the navy's
anti-ship and anti-submarine capability and to maintain a UK nuclear
submarine construction capability into the next century.
Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said he was 'delighted that the
invitations to tender have been confirmed. We have been expecting them for
several months. Our teams working on these deals will go into top gear at
once'.
But he also expressed concern that the timings were further away than VSEL's
previous understanding.
Vosper Thornycroft won an order for seven Sandown class minehunters which
will be built at Southampton. The order was worth Pounds 250m in total, with
about Pounds 150m of the work to be done by Vosper. It secures about 450
jobs for four years, with production starting next year.
Mr Chris Girling, finance director, said the company was 'obviously
thrilled. This will continue a long tradition of supplying ships to the
Royal Navy and further enhance our export prospects'.
Widespread expectations that another batch of Type 23 frigates would be
ordered were not fulfilled, though the MoD indicated that a further frigate
order was likely later in the year - it is expected to go to Yarrow if a
satisfactory price is agreed.
The Army got the largest single order that was placed firmly yesterday, when
it was confirmed that 259 Challenger 2 tanks would be bought from Vickers.
The company was asked to tender for the tanks last year when it was decided
not to update the Challenger 1 fleet.
The order is worth Pounds 1.1bn in total and Pounds 800m to Vickers, and
will secure work at the company's Newcastle factory until the end of the
century.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, said the order 'is good for
the Army and for Britain. It provides a formidable yet cost-effective
weapons system. The endorsement of Challenger 2 will boost its export
prospects in those markets which traditionally look to Britain for a lead'.
Royal Ordnance received an order for 400,000 rounds of mortar ammunition
worth Pounds 50m.
The Royal Air Force was not forgotten. Its 14 Tornado GR1 ground attack
aircraft are to get an extensive mid-life overhaul. The order, worth Pounds
700m, will secure 1,000 jobs at British Aerospace's Warton site in
Lancashire, as well as a further 600 jobs in first-tier suppliers such as
GEC-Marconi.
The MoD stressed that the Tornado work would help maintain BAe's
manufacturing base until production of the Eurofighter 2000 came on stream
in the year 2000.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, welcomed the orders. 'This is worth a
total of Pounds 1bn to BAe, and will secure jobs within the company and many
of its suppliers.' BAe will benefit from the Tornado and Paveway programmes,
and will supply command and control electronics for any Type 23 frigates and
Trafalgar class submarines which are ordered.
As well as procuring new weapons, Mr Rifkind said the forces' fighting
capability would be improved by the retention in service of a frigate and a
nuclear submarine which were previously to have been mothballed. He
announced the formation of a joint services rapid reaction force, a move
many Conservative MPs had been pressing for.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Unions launch campaign against 'a dirty trick'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unions representing defence workers plan a three-month campaign
against cuts in the worst affected areas of the country which have
Conservative MPs.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said last
night: 'Through a long, hot summer the unions will be asking why the party
of defence is betraying the defence workers.'
The IPMS civil service union, which represents 25,000 technical specialists
in the Ministry of Defence, said the 7,100 cut in civilian jobs announced
yesterday was on top 12,000 job losses announced under the Options for
Change programme.
Mr Paul Noon, the union's assistant general secretary, said last night:
'This means one-in-six civilian workers in the Ministry of Defence will be
thrown out of a job within the next three years.'
He said that the unions would be calling for an immediate inquiry by the
Commons defence committee into the operational effects of the white paper
proposals and that the Commons public accounts committee should inquire into
the Pounds 1bn a year cost of contracting out work in the MoD.
Mr Ross Burns, secretary to the industrial trade unions at Devonport, said
the latest job losses at Royal Navy stores depots in Devon were 'a dirty
trick to pull on people who have given damned loyal service to the
government and to the country'.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Retailers win supply rights for newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent retailers have won greater access to supplies of newspapers from
wholesalers after a lengthy debate about the newspaper distribution
industry.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission found last December that newspaper
wholesalers operated a complex monopoly and that some practices - refusing
supplies in an area they judged to be adequately served - operated against
the public interest. There was, however, a fear among existing newsagents
that a sudden increase in new outlets might disrupt the distribution network
and undermine the sale-or-return system and home delivery of newspapers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that subject to
satisfactory undertakings he had decided to accept a new industry code of
practice, rather than introducing a statutory order prohibiting practices
found to be against the public interest, as he had warned.
The code, put forward by the Association of Newspaper and Magazine
Wholesalers, will define conditions under which a new retailer will have a
right of access to newspaper supplies.
Established retailers will be able to sub-retail or transfer copies within
500 metres from their outlets in urban areas and 1km in other areas. New
retailers will have to meet a minimum weekly order of 50 per cent of average
orders for the area and pay a returnable deposit equal to three weeks'
supplies.
There will be a right of appeal in the case of disputes to a new body to be
set up under the code.
Mr John Gardner, managing director of VG, the convenience store group which
led a campaign for greater access to newspaper supplies, yesterday welcomed
the outcome.
He said: 'Independent grocers will now be able to offer newspapers to their
customers. For decades now newsagents have been able to sell groceries, but
grocers were denied the right to sell newspapers. These unfair practices
have now been abolished.'
The minister has asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading,
to negotiate satisfactory undertakings from the wholesalers that they will
keep to the terms of the code of practice.

exploration.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said oil companies, environmental groups and
local authorities would be involved in preparing reports on the coastal and
marine environments of areas which could be included in the forthcoming 16th
licensing round, details of which will be announced in the autumn.
The UK Offshore Operators Association, an oil industry group representing
companies active in the North Sea, will pay for the studies.

FT  15 JUL 94 / SIB slow to change its role as regulator
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The efforts of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, to withdraw from direct regulation and concentrate on standard
setting and supervising other regulators have achieved only limited success
so far, its annual report says.
The report, published yesterday, shows that at the end of March this year
SIB was directly regulating 75 organisations - only five fewer than in March
last year.
However, it adds that 22 of these have now applied to the Personal
Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, and
SIB expects some of the 20 others eligible to follow suit.
SIB's costs for the year to the end of March totalled Pounds 17.7m - an
increase of 25 per cent on the previous year, but Pounds 500,000 under
budget.

FT  15 JUL 94 / MPs urge probe on bread prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An influential committee of MPs is putting pressure on the Office of Fair
Trading to launch a formal investigation into the price of bread in Northern
Ireland.
The recently established cross-party committee on Northern Ireland yesterday
wrote to the OFT to express its concern about the differential in bread
prices between Ulster and the rest of the UK.
The committee - chaired by Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist
party MP for North Down - said it wanted to know 'as speedily as possible'
whether the OFT thought there was a case for further investigation.
The letter followed an appearance before the committee by the General
Consumer Council for Northern Ireland.
According to the council, a large loaf costs on average up to 40 per cent
more in Ulster than in mainland Britain.
The council says the difference has increased since 1989. It asked the
director-general of fair trading to investigate the matter last November.
Lady McCollum, who chairs the council, said at the time that the body was
'not convinced' that the difference in price was fully justified, in spite
of the information supplied by the industry. She added: 'What is even more
worrying is the fact that the situation has actually got worse . . . than it
was five years ago.'
The council says the bread market in the province is dominated by three
bakeries, two of which are subsidiaries of Associated British Foods and
Ranks Hovis McDougall (which was taken over by Tomkins in 1992). It says ABF
also owns two of the largest supermarkets in the province.
The OFT said yesterday it was in the process of conducting an informal
investigation into bread prices in the province. There were no plans to make
an announcement on its findings in the immediate future.

bring private prosecutions against superstores which open on Sundays.
Two judges ruled that Mr Roy Edey was entitled to launch such actions after
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, declined to intervene. They said
that prosecutions begun by Mr Edey against Woolworths, Superdrug and Tesco
Stores would proceed as soon as possible.
However, Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Mr Justice Macpherson added that, in
view of changes in the law, magistrates 'may not regard the offences
disclosed as being particularly serious'.
Recent prosecutions in England and Wales had resulted in magistrates' orders
against offending stores varying from absolute discharges to maximum fines,
said the judges.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Law change mooted to smooth Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is willing to consider amendments to the 1920 Government of
Ireland Act as part of the effort to secure a new political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today tell Mr Albert Reynolds,
his Irish counterpart, that an explicit pledge by Dublin to modify the
republic's constitutional claim to the province is vital to any hope of an
agreement.
British officials insist that it will be impossible to restart talks between
the constitutional parties without a commitment by the republic to
incorporate into article two of its constitution the principle of majority
consent in Ulster to any change in the status of the province.
Moderate unionist leaders have made it clear that they will not participate
in a resumption of the 'three-strand' search for a political settlement
without such a pledge from Dublin.
But Mr Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment in advance of
the conclusion of an overall accord between unionists and nationalists. As a
result, talks between London and Dublin on a framework document to restart
the talks process have become deadlocked.
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to break that deadlock at their meeting
today on the margins of the European summit in Brussels.
In spite of recent gloom in both capitals about the prospect of a
breakthrough before the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled in for late next week,
officials in London have not ruled out the possibility that the two prime
ministers will find a compromise. The expectation is that if they do not the
summit will be postponed until September.
British officials say that Mr Reynolds' recent public calls for changes in
the Ireland Act have not yet been matched by specific suggestions for
amendments.
There is also some puzzlement as to why Dublin regards that legislation  -
which predates the division of Ireland - as such an important symbol of
Irish partition. The 1973 Northern Ireland Act is a much clearer assertion
of Westminster's sovereignty over the province.
The view in London is that as long as the principle of consent is not
undermined the government is ready to consider changes to the 1920
legislation as part of a package to restart the process.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons
yesterday that he saw no particular need for changes but was ready to
consider any proposals.
It is understood that the liaison group drawing up the proposed framework
document has still to settle the form of the new cross-border groups
demanded by nationalist politicians in the province as a quid pro quo for
the creation of a new Ulster assembly.
Some differences remain over the degree to which the two governments should
seek to prescribe the form of devolved administration.
The London government appears confident that they could quickly be resolved
if Mr Major and Mr Reynolds break the deadlock over the constitutional
claim.
By contrast there appears little optimism in London about the prospects for
an early end to violence in the province.
Intelligence reports suggest that the latest escalation in attacks by the
IRA might represent a deliberate show of strength as the precursor to a
temporary ceasefire.
The government still believes that the faction represented by Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is looking for an escape route from the
violence to allow it to join the talks process.
But the apparent determination of hardline sections of the IRA to continue
the killing has all but extinguished hopes of a quick 'clean' break with the
past 25 years.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Local authorities 'used reserves to avoid capping'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England and Wales drew on their reserves to an
unprecedented extent last year to avoid having their budgets capped by the
government, figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy show today.
Total use of reserves rose from Pounds 531m for the financial year 1993-94
to Pounds 819m in 1994-95.
In some areas spending from reserves was all that stopped councils from
exceeding the level at which they would have been 'capped' by the government
under legislation to stop authorities from setting too high a council tax.
In inner London, total budgets were only Pounds 55m below the level at which
they would have been capped, and Pounds 56m of reserves had been used. In
outer London Pounds 64m of reserves were used to keep budgets only Pounds
52m below the capping level.
Overall reserves are equivalent to 7.3 per cent of overall annual
expenditure. However, this varies across the country. In the north-west,
reserves are only equivalent to 4.4 per cent of expenditure, while in the
south-east outside London and in East Anglia the figure is 10.2 per cent.
The government was successful in containing council tax rises, with only a
2.1 per cent increase on last year, according to the institute. The average
council tax for houses in band D is Pounds 580.33 in England (Pounds 350.32
in Wales), while the average bill for all English households was Pounds
473.28 (Pounds 283.80 for homes in Wales).
Local authorities were worried that this draw on reserves could not be
sustained. Mr John Blundell, head of finance for the cross-party Association
of District Councils, said: 'Clearly what councils are trying to do is keep
spending on services. I would have thought it unlikely that local
authorities could use a similar take from reserves to support services next
year so the financial squeeze will be greater.'
Mr David Thomas, the institute's head of local government, said: 'The
government's financial equation for local authorities appears to have
worked. What the figures do not show are the actions each has had to take to
achieve their financial targets.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / Income figures inflame poverty row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy over the extent of poverty in the UK was renewed yesterday by
government figures showing that the real incomes of the bottom 10 per cent
of the population have fallen by 17 per cent since 1979.
This maintains a continuing pattern of decline in the income of the bottom
group after housing costs. It fell 14 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91, and
was 17 per cent lower by 1991-92. Before housing costs are taken into
account the real income of the bottom 10 per cent is unchanged since 1979.
The figures were published in the government's Households Below Average
Incomes statistical analysis.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that the results 'do not
show that the poor have become poorer'. He said spending patterns in the
bottom 10 per cent of income distribution suggested that the income figures
did not reflect true living standards.
The pressure group Church Action on Poverty said poverty had reached
scandalous levels. It said: 'Poverty is not an incurable disease. Yet still
we have no indication of regret or remorse from the government, nor any
signs of a plan to reconnect those who are systematically cut adrift from
mainstream society.'
The Child Poverty Action Group said that Britain should be 'deeply ashamed'
by the problems revealed in the report.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said: 'It is not a fringe
that is excluded from increased prosperity, but a great mass of ordinary
decent working people.'
The government says that the figures reflect factors such as the increase in
unemployment during the recession rather than a growth in absolute poverty.
However, the report provides further evidence of growing disparity in
incomes between the top and bottom groups. The 17 per cent decline in income
of the bottom group since 1979 compares with a 36 per cent average increase
for the population as a whole, and a 62 per cent rise after housing costs
for the wealthiest 10 per cent.
Anti-poverty campaigners say this shows the UK is developing into a US-style
society with a widening gap between its richest and poorest.
In 1979 the proportion of the population receiving less than half average
income was 8 per cent before housing costs and 9 per cent after. These
proportions rose to 21 per cent and 25 per cent by 1991-92.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Radical council shake-up proposed for East Anglia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Anglian local government should be radically reorganised with eight new
unitary authorities replacing Norfolk and Suffolk county councils and the
area's 14 district councils, the Local Government Commission said yesterday.
Under the proposals, Norwich and Ipswich would become self-governing cities.
Total costs could be as high as Pounds 37m, according to the commission,
while the annual savings might be as little as Pounds 1m.
King's Lynn and West Norfolk District Council would become a unitary
authority within its existing boundaries. There would be five mergers: Great
Yarmouth in Norfolk with Waveney in Suffolk; North Norfolk and Broadland
councils; Breckland with South Norfolk; Forest Heath, St Edmudsbury and the
western parts of Mid Suffolk and Babergh would become West Suffolk; and
Suffolk Coastal with the eastern parts of Mid Suffolk and Babergh would form
East Suffolk.
The commission believes the only viable alternative to this ambitious system
would be to leave the structure unchanged, with Norwich and Ipswich
remaining as district councils within larger counties.
The commission believes that the second option is supported by 'the majority
of local town and parish councils'.
The total number of mainland county councils which the commission has
recommended for abolition so far is 22. However, in 13 cases it has also
suggested the two-tier system as an alternative.
All households in the counties concerned have been sent leaflets in a
consultation exercise which will continue until September. If this reveals
support for the two-tier system, the commission could rule out
reorganisation.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who is a Suffolk MP, has said he
supports unitary councils because they allow greater accountability, and has
already asked the commission to review again three counties where it has
recommended keeping the two-tier system.

FT  15 JUL 94 / M and S decides to open on Sundays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, and the John Lewis Partnership, two of the stalwarts in
the campaign against seven-day-a-week trading, yesterday announced their
plans to open on Sunday.
The new Sunday trading law, which comes into effect at the end of next
month, means that shops will be allowed to open legally for at least six
hours on a Sunday. Current restrictions are widely flouted, with about
145,000 shops ignoring the 1950 Shops Act.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of M and S, told the company's annual
general meeting yesterday: 'There are clearly a number of places where all
the neighbouring retailers will now open on Sunday, and in order to satisfy
customer needs, and protect our share of the market, we will open in those
locations.'
M and S would open 'most, if not all' of its stores on Sundays throughout
the December Christmas trading period and, beyond that, would 'continue to
evaluate the situation', he said.
Separately, the John Lewis Partnership said it would open 19 of its 108
Waitrose supermarket branches on Sundays from September 4. The current
illegal Sunday opening by competitors was costing the company Pounds 1m a
week, it said.
John Lewis was originally part of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, which
was also backed by the main churches, while M and S was active in the
Retailers for Shops Act Reform. The two groups joined forces in November
last year in a failed attempt to limit deregulation in England and Wales -
Scotland is already fully deregulated. A campaigner against Sunday trading
yesterday won the right to bring private prosecutions against superstores
that open on Sundays.
Two High Court judges ruled that Mr Roy Edey was entitled to launch such
actions after Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, declined to
intervene.
However, Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Mr Justice Macpherson added that, in
view of changes in the law, magistrates 'may not regard the offences
disclosed as being particularly serious'.

FT  15 JUL 94 / 20% of directors take pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in five directors in some of the UK's biggest companies took a pay cut
last year, according to a report by Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International,
the recruitment consultants.
The report surveyed salaries of more than 1,000 senior executives, in 154 of
the UK's largest companies.
It found that two in five top executives received less than a 2 per cent
increase in their total cash earnings. 'This firmly contradicts the public
perception that senior managers are paid inflated salaries,' said Mr Michael
Brandon, the Korn/Ferry director who co-wrote the report.
But the findings also revealed broad discrepancies in the upper and lower
earnings of managers. While 40 per cent of those in the survey had
relatively low increases, another 15 per cent had annual increases of more
than 30 per cent. More than 40 per cent received increases above 10 per
cent.
The report said that those earning the highest salaries were generally
obtaining proportionally greater increases.
The median increase in cash earnings of all the directors of 8.4 per cent
was largely due to increased bonuses, said the report. Basic salaries on
average rose slightly ahead of inflation, by 4 to 5 per cent.
Mr Brandon said: 'What we are finding is that while there is a whole group
of people doing very well there is another group of directors out there who
are not.' Building Societies and mutual life offices are losing out in
competition with the quoted banks and insurance companies to attract the
highest quality directors, a report says today.
The Incomes Data Services management pay review compares the pay packages of
top directors in the 11 largest building societies and 11 mutual life
offices with those of equivalent directors in quoted banks and insurances.
The IDS report said that the societies were confronting the problem by
adopting long-term bonus schemes linked to various measures such as sales
achievements and cost controls.

FT  15 JUL 94 / MMC to probe advertising bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate a bid by More
O'Ferrall, the poster advertising company, for London Transport Advertising,
the London Transport subsidiary which is being privatised.
More O'Ferrall, one of four bidders for LTA, said it was 'extremely
disappointed' about the referral. The resulting delay could jeopardise its
chances of a successful bid.
LTA generates about Pounds 23m a year from the sale of poster space in
Underground stations and on buses and trains. It employs about 300 people.
It had been expected that the sale would be completed by the end of this
month but the government has now given the MMC a deadline of mid-October to
present its report.
Mr Vincent Slevin, More O'Ferrall UK managing director, said it was up to
London Transport to evaluate the bids and take the MMC investigation into
account.
The Department of Trade and Industry is concerned that More O'Ferrall's bid
'raises competition concerns in the poster advertising market in the London
area which merit investigation by the MMC'.
If More O'Ferrall were to be successful it would control about 21 per cent
of the UK outdoor advertising market and about 38 per cent of the market in
London. A market share of 25 per cent commonly triggers an MMC
investigation.
Mr Slevin said the company had hoped that the bid would not be referred
because the media world was changing. Carlton had 55 per cent of the London
television market and Capital Radio 65 per cent of London radio, he added.
The three other bidders for LTA are a management and employee buy-out; a
joint bid by Giraudy, a French poster company, and Primesight, a UK outdoor
company; and a consortium led by Transportation Displays, a US transport
advertising company.
More O'Ferrall shares closed down 1p at 361p.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Building optimism marred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubts about the strength of the housing market recovery are clouding an
otherwise positive picture of improving prospects for the construction
industry, the latest quarterly survey from the Building Employers
Confederation shows.
The survey, published yesterday, raises concerns about employment in the
industry, with evidence of emerging skills shortages, in spite of the large
number of job losses in the recession.
The report shows increasing confidence of growth in the next year among a
rising number of companies. A significant proportion of companies expect to
employ more people over the next few months.
It also indicates an upturn in the level of construction activity in the
second quarter of this year, with more companies working at a higher level
of capacity than in the first quarter. More than one-third of companies
reported increased output in the second quarter  - the highest proportion
since the second quarter of 1989.
The upward trend of inquiries about new work was confined almost entirely to
the private sector, however, as public sector inquiries for new schools and
hospitals fell in comparison with the first three months of this year.
Sir Brian Hill, BEC president, said: 'If the present uncertainties in the
housing market reflect consumer confidence in the economy as a whole, this
is indeed worrying.'
He expressed concern about shortages of skilled workers, particularly
bricklayers and carpenters. 'We have a major task ahead of us in stepping up
training and also attracting back into our industry some of the many skilled
people who have left it,' he said.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Regulator's plans may restrict Railtrack profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough curbs could be imposed on the profits of Railtrack, the company which
has taken over British Rail's track and signalling, if proposals unveiled
yesterday by the rail industry regulator are put into effect.
Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, suggests in an assessment of the
proposed access agreements to be signed between Railtrack and the train
operating companies, that commercial pressures could require Railtrack to
reduce the value of its assets and the level of return it made on them.
He says: 'The combined effect might be to impose a significant reduction in
Railtrack's profitability post-privatisation.'
The tone of his 50-page paper suggests that Mr Swift will adopt a rigorous
approach to Railtrack's efficiency and profitability. Its detail indicates
the extent to which many practical issues involved in rail privatisation
have still to be solved.
Mr Swift questions whether the 8 per cent return on assets set for Railtrack
by the Treasury is sustainable, because private-sector returns have fallen
in recent years.
He suggests that valuing Railtrack's assets on the basis of what it would
cost to replace them may not be realistic and that their value would be set
much lower in the commercial market place when the company is privatised.
Mr Swift is seeking comments on the document, and on a second paper which
looks at the question of increasing competition on the railway, by the
middle of August.
He plans to publish policy statements in November and April. Once agreed, a
formula would apply for five years.
Railtrack did not comment yesterday on the detail of the proposals but
welcomed the start of the consultation process and the news that agreements
would last for five years.
Mr Swift said it was not the intention of his proposals to make Railtrack
more difficult to float on the stock market. But he wanted to resolve the
regulatory issues before the privatisation of BR was completed rather than
waiting until afterwards as had happened with the water and gas industries.
The consultation document says that in the early years Railtrack will have
an incentive to improve its operating efficiency as its required return
rises from 5.1 per cent to 8 per cent, but after that incentives related to
the retail prices index may be needed. The company would be required to hold
cost increases to a percentage figure below the retail prices index.
The regulator will also want to see that the figure which Railtrack charges
to depreciation in its accounts relates to actual spending on track and
station replacement. He will also look for efficiency improvements in
infrastructure maintenance.
In a second document on the subject of competition Mr Swift says that he
expects exclusive rights to run trains on a particular stretch of track to
be granted only in exceptional cases and for limited periods.
The government is keen to open the rail tracks to independent train
companies operating alongside the franchised companies but this could make
the franchises less attractive.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Business predicts increase in staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses plan to hire more staff in the three months to the end of
September in spite of expectations that new orders will grow at a slower
rate, the latest quarterly survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information group, shows.
The company's poll of 1,500 managing directors found that 40 per cent
expected to increase staffing levels in the current three months compared
with a year ago, with 11 per cent planning a reduction. The balance - a
positive 29 percentage points - was slightly up from the second quarter and
the highest for five years. Nearly half the service companies polled plan to
increase staff.
The survey found that the balance of companies expecting increased net
profits and selling prices rose slightly between the second and third
quarters, while expectations of net sales, exports and inventory levels fell
marginally.
The positive balance expecting new orders to rise in the latest quarter
compared with a year ago fell to 45 percentage points from 56 points in the
second.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that the survey highlighted the fragility of Britain's
economic recovery. This was disputed by the Treasury, which said that the
fall in orders growth could reflect a seasonal pattern.
Past surveys show that the balance of new orders has deteriorated between
the second and third quarters of every year since 1989. The latest poll
found that just over half of businesses expected to increase orders in this
quarter compared with a year ago, while 42 per cent expected no change.
The north-west and west Midlands appeared to be the most confident regions.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Electricity liberalisation plea rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday
angered large electricity users by turning down proposals to liberalise the
electricity market.
He said that no case had been made for significant changes to the rules for
the pool, the wholesale market for electricity, which have been blamed for
pushing up prices.
The pool arrangements 'have worked well', he said in a long-awaited report,
and claims that security of supply would be threatened and competition would
not work 'have been proved wrong'.
In particular, Prof Littlechild said there was no case for allowing
generators and consumers to bypass the pool and trade directly with each
other. Under current rules large generators are obliged to sell all their
output through the pool.
Intensive energy users, which have criticised the sharp rise in electricity
prices, have been pressing for liberalisation of pool trading.
Earlier this week the Chemical Industries Association put outside-pool
trading forward as a means of increasing competition among generators.
Mr Doug Roger, one of the association's executive directors, said yesterday
that he was 'amazed' that the regulator should have turned the proposal
down.
However, Mr Peter Rost of the Major Energy Users Association said that while
some big industries would be disappointed, smaller companies would welcome
the news because they lacked sufficient bargaining power to strike
one-to-one deals directly with the generators.
Prof Littlechild said there was little tangible evidence of the likely gains
that trading outside the pool could bring, and it would be costly to make
the necessary arrangements. It might also damage volume and transparency in
the pool, which would place smaller competitors and new entrants at a
disadvantage.
But he said he wanted further improvements to the pool, although his
research had shown opposition to a suggestion that generators should be paid
their bid prices. At present generators receive the price bid by the most
expensive plant needed to satisfy demand at a particular time of day,
regardless of what they bid themselves.
The regulator's views were laid out in a report produced in response to a
request last year from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. In parallel with
his inquiry the pool management has been preparing its own recommendations,
which will be put forward later this year.
London Docklands Development Corporation is inviting 16 companies to bid to
participate in a project to supply heat and power to the Royal Docks. The
project would supply power directly, bypassing the local electricity
company.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Court backs job security in pregnancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British women who are sacked as a result of becoming pregnant will be able
to claim a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 - and thus much higher
compensation awards - following a ruling in the European Court of Justice.
The decision was played down by ministers but welcomed by the Trades Union
Congress and the Equal Opportunities Commission. It could result in more
Pounds 100,000-plus awards similar to those made to women soldiers sacked by
the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Ira Chalphin of the Institute of Directors said, however, that the ruling
would make women of child-bearing age less attractive to employers. 'The law
is increasingly saying to employers 'beware of these people',' he said.
The case was taken to the European Court of Justice by Mrs Carole Webb, 25,
of West Drayton, London, who was dismissed from her clerical job at EMO Air
Cargo in June 1987. She had been taken on as a replacement for another woman
soon to begin maternity leave but was dismissed when she discovered that she
too was pregnant.
Mrs Webb said this was a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act and took her
case to an industrial tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the the
Court of Appeal, losing in all three places.
The House of Lords then ruled that there was nothing special about pregnancy
that should cause a woman to be treated differently from a man or woman
unavailable for work on medical grounds. It asked the European Court of
Justice for a preliminary judgment on the issue.
The European Court of Justice disagreed with the Lords, finding that
pregnancy cannot be compared with male illness and that Mrs Webb's dismissal
therefore amounted to sex discrimination.
Hitherto women have been able to claim compensation for dismissal when
pregnant under either employment protection rules or under the Sex
Discrimination Act. But cases under the Sex Discrimination Act have often
failed on the grounds that a man would not have been treated differently,
and employment protection cases have been subject to a compensation limit of
about Pounds 16,000.
The European Court of Justice's ruling insists that pregnant women are
entitled to the protection of the law from the first day of employment,
rather than after two years of service.
In the next significant case before it, expected to be by the end of this
year, the European Court of Justice will rule on whether women should
receive full rates of pay while on maternity leave.

FT  15 JUL 94 / BCCI creditors attack liquidator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two members of the creditors' committee to the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International yesterday renewed their attack on the liquidators
from accountants Touche Ross.
In a newsletter due to be circulated to members today, Dr Adil Elias and Mr
Tony Scott of the BCCI Depositors' Protection Association questioned whether
the liquidators had acted 'in the most effective and cost-efficient way'.
They said the liquidators' costs had 'always been too high'.
They said they remained 'wholly unconvinced' that the new agreement
negotiated between the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi, majority
shareholder in the bank, was the best settlement that could be achieved.
The newsletter accused Touche Ross of taking a 'high-handed approach' which
had imposed strategies on the creditors - seeking only their ratification
rather than their advice. The men were 'unhappy' and still negotiating with
the liquidators over the requirement for confidentiality covering the
creditors' committee meetings, which meant they could not pass information
on to depositors.
They question the assiduousness with which Touche Ross is pursuing its claim
against the Bank of England, which was sued for alleged negligence in its
role as supervisor to BCCI.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Raitrack chairman criticises RMT over 'scaremongering'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, last night condemned the RMT transport
union for 'irresponsible scaremongering' over safety standards on the rail
network during the one-day strikes, Robert Taylor writes.
Speaking as the RMT executive met to discuss its planned move to escalate
the signalling staff dispute which has shut down most of Britain's rail
network over the past five Wednesdays, Mr Horton accused it of 'trying to
bring the country to a halt by frightening the public into staying at home'.
His remarks follow accusations by the RMT that Railtrack had been
compromising safety by using unqualified staff in signal boxes on strike
days.
Mr Horton said: 'The rumours and allegations that were spreading on
Wednesday are desperate attempts to try to prevent the public using the
services available.' He emphasised that 'not one train will run on a strike
day or any other day unless Railtrack is absolutely satisfied that the
service meets the requirements of safety'.
The RMT has already decided to call a further one-day strike for next
Wednesday.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Walker 'accused director of disloyalty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former finance director of Goldcrest Films was accused by Mr George
Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman and chief executive, of disloyalty
and asked to reconsider his position after querying the company's accounts,
an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Frederick Fisher was giving evidence as a prosecution witness in the
trial of Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the group's former finance
director.
The two are accused of fraudulently boosting Brent Walker Group's profits by
some Pounds 19m. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring
to falsify accounts.
Mr Fisher took over as finance director of Goldcrest, a Brent Walker
subsidiary, in 1990 from Mr Donald Anderson whom the prosecution alleges was
also party to the conspiracy to inflate profits.
Mr Fisher told the court that he had suggested including write-off
provisions in the film company's 1989 accounts that would have reduced its
reported profits and asset values. In spite of Mr Fisher expressing these
concerns to Mr Walker, the accounts appeared without the inclusion of these
write-offs, he said.
Mr Fisher told the court he queried the accounts with Brent Walker's
auditors. In a meeting with Mr Walker and Mr John Quested, another alleged
conspirator, Mr Walker angrily accused Mr Fisher of putting his personal
interests before those of the company.
Mr Walker said Mr Fisher's first responsibility was to himself as chief
executive. The conversation ended when Mr Walker asked the finance director
to consider his position with the company.
The trial continues next Monday.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Street-digging code aims to save trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A national code of conduct on the way streets are dug up is to be launched
this autumn by the power, gas, water and telecommunications industries to
try to protect thousands of endangered trees.
Environmentalists and local authorities are concerned about serious damage
to trees caused particularly by cable television companies digging up
pavements and severing roots.
Professor Chris Baines, an environmental consultant who is leading a
campaign to protect street trees, told a conference in Norwich yesterday
that few trees would be left within a few years because cable companies were
licensed to dig 60,000 miles of trenches by the year 2000.
He called for a change in the law which excludes utilities and cable
companies from local authority planning controls when digging up streets.
He said: 'Trees provide the air-conditioning for our towns and cities. It is
criminal to destroy them when we are becoming increasingly worried about the
effects of traffic pollution.'
He said trenches dug by cable companies and utilities severed roots which
provided water, oxygen and anchorage. Almost all these roots lay close to
the surface.
Draft rules for a voluntary code of conduct have been prepared for the
Arboricultural Association and the National Joint Utilities Group
representing all leading utilities.
The working party which devised the rules was chaired by the Department of
the Environment and included the Cable Television Association and local
authority tree officers.
It is hoped that all local authorities will adopt the code, which is
expected to call for the use of small-bore tunnelling close to trees
wherever possible. It says trenches near trees should be hand-dug to protect
roots if tunnelling is impossible, arguing that the increased cost is likely
to be small compared with the total installation bill.
Repair and maintenance techniques which do not require pavements to be
excavated will be encouraged.
Designers and planners will be asked to keep services at a safe distance
from mature trees in new developments.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Royal Mint to avoid sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury, the department in charge of the government's privatisation
programme, has decided against privatising the Royal Mint, one of the most
profitable of the government's executive agencies.
Whitehall insiders expressed surprise because the Treasury is pressing other
government departments to privatise their agencies.
'It reminds me of that old saying about people in glass houses not throwing
stones,' said one mandarin last night.
The Royal Mint, which is based at Llantrisant in south Wales and became an
agency in 1990, was an attractive candidate for privatisation, with an
operating profit of Pounds 15.6m last year. Unlike other agencies it does
not rely on UK government contracts for income. Almost two-thirds of its
sales are exports, where the agency has more than 50 per cent of the market
in coins and medals.
In December a white paper on the future of agencies promised a much stronger
emphasis on privatisation in the triennial reviews of each agency. However,
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday announced that the Royal Mint
would remain in public hands after a review of the options.
A report on the agency's performance found that it had made a return on
capital of 23.2 per cent during its first three years - almost double its
target of 12.5 per cent.
The announcement coincided with the publication of the Royal Mint's annual
report showing that it paid the government a dividend of Pounds 16.5m last
year, up from Pounds 11.8m in the previous year.
Its operating profit had risen 38 per cent in the past year.

FT  15 JUL 94 / MPs say recycling can be harmful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recycling waste can be more harmful to the environment than incinerating it,
the Commons committee on the environment said yesterday.
In its report on recycling the committee strongly urges the government to
investigate the merits of burning waste in order to recover energy. The
report's 46 recommendations also encourage households and companies to
reduce the amount of waste they produce by improving efficiency.
The committee says government targets of recycling a quarter of household
waste by the year 2000 are 'helpful in achieving a step-change in the level
of recycling' but it warns of the danger of 'a counter culture of recycling
for its own sake, no matter what the cost is in energy or money'.
Recycling is one of the government's most popular environmental policies.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said yesterday that
'94 per cent of people (are) convinced that recycling is important'.
Industry groups such as the National Association of Waste Disposal
Contractors say that some recycling, particularly of household waste,
consumes more natural resources than it saves. Many local authorities which
promote recycling have found it difficult to identify markets for the
products.
The committee says the case for recycling 'appears to be most clear for
metals'. Recycling aluminium, it says, consumes 95 per cent less energy than
manufacturing aluminium from bauxite ore.
But in some schemes for recycling paper and plastics 'the energy consumed in
cleaning, collecting and recycling the material may be greater than that
used to manufacture the same product from virgin material'.
The report says that while 45 per cent of glass collected in bottle banks is
green, mainly from wine bottles, there is limited demand for products made
from green glass.
The committee argues strongly against the imposition of a levy on landfills,
a measure ministers are considering in order to encourage recycling. New
regulations on landfill management, which came into force on May 1, will in
any case raise landfill costs, it says.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Dental service faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ways of extending the purchaser-provider structure of the 1991 health
reforms to the dental service are being considered by the government.
A green paper published yesterday envisages introducing a system under which
health authorities would purchase dental services at local level. They would
agree contracts with dentists to obtain services reflecting specific local
conditions and the state of oral health in the area.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said: 'The government believes that
there would be clear advantages if the system of payment for dentists could
be made more sensitive to local needs and priorities for dental care. That
was the thrust of our changes to the wider NHS, and the benefits there are
now tangible.'
The dental service costs about Pounds 1.5bn a year - about 4 per cent of NHS
spending - and the government says it wants to target these resources
better.
Reform of the current system of dental remuneration, under which dentists
are paid a fee for each item of service, is envisaged by the green paper. It
might be replaced by sessional fees based on the time dentists spend
treating each patient.
The government plans to establish pilot studies to evaluate its ideas for an
alternative dental service. Such studies and a new fee system would both
require legislation.
There will also be consultations on ways of improving the present system of
charging patients. Dr Mawhinney said a reduced examination charge, to
encourage people to have regular checks, was a possi-bility.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Alliance enters overdraft rate war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester building society, the UK's fourth largest, yesterday
became the latest high street financial organisation to cut its overdraft
rate in a ploy to attract new customers.
Alliance &amp; Leicester's new rate for an authorised overdraft in its Alliance
account is 9.5 per cent equivalent annual rate.
The rate reduction, made only two weeks after the account was launched, is
seen as a sign of how quickly the battle to win personal customers is
intensifying.
The current round of rate-cutting was started by Abbey National bank, the
former building society, at the end of last month when it reduced the annual
percentage rate on authorised overdrafts to 9.9 per cent.
Although this sparked fears of a price war, the largest high street banks,
which have most of the estimated 33m personal current accounts, have
dismissed the move and have expressed doubt that the reductions will be
maintained.
However, Nationwide, the second-largest society, and Woolwich, the third
largest, have announced substantial reductions in their authorised overdraft
rates.
Alliance &amp; Leicester said that it would probably reduce the overdraft rate
on its Giro account.
The society sees the Giro account as comparable with bank current accounts,
while the Alliance account competes with other building society current
accounts.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said that cutting overdraft
rates represented another, and relatively cheap way for societies to attract
retail deposits.
Although societies recorded net inflows of retail funds in April and May,
the net outflow in the first quarter totalled Pounds 1.3bn.

FT  15 JUL 94 / China slows economy but keeps eye out for unrest: Beijing is
walking a tightrope in trying to balance growth with fears of social
dislocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, was quoted in a pro-Beijing Hong
Kong magazine recently urging continued rapid growth in the Chinese economy.
But the 'designer' of China's economic reforms will be disappointed if he
expected that the breakneck speed of 13 per cent growth in gross domestic
product of the past two years would be maintained.
At mid-year all the indications are that China's economy is slowing in
response to tight money and credit restrictions. Economists are now
forecasting growth of 10-11 per cent this year and further slowing to
between 7 and 9 per cent in 1995.
The key question, however, is whether the slowdown will prove too abrupt and
risk a 'hard landing' for the economy with associated dangers of unrest
among a fractious population, especially in urban centres where unemployment
and under-employment are rising.
Chinese officials fear urban unrest almost as much as the continued
spiralling inflation of earlier this year when cost of living increases in
the 35 biggest urban centres exceeded 25 per cent compared with the same
period last year.
Western economists in Beijing say the government is 'walking a tightrope' in
its continuing efforts to balance the political need for high growth with
fears of social dislocation caused by rising prices.
In the past month or so efforts to sustain relatively high economic growth
appear to have taken precedence over the inflation fight. Credit
restrictions have been loosened somewhat to provide working capital for
faltering state enterprises which have suffered in the squeeze.
Latest statistics reveal the impact on the state sector of the credit
restrictions. Losses to April by medium and large state companies were up by
63 per cent compared with the first four months last year. The proportion of
loss-making enterprises had increased to about 47 per cent compared with 30
per cent in the first quarter of 1993.
By contrast, output of township and village enterprises - mostly small
co-operative ventures - was up by 48 per cent in the four months to April
compared with last year. Industrial output of foreign joint ventures rose by
68 per cent in the same period.
The authorities have also begun to give much greater emphasis to assisting
the agricultural sector in response to signs of growing unhappiness in rural
areas with growth in peasant incomes lagging well behind urban employees.
'The concern of the government has clearly shifted from macro-stability to
agriculture and emerging urban unemployment problems,' said Mr Peter
Bottelier, the World Bank's chief representative in Beijing. 'Sectoral
problems rather than macro-problems are now dominating the scene.'
The annual increase in the national retail price index peaked at 20.8 per
cent in February after rising sharply from 8.4 per cent at the beginning of
1993. Cost of living increases of 25.9 per cent also reached their highest
level in February before beginning to fall back.
Economists forecast that retail inflation would come down to about 16.5 per
cent in the June quarter and cost of living rises would be in the order of
18-20 per cent for the half year compared with last year.
Producer prices have also been falling - by some 50 per cent since mid-1993.
This augurs well for a further reduction in consumer prices through the rest
of the year.
But western economists also note that the re-introduction of price controls
earlier in the year on some 20 basic items, including services, was a
significant factor in slowing growth in prices.
Among slightly ominous recent developments as far as the continued
liberalisation of China's economy is concerned have been signs that the
leadership has begun re-emphasising central planning, including the
re-introduction of grain production targets.
But at this stage in what has proved a difficult process of seeking to
stabilise a runaway economy - 1993 economic growth reached an unsustainable
13.4 per cent - Chinese leaders would seem to have reason to be quietly
satisfied with developments.
Among other positive indications is the slowdown in industrial production to
a more manageable 18 per cent in the first quarter compared with a peak of
27 per cent in the second quarter last year. Investment demand is also
weakening.
Growth of investment by state enterprises fell to about 38 per cent in the
first four months of 1994 compared with peak rates of more than 70 per cent
last year. In line with the government's attempt to re-direct funds towards
infrastructure, investment in transportation and energy has continued to
grow while that in machinery, light industry and real estate has been
curbed.
The government might also be well satisfied with fiscal developments. While
information is sketchy about the success of new tax reforms, including the
introduction of a value-added tax, tax receipts have exceeded targets,
according to the Finance Ministry.
The sale by the end of June of some Yn100bn (Pounds 7.6bn) of two and
three-year treasury bonds surpassed expectations and is being hailed as an
important success in the battle to drain liquidity from an overheating
economy.
National savings rates have also been rising again after wavering last year
amid near panic about rising prices which pushed people into buying gold and
household durables. Urban and rural savings were forecast to reach Yn1,770bn
in the June quarter, a 38 per cent increase over the same period last year.
But for all the positive signs, economists say that Chinese economic
managers are not out of the woods. Not least of their problems is the
debt-crisis among state enterprises caused by companies being unable to pay
each other for supplies of raw materials or finished products.
This in turn is complicating efforts to push ahead with state enterprise
reform and at the same time improve the balance sheets of the specialised
banks. As one western official said: 'The leadership continues to be
involved in a very difficult balancing act.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / Britain in push for better relations with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alastair Goodlad, a UK Foreign Office minister, arrived in Beijing
yesterday for the start of a six-day visit marking the start of a concerted
effort by Britain to improve its relations with China.
During his stay, to take in Shanghai and Guangzhou, Mr Goodlad will meet Mr
Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and senior government officials
responsible for China's relations with western Europe and Hong Kong.
He said on arrival in Beijing that Sino-British relations were good and
'will be getting better'. He is the most senior British politician to visit
Peking since Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, went there a year ago.
Mr Goodlad is expected to tell his Chinese hosts the UK wants links put on a
more normal footing. The two countries are permanent members of the UN
Security Council and share common interests in free trade.
UK officials say the visit is not a negotiating session; they describe it as
a chance to exchange views on a range of topics, which may include the
safety of the Korean Peninsula after North Korean President Kim Il-sung's
death.
Pressure is growing on Foreign Office ministers to recognise that, while the
UK has a responsibility for Hong Kong, its bilateral relations with China
will command centre-stage after the 1997 handover of the colony.
The UK government is under pressure from a restive business community which
believes British business is losing out in China because of the government's
stance on democracy in Hong Kong. A high-level business mission plans to
visit China this autumn to improve commercial ties.
There has been evidence that China's hostility to Hong Kong's political
development has cooled to the extent where Beijing will let large-scale
infrastructure projects progress.
But Britain's decision to press on with Governor Chris Patten's plans for
greater democracy continues to anger Chinese leaders.
Last week Mr Jiang Zemin, state president, said that while China would work
for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong, Britain could not be trusted.
Advisers to China in Hong Kong have warned that while Beijing may be
prepared to work with Britain on Hong Kong's transfer, relations would
remain cool for many years to come.
A Foreign Office official said Mr Goodlad's trip would be a start to
'getting the relationship back on track'. The minister will spend next
Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
New Zealand faces a month of political uncertainty after the surprise
resignation from parliament of Ms Ruth Richardson, former finance minister.
The National government would lose its slender majority if it lost Ms
Richardson's marginal seat in the resultant by- election.
Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said on television last night he had been
tempted to call a general election to ensure a stable government. 'However,
I was elected to lead for a full three-year term,' he added.
The leader of the two-seat opposition Alliance party said he would vote to
ensure the National party continued in government if it lost the Selwyn
seat, 'provided it does nothing controversial'.
The government is riding high in the opinion polls after recent economic
successes, and Mr Bolger acknowledged he was under pressure from his party
to hold a snap election. This would be held under the Westminster
first-past-the-post system; a referendum last year voted in favour of a
switch to the West German system of proportional representation, but the
necessary legislative procedures are not yet in place.
Ms Richardson is one of the most powerful and outspoken right-wing MPs, and
from 1991 was widely credited with being the principal architect of a series
of sweeping government economic reforms.
Her strong views made her politically unpopular, however, and she was sacked
after the last general election when the National party won 50 seats against
the 49 held by opposition parties.
She said yesterday that one of her chief accomplishments came this month
when as a backbencher she steered through parliament a Fiscal Responsibility
Bill which forces future governments to disclose budgetary information on a
quarterly basis.
Ms Richardson said she was resigning to follow family and business
interests, and did not want to be carried out of parliament 'in a box'. She
said the resignation had nothing to do with being sacked as finance
minister, and she would not be joining another political party.
Financial markets reacted sharply to the news, with the New Zealand dollar
losing nearly a cent against the US currency, and interest rates rising
strongly.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Elderly give Singapore's leaders grey hairs: 'Sue Your Son'
bill passing through republic's parliament aims to make adults responsible
for needy parents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many countries, Singapore will in future have fewer people of working
age supporting an expanding pool of elderly. 'I worry that in 30 years' time
our economy may lose some of its drive, vigour and competitiveness,' says Mr
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister.
According to government projections, about 30 per cent of Singapore's
population will be over 60 in the year 2030, compared with today's figure of
9 per cent.
Radical solutions are being proposed.
The Maintenance of Parents Bill, now going through parliament, would compel
adult offspring to give financial support to needy parents. Under the terms
of the privately sponsored but government supported bill, children who
failed to comply would be liable to fines and jail.
The 'Sue Your Son' bill tackles a number of government obsessions. Singapore
is one of the most economically successful countries in Asia; a country of
fewer than 3m people, it has foreign exchange reserves of more than
USDollars 40bn (Pounds 26.3bn). Average annual per capita income, at more
than SDollars 25,000 (Pounds 10,600), is exceeded in Asia only by Japan. The
economy grew by 9.9 per cent last year.
Yet economic success has not brought any comprehensive welfare system.
Welfare, according to the government, is part of the 'democratic distemper'
which has caused western economies to become sluggish and lose their
competitive edge.
Instead, a central provident fund (CPF), a compulsory savings scheme to
which both workers and employers contribute, is supposed to cover the needs
of old age. CPF savings can be withdrawn only when workers reach 55,
although they can be used to raise mortgages and recently the government has
allowed a portion of CPF funds to be used for share purchases.
It would be a disaster, says Mr Goh, if companies and young workers had to
be taxed heavily to support a large number of elderly Singaporeans. 'I worry
that what is happening to the developed countries can also happen to
Singapore,' he says. 'If we lose our competitiveness. . . our growth will
falter and Singaporeans will become unemployed.'
Singapore watchers see other reasons behind the government's support for the
parents bill.
According to the government, the family - with its emphasis on filial piety,
obedience and discipline - is the core of an Asian value system, responsible
for political and social stability as well as encouraging traits that lead
to economic success. In this ideal, Confucianist world, the family also acts
as a bulwark against what are seen as corrosive western influences.
In the early 1980s Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the then prime minister, visited a new
housing development. He was dismayed to find it had two homes for the
elderly.
'It is not something to be proud of,' said Mr Lee. 'It must not be
encouraged. . . it is unsound for a government to take over family
responsibilities for we shall damage the basic unit of society, the family,
the building bricks of our society.'
Recently Mr Lee, now senior minister in Mr Goh's government, suggested that
parents aged between 35 and 60 be given a double vote. According to Mr Lee
this would give those who contribute most to society a greater say. Once
past 60 Singaporeans would revert to a single vote - otherwise, said Mr Lee,
the elderly could have a disproportionate influence and pressure the
government for more welfare.
Critics say the government, by supporting the parents bill and constantly
emphasising the family unit, is ignoring social trends.
As in many western countries, divorce rates in Singapore are rising - almost
doubling in the last 10 years. Birth rates, particularly among Singapore's
more affluent and educated, are falling. This has long-term economic
implications.
Already Singapore has chronic labour shortages and imports about 300,000
workers from neighbouring countries to make up the shortfall. Up until the
mid-1980s the government promoted birth control with a 'two is enough'
slogan. Now it exhorts couples to have 'three or more'.
However, procreation must take place within the family unit. The government
frowns on those merely living together. Unmarried couples cannot combine
their CPF funds to buy public housing and also face restrictions in the
private sector. With property prices rising rapidly, such rules are hurting.
Many say the government's policies avoid not only social realities but
economic circumstances. They point out that even in affluent Singapore there
are many who need state help and welfare. Some families will not necessarily
be able to support ageing parents.
In future years Singapore's elderly population is likely to cause a few grey
hairs among the island republic's leadership.
An article on a proposed state pension scheme for Hong Kong appeared in the
Financial Times yesterday.

Portugal protested yesterday at an attack by Indonesian soldiers on a
student demonstration in the troubled island of East Timor and called for a
strong international response, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
'Portugal wants a strong international reaction to the events in the
territory,' the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Mr Jose Manuel Durao
Barroso, foreign minister, as saying. Lisbon felt obliged 'vehemently to
protest at the intolerable situation in East Timor,' he declared.
Up to 20 people were injured yesterday in clashes between student protesters
and the Indonesian security forces, the worst recorded confrontation in East
Timor since Indonesian troops opened fire on mourners for a pro-independence
activist in November 1991, killing up to 200 people.
An Indonesian military official in the East Timor capital Dili said two
students had been injured and 10 arrested as the security forces stopped
several hundred protesters marching from the university campus to the
regional parliament. But residents said about 20 people had been injured;
some reports said three people had been killed.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Nigerian court blocks bail for Abiola

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Moshood Abiola, the winner of an annulled Nigerian presidential election
last year, was refused bail yesterday on a technicality and faces trial for
treason on July 28, as oil workers rejected claims by the military
government that the strike which is bringing Lagos, the commercial capital,
to a standstill was easing.
The judge in a recently created High Court in the capital Abuja ruled out Mr
Abiola's bail request, which was made orally, as he said it should have been
in writing. Mr Abiola was arrested last month for declaring himself
president one year after his election victory was overturned.
The millionaire Mr Abiola, who looked sickly and frequently coughed in
court, complained about the poor cells in which he was being kept.
Oil workers on strike in southern Nigeria are protesting against the actions
of the military government, and are also critical of the state's lack of
investment in the oil industry. The main producers of Nigeria's output of up
to 2m barrels a day of crude oil say they are maintaining output but that,
without key staff, they are 'limping along'.
The government claimed yesterday that the key Warri branch of Pengassan, the
senior staff union, was ending its strike, although this was denied by
Pengassan's head office in Lagos. The strike has stopped the Warri terminal
producing natural gas for Nigeria's four thermal power stations in southern
Nigeria.
The plants have all stopped working and there is no mains electricity in the
south-west. Supplies of diesel in the region are also running out as
offices, factories and homes rely on back-up generators.
Filling stations are nearly all dry and fuel is selling with a mark up of
1,000 per cent on the black market. In northern and eastern Nigeria supplies
of fuel are normal but, although reaching Lagos harbour, the strike prevents
supplies being distributed into the city.
A split appears to have emerged between northern and southern members of
Pengassan. The Kaduna refinery in the north is not on strike but is not
receiving crude oil from Warri. At the country's main refinery in Port
Harcourt, workers of northern origin are considering staying at work while
those from the south propose to strike.
Two northern branches of the Nigeria Labour Congress ruled out a political
strike ahead of next Tuesday's vote by the executive of the congress on a
general strike in support of the oil workers.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A privately funded study of the United Nations and its agencies proposes
sweeping reforms to meet global problems that 'can no longer be neglected
without catastrophic consequences'.
The authors - former international civil servants with considerable
experience in the workings of the organisation - are Sir Brian Urquhart, a
British war hero who was the UN's first employee in 1945, and Mr Erskine
Childers, grandson of a former Irish president and an authority on third
world development problems.
In their report, financed jointly by the Ford Foundation and the Dag
Hammerskjold Foundation of Sweden, they state that as the UN nears its 50th
anniversary next year there is mounting concern about its ability to remain
an effective mechanism for peace and security in an increasingly complex
world.
The authors recommend radical reforms in the International Monetary Fund,
created by the Bretton Woods conference held 50 years ago this month. Third
world nations have long criticised the Fund and the World Bank and the
report notes that, despite or because of these institutions, 20 per cent of
the global population still holds 80 per cent of world wealth.
Sir Brian and Mr Childers call for a UN monetary, financial and trade
conference to develop an equitably governed, low-interest capital lending
facility, and an equitably governed monetary fund working with a similarly
governed universal trade organisation.
They also see a need for a single UN development authority consolidating all
present UN development funds, and a consolidation of now-scattered UN relief
operations.
Another proposal is for the establishment of a UN humanitarian security
police force. Critics have accused the world body of allowing politics to
influence too many decisions relating to human rights and humanitarian
affairs.
The report calls for an inter-governmental consultative board for the UN
system as a whole, an executive committee comprising the secretary-general
and heads of specialised agencies, and a new documentation office
responsible for creative management of economic and social reports.
The financially strapped world body could operate more efficiently from a
single headquarters, the report advises. This need not be in New York or
Geneva, although Sir Brian told correspondents at a briefing that he
believed keeping New York as the centre would maintain the interest and
support of the US.
Germany is prepared to offer inducements to the UN to move many or all
operations to Bonn after the German capital transfers to Berlin, but so far
this has not been seriously considered by member states.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, had yet to study the report,
his spokesman said. The document is not the first such contribution by the
authors to debate about the shape and future of the UN. While their
expertise is widely respected, far-reaching proposals are likely to
encounter opposition in a body fundamentally averse to change.

<TEXT>
Mr Paul Mozer, former bond trader at the heart of the 1991 scandal that
rocked the Wall Street firm of Salomon Brothers, has agreed to pay Dollars
1.1m (Pounds 703,000) to settle government charges that while at Salomon he
submitted false bids in auctions of Treasury securities, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
He is also permanently barred from securities trading.
The settlement is the final chapter in a three-year saga which began when
Salomon admitted its bond trading desk had faked customers' bids in Treasury
auctions to bypass restrictions on the amount of new government bonds firms
were allowed to buy at auction.
Mr Mozer, who ran Salomon's government bond trading desk at the time, was
sentenced last year to four months in prison and fined Dollars 30,000.

Judge Stephen Breyer looks set to win Senate approval for his nomination to
the US Supreme Court, writes Ken Warn in Washington.
Mr Breyer was questioned behind closed doors yesterday by the Senate
judiciary committee, apparently without any issues that could damage his
nomination being raised.
Mr Breyer was questioned in open session earlier this week, during which he
trod warily on controversial issues such as abortion and the death penalty.
He told the committee that the Supreme Court had already decided abortion
was legal but refused to be drawn about how the law should be applied. The
death penalty was constitutional, he said.
Mr Breyer, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by President Clinton
to replace Justice Harry Blackmun.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Clinton tour shows US loss of direction

<TEXT>
There was a time when an American president could help his standing at home
by striding majestically across the world stage, basking in the adulation of
huge crowds from Berlin to Beijing.
But for President Bill Clinton, a weeklong trip across Europe has done
little to enhance his stature at home, while distracting him from pressing
domestic issues such as the devastating floods in Georgia or the critical
phase of his healthcare reform plans.
There is even a sneaking suspicion that his travels have not done him much
good abroad, either. Leaders of the other Group of Seven leading industrial
nations rebuffed Mr Clinton's principal initiative at their Naples summit, a
last-minute proposal for new trade liberalisation talks. President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia publicly upbraided him for blocking Russian exports and
flatly contradicted him on the issue of getting Russian troops out of
Estonia. And the crowds that greeted him in Riga, Warsaw and Berlin were at
best politely enthusiastic, not the cheering multitudes that greeted his
predecessors in the days when the Iron Curtain still stood.
Even as he travelled through Europe, Mr Clinton's time was taken up with two
outlaw nations thousands of miles away, Haiti and North Korea.
Mr Jim Hoagland, the Washington Post's foreign affairs commentator, calls it
'the disappearance of the American premium in international politics:' a
sense that foreign leaders - from the US's G7 partners to the Haitian
military junta - see little to lose in defying the US president and little
to gain in making him look good.
Much of this is unconnected to Mr Clinton's own standing. The collapse of
the Soviet Union and the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact have greatly
diminished the significance of the US's protection to its allies, while the
harsh realities of the transition to a market economy have made the American
grass seem much less green to the citizens of the former communist
countries.
But part is also linked to doubts over where exactly Mr Clinton and his
administration stand; over whether, if pushed far enough, there is a point
at which they will turn and fight.
European diplomats have been wondering, ever since the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation summit in Seattle last year, which way the American Janus is
facing: towards Asia or Europe. After Mr Clinton's third trip across the
Atlantic this year, the answer is towards Europe; and within Europe, towards
Germany.
In Bonn, Mr Clinton spoke of 'a common partnership that is unique now
because so many of our challenges are just to Germany's east.' The 'special
relationship' with the UK he consigned to the status of a nostalgic curio:
'Even though we fought two wars with them early in the last century it is
unique in ways that nothing can ever replace because we grew out of them.'
Clinton administration officials have developed a formula for describing the
significance they attach to each national or regional relationship: 'No
country/region is more important to us than ..'
This ever-changing focus has caused some of the US's closest allies to
wonder if the Administration has any priorities at all for deciding what is
truly important to it. The answer is not reassuring. 'We want it all,' said
a senior State Department official.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Multinational police force in line for Haiti
</HEADLINE>

   KINGSTON, WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
The White House yesterday announced that up to 12 nations had agreed to join
a US-led force to police Haiti in the event of ousted president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide being restored to power.
Indications of growing consensus on Haiti came as Mr Aristide demanded that
the international community take 'swift and definitive' action to remove the
republic's current military leadership.
Although he added that he was constitutionally prohibited from calling for
military intervention - a stance which has previously been seen as a
stumbling block to multilateral military action - his statement appeared to
be a veiled endorsement of a US invasion. President Bill Clinton has
repeatedly said that military intervention is an option in attempts to
restore democracy.
Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations, said that
Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname,
Belize, El Salvador and Honduras had agreed to participate in a multilateral
force.
According to Caribbean officials, in a series of meetings last week, Mr
William Gray, the US adviser on Haiti, and senior representatives of the US
National Security Council, the Defence Department and the US army, told
Caribbean leaders that the US would invade Haiti if the military regime had
not imploded within three weeks.
The Americans had said that the US would only take this course of action if
the United Nations Security Council judged it necessary
However, the US was 'alarmed' at the increase in refugees from Haiti over
the previous fortnight and had told Caribbean leaders that it felt the only
way to end the flow of boat people was to force the military to leave
office.
The US was willing to play a prominent role in a multilateral operation to
that end, Caribbean officials said.
However, congressional and administration officials in the US yesterday
insisted that only US forces would be used in the initial phases of an
invasion. The US military could later be reinforced and replaced by a
multinational peacekeeping team, US officials said.
Caribbean leaders confirmed that the US government wanted them, as Haiti's
neighbours, to contribute to an international military and police force,
which would maintain security and public order in the early days after Mr
Aristide's return.
Mr Christopher Thomas, acting secretary general of the Organisation of
American States, said in Washington that the OAS had been discussing a
multilateral 'reconstruction effort' that could include peacekeeping troops
which would move in after Mr Aristide's return.
Meanwhile, senior administration and Pentagon officials said that US forces
had rehearsed an emergency evacuation of civilians on the island of Great
Inagua, in the Bahamas, on Wednesday.
The operation was similar to the operation that would be used to rescue US
or other citizens from Haiti, they said.
The 400 US Marines who carried out the exercise are part of a force now
numbering 2,800, which is positioned off Haiti's coast.
Their mission is to evacuate the 5,000 US nationals in Haiti should their
lives be in danger.
The White House also expressed alarm yesterday over deteriorating human
rights conditions in Haiti.
As UN human rights observers left Haiti under orders from Lt Gen Raoul
Cedras, Haiti's de facto ruler, officials from the US embassy in Haiti were
investigating the deaths of 12 Haitian men whose bodies were found near the
Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.
The US state department issued a strong rebuke to the Haitian regime over
the killings.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Retail sales increase by 0.6% in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales increased 0.6 per cent between May and June after falling
for two consecutive months, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
The report follows other recent signs of renewed economic vigour, including
a 379,000 rise in non-farm payroll employment in June - far above Wall
Street projections.
The recovery in retail sales mainly reflected higher sales of motor
vehicles, which rose 1.5 per cent from May. Other strong sectors included
building materials, up 2.7 per cent, and department stores, up 1.8 per cent.
Overall, retail sales are running 6.6 per cent higher than in June last
year, before allowing for inflation of about 2.5 per cent.
Officials released revised figures for May showing a decline of 0.4 per cent
rather than 0.2 per cent as initially reported. Allowing for the weakness of
sales in April and May, analysts expect real consumer spending to grow at an
annual rate of little more than 1 per cent in the second quarter, sharply
down from 5.2 per cent in the first three months.
But strong growth in capital spending, a rebound in construction and a
rebuilding in corporate inventories are expected to compensate for weaker
consumer spending.
Most forecasters expect real economic growth at an annual rate of at least
3.5 per cent in the second quarter, and possibly significantly faster,
against 3 per cent in the first quarter.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Dollar continues its cautious recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its cautious recovery on foreign exchanges yesterday,
helped by supportive comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary.
Earlier in the day the US currency had been buoyed by wild rumours, later
denied by US defence officials, that the US had invaded Haiti. It also took
heart from firmer international bond markets.
'We're going to continue to be in accord with the Federal Reserve as far as
their objectives to see that we have sustained growth with low inflation,
and work toward a strong dollar,' Mr Bentsen told reporters.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5457 from DM1.5383 on Wednesday. It
finished at Y98.28 against the yen from Y98.155. During US trading it
touched DM1.5560 and Y98.65, before easing back.
Traders said the dollar's bounce back was being supported by technical
factors, but were not prepared to say that the recent bear trend had been
reversed.
Earlier the dollar had received some muted support from Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
the Bundesbank president. He told a lunch in Frankfurt that 'the world
economy has an interest in an internally and an externally stable dollar.'
He made clear, though, that 'the prime responsibility for the dollar's
strength lies in the US itself. The thesis current at the beginning of the
seventies - it's our currency but your problem - is clearly too
short-sighted,' he said.
The economic data that emerged in the US provided a confused message for the
dollar. June retail sales were in line with market expectations, and May
sales were revised down, providing no evidence that a Fed policy tightening
is required.
The White House mid-session budget review, however, said the economy was
approaching full capacity faster than expected.
More encouraging for the dollar was the recovery in US and European bond
markets. One of the factors behind D-Mark strength - and dollar weakness -
in recent months has been investors selling European bonds and putting the
receipts into D-Mark deposits. The recovery in bond markets suggests this
trend may be being reversed.
'If this is a turn in the bond markets it should be positive for the
dollar,' said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at the securities house
BZW in London. 'Anything that takes upward pressure off the D-Mark would
have to be good for the dollar.'
Dealers report that some investors are now starting to see good medium-term
value in the dollar at its current levels. But they warn that it may still
fall further against the yen, especially if the US continues its tough
attitude towards Japan on trade issues.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US under secretary of Commerce, said in Tokyo that
although the rhetoric had been 'toned down,' US strategy had not changed.
Mr Garten said 'significant obstacles' remained in the way of progress.

FT  15 JUL 94 / The New Economic Order: Mexican legal system puts progress
in fetters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is at least one point of agreement in Mexico for the governing party
and opposition, business organisations, foreign investors, and lawyers: the
country's competitiveness and economic progress is hindered by its slow,
outdated and often corrupt legal system.
The broad alliance in favour of legal reform reflects the dissatisfaction
with a judicial system that has hardly been touched by the economic and
social reforms of the past decade.
Mexico's judges are still largely subservient to the executive branch;
corruption is common; litigation is extraordinarily slow; and many important
commercial laws, dating back to the 1930s, are inadequate for today's
businesses.
In a recent report, the World Bank said the weakness of Mexico's legal
system was an 'important constraint to private-sector development'. The
unclear legal environment, added to the cost of capital, created uncertainty
and discriminated against small businesses, which are more vulnerable to
arbitrary legal decisions than large companies.
The system's poor reputation is believed to have reduced foreign investment,
especially in the agricultural sector, where commercial law is least
developed. 'There is a great deal of fear in many US businessmen's minds
about coming to Mexico,' says Mr Vincent Russo, deputy director of the
National Law Center for Inter-American Free Trade, which is looking at ways
of harmonising trade and investment laws in the Americas. 'Mexico's legal
system generates mistrust and scares people away.'
But any reform of the legal system is made more difficult by the fact that
the creation of an independent judiciary would reduce the power of the
ruling party. 'The basic problem is impunity and arbitrariness, which is a
result of a lack of democracy,' says Mr Santiago Creel, a prominent Mexico
City lawyer. 'Modernisation of the legal system depends on changing the
political system.'
Although Mexico's constitution upholds the judiciary's independence, in
practice judges are often answerable to the government. Given the
Institutional Revolutionary party's domination of Congress, the president
and governors can pick and dismiss federal and state judges almost as they
wish.
'It can be dangerous to fight in the courts against powerful political
interests,' says Mr Ernesto Ayala, a litigant with Bufete, Noriega and
Escobedo, a top law firm in Mexico City.
Partly thanks to the efforts of Mr Jorge Carpizo, the former
attorney-general who is now interior minister, several corruption cases
involving judges have come to light. Last year, Mr Carpizo's office ordered
the arrest of Mr Ernesto Diaz Infante, former Supreme Court Justice, for
allegedly taking a Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 329,000) bribe while in office
for arranging the release of a man convicted of raping and murdering a young
girl. Mr Diaz disappeared soon after his arrest was ordered.
While corruption is said to affect only a small minority of cases, the
resolution of disputes in Mexican courts is generally 'lengthy, costly and
unpredictable', according to the World Bank. Under Mexico's legal system,
almost every case in state courts can be appealed against in federal courts,
enabling parties to delay cases for years.
The World Bank reports: 'Deficiencies in the system of legal education and
training and a dearth in appropriate standards of professional ethics, have
left legal practitioners complacent and unprepared to meet the challenge of
their business clients competing in a global economy.'
The effect of unpredictability is that businesses often avoid signing
contracts with companies they do not know, to minimise the chance of landing
in court, according to a US lawyer who is studying the impact of Mexico's
legal system on the economy. This discriminates against new companies.
Commercial laws further discriminate against small businesses by making it
difficult to secure credit by pledging the lender movable property - such as
machinery - as a guarantee. In the US secured credit by some estimates
accounts for as much as 40 per cent of business loans. In Mexico companies
either have to mortgage land or houses when borrowing money, or pay high
rates of interest charged for unsecured credit.
'Mexico's small and medium-sized businesses are going to get killed as US
businesses come down with 10 per cent credit,' says Mr Russo. 'If the
government does not move on secured credit, Mexican businesses will be in
trouble.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / The new agenda - reform of civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin American Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last 10 years, the role of government in the economies of Latin
America has been in decline, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin American Editor.
As governments have privatised inefficient state industries and deregulated,
there has been strong emphasis on the importance of market mechanisms in
generating economic growth.
Although few can claim to have completed market reform, the pendulum already
seems to be swinging the other way - towards trying to improve the way that
governments function.
Studies of the successful Asian developing economies almost always underline
the constructive role of government - and in particular meritocratic
bureaucracies - in generating growth. However, because of the poor record of
Latin American governments, some economists believe the optimal size of the
state there is smaller than in Asia.
Some functions, however, are inevitably the state's responsibility - legal
systems and regulation of private utilities. In other activities - such as
social services - the market may have a role but the state's participation
is often essential.
Mr Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan minister and the chief economist at
the InterAmerican Development Bank in Washington, says: 'The agenda ahead is
highly concentrated on these institutional issues.'
He identifies one important problem seen all over the world but is
particularly acute in Latin America: the tendency of departments of
government to lose sight of their objectives. 'Institutions tend to fall
under the control of the producers, rather than the consumers.'
Bureaucracies tend to function for the benefit of those working inside them
and attempts to reform them are often thwarted by powerful public sector
unions.
Furthermore, government bureaucracies have been weakened by fiscal
stringency, another aspect of economic reform. This has reduced real wages
in the public sector and its ability to attract talent. 'It's not at all
clear whether significant progress has been made (in reforming
bureaucracies), though the problem may be less critical because their scope
to do harm has been reduced by the reforms,' he says.
Mr Andrew Nickson, a senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham with
direct experience of several Latin American bureaucracies, agrees that
bureaucratic capabilities in the region are very weak. Some governments,
encouraged by the IADB and the World Bank, are shedding large numbers of
civil servants - but there is little evidence that the capacity of remaining
civil servants is being improved.
Not only are wages low, but career possibilities of civil servants are
stunted. They can rarely move from one department to another (or from one
municipal or state government to another) because there are no uniform civil
service standards.
There are some reasons for optimism that the trend toward decentralising
government increases its accountability to the public. However, he says
'virtually every country pays lip service to the idea of a career-based
civil service, but the reality is very far from the rhetoric. I don't
honestly see very much change.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilians ready for 'battle of the big dogs'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shot after shot failed to pierce Sweden's armour. But then the smallest man
on the field rose above it all to head the goal that nudged Brazil into
Sunday's World Cup final against Italy.
A header by Romario in the 80th minute of Brazil's semi-final against Sweden
in Los Angeles gave them a 1-0 victory and a chance to erase the
disappointments of the last five World Cups.
Earlier, Italy beat Bulgaria 2-1 in New Jersey in the other semi-final,
thanks to two inspired goals in quick order by Roberto Baggio.
'I haven't made many of those,' said Romario later, recalling the perfect
downwards-headed goal that dashed Sweden's hopes. 'I can probably count them
all on the fingers of one hand.'
The 5ft 6in Brazilian striker was the most visible man on the field all
afternoon, but for 79 minutes the spotlight shone cruelly on the goals he
was missing - including an open net in the 25th minute.
Branco fed Romario at the edge of the penalty area, where he split two
defenders and then fooled Ravelli, the eccentric but resourceful Swedish
goalkeeper. But the striker pushed the ball a shade too wide. When he
regained possession, Romario hit a weak shot that Andersson, the Swedish
full-back, zoomed in to clear off the line.
'I'm still trying to figure out where that guy came from,' said Romario.
However, the game was not as close as the score indicated. In the view of
most neutrals, Brazil overwhelmed their opponents.
'Technically, tactically and physically we controlled the whole game,'
Carlos Alberto Parreira, Brazil's coach, said, relieved that criticisms of
their scrappy style and lack of menace in the earlier stages of the
tournament had been deflected if not silenced.
'We took the initiative from the beginning, and 1-0 doesn't (reflect)
Brazil's supremacy. The only difficulty was putting the ball in the goal.'
Brazil repelled the Swedes with outstanding defence - a word not always
associated with the heights of Brazilian art-house soccer. But Romario had
said before the game that Brazil were at present playing 'modern and
efficient' soccer that might not be pretty but was at least producing
success.
Having studied the Swedes closely, Brazil shut them down. There always
seemed to be swarms of Brazilian blue shirts surrounding every white Swedish
jersey.
'We annulled their air game, and that is the only way they know how to
play,' Brazilian 'keeper Taffarel said.
But the Brazilian front-line missed chance after chance. Zinho fluffed an
excellent opportunity in the 13th minute. Romario fed Bebeto on the left,
who one-touched it to Zinho racing in uncovered, but he shot into the side
netting.
Then Andersson denied Romario. 'I'm here to make goals and to miss them,'
the Brazilian reflected. 'I prefer to talk about the ones that go in.'
Seven minutes after that, Romario blew another one. Bebeto streaked up the
left on a counter-attack and fed Romario in the middle, a play they had
rehearsed all week in training. But Romario stepped on the ball, stumbled
and managed only a weak shot that Ravelli knocked away.
Brazil out-shot Sweden 15-1 in the first half and 26-3 overall.
Brazil's victory means that the winner of Sunday's final in Los Angeles  -
'a battle of big dogs,' according to Brazilian mid-fielder Mazinho - will
become the first four-time winner of the World Cup.
The last time Italy and Brazil met in the final - in Mexico City in 1970 -
Pele led an inspired Brazilian team to a 4-1 win.
Brazil probably benefited from a day's more rest than Sweden, after the
quarter-finals. 'We had too short a time to reload our batteries after
running them down against Romania last Sunday. We did not come up to the
same class as we did before,' said Swedish coach Tommy Svensson.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: More important than matters of life and death
 -Political unrest, civil war and economic hardship are simply minor
irritations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best way to get applauded on the streets of Haiti is to wear a Brazilian
football shirt. Haiti's team are so bad they were kept out of the World Cup
by Bermuda, so the whole country supports Brazil.
'You are asking which is more important - Brazil or a US invasion?' one fan
asked an American reporter. 'We are hungry every day. We have problems every
day. The Americans talk about invading every day. But we only have the World
Cup every four years.'
During the World Cup, economic sanctions against Haiti have failed to bite
and talks between government and opposition were out of the question. At
half-time during matches, Haiti's black-and white TV sets show bloody videos
of the US invasion of Panama, with texts like No to Intervention
superimposed.
'This country is demobilised by the World Cup,' complains Haitian Prime
Minister Robert Malval. 'I think when we wake up on July 18 - that's the end
of the World Cup party. And that will be the beginning of the end of the
party here.'
This World Cup is having a bigger effect on countries' politics than any
previous World Cup. True, the Argentine junta used the 1978 World Cup much
as the Haitian junta is using this one, and West Germany's 1954 triumph did
more to restore German self-respect than Konrad Adenauer ever could.
Other examples abound. But this World Cup is more serious. For a start,
there are more TV sets in the world today than there were even four years
ago. The tournament is attracting vast audiences. The average human - a
Chinese peasant, Essex Man, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn - will probably have
watched six World Cup games by the end of Sunday's final.
Rwandans root for Nigeria, Bangladeshis for Maradona (they held protest
marches in Dhaka after he was banned for drug-taking), and no doubt the
Eskimos have their favourite team.
In 1950, famously, Britain learned by telegram that the US had beaten
England in Brazil, and even later things were not much better in Africa and
Asia. But telegrams do not tend to demobilise nations.
Second, in this lone superpower world, the World Cup is the one key arena
which the Americans do not dominate. One Mexican soccer-lover living in
Boston told me that he would prefer not to see football taking off in the
US.
The World Cup is the most direct way we have of ranking the nations of the
world - it is hard to compare GDPs in a way that is quite as visually
appealing - and the Americans' weakness at soccer leaves the field
relatively even.
Soccer can give a nation status. When we say 'Brazil beat Holland' we feel
we are talking not just about their soccer teams but about the countries
themselves.
'In the World Cup, all we lost is two games. We didn't lose our national
honour,' a Colombian state governor tried to argue a few days ago. He was
standing beside the coffin of Andres Escobar, the Colombian player (and
own-goal scorer) slain on his return home.
Whereas in the past most countries were dictatorships propped up by the US
or USSR, now dozens are (or are becoming) democracies. Nicolae Ceaucescu and
Todor Zhivkov did not worry about public opinion, and in the 1980s nor did
African leaders.
Now the Cameroonian president, Paul Biya, is so worried that for two World
Cups in a row he has recalled the middle-aged Roger Milla to the team (what
will he do in 1998, when Milla is 46?).
Ethnic tension rises, and rulers look to the World Cup to foster unity.
General Sani Abacha likes the Nigerian team to include players from each of
the country's three main tribes, and after Romania beat Argentina, President
Ion Iliescu said the ethnically diverse team had created a 'national
consensus.' (That was before the ethnic Serb Belodedici missed the decisive
penalty in the quarter-final).
The US squad, which contains Hispanics, blacks, Italian- and Greek-Americans
 -precious few Wasps - received a call from President Clinton that was shown
on prime-time TV.
Democratic rulers everywhere are struggling, and they all turn to the World
Cup. In Italy, where soccer is perhaps the least tarnished national
institution of the moment, Silvio Berlusconi got himself elected prime
minister with a party named after a football chant.
In Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, presidents have appeared on TV during the
World Cup to suggest changes to the national team's line-up. Even in Norway,
Prime Minister Gro Brundtland appeared on a TV panel commenting on the
country's opening game.
Countries that need the World Cup most were only admitted to it quite
recently. Fifa, soccer's governing body, first gave Africa a World Cup berth
in 1970; only this year did the continent get three places. Asia, with more
than half the world's population, for long had only one spot, and still has
only two.
And the poor are improving. African teams regularly reach the second round.
The Third World cares: when Egypt drew with Holland in 1990, soldiers of all
factions in Beirut spent the night firing into the air. When England beat
Cameroon a couple of weeks later, a Bangladeshi man had a heart attack and a
Bangladeshi woman killed herself. 'The elimination of Cameroon also means
the end of my life,' read her suicide note.
Americans are trying hard to understand. 'When Brazil lost in 1990 people
were jumping off buildings,' said US star striker Eric Wynalda. 'I don't
think anyone jumped off a building when Buffalo lost the Superbowl.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan warned on impasse - Deadlock in
trade talks could raise tensions in Washington

Trade negotiations between the US and Japan are in a worrying deadlock which
could lead to renewed tensions in Washington, a senior US trade official
warned yesterday.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,
indicated that bilateral negotiations aimed at increasing access to Japanese
markets have not made much headway and that unless there was visible
progress progress in the talks, frustration could mount in Washington.
'Progress is very slow. Most of the major problems are still in front of
us,' he said. Mr Garten yesterday took part in sub-cabinet level talks on
increasing foreign access to Japan's car and car parts markets, one of the
priority areas in the framework negotiations.
Since the trade talks resumed in May, the rhetoric has been toned down, Mr
Garten noted. But there was still 'significant difference in the perception
of whether or not there is an access problem.' The framework trade
negotiations, agreed between Japan and the US last summer, broke off in
February this year when the two sides could not agree on ways to measure
progress in opening Japan's markets.
Mr Garten cautioned that there was increasing frustration among the business
community in the US and that once legislation approving the Uruguay Round
agreement was passed, Congress would turn its attention to Japan.
'The concern is that just because we have been able to contain the tension.
. . this should not be seen as an indication that that is going to last for
a very long time.'
Meanwhile, the US is developing an export strategy for Japan 'above and
beyond the framework trade talks' which involves looking into ways the
government can help US companies win Japanese Overseas Development
Administration contracts and other projects such as the Nagano Olympics.
The Clinton administration is aiming to nearly double exports to Dollars
1,000bn by the year 2000 and one particular focus of this export strategy
will be the information technology sector, Mr Garten pointed out.
'This is the kind of area that the US and Japan can co-operate on, not just
in the US, not just in Japan but elsewhere. These kinds of issues will have
a major impact on US-Japan relations in the future.'

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Nippon Steel in US rail venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, has agreed to take a 10 per
cent equity stake in New CF&amp;I of the US, a subsidiary of Oregon Steel, and
provide its subsidiary, CF&amp;I, with the technology and facilities to
manufacture head-hardened rail.
The deal will enable Nippon Steel to overcome the adverse impact of the
yen's sharp rise against the dollar and to deflect US anti-dumping charges.
The arrangement will enable CF&amp;I to supply its customers in the railway
industry with a leading product.
The venture comes two years after CF&amp;I joined Bethlehem Steel in bringing
charges against Japanese steelmakers of dumping rail in the US. Those
charges were dismissed in June, 1992 by the US International Trade
Commission.
Head-hardened rail, which is longer lasting than ordinary rail, is expected
to see greater demand in the years ahead. However, most US steelmakers,
including CF&amp;I, do not have the technology to manufacture head-hardened
rail.
Nippon Steel said that the agreement would allow it to sell its product in
the US without having to worry about dumping charges. The yen's high
appreciation has meant that Japanese steelmakers exporting product to the US
will be forced to raise their prices significantly if they want to avoid
anti-dumping charges.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: China to import top-class films
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From OUR BEIJING CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday said it would allow its cinemas to screen newly-made foreign
films and to share profits with producers, but only about 10 'excellent' new
movies would be signed for screening each year.
'An end is in sight to the 40-year-old tradition of buying out-dated and
low-grade but cheap foreign movies,' said Chinafilm, the state monopoly film
importer.
'We are negotiating with world-renowned film corporations in the US and some
other countries, with which we had no contact before,' said China-film
spokesman Mr Wang Zengfu. He declined to identify the companies or the
profit-sharing arrangements.
The imports might include Oscar winners and other leading films, according
to the official Xinhua news service.
Mr Wang said the selected films for screening would 'reflect world
civilisation and modern achievements in film and art techniques'.
Up to now, Chinese television and cinemas have recycled classic films such
as The Sound of Music, Gone with the Wind and Roman Holiday. TV has often
shown soap operas, including Dynasty, and Beauty and the Beast.
After the 1989 crackdown on dissent culminated in the Tiananmen massacre,
cinemas were compelled to run communist propaganda films and were nearly
always empty apart from young couples using their free tickets as an
opportunity to cuddle in the dark.
In 1991, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan, a relatively
liberal senior leader, reversed the restrictions on films with no propaganda
value, and cinema managers looked forward to getting out of the red.
But China's film makers still have running battles with the censors and with
bureaucrats at state-owned movie studios. This has caused a shortage of
box-office hits, so that most of the country's 200,000 cinemas are still
losing money.
Many Chinese prefer to stay at home and watch one of the new rash of locally
made soaps or pirate videos. Most of the latter are dubbed or produced in
Taiwan and Hong Kong and many are lewd and violent, despite repeated police
crackdowns on both pornography and pirating.
In the past two years, foreign film makers undertaking joint productions in
China have had frequent clashes with censors. There are so many taboos that
it is hard to predict what kind of international hits might be allowed into
the country. Earlier this month China said it would impose new censorship
rules on imported films.
'The plan is aimed at expanding cultural exchanges, reviving the film
market, meeting the audience's needs and developing the national film
industry,' Mr Wang said.
Xinhua said western films were introduced in the 1960s but 'most of the
movies were second-rate or third-rate, usually seven or eight years old'.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: A North American storm in a cereal bowl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The much trumpeted virtues of integrating the North American market and
harmonising commercial systems in the US, Canada and Mexico are turning out
to be unproven in one sector at least - agriculture. The US and Canada are
again on the brink of trade war - this time over wheat - and Mexico has
launched countervailing duty investigations against wheat sales by both its
North American trading partners.
The US-Canada dispute could reach boiling point this summer if President
Bill Clinton decides to use his powers under Section 22, an obscure
provision of the US Farm Act of 1933, to impose tariffs or quotas on
Canadian wheat imports. If he acts, as recommended last week by Washington's
International Trade Commission, Canada will almost certainly retaliate with
restrictions on imports of a variety of US food and farm goods.
What would be even worse for trade liberalisation, the US and Canada could
settle their differences without sanctions by allowing each other to
continue the protection of favoured farm sectors - say US grain for Canadian
poultry, dairy and eggs.
Trade analysts say this chaotic state of affairs in the continent's newly
minted free trade area stems from state intrusion in agriculture and
differences in the nature of that intrusion. What the three North American
governments are doing is arguing over whose intrusion is the most damaging.
The US pays loans and subsidies which support domestic prices and export
subsidies which depress external prices. Canada has a Wheat Board, which
operates like a monopoly, and transportation subsidies. Mexico, now the
least protectionist of the three, pays income support to poor and
medium-sized farmers and plans to phase the payments out over the next 15
years.
President Clinton is not required to protect the US farm programme, except
that he has political dues to pay to northern plains senators and
congressmen. Once the ITC had given the administration its first legitimate
cause to act, Senator Max Baucus of Montana and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota
lost no time in reminding Mr Clinton that he had promised last November to
assist US wheat growers.
The impact of the dispute may be temporary. If, as expected, Congress
approves legislation to implement the hard-won Uruguay Round trade
agreement, trade barriers under Section 22 would become illegal. The Clinton
administration has sought sanctions against Canada under Article 28 of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but this would have to be approved
by Congress. The House Ways and Means committee has already turned its
thumbs down to the proposal.
In the meantime, the dispute could give US agriculture officials muscle to
negotiate reforms in Canada's grain marketing system. They want increased
transparency in the Wheat Board's export pricing policies - in fact, they
say the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement appears to require more transparency.
And, they argue, while Canada does not employ export subsidies, the Wheat
Board regularly undercuts the subsidised prices of their competitors. The
amount of bluster coming from both sides in the wheat dispute is surprising
given the relative insignificance of the size of the wheat trade between the
two countries.
Of the food-quality wheat that crossed the border, large quantities were
shipped back into Canada as part of the Dollars 77m pasta trade. In fact,
the flow of raw and processed agricultural products could, if left alone,
form a model for the Clinton administration's vision of the integrated North
American market.
Grain trade analysts view the wheat from Canada flow as a temporary
adjustment to a poor crop in the US last year, and expect the volume of
Canadian exports to ease of their own accord as the US feedgrain crop
normalises with this summer's harvest.
The 'dispute' they say, should be viewed in the context of politics between
Washington and the northern plains states and the complicated manoeuvrings
that are occuring as the world's largest grain producers jostle for position
in a post-Gatt world.
