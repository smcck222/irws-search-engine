FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan steps up foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Overseas investment by Taiwanese companies rose rapidly in the first half of
this year. The government approved Dollars 936.3m in investments by local
companies in countries other than China during the first six months of this
year, a 54 per cent jump from the Dollars 606.8m (Pounds 399m) recorded in
1993.
But January-June approvals for investment in China were sharply lower,
amounting to only Dollars 434.7m against Dollars 3.6bn for 1993, according
to the economic ministry's investment commission.
Analysts attributed the steep decline to China's economic clampdown imposed
last year and tensions generated by the March 31 killings of 24 Taiwanese on
a pleasure boat tour.
It was also noted that China had largely discarded the preferential
treatment accorded to Taiwan firms in the form of tax breaks and other
incentives.
Meanwhile, government-approved inward investment in the first half climbed
49 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 639.1m. The petrochemical, food
and services sectors recorded the largest gains.
Analysts cautioned that the outward investment figures were an indicator of
investment interest by private-sector Taiwan firms but were skewed because
they do not include the substantial offshore activities of state-run firms.
South-East Asian countries continued to be a magnet for Taiwanese cash, with
Malaysia topping the list at Dollars 101.5m, up from Dollars 42.2m during
the first six months of last year. The commission approved investments of
Dollars 39.1m in Thailand, versus Dollars 19.2m in 1993.
An important beneficiaries of Taiwanese investment is Europe, officials
said, via the British Virgin Islands, from which Taiwanese may invest in the
EC tax-free. Investment in the 'other areas' category hit Dollars 637.9m in
the first half, up from Dollars 120.9m in 1993.

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: President to see Canadian wheat
recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton today receives the International Trade
Commission's recommendations on Canadian wheat imports. Each commissioner
can produce his own solutions, and they could vary widely. Three of the six
members last week found that Canadian wheat imports had 'materially' injured
the US farm support programme. They could recommend import curbs through
either tariffs or quotas. The other three commissioners - two Republicans
and one Democrat - found only an 'adverse impact' on the US wheat programme
and could recommend only temporary measures.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Next stage of Russian asset sales blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian reformers will press President Boris Yeltsin to sign a decree giving
a legal base to the second, crucial phase of privatisation - after the state
duma, or lower house, refused to pass the government's privatisation bill by
a large majority on Wednesday night.
In the first phase, some 70 per cent of state enterprises were auctioned in
exchange for vouchers. Yesterday, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister
for privatisation, made clear he would push ahead with a second stage under
which the rest would be privatised for cash. 'The president must act,' he
said.
The government hopes that the industrial restructuring process, still in its
infancy, will take off in the second round, pushed by Russian - and to a
lesser extent foreign - investors seeking to make enterprises profitable and
competitive.
A long fight with parliament over such a key issue would be a severe setback
for a government pointing with increasing confidence to signs of recovery.
But the road still appears open for compromise, the more so since the bill
was not thrown out but referred to a commission for further work. Mr Sergei
Burkov, a centrist deputy who presented a report on the bill to the duma,
said that the programme would sell off state assets at an artificially low
price; that commercial banks had to be given greater rights to take part in
the privatisation process; and that closed joint stock societies, formed in
the early stages of privatisation to keep shares within a narrow circle,
usually of directors, should not be forced to open up.
Mr Chubais had earlier pressed for a decree to allow the privatisation
process to start, but had been turned down by President Yeltsin, who
insisted on the parliamentary route. A decree on this subject, where
parliament has clearly shown the wish at least to amend the legislation,
would raise the political temperature, which has so far been mild.
A meeting of government and deputies today, called to discuss economic
reform, will be told that tax collection for the first six months is running
at only a little over 60 per cent of the estimated level and that inflation,
down to 4 per cent in June, will surge to around 10-11 per cent in August
because of the payment of delayed salaries.

Greek Transport Minister Theodoros Pangalos warned summer travellers
yesterday that long delays at Athens airport would persist because of the
big seasonal increase in flights. The delays, often of two to four hours,
are due to air traffic controllers' refusal to work overtime, an inadequate
radar system and a 30 per cent increase in flights during the summer. Mr
Pangalos wants a new radar system operational as soon as possible but ruled
out a wage increase. The Board of Airlines Representatives said: 'The
situation is a nightmare for tourists and threatens Greece's commercial
interests.'

Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, will not have to appear before the
country's highest court for questioning over a financial scandal, following
a vote in the Belgian parliament yesterday. The parliament voted to question
former deputy prime minister Mr Guy Coeme in the investigation. It is
alleged that a research company, Inusop, which conducted opinion polls for
the government, channelled taxpayers' money to political parties in the late
1980s. The vote followed a report by a parliamentary commission which said
there was enough evidence to justify Mr Coeme going before the court, but
said there were insufficient grounds for Mr Claes to appear.

European Commission officials responsible for European policy on culture and
the broadcasting industry yesterday distanced themselves from comments this
week that quotas designed to protect the European film and television
industry could soon become a thing of the past. Advisers to Mr Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, commissioner responsible for the audiovisual industry, are
irritated that Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the industry cabinet, raised
the prospect of technological changes in broadcasting making quotas
impractical. Mr Pinheiro insists that quotas - which require at least half
of all broadcasts shown on any channel to be European - will remain.
However, the Commission is looking at ways of altering the manner the quotas
are applied to reflect the development of specialised channels, such as a
Disney channel, where the current quota rules are completely impractical.

The European Commission is expected to propose this month that the European
Union draw up rules on concentrations of media ownership, a Commission
official said yesterday. National laws aimed at ensuring that newspapers and
television stations reflect diverse views differ widely, making it difficult
for companies to operate across borders, said Mr Paul Waterschoot of the
Commission's internal market division. European legislation would probably
choose to limit media ownership depending on the size of the audience rather
than on the number of publications or stations any one company owns. The
Commission decided the EU should act following consultations with industry,
national officials and others on a 'green paper' it issued in 1992, he said.

The Latvian coalition government is to resign because of the decision by the
Peasants' Union party, the smaller of the two coalition partners, to pull
out of the government. Mr Valdis Birkavs, announcing the decision on
television on Wednesday night, said however that his Latvian Path party
would be ready to form a new government with another coalition partner. The
Peasants' Union decision reflects growing tension over economic policy in
Latvia, and came after Mr Birkavs had refused the Peasants' Union request
for increased tariffs on imported foodstuffs.
The president and prime minister of Estonia yesterday issued a statement
welcoming the offer by Russian President Boris Yeltsin for talks - described
by Mr Yeltsin as a 'final effort' - on the withdrawal of Russian troops from
Estonia by August 31. Mr Yeltsin said at the Group of Seven summit in Naples
that he would not withdraw the troops unless Estonia guaranteed full civil
rights for the large ethnic Russian population. Estonia, along with Latvia,
has adopted a citizenship law which in practice restricts the numbers of
Russians able to take citizenship.

Hungary's new Socialist government yesterday opened the way for a 'historic
reconciliation' with Romania and Slovakia by offering to renounce formally
all territorial ambitions against them. Mr Gyula Horn, making his inaugural
speech to parliament as prime minister after winning May's elections,
announced that Budapest would begin treaty talks 'without delay' with
Bucharest and Bratislava. Mr Horn said Hungary was ready to enshrine in new
bilateral agreements a guarantee of the inviolability of borders upon which
Romania and Slovakia had insisted. He tied his concession to the
incorporation of a commitment on minority rights for the roughly 2m ethnic
Hungarians in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia. He has nevertheless abandoned
the position of the outgoing centre-right government, which ruled out the
revision of frontiers by force but refused to carve in stone a territorial
settlement it deemed unjust. In pointed contrast to a conservative
predecessor who called himself premier of all 15m Hungarians, within and
beyond the borders, Mr Horn said he was prime minister of Hungary's 10.5m
inhabitants alone. 'This government is the government of the citizens of
Hungary,' he declared. Tension however remains high in Cluj, capital of the
Romanian region of Transylvania, after nationalist mayor Mr Gheorge Funar
tried to remove a statue of King Matthias of medieval Hungary, which is a
central symbol of the city's ethnic Hungarians.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Santer set to clinch top job in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EU leaders look set today to name Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's prime
minister, as the new president of the European Commission in succession to
Mr Jacques Delors.
In spite of widespread concern in Brussels and among senior EU diplomats and
national officials that the Commission would be badly weakened after Mr
Delors' influential 10-year stewardship, Mr Santer appeared the only
candidate behind whom the 12 member states could unite.
However, in a development that raises the possibility of a setback at
today's special summit in Brussels, Denmark announced yesterday the rival
candidacy of Mr Poul Schluter, a former conservative prime minister. Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, declared Mr Schluter's candidacy
after meeting parliamentary leaders.
'The Danish government finds that Mr Schluter is the Danish candidate with
the best chances of getting the post,' he told Danish radio. 'It is too
early to say what the outcome of Friday's summit will be . . . but Mr
Schluter is Denmark's candidate.'
In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand predicted that today's summit would
agree on the Brussels succession, and stressed that the person must be
'someone who speaks French'. Mr Santer, 57, has led a Christian
Democrat-Socialist coalition in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg since 1984. He
speaks fluent French and German, as well as English.
The British government yesterday signalled strongly that it expected Mr
Santer to emerge as the consensus choice, although UK officials warned that
other candidates remained.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, refrained from naming Mr Santer during
Commons exchanges but said there was 'a substantial difference' between the
current candidates and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who
was vetoed by the UK at the Corfu summit.
Strong backing for Mr Santer emerged yesterday from Portugal. 'If the
candidature of the prime minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, is
confirmed, Portugal will approve it enthusiastically,' Mr Jose Manuel Durao
Barroso, the foreign minister, told reporters.
Last-minute consultations took place in Paris. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, Mr Mitterrand, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister,
Mr Dehaene and Mr Santer all attended Bastille Day celebrations.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Rise and fall of a house of cards: Emma Tucker on how the
carton-board price-fixers operated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towards the end of 1990, carton printers in the UK did not like what their
books were telling them.
The government may not have noticed it, but their own orders suggested the
economy was heading for a sharp downturn. To make matters worse, they were
sickened by the relentless rise in the price of the cardboard they relied on
to print the brand names of toothpaste, cereal, make-up and frozen foods.
Such increases in a dead market would hurt the industry badly.
A number decided to raise the matter with the British Printing Industries
Federation which represented many of the UK's carton printers. The BPIF,
suspicious that a price-fixing cartel was unjustly squeezing its members,
contacted counterparts in France and other European Union countries and the
following year, armed with information from across Europe, took the matter
to Brussels.
'It was a very unusual step,' says Mr Colin Stanley, BPIF director-general.
'Only once in 10 years have our members felt so concerned that they have
asked us to take up a matter with the Commission.'
It did not take long for Brussels to decide that an investigation was
necessary. On April 23-24 1991, 40 officials from the Commission and member
states staged simultaneous raids on carton-board producers across Europe.
Based on what they found, they constructed the case which on Tuesday
resulted in 19 producers receiving the biggest fines ever to be levied
against a price-fixing cartel in Europe. The fines, which must be paid
within the next three months, total Ecu132.15m (Pounds 104.27m), the largest
single penalty being Ecu22.75m.
The cartel was, as Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, described
it, both pernicious and sophisticated. But much of what the officials
uncovered was also laughable.
Under the aegis of an ostensibly legitimate association known as the Product
Group Paperboard, ringleaders of the 19 member cartel met 12 times a year
for 'social' meetings, most often in Zurich, but occasionally in Nice or
Barcelona, to lend credence to the idea of a 'social' gathering.
Fake minutes were drawn up to disguise the real business in hand - arranging
concerted price rises. But among the documents found during the raids were
personal notes showing exactly when price rises for carton-board would occur
in each member state and by how much.
These private notes were made in spite of a general understanding among the
cartel members that no incriminating evidence was to be kept. The
investigation thus uncovered a whole network of deception designed to ensure
that the cartel was never discovered. According to the Commission, at least
one company had confidently asked lawyers to carry out a 'dummy run' of a
Brussels investigation, after the initial complaint by the carton users
became known.
The key to the cartel's success lay in achieving a balance between the
supply of and demand for carton-board which enabled the concerted 'price
initiatives' to go through. The participants did this by agreeing a
carefully constructed market-sharing arrangement.
'They all realised that aggressive attempts to gain market share would
undermine their carefully orchestrated price initiatives,' said the
Commission. It also alleges that companies suspected of deviating from the
plan were required to explain themselves to the others, while laggards were
pressed into raising their prices to the agreed levels.
With the market-sharing arrangement in place, the cartel's members then
compared the state of their order books to judge when best to introduce a
price increase. Sometimes, the big producers agreed temporary plant
stoppages to keep production under control.
The 'price initiatives' which took place every six months were planned and
programmed in advance 'in the most explicit detail', says the Commission.
The increases were announced to customers and in the trade press with a
different company each time taking the lead, and the others following on
agreed dates.
The arrangement was not achieved overnight. According to the Commission, the
PG Paperboard, set up in 1981, had been attempting to regulate the market
for several years. It was only in 1986, following a reorganisation of its
structures, that the cartel began to operate more successfully.
At the top was a 'presidents' working group' of managing or commercial
directors who acted as the ringleaders and took the strategic decisions.
They were: Cascades of France, Finnboard of Finland, Mayr-Melnhof of
Austria, Thames Board (later part of the Swedish group MoDo), Sarrio (Spain
and Italy) and two Stora companies of Sweden.
The Commission's efforts to probe the cartel were boosted substantially by
Stora's decision to come clean. In August 1991, the Swedish management of
Stora informed Brussels that it accepted that several companies in the group
had been involved in a serious infringement of European competition laws.
Stora had recently taken over the German producer Feldmuhle, which had been
a ringleader.
The fines when they came were astronomical. Some of the companies involved -
those that still insist that the meetings of the producers were no more than
'social occasions' - are said to be considering an appeal. These companies -
Cascades, MoDo, Finland's Enso Gutzeit and Finnboard, Gruber &amp; Weber and
Laakmann of Germany, Mayr Melnhof of Austria, BPB De Eendracht of the
Netherlands and Sca Holdings of the UK  - faced bigger fines than the
others.
Perhaps wisely, the rest of the companies involved did not deny the
essential facts alleged against them.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Italian scandals inquiry team quits over government decree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The entire team of Milan magistrates largely responsible for bringing down
the post-war political system in Italy through their corruption
investigations resigned last night.
They did so in protest at a decree introduced by the government on Wednesday
reducing their powers to use preventive detention during their
investigations. Their action is the most serious challenge to the
two-month-old government on an issue which the administration has sought to
brush under the carpet.
In the lead of those resigning was Mr Antonio Di Pietro, rated in opinion
polls as one of Italy's most popular figures. He broke the original
corruption scandals in Milan and has been instrumental in bringing to
justice more than 300 businessmen and politicians on charges of corruption
and illegal financing of political parties.
It was not clear last night whether the magistrates' move - which could be
followed by similar resignations round the country - was simply designed to
put pressure on the government to change its mind. But in an emotional
statement last night Mr Di Pietro said he and his colleagues had asked to be
removed from all their current investigations because the legislation had
completely undermined their task and more than two years of patient
investigation.
The decree, with immediate effect, was intended to prevent abuses in the use
of imprisonment, which, the government claims, has been used widely to force
confessions.
But yesterday, the investigative magistrates insisted that imprisonment was
an essential means of ensuring that evidence was not tampered with and that
those under suspicion did not flee the country.
The decree limits the use of preventive detention to serious crimes and
excludes most of the cases under which businessmen and politicians have been
imprisoned during the recent scandals. Because of it, 44 people named in new
arrest warrants yesterday were all allowed to return to their homes, where
they face a form of house arrest.
Police yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of Mr Alberto Falck, the
chairman of Falck, Italy's biggest private steelmaker, and Mr Giuseppe
Tramontana, the managing director of La Rinascente, one of the country's
leading retail chains.
Arrest orders were also issued for the president of the Italian accountants'
federation, and executives from sectors as diverse as construction,
pharmaceuticals and funeral direction. Neither Falck nor La Rinascente
commented on the developments.
The Milan magistrates' inquiry - the latest in the two-year effort to
uncover corruption - has centred on Italy's Guardia di Finanza. Officers
co-operating with magistrates have alleged that large Italian companies
systematically bribed a unit assigned to investigate potential tax fraud by
businesses with turnover of more than L5bn (Pounds 2m) a year. Police
allegedly ignored accounting abuses and tax fraud after receiving kickbacks.
Italian companies caught up in corruption investigations since 1992 have
always claimed they were obliged to pay bribes to political parties because
it was the only way to do business under the corrupt old regime. If upheld,
the new charges would cast doubt on the claim that they were reluctant
parties to fraud.
Eight Guardia di Finanza officers are already under arrest, and warrants for
the arrest of six more were issued yesterday. Within the past week, two
others have committed suicide.

Dutch unemployment fell for the third consecutive month in June, confirming
a trend that emerged earlier in the second quarter after nearly two years of
increase. The central statistical office said yesterday that an average of
461,000 people were registered as unemployed in April-June, down from an
average 483,000 in the previous three-month rolling period of March-May and
500,000 in February-April. The figures, which are not corrected for seasonal
factors and are based on a narrow definition of registered joblessness, are
equivalent to an unemployment rate of 7.2 per cent. Despite the
month-to-month decline, registered unemployment in April-June was still
higher than a year earlier, when 394,000 people were unemployed and the
jobless rate stood at 6.2 per cent.
Norway's trade surplus widened to NKr5.54bn (Pounds 521m) in June from
NKr4.88bn in May and NKr4.98bn in the same month last year, the central
bureau of statistics said.
German company insolvencies rose by 18.8 per cent in April against the same
period last year. 1,234 companies became insolvent in April 1994, bringing
the total to 4,894 in the first quarter. The figure for the first quarter
rose by 22.4 per cent against last year.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Tietmeyer sees need for dollar stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An excessive fall in the US dollar is damaging for everybody, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday in a statement of
support for the US currency.
'The world economy has an interest in an internally and externally stable
dollar,' said yesterday in Frankfurt at a lunch held by the American Chamber
of Commerce.
The dollar, meanwhile, continued its cautious recovery on foreign exchanges
yesterday, helped by supportive comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary.
Mr Tietmeyer said the strengthening of the D-Mark against the US currency
this year was in part due to overreaction in financial markets, as well as
overdone fear of new inflation in the US. 'Unfortunately now and then there
are exaggerated developments in the foreign exchange markets, as seems to be
the case now with the dollar,' he said.
Although economists believe that a cut in short-term German interest rates -
particularly if coupled with an increase in US rates - would take the
pressure off the US economy, Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday: 'The prime
responsibility for the dollar's strength lies in the US itself.
'The thesis current at the beginning of the seventies - it's our currency
but your problem - is clearly too short-sighted. It didn't do the US much
good at the time either.'
He welcome the commitment of Mr Bentsen to a stronger dollar, as well as the
conclusion of G7 ministers at Naples that a further weakening would be
neither desirable nor justified.
He said that as yet the economic recovery in Europe had not been endangered
as a result of currency developments, and that in fact the latest
developments helped to hold costs down. Further export growth was dependent
on a lasting worldwide recovery, for which a central precondition was
lasting price stability, in the US as elsewhere.
He said a return to fixed interest rate systems would not work, nor would a
move to 'target zones' for currencies. Long-term fixed exchange rates could
only work with convergence of economic conditions, he argued, 'and at the
moment we are a long way from that - at least worldwide'.
Reviewing recent German interest rate policy, Mr Tietmeyer said the
Bundesbank had not given way to pressure for a forced, aggressive sinking of
interest rates. This would have had a negative impact in the markets.

FT  15 JUL 94 / 'It's an industry that likes to get together'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allegations that 19 European carton-board makers operated a cartel for four
years came as little surprise to some industry watchers yesterday who
described the operators as 'quite clubby'.
'It's an industry that likes to get together. They're always holding
conferences, and although they stress they don't want to talk about prices,
maybe they decided they wanted to go further,' said Mr Dennis Christy, pulp
and paper analyst at James Capel in London.
The European Commission has alleged that carton-board makers managed to push
through price rises of 6-10 per cent twice a year from 1987 to 1990 in spite
of consumer resistance and falling costs of raw materials. During the four
years, carton-board consumption in western Europe increased by almost 20 per
cent.
Mr Christy said the operation of a cartel could explain the continuation of
high price levels in the sector when other parts of the industry were
suffering a downturn. Prices for other products in the industry, such as
pulp and high quality paper, peaked in 1989. But carton-board prices did not
reach their highs until two years later.
Printers, among of the main users of carton-board - a stiff card-like
product used for making cardboard boxes and for graphics purposes -
complained to the Commission about pricing in the Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn)
industry. The British Printing Industries Federation, which recently
complained to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the operation of a cartel
in the paper market following recent sharp rises in price, yesterday
welcomed the Commission's report.
The European Union uses 3m tonnes of carton-board a year of which a third is
imported from Finland, Sweden and Austria.
Carton-board makers are at the mercy of wide swings in price for their raw
materials, which are chiefly wood pulp and waste paper but in the period
when the cartel was alleged to have operated, raw materials costs were low.
This year, pulp prices have risen by 50 per cent, squeezing some companies'
profit margins since they are finding it hard to pass on increases to
customers.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Arrest warrants issued for leading Italian businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   MILAN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian police yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of the chairman of
Falck, Italy's biggest private steelmaker, and the managing director of La
Rinascente, one of the country's leading retail chains, as Milan magistrates
deepened their investigation into bribes allegedly paid by big business to
anti-fraud police.
More than 40 arrests were ordered yesterday, the day after the Italian
government approved a controversial decree to limit the use of arrests in
the investigative process. Magistrates joined a chorus of protests from
left-wing opposition parties yesterday against the government move.
As well as Mr Alberto Falck, who has headed the steel company since 1982,
and Mr Giuseppe Tramontana of La Rinascente, orders for arrest were also
issued for the president of the Italian accountants' federation, and
executives from sectors as diverse as construction, pharmaceuticals and
funeral direction. Neither Falck nor La Rinascente commented on the
developments.
The Milan magistrates' inquiry - latest in the two-year effort to uncover
corruption - centres on Italy's Guardia di Finanza. Officers co-operating
with magistrates have alleged that large Italian companies systematically
bribed a unit assigned to investigate potential tax fraud by businesses with
turnover of more than L5bn (Pounds 2m) a year. Police supposedly ignored
accounting abuses and tax fraud after receiving kickbacks.
Italian companies caught up in corruption investigations since 1992 have
always claimed they were obliged to pay bribes to political parties because
it was the only way to do business under the corrupt old regime. If upheld,
the new charges will cast serious doubt on the claim that they were
reluctant parties to fraud.
Eight Guardia di Finanza officers are already under arrest, and warrants for
the arrest of six more were issued yesterday. Within the past week, two
others have committed suicide, including a general in Trieste, who shot
himself on Wednesday, even though he was apparently not yet on the
investigation list.
The Guardia di Finanza is still one of the main tools used by magistrates to
pursue investigations, and has an important role in tracking down drug
trafficking and money laundering. Yesterday's arrests were carried out by
specially selected members of the unit, and magistrates and members of the
government have made a point of expressing their confidence in the Guardia
to avoid a further decline in morale.
Meanwhile, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left yesterday
called for an urgent Senate debate of the measures unveiled by Mr Alfredo
Biondi, the justice minister, late on Wednesday night. According to Mr
Biondi, the government is trying to stop abuse of preventive arrests by
strictly limiting the occasions on which this measure can be applied to
those suspected of having committed a crime.
Magistrates have made extensive use of arrest and imprisonment to ensure
evidence is not tampered with and to prevent those under investigation from
fleeing the country. However, there has been public concern that these
powers have been distorted to force confessions. Often people appeared to
have been detained in prison only for as long as they had not confessed. It
was also used as a form of public humiliation.
The new legislation - in the form of a decree with immediate effect - means
that imprisonment would be reserved for more serious crimes like
drugs-trafficking and membership of a criminal organisation.

<TEXT>
European Commission officials responsible for European policy on culture and
the broadcasting industry yesterday distanced themselves from comments this
week that quotas designed to protect the European film and television
industry could soon become a thing of the past. Advisers to Mr Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, commissioner responsible for the audiovisual industry, are
irritated that Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the industry cabinet, raised
the prospect of technological changes in broadcasting making quotas
impractical. Mr Pinheiro insists that quotas - which require at least half
of all broadcasts shown on any channel to be European - will remain.
However, the commission is looking at ways of altering the way the quotas
are applied to reflect the development of specialised channels, such as a
Disney channel, where the current quota rules are completely impractical.
One possibility under consideration is to stipulate that broadcasters in
Europe invest a certain amount of their profits in the European industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is expected to propose this month that the European
Union draw up rules on concentrations of media ownership, a Commission
official said yesterday. National laws aimed at ensuring that newspapers and
television stations reflect diverse views differ widely, making it difficult
for companies to operate across borders, said Mr Paul Waterschoot of the
Commission's internal market division. European legislation would probably
choose to limit media ownership depending on the size of the audience rather
than on the number of publications or stations any one company owns. The
Commission decided the EU should act following consultations with industry,
national officials and others on a 'green paper' it issued in 1992, he said.
The decision should please a group of industry executives who submitted a
report to EU leaders last month on ways to promote pan-European 'information
highways'. The report highlighted media ownership as a critical issue,
saying divergent national rules were a 'patchwork of inconsistency' that led
to fragmented markets.

Hungary's new Socialist government yesterday opened the way for a
'historical reconciliation' with Romania and Slovakia by offering to
renounce formally all territorial ambitions against them. Mr Gyula Horn,
making his inaugural speech to parliament as prime minister after winning
May's elections, announced that Budapest would begin treaty talks 'without
delay' with Bucharest and Bratislava. Mr Horn said Hungary was ready to
enshrine in new bilateral agreements a guarantee of the inviolability of
borders upon which Romania and Slovakia had insisted. He tied his concession
to the incorporation of a commitment on minority rights for the roughly 2m
ethnic Hungarians in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia. He has nevertheless
abandoned the position of the outgoing centre-right government, which ruled
out the revision of frontiers by force but refused to carve in stone a
territorial settlement it deemed unjust. In pointed contrast to a
conservative predecessor who called himself premier of all 15m Hungarians,
within and beyond the borders, Mr Horn said he was prime minister of
Hungary's 10.5m inhabitants alone. 'This government is the government of the
citizens of Hungary,' he declared. Tension however remains high in Cluj,
capital of the Romanian region of Transylvania, after nationalist mayor Mr
Gheorge Funar tried to remove a statue of King Matthias of medieval Hungary,
which is a central symbol of the city's ethnic Hungarians.
Budapest's gestures have been welcomed by Bucharest and Bratislava and make
rapprochement more likely than at any time in the past four years of
tortured relations. A settlement will complete two missing links in the
network of bilateral agreements which have woven together central Europe's
security system since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Waigel wants to limit jobless benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will today present a budget to
the cabinet calling for a strict time-limit on the payment of unemployment
benefit, and a freeze on the government's net borrowing requirement.
The DM485bn (Pounds 195.5bn) budget for 1995 represents a growth rate of
just 1 per cent over the current DM480bn spending, thanks to drastic savings
enforced on most government departments.
The net borrowing requirement will be limited to DM68.7bn, compared with
DM69.1bn this year, but the figures were instantly condemned as a
'deliberate deception' by the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition.
Mr Waigel's latest assault on the cost of unemployment benefit has been
rumoured for weeks, and seems certain to unleash a furious political debate
in the run-up to the October general election.
In the 1994 budget he reduced unemployment benefit for childless workers
from 63 to 60 per cent of previous net earnings for initial benefits,
followed by a reduced rate of 53 per cent for the long-term unemployed
forever.
It is that reduced rate which Mr Waigel now proposes to limit to two years.
After that, the long-term unemployed will be reduced to subsistence-related
social assistance, resulting in a net saving, in a full year, of DM6.5bn.
The move was condemned yesterday by Mr Helmut Wieczoreck, the budget
spokesman for the SPD, as 'daylight robbery of the unemployed and the local
authorities'. He said it would make no difference to overall public
spending, because it simply shifted the burden of support from
federally-financed unemployment benefit to local government-financed social
assistance.
The net borrowing requirement has been kept below this year's DM69bn, in
spite of soaring debt servicing costs, by assuming privatisation revenues
from the sale of Lufthansa, the national airline, of a net DM1.5bn, and of
the Rhine-Main-Danube canal company of DM800m. A further DM5bn will come
from the assets of the former East German central bank.
A second way of keeping the 1995 borrowing requirement down is to bring
forward payments of Germany's oil tax on big companies from February 1996 to
December 1995, topping up Mr Waigel's tax revenues by DM2.6bn.
The spending plans show that the cost of servicing the soaring federal
government debt - which assumes the debts of the Treuhand privatisation
agency in eastern Germany from next year - will rise by 38 per cent to
DM92.6bn. The Finance Ministry's own budget, which will have to take on
continuing running costs of the Treuhand, will more than double, from
DM5.8bn to almost DM12bn.
In contrast, the Economics Ministry, which pays industrial subsidies and for
trade promotion, will see its budget cut by 14.5 per cent. The defence
budget, the largest single item at DM47.9bn, has been kept to a growth rate
of just 1.4 per cent.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Tesco offer for Wm Low may spark rival bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK's second largest supermarket chain, yesterday made a
recommended offer for William Low, the struggling Scottish retail food
group, in a deal worth Pounds 200m.
But J. Sainsbury, Tesco's bigger rival, signalled later yesterday that it
was considering its options, raising the prospect of a takeover battle for
the Scottish chain. Both Tesco and Sainsbury are keen to expand in Scotland.
Tesco is offering Pounds 154m in cash for the share capital of William Low
and would assume debt of just over Pounds 50m. The deal was unanimously
recommended by the William Low board.
Sainsbury entered the picture when it told Reuters: 'William Low is
something we have looked at before. It is an obvious candidate for takeover
and has been for some time. As a result of this morning's takeover news we
are reviewing the situation.'
Sainsbury later told the Stock Exchange that it was requesting information
from William Low and was considering its position.
Analysts said it would be out of character for Sainsbury to become involved
in a hostile takeover battle, particularly since the Tesco bid has the
backing of the William Low board.
Sainsbury has only four outlets north of the border - three supermarkets and
one hypermarket. Tesco said its 16 Scottish stores would be a good strategic
fit with William Low's 45 outlets in Scotland and 12 in the north of
England.
Strong competition from discount retailers and larger food chains has cut
William Low's profit margins, and its sales are currently 5 per cent below
last year's levels.
Tesco said there would be few, if any, immediate closures of William Low
stores. But it would be necessary to integrate the management and support
services provided by just over 300 people working at the company's Dundee
head office into Tesco's administration.
'Accordingly, there may be a significant number of job lossesif the head
office were to close,' Tesco said.
Tesco added it would offer relocation opportunities and give generous
redundancy terms if the takeover went ahead.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, the Scot who is chairman of Tesco, said the deal would be
good for shareholders of both groups.
The William Low outlets would be renamed Tesco, but he said an effort would
be made to develop a distinctive Scottish identity - perhaps using a Tesco
Scotland brand.
The group would spend Pounds 35m on rebranding the existing William Low
stores and introducing its own-label products. Tesco said its prices were on
average 5 per cent lower than William Low's, thanks partly to the economies
of scale achievable by the bigger group.
Tesco is offering 225p in cash for each William Low ordinary share and
105.5p for each convertible preference share.
There is a full share alternative, worth 236p per ordinary share at last
night's close.
William Low's shares rose by 67p to 236p, while Tesco's shares closed 10 1/2
p higher at 232 1/2 p. Tesco is advised by BZW and William Low by Barings.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Rifkind cuts 18,000 defence jobs: RAF faces heaviest
personnel losses - Blow softened by weapons orders for Pounds 5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, BERNARD GRAY and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 18,000 British defence jobs are to be cut, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
UK defence secretary, said yesterday, but he softened the blow by announcing
orders for new weapons worth about Pounds 5bn.
His announcement, which drew angry protests from opposition parties and
trade unions, marked the conclusion of an eight-month study designed to cut
Pounds 750m from the annual defence budget from 1997 onwards.
Mr Rifkind told the Commons the cost-saving drive would make no difference
to Britain's fighting strength and the money saved would enable some
upgrading of capacity. The heaviest job losses will be in the Royal Air
Force which will lose 7,500 personnel, while another 7,100 civilian jobs are
to go.
To offset the job losses, Mr Rifkind announced firm orders for Pounds 2.4bn
tenders for additional hardware worth a similar amount.
'The orders will preserve and enhance our fighting strength and help sustain
over 10,000 jobs,' Mr Rifkind said. 'Our plans for the armed forces reflect
the challenges we are likely to face. We are determined to maintain that
position and not drop our guard.'
Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, rejected the contention that
fighting strength was unimpaired. He said that in the event of war 'today's
short-term financial savings could cost British lives'.
Mr Rifkind announced orders for seven new minehunters for the Royal Navy,
259 Challenger-2 tanks for the army and a substantial upgrading of 142
Tornado aircraft in service with the RAF.
Further orders will follow, including two new Royal Marine assault ships to
replace HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, a further batch of three Type 23
frigates and up to six Trafalgar class nuclear submarines. The MoD also
confirmed that the royal dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth are to be
privatised.
Several smaller RAF stations, including RAF Pitreavie in Fife, Scampton in
Lincolnshire and Finningley in Yorkshire are to close, but the naval base at
Rosyth is to remain open with a reduced role.
Its ships are to be assigned to Faslane on the Clyde and Portsmouth in
Hampshire, and 700 jobs will be lost at the base with an additional 1,500
naval personnel moved elsewhere. Some 900 jobs will remain.
The cuts go to the highest level in the forces with some 20 military and
civil service posts of the rank of major general or above being abolished.
At the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London, a further 1,500 jobs are
to go and two buildings are to close.
Some 500 jobs will go at the defence procurement executive in Bristol.
Logistic support is being rationalised with the closure of 17 stores and the
loss of 1,500 jobs.
Many of the orders spelt out yesterday had been expected for some time.
However, Mr Rifkind made a surprise announcement that, in the light of
experience in the Gulf war, the UK would be ordering laser-guided Paveway 3
bombs from the US manufacturer Texas Instruments.
It was also opening negotiations with the US government to buy the Tomahawk
cruise missile. These 'smart' munitions proved particularly effective in the
Gulf.
Mr Rifkind also announced that a frigate and a submarine which were
previously to have been mothballed would be retained in active service.
A joint service rapid deployment force, including paratroopers, marines and
RAF aircraft, is to be formed.
Several new institutions to be used by all three services will replace
single-service facilities.
Senior officers had apparently opposed the emphasis on tri-service
operations, but ministers regarded it as an important change.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Dollar hopes lifted as Washington sees rates rising to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration signalled yesterday that it expects a further
significant tightening of US monetary policy, with short-term interest rates
averaging about 5 per cent next year. Short-term rates are currently 4.25
per cent.
Higher rates would help bolster the dollar on foreign exchange markets and
prevent the US economy from growing too fast and hitting constraints on
production capacity.
The dollar continued its cautious recovery yesterday, helped by comments
from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. It closed in London at
DM1.5457 from DM1.5383 on Wednesday, and at Y98.28 from Y98.155. In late
trading in New York, it was at DM1.5547 and Y98.55. The dollar's rally
helped US share prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 34.97
at 3,739.25.
In its economic projections for its 'mid-session' budget review, the US
administration assumes that interest rates on three-month treasury bills
will average 4.7 per cent next year. This implies that it expects the
Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to have raised the key federal funds
rate to about 5 per cent.
The Fed has raised short-term rates four times this year to 4.25 per cent
against 3 per cent in early February. Next Wednesday Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, may provide clues to his monetary plans when he delivers his
main twice-yearly monetary testimony to Congress.
The White House also claimed credit for a rapid reduction in the federal
budget deficit, projecting a shortfall of Dollars 167.1bn in the fiscal year
beginning this October, against a projection of Dollars 301.8bn before
enactment of last year's deficit-cutting measures.
As a proportion of gross domestic product, the deficit is projected to fall
from 4 per cent in fiscal 1993 to 3.3 per cent this year and then to
stabilise at about 2.4 per cent of GDP.
The administration's interest rate projections are sharply higher than those
in its February budget when it projected a Treasury bill rate of 3.8 per
cent in 1995. The White House also concedes that bond yields will remain
higher than earlier projected. It expects yields on 10-year Treasury bonds
to average 7 per cent next year rather than 5.8 per cent.
Since the economy is near full employment, this means the administration
does not expect to reduce the structural deficit below about 2.5 per cent of
GDP.
White House growth and inflation projections are little changed. As in
February, it expects economic growth to slow from 3 per cent this year to
2.7 per cent next year and 2.5 per cent later in the decade.
Inflation is expected to rise gradually from 2.9 per cent this year to 3.2
per cent next year and 3.4 per cent by 1997. The unemployment rate is
projected to stabilise at just above 6 per cent rather than decline to 5.5
per cent as previously projected.

FT  15 JUL 94 / RMT strike action set to escalate in rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive of the RMT transport union last night decided to step up the
railways signalling staff dispute.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the executive was calling
signalmen out on strike from noon on July 26 until noon on July 28 - in
effect disrupting the network over three working days.
This action will be followed by a further 24-hour strike from noon on August
3. The RMT said that it planned further action in the week starting August 7
which would hit commuters on two days. Details will be announced nearer the
time.
Railtrack's personnel director, Mr David Armstrong, said the escalation was
'vicious' and would have a 'devastating' effect on the railway industry. He
accused RMT of being 'intent only on causing the maximum disruption and
distress to the travelling public'.
Next Wednesday's 24-hour strike will go ahead as planned.
By moving the starting time of the strikes from midnight to noon the RMT
executive believes greater disruption will be caused.
In a further escalation, the union's executive also agreed to ballot its
supervisory and management members employed at Railtrack to join the
industrial action in support of the signalling staff. Postal votes will go
out today to the members concerned. If they vote in support, they could be
involved in the increasingly bitter industrial conflict by the middle of
next month.
The union repeated its readiness to negotiate on a restructuring package for
signalling staff but only when Railtrack had agreed on an interim payment
for past productivity performance.
The 4,600 signalmen have been offered a 2.5 per cent rise, plus measures to
be negotiated, involving job evaluation, a new salary structure and flexible
working arrangements. The union wants an 11 per cent 'interim' rise for the
railwaymen before entering negotiations on a new pay system.
Railtrack insists that any increase above 2.5 per cent must come through a
negotiated package of restructuring measures including job evaluation, more
flexible hours and changes in working conditions.
Last month Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, admitted he had warned
Railtrack's management not to breach the government's public sector pay bill
freeze. His admission followed the withdrawal of a negotiating 'proposal' by
Railtrack to award signalling staff a 5.7 per cent rise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India and the US yesterday signed a series of agreements to establish
long-term technical co-operation programmes in the fields of power
generation and sustainable energy development.
Eleven new private sector ventures between Indian and American companies to
build energy projects in India were also signed.
The agreements result from a nine-day visit to New Delhi by Ms Hazel
O'Leary, the US secretary of energy, who led 40 US companies on the first
cabinet level visit to India in 20 years.
Ms O'Leary's mission follows closely on the heels of Indian prime minister
PV Narasimha Rao's visit to Washington, a visit hailed by both sides as the
'beginning of a new era' of trade and diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
On the commercial side, the visit resulted in agreements between Solec
International of California and Pentafour Solec Technology of India for
low-cost photo-voltaic technology, Spectrum Technologies, USA, Elgin
National Industries and Spectrum Washeries India, and Jaya Foods to apply
advanced US coal-washing technologies to India's high-ash coals, targeting a
Dollars 1bn coal washing market.
The US will also assist India in the oil and natural gas sector, in the
fields of advanced exploration, production, and upgrading technology
transfer.
The World Bank and several other donors have urged India to accelerate its
infrastructural development to enable the success of its reform programme.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan resists demands to lift capital
controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan has balked at US demands that it lift controls on capital movement
and foreign investment in the domestic stock market as a condition for the
island's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the country's Central Bank of China, was
quoted yesterday as saying that to do so would be to allow the US to dictate
Taiwan's monetary policy. Because Taiwan is not a member of the
International Monetary Fund, it is required to sign a special exchange pact
in order to join Gatt.
But Taiwan views some of the terms of a financial services agreement which
it must sign with the US to gain US support for the Gatt bid as
'unreasonable', the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported. Taiwan
officials were in Washington last week to discuss the agreement, but refused
to concede to US demands.
Taiwan is widening market access to foreign banks to enhance its Gatt
application and further its professed aim of becoming a regional financial
centre, according to Mr Liang, who took up his post last month.
Soon, non-resident foreigners will be allowed to open local-currency bank
accounts. Rules limiting foreign banks from accepting more than 15 times
their capital in deposits will be relaxed or abolished. And restrictions on
the number and location of branches foreign banks may open are to be eased.
'We're not allowing foreign banks to do everything, but we are making it
easier for them to get a licence and open offshore banking units,' Mr Liang
said.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Austria poll set for October 9

<TEXT>
The Austrian government has called general elections for October 9 and
European elections will be held early next year, after Austria's January
1995 admission to the European Union, interior ministry officials said
yesterday. Austria's coalition government, led by Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky's Social Democrats (SPOe) with their junior partner, the
conservative People's Party (OeVP), was successful in securing a Yes vote in
the referendum on EU membership in June, but the SPOe had fared badly in
regional elections in March. Austria's far right Freedom Party (FPOe), led
by Jorg Haider and one of the parties opposing EU membership, retained
suport at regional elections, and Mr Haider has claimed that those who voted
No in the referendum will support him in October. The Social Democratic
party has ruled alone or in coalition since the early 1970s, and analysts
argue that the SPOe coalition is likely to hold on after the election.

FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAA strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airports operator BAA cheered the market with better than expected traffic
figures for the month of June.
The shares jumped 20 to 948p, on trade of 1.7m after the figures revealed a
9.1 per cent year-on-year increase in passengers handled. UBS reiterated its
buy recommendation on the stock boosting sentiment further. The shares have
been a strong performer since last week's favourable figures from British
Airways.
The news from BAA also encouraged buying of British Airways and the shares
finished 10 ahead at 426p, with volume reaching 3.3m by the close.
Oil shares continued to make good progress as prices responded to the recent
upsurge in crude oil prices as a result of the Nigerian oil workers strike.
BP was the favourite stock of mant institutional fund managers to
participate in the oil price rise, with dealers pointing to the stock's high
gearing to rising prices. At the close BP shares were 11 better at 395 1/2 p
after relatively heavy turnover of 12m. And there was evidence that some US
fund managers had moved to buy back some stock after the recent surge of
selling from across the Atlantic.
Shell, on the other hand, underformed BP as some institutions remained
concerned about the group's sizeable interests in Nigeria. Shell shares
settled 6 1/2 firmer at 701p.
Exploration and production stocks, which have tended to lag the majors, made
rapid progress led by Enterprise which put on 11 to 421p and Lasmo 4 better
at 140p.
Better than anticipated figures from tour operator Owners Abroad and an
upbeat results statement helped the shares gain 6 to 99p. The group reported
a loss of Pounds 13.8m, against a loss of Pounds 17.4m a year earlier and
better than the market's worst fears. Sentiment in Owners spread to
Airtours, where the shares hardened 2 to 462p. Solid demand for Rank
Organisation ahead of today's interim figures saw the shares appreciate 14
1/2 to 391 1/2 p. Speculation that Thorn EMI may make an announcement on its
demerger plans at tomorrow's annual meeting was heard in the market. The
shares gained 12 to 1074p.
Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries jumped 15 to 425p in
response to positive figures from US rival Philip Morris. Also, the group's
proposed acquisition of the American Tobacco Company division of American
Brands was cleared by the UK Trade and Industry Secretary.
Food and detergent group Unilever was one of the few fallers in the market
as what one trader described as a 'technical situation' overhung the stock.
The shares were also suffering from a recent sector review by Smith New
Court which restated the analysts' bearish view on the stock. They closed 3
down at 990p.
Great Universal Stores added a further 13 at 587p as share buy back
speculation reached fever pitch ahead of the figures today. Last year the
company announced that its was enfranchising its shares and investors are
increasingly hungry for good news this year. The market expects a full-year
profit of Pounds 517m against Pounds 475m last year.
SmithKline Beecham recovered 10 to 398p in the 'A's as the recent 9m share
bought deal was finally said to have been carried out. Dealers said Smith
New Court had taken the stock on at 397p and placed it at 398p. Smith was
also said to have been actively on the bid in the pharmaceutical sector and
SmithKline rival Wellcome rallied from early pre-results weakness to close 4
up at 604p after being 6 lower,while Zeneca lifted 6 1/2 to 746 1/2 p.
Recent weakness in the dollar plus the sale of a 2 per cent block of Willis
Corroon and a broker downgrade in Sedgwick continued to drive the insurance
brokers lower. Willis settled 3 off at 134p and Sedgwick 7 lower at 157p.
The regional electricity stocks shrugged aside press criticism and made good
progress as income funds moved in to buy the sector.
Eastern was one of the sector's best performers climbing 19 to 616p, as was
East Midlands, up 23 at 605p. Southern jumped 17 to 601p.
Bank shares mirrored the market's surge with HSBC, also stimulated by a
strong rise by the Hong Kong market, jumping 21 to 687p. NatWest, now very
much in favour with a number of influential UK funds, moved up 11 to 445p.
Royal Bank of Scotland remained a poor performer after the recent stake
sale, the shares easing 2 to 402p.

FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Steel doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in British Steel rose to 22m, making it the day's most heavily
traded stock, after NatWest Securities, a long- time bear of the shares,
announced a substantial upgrade in its profits forecast. The shares put on 3
1/2 to 155p.
The securities house, which met British Steel executives on Monday, raised
current year profits estimate by Pounds 130m to Pounds 400m. It said the
move took account of changing currency forecasts, and expected rises in
product prices in the second half of the year.
However, there was little change in NatWest's general caution on the British
Steel and it continued to advise investors to 'reduce holdings.' Analysts at
the broker said: 'Even on this new forecast, it remains an overvalued
cyclical.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portfolio worries hit Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Glaxo the leading UK pharmaceuticals group, were dragged lower in
afternoon trading in London when US investors sold heavily on worries over
suspected losses on the company's Pounds 2.2bn investment portfolio. The
company is believed to have lost at least Pounds 100m.
Later, it emerged that Glaxo had disbanded its in-house investment arm,
which is based in Bermuda, and had already started to liquidate an
unspecified portion of its investments prior to appointing a new fund
manager. The company refused to say how much of its Pounds 1.7bn internal
portfolio it was selling. But a spokesman commented; 'we are selling some of
the investment as a pre-requisite to handing over because new fund managers
tend to prefer cash.'
The company added that, following an internal investigation, it had decided
to hive off its investment arm because, 'Glaxo's business is pharmaceuticals
and not financial investment.' It refused to name the choice of fund
manager. Early indications were that the portfolio might be spread among
several institutions.
The shares were 11 higher at their peak but US selling outweighed continued
institutional buying in the UK and took the price back to 1 1/2 up at 551p
on turnover of 6.9m.

FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie recaptures 3,000 mark in good
volume - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest official statistics on domestic inflation and employment found a
very positive response in the UK stock market yesterday. The FT-SE Index
rose by more than 40 points to close convincingly above the 3,000 mark which
has proved a barrier since the middle of last month. Reports that
continental European funds had been buyers of shares in London were borne
out by an increase of around one fifth in trading volume.
After breaking though the Footsie 3,000 mark in early trading, the market
remained firm behind a positive British government bonds sector. The final
reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,005.5 for a net gain on the day of 41.4.
The lead came from a powerful recovery in the stock index futures sector,
depressed on the previous day by a heavy sell-off by a US fund. After
struggling for several sessions, the September contract on the Footsie moved
up to a significant premium against the cash market yesterday morning and
held solidly above 3,000 until the close.
A steadier trend in the US dollar set the stage for market recoveries across
Europe. London sloughed off a bout of nervousness in mid-afternoon when
rumours circulated in Europe that the Federal Reserve might, after all, be
about to raise rates in the US.
But the very slight increase in US June consumer prices was in line with
expectations, and the bout of nerves appeared to reflect nothing more than
the Fed's failure to supply liquidity at its traditional time for
intervention. Today brings the latest US retail sales data which will
provide the latest focus for caution in European securities markets.
Share prices opened higher, in line with firmness in the US dollar and other
European bond and stock markets. But the chief boost to UK equities came
from the release of the day's batch of domestic economic data at
mid-morning. Steady headline inflation of 2.6 per cent for June, with the
underlying rate 0.1 per cent easier, steady underlying wage inflation of
3.75 per cent and a fall in unemployment in May, underpinned the market's
most optimistic scenario of economic growth and subdued inflation.
The influence of the futures market could be seen in the pattern of trading.
Of total Seaq volume of 720.8m shares, around 50 per cent was in the
Footsie-listed shares, a higher proportion than usual and an indication of
substantial activity in the blue chip stocks which make up the Footsie
contract.
However, the second line stocks were sufficiently active to lift the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index by 27.8 to 3,493.7. On Tuesday, retail or customer business
was worth Pounds 1.19bn, confirming the return to levels of turnover
associated with the long-running bull market in London.
Increasing reports that international funds may be moving out of
dollar-based securities and towards European bonds, with UK gilts in
particular favour, gained some credence yesterday from the strong
performance of the London market. Late trading saw bond markets ease back
from the day's highs, however.
Some nervousness was again expressed regarding the powerful influence
exerted by the futures markets, but it is now widely recognised that the
stock index futures are the conventional route by which international funds
seek to change their asset stance in global markets and that the London
futures market has established itself as an important stage for these
operations.

FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed above the 3,000 level for the first time in
nearly a month as favourable figures on inflation triggered buying by
European and US institutions, writes Joel Kibazo.
At the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,015, up 45
on its previous close, at a strong premium to cash and some 7 points above
its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume was an Average
15,610 lots.
Earlier, the contract had opened firmly at 2,985 which was the first sign
that a positive session lay ahead. The UK figures on inflation and
unemployment encouraged buying by the large institutions. Dealers suggested
that one of Tuesday's main US sellers had turned a big buyer.
September reached its peak of 3,030 over lunch before a bout of nervous
selling, ahead of Wall Street's opening brought a brief retreat. This proved
short lived and buyers for September were seen once again. The contract
maintained a strong premium to cash through out the session which at the
day's best stretched to 20 points.
In traded options, most of the sector's activity was centred on the index
options. Total volume was 31,343 of which the FT-SE 100 option traded 12,012
and the Euro FT-SE option 10,096. Argyll Group was the busiest stock option
at 1,097 lots.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Collection of factors combine
to lift Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Reassuring news on inflation, a modest rebound in the dollar and news of
another bid for the QVC television shopping group lifted US share prices
across the board for much of yesterday, though prices eventually ended
little changed on the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.62 up at 3704.28, having shown
double-digit gains through the morning. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was also slightly firmer, up 0.78 at 448.73, while the American
Stock Exchange composite was up 2.23 at 427.73 and the Nasdaq composite up
9.76 at 719.35. Trading volume stood at 265,000 shares.
Share prices firmed from the opening, helped by news that the consumer price
index had risen by only 0.3 per cent last month. Although the CPI number was
not as positive as the report on the producer prices index, which was flat
last month, it was in line with expectations, and reassured investors who
had been worried that strong second quarter economic growth might have fed
through into higher prices. Also, taken together, the June inflation data
was unlikely to prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates
again.
Consequently, stocks posted solid gains in early trading, rising by more
than 20 points at one stage. Equities received no help from bonds, which
ignored the good inflation news. By late in the day, the 30-year bond was
barely changed, yielding 7.67 per cent.
A modest rally in the dollar, which rebounded a yen to Y98.35 and more than
a pfennig to DM1.5422, did help stock market sentiment, however. Later in
the day, blue chip prices gave up most of their gains on a lack of
follow-through buying.
Nasdaq stocks outperformed other sectors of the market thanks to strong
technology stocks, and news of a rival bid for QVC. Last week the home
shopping television group announced that it was merging with CBS, the
broadcast television network. Late on Tuesday night, however, Comcast, the
big telecommunications group which owns 15.4 per cent of QVC, launched a
counter bid worth Dollars 2.2bn.
The rival offer immediately persuaded CBS to abandon its merger plans, which
did not deter investors from buying QVC in the hope that the stock's price
would be driven higher by new bids for the company. By the close, QVC was up
Dollars 6 at Dollars 42 in volume of 7.3m shares. Comcast, which is also
traded on the Nasdaq market, was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 15 1/8 in
volume of 7.4m shares.
On the New York SE, CBS shares were also higher, up Dollars 8 at Dollars
308, although the rise in the stock had less to do with the news of its
failed merger with QVC and more to do with the company's plans, announced
yesterday, to buy in 3.5m of its own shares and split the stock
five-for-one.
Hilton Hotels rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 after reporting second
quarter profits of Dollars 33.9m, up 26 per cent from a year ago.
Among higher Nasdaq technology stocks, Intel was up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars
61 3/4 , Cisco Systems Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 24, Lotus Development
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 40 1/2 , and Oracle Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars
39 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto posted a small gain in dull dealings. The TSE-300 composite index
gained 8.83 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 4,140.55, as advances were led
declines by 371 to 336. Volume rose to 56.15m shares compared with 43.91m on
Tuesday.
Despite the overall market gain, just five of the 14 sub-indices ended
higher, including industrial products with a 1.71 per cent index gain.
Energy was up slightly, consumer products and mining were flat. Financial
services was a bit lower and golds fell 0.85 per cent.
Newbridge Networks continued its sharp climb, rising 2 3/8 to 59 7/8 . The
company late Monday announced a buy-back of up to 4m shares, and was up 2
7/8 yesterday.
Mexico
Mexican stocks closed lower after an apathetic session, affected by an
increase in domestic interest rates. The IPC index of 37 leading shares
closed 23.31 points lower at 2,264.97, a drop of 1.02 per cent.
'The market is still dead as far as volume is concerned,' one analyst said.
'The increase in domestic interest rates may well be the most influential
factor, since a rise was expected but nothing so big or so across the
board,' a trader added.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei makes its first
gain in six sessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an interest rate rise in the US at the end of this week encouraged
some brokers, and the Nikkei average gained ground for the first time in six
trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 index gained 139.93 to 20,540.41 after a low of 20,368.77 and a peak
of 20,558.81. Consumer spending-linked shares were popular, reflecting the
recent rise in consumption due to income tax cuts and the hot summer
weather, but large capital stocks were hit by profit taking.
Volume totalled 320m shares against 303m. Buying orders placed at low levels
by life insurers and brokers supported investor confidence but some foreign
securities houses took profits. Individuals were also reported to be picking
up some speculative favourites.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.38 to 1,654.53 while the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.34 to 300.81. Advances led declines by 606 to 358 with
228 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index unchanged at 1,340.01.
Traders said that the rebound of the dollar from record lows against the yen
supported sentiment. Speculation that the US Federal Reserave Board may act
to prevent a further plunge also encouraged some investors.
Stocks linked to Vietnamese oil development were actively traded on
Mitsubishi Oil's discovery of its second oil well off the coast of Vietnam,
earlier this week. Mitsubishi Oil was the most actively traded issue of the
day, but closed unchanged at Y1,200 on profit-taking in the afternoon
session.
Japan Energy, which is also drilling for oil in Vietnam, rose Y1 to Y492 and
trading houses involved in similar ventures advanced.
Koatsu Gas Kogyo, a leading industrial gas producer, was actively bought on
rumours that the company has received a patent for a process in the
manufacture of a special carbon. The stock gained Y65 to Y795 in spite of
later denials by the company.
High-technology stocks were lower on the yen's recent rise. Hitachi fell Y10
to Y1,010 and Toshiba lost Y9 to Y780.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 44.68 to 22,955.83 in volume of 29.4m shares.
Retail-linked shares gained ground, with the mens' suits retailer, Aoki
International, rising Y230 to Y2,850 and Aoyama Shoji gaining Y190 to
Y4,180.
Roundup
The strong performance seen in Hong Kong provided a fillip elsewhere in the
region.
HONG KONG rose another 2.8 per cent, taking the Hang Seng index above 8,800
at the close in a continued sharp technical rebound as bargain hunters swept
back into the market.
The index rose 237.46 to 8,828.91 in turnover that swelled to HKDollars
3.9bn from Tuesday's final tally of HKDollars 2.6bn. In subsequent London
trading, the indicative index put on a further 67 to 8,896.
Mr Nicholas Knight at Nomura commented that taken in isolation, the market's
two day rise of 5.2 per cent looked impressive.
However, he cautioned that in the wider context of the negative impact on
valuations of rising interest rates, it looked somewhat of a swan-song. 'The
slow slide in the market now looks destined to accelerate with third quarter
1993 levels looking the most obvious downside target'.
Previously hard-hit property stocks led the rally for a second day. Cheung
Kong rose HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 34.10, Henderson Land added HKDollars
2.70 to HKDollars 37 and New World jumped HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 22.50.
SINGAPORE closed higher on demand from foreign funds for blue chips, and the
Straits Times Industrials index rose 24.58 to 2,183.93. Commercial property
stocks led the return of institutional buying in the wake of a pick up in
commercial property rentals.
KUALA LUMPUR was again encouraged by hopes of an early general election and
the composite index put on 3.95 to 989.57. SYDNEY displayed renewed
confidence although brokers warned that the positive sentiment was fragile
ahead of the release of yesterday's US inflation data.
The All Ordinaries index closed 5.7 points stronger at 1,978.6, after a
day's high off 1,985.1.
WELLINGTON saw demand for forest sector stocks and the NZSE-40 capital index
gained 15.73 to 1,970.52.
MANILA was weighed down by the continuing slide in PLDT although some
second-line issues firmed.
The composite index fell to 22.56 to 2,510.76, prompted mainly by PLDT's
Dollars 1 1/4 drop to Dollars 52 5/8 in New York. The stock's local price
fell 25 pesos to the year's low of 1,400 pesos.
SEOUL was flat after renewed interest in financials and some smaller
capitalised shares was eroded by profit-taking. The composite stock index
added 1.38 points to 961.97.
BOMBAY ended slightly higher as volumes fell sharply due to thin attendance
on the trading floor after many employees were late arriving for work after
monsoon rains threw suburban train services out of gear. The BSE 30 share
index rose 2.45 to 4,131.52.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies from emerging markets have been turning increasingly this year to
issuing ADR's in the US, according to Citibank.
India has led the way, with 18 companies having launched ADR programmes so
far in 1994, followed by Hong Kong with 10, and Brazil and Mexico with nine.
Citibank comments that the total dollar trading volume for the instruments -
a certificate issued to facilitate trading in overseas stocks - reached
Dollars 135bn in the first half, up 60 per cent from first half 1993.
Other emerging market countries which have issued ADRs this year include
China, Korea, Ghana, Hungary, Turkey, Chile and Peru. Mr David Boyle,
managing director, says that the strong growth seen in ADR trading is 'being
fuelled not only by investors attracted to the higher potential returns for
overseas equities over the long term, but also because there is now greater
emphasis on diversifying portfolios internationally.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends mixed in slow trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African shares ended mixed after struggling for direction in a slow
trading session.
The failure of the bullion price to move forward also contributed to the
general lack of movement, brokers commented, although firmer London and US
markets lent support.
The overall index added 17 to 5,471, the industrial index 12 to 6,266 and
the gold index lost 6 to 2,105.
Among the day's main movers Anglos improved R1.40 to R225, De Beers made
R1.50 to R107 and Gencor added 15 cents to R12.
Pick n Pay lost further ground as strike action hit its stores, shedding 50
cents to R12.75. Iscor added 10 cents to R3.70, Sasol continued to move
ahead adding 75 cents to R25.75 and Absa 15 cents to R9.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses reflect dollar, higher
oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar stabilised, but bourses were mixed, writes Our Markets Staff.
Oils were strong as the commodity price reflected a strike by Nigerial oil
unions.
FRANKFURT sold the 'Big Three' chemical stocks as the Dax index rose 5.95 to
2,054.00 in turnover down from DM6.4bn to DM5.4bn. BASF, Bayer and Hoechst
fell by DM6.70 to DM291, DM5.20 to DM337.80, and DM3 to DM310 respectively,
on the weakness of the dollar against the D-Mark this year.
Mr Albert Richards, chemicals analyst at CS First Boston in London,
acknowledged that, with chemicals priced in global terms, the present
currency relationships meant a less competitive European chemicals industry
and a more competitive one in the US.
However, he said, when the dollar settles this will provide a nice buying
opportunity. 'Past periods of dollar weakness were accompanied by periods of
overcapacity in the US, bringing significant pressure to bear on European
pricing,' he explained. 'The US, now, does not have that much spare
capacity.'
AMSTERDAM notched up a gain although the market stayed volatile ahead of
futures and options expiry tomorrow. The AEX index improved 3.10 to 386.31,
recapturing most of Tuesday's losses.
Royal Dutch rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 186.80. Oce van der Grinten, up Fl 2.00 at Fl
76.00, attracted an upgrade by James Capel earlier in the week which rated
the stock a buy opportunity. Capel said that fourth quarter 1994 and 1995
profits growth should be in the region of 20 per cent, placing the company's
shares at a 1995 multiple in line with the market.
PARIS built up a good rise on relatively thin turnover ahead of its holiday
today and tomorrow. The CAC-40 index gained 32.51 or 1.6 per cent to
1,974.59.
Oils were strong, helped by firmer crude prices. Elf Aquitaine rose FFr18.10
to FFr395, and Total FFr6.30 to FFr307.30.
ZURICH fell to its low for the year as Roche gave up 5.3 per cent in further
response to Tuesday's lower than expected first half sales. The SMI index
lost 33.5 or 1.3 per cent to 2,474.5 in higher volume as recently inactive
institutional investors turned sellers.
Roche dropped SFr300 to SFr5,400, taking the two day loss to 10 per cent,
the market unimpressed by yesterday's statement that first half financial
earnings improved. The weakness spilled over into other pharmaceuticals,
Ciba registered falling SFr19 to SFr721, while Sandoz, reporting its own
first half sales figures today, saw its registered SFr11 lower at SFr650.
MILAN reversed its five-day slide as hopes grew that budget details would
finally emerge after last night's cabinet meeting. The Comit index picked up
9.25 to 687.35 as the market was also encouraged by a forecast from the Isco
research group that the public sector deficit next year could be smaller
than feared.
Industrials were among the better performers with Pirelli rising L114 or 4.5
per cent to L2,643 in response to recent positive analysts' notes. Fiat was
L96 higher at L6,585.
Telecommunications, which had been one of the biggest sufferers in the
recent retreat, also rose strongly with Stet adding L188 or 3.6 per cent to
L5,312 and Sip putting on L122 or 3 per cent to L4,218.
MADRID extended its gains to a fifth day, the general index closing 2.68
higher at 301.40 in turnover of Pta32bn. Endesa was the most active stock as
it rose Pta110 to Pta5,800. However, Repsol came back from a high of
Pta4,110 to close only Pta5 higher at Pta4,010 after Nymex oil prices turned
mixed in New York.
Nordic markets mostly had a good day, helped by the high-tech appeal of
Ericsson and Nokia in Sweden and Finland - after strong second quarter
results from Motorola in the US on Tuesday - and by higher oil prices in
Norway.
STOCKHOLM rose for the fifth consecutive session, Ericsson climbing SKr16,
or more than four per cent to SKr399, as the Affarsvarlden General index
closed 13.90 higher at 1,397.70. HELSINKI saw Nokia up another FM17 to Fm493
following continued gains for its American depositary shares in New York.
OSLO's all-share index climbed by 9.33 to 617.31 with Norsk Hydro NKr6
higher at NKr228.50 on oil prices, high aluminium prices and a decision to
lift magnesium production at Hydro's plant in Canada.
WARSAW was encouraged by Tuesday's advance through the 10,000 level, and the
Wig index put on another 804.7, or 7.8 per cent to 11,062.9. Turnover rose
by 35 per cent to 1,400bn zlotys.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Rumours boost dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours of a rise in US interest rates and ongoing fears of central bank
intervention yesterday helped the dollar bounce off recent lows, writes
Philip Gawith.
These factors overshadowed the release of US consumer inflation figures
which were in line with market forecasts - a 2.5 per cent year on year rise
to June. As with Monday's producer inflation figures, the market's initial
response was to sell the dollar as the figures did not seem to provide cause
for the Fed to tighten policy.
The dollar finished 1 1/2 pfennigs higher against the D-Mark in London at
DM1.5383 from DM1.5235. Against the yen it closed at Y98.155 from Y96.8050.
The dollar's bounce came amid evidence of increasing nervousness in the
market that the currency might be close to the bottom. Sentiment remains
negative, but investors are wary of being caught short.
The D-Mark turned in a mixed performance in Europe, amid evidence that
investors have used the currency's recent strength as an opportunity to take
profits. The Belgian franc finished unchanged at BFr20.61 against the D-Mark
after the central bank cut its central rate to 4.90 per cent from 4.95 per
cent.
This brought Belgian rates in line with German rates following a two basis
point cut in the German repo rate to 4.91 per cent.
The good inflation data in the US released yesterday and on Tuesday did not
deter markets from working themselves into a frenzied lather of expectation
about the Fed raising rates. Initial rumours involved a 50 basis point rise
in the discount and Fed funds rates. The size of the likely increase later
grew to 100 basis point.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said the relatively modest
bounce in the currency suggested the market was not altogether convinced by
the rumours.
But Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said the
bounce 'shows the market is slightly nervous about these levels. The lower
we get, the more nervous the market gets.'
Mr Cocker said there had been reasonable buying from a wide variety of
sources, but underlying sentiment remained deeply negative towards the
dollar. He said the dollar was enjoying a 'corrective rally' rather than a
sustainable upward move.
The Chemical analyst said the further rumour that the Fed was taking prices
'added to the sense in the market that the Fed is keen to stabilise the
dollar now.' He said the rate of decline in the dollar on Tuesday had been
approaching levels which central banks might have considered inappropriate.
The German newspaper Handelsblatt, meanwhile, reported that 'sources in the
US president's delegation let it be known on Tuesday that a consensus had
been in Naples to accept a dollar level of Y96.98 or DM1.50 and (only) to
intervene heavily below this level.'
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said the sober performance
in recent days of the D-Mark, against European crosses, was a 'possible
early indicator that the bear market in Dollars /DM may have been overdone.'
He said the 9 per cent fall in the dollar since the beginning of June was
difficult to understand since all the explanations put forward - such as a
large trade deficit and adverse capital flows - had been present all along.
Mr Luxton said that if the Fed were to raise rates now, against a benign
inflation background, this would be very well received by the market. It
would show that the Fed was responding pro-actively to inflation - the
market has worried that it has fallen 'behind the game' - and that it was
not bowing to the Clinton White House which has made clear that it does not
feel rates need to rise.
Short sterling futures had a heady day after the release of better than
expected retail prices inflation. It fell to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.5
per cent in May.
Volumes were heavy, with the December contract trading nearly 55,000 lots to
close 16 basis points up at 93.85. Analysts said the market was buoyant,
with rates converging on the cash rates after a protracted period of extreme
interest rate pessimism.
A gilt auction at the end of the week, and the health of sterling, are the
main obstacles to further advances.
The sterling index closed slightly firmer at 79 from 78.8. The pound was
slightly firmer against the D-Mark, at DM2.4089 from DM2.3958. It slipped
slightly against the dollar to finish at Dollars 1.566 from Dollars 1.5725.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 680 of late assistance to UK money
markets after earlier forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage. The Bank had
earlier provided Pounds 63m assistance. Overnight money traded between 4 1/2
and 7 per cent.
German call money eased slightly to 4.90/5 per cent from 4.95/5.05 per cent
after the Bundesbank sanctioned a two basis point decline in the repo rate
to 4.91 per cent. With the small fall in the repo suggesting rates may be
close to the bottom, euromark futures lost ground. The December contract
closed at 95.05 from 95.09.

Report

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange COPPER made another attempt to clear Dollars 2,450
a tonne for three months delivery yesterday but again met general
liquidation and Chinese selling and settled back to end marginally lower on
the day.
ALUMINIUM prices did not make any more headway either. Business was done
within a comparatively narrow band, well below the overhead objective for
the three months position of Dollars 1,550 a tonne.
There were some signs of forward tightness developing in LEAD next year, but
this failed to generate enough on the upside to lift the market above the
Dollars 600-a-tonne barrier.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Generators forecast to need
15.5 per cent more uranium by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New uranium mines will be needed at the turn of the century to cope with a
forecast 15.5 per cent world-wide increase in requirements by nuclear power
stations, according to the Uranium Institute, an international association
of producers and consumers.
Most of the new capacity will be in Canada, the US and Australia, it points
out in what the institute claims is 'the most comprehensive global analysis
of the uranium market published so far'.
The report notes that the World Energy Council predicts global energy demand
will be 50 per cent higher in 2010 than in 1990 and then looks at projected
nuclear generating capacity on a country-by-country basis. It concludes that
requirements will rise from 56,076 tonnes in 1993 to 64,786 tonnes in 2010.
Some of the extra uranium will be supplied from existing mines which have
been operating at well below capacity for some years. There is also the very
real prospect that uranium derived from former military material will begin
to be released into the market at some point in the next decade - 'a real
manifestation of the peace dividend', was the way Mr Ian Duncan, the
institute's chairman, described it. Depending on the restrictions placed by
governments on this material, it could add between 5 per cent and 15 per
cent to world supplies from all sources within 10 years.
The report points out that uranium production in the western world has
fallen sharply in recent years and in 1992 covered only half of western
demand. The gap was filled by uranium from stocks, from reprocessing
products and from imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Eastern Europe and China.
As existing western stocks begin to run out towards the end of the 1990s,
and if the market share of the CIS and East European countries continues to
be limited by economic factors and by trade restrictions imposed by the US
and the European Union, production of uranium from western mines will need
to increase, the report suggests.
However, Mr Duncan said the fundamental issue raised by the report was 'how
is the world to meet the burgeoning demand for electricity and what part is
nuclear power to play in this?'
The report says that in 1991-92 nuclear power supplied about 7 per cent of
the world's primary energy and 17 per cent of its electricity. Since 1971
nuclear power has been the only primary fuel to increase its share of total
electricity production. 'Nevertheless, nuclear power's future role and
growth faces considerable uncertainty in spite of its competitiveness and
demonstrated environmental benefits.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT hopes for big yield from
crop insurance futures - A look at a scheme that could cut the cost of
government disaster compensation to US farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government and the Chicago Board of Trade are collaborating on a
novel market-based effort to reduce the cost of government support to
farmers after crop disasters like floods and droughts.
The co-operation is a by-product of a major overhaul in the US federal crop
insurance programme this year, but the resulting options contracts could
find favour with a variety of agribusinesses that need to manage risks
associated with volatile grain production levels in the US.
The CBoT's futures and options pits already set the benchmarks for world
prices for wheat, maize and soyabeans. Those contracts offer producers,
grain dealers, and food processors a kind of price insurance mechanism.
The new options, which are still in the design stage and have not been
announced publicly, will provide a means for hedging the size, rather than
the price, of a crop in specific areas. The contracts would pertain to US
crops, but analysts say the concept could be applied anywhere in the world.
The 'area yield options contracts', as they are called, would work much like
similar price-based contracts. However, instead of selecting a strike price,
traders would select a strike yield for a particular crop in a particular
area. A holder of a call option for maize grown in the Midwest, for example,
might select a strike of 100 bushels an acre. If the actual yield, as
assessed by the US Department of Agriculture after harvest, was greater than
the strike, the call holder would receive a cash payment. Conversely, a put
holder would receive payment if the crop was smaller than the chosen strike.
The contracts would mature at harvest, and be settled in cash.
In essence, the options would be a production insurance mechanism, says Ms
Ann Berg, a CBoT Director and a champion of the yield options concept. She
expects a wide variety of grain handlers, barge and rail companies, food
processors, and bankers to use the product. 'There has been a long period of
consolidation and integration in agribusiness which has created big
companies with huge capital investments in storage terminals, export houses,
and other facilities whose profitability depends largely on the volume
handled, and hence the crop size,' she says. 'This could help them manage
that aspect of risk in their business.'
Ms Berg expects the options contracts to be ready to trade sometime next
year.
The USDA views the options as one way to attract more capital into the
re-insurance network that backs the government's vast crop insurance
programme for farmers.
That programme has been widely criticised for its lack of actuarial
soundness, low levels of farmer participation, and its high cost. For each
of the last seven years congress has voted additional disaster relief to
farmers, trying to fill the gaps left by the insurance system. Last year the
US paid out more than Dollars 4bn in disaster relief and crop insurance
payments to farmers following record floods in the Midwest. The money paid
to compensate farmers for crop losses represented one quarter of all federal
subsidies paid for wheat, rice, feedgrains and cotton programmes, including
export subsidies.
In an effort to manage the budget drain congress this month is expected to
approve a controversial overhaul of the crop insurance programme.
Under the new system, farmers will be required to sign up for crop insurance
so as to qualify for government price supports. This, USDA experts say, will
triple the size of the insurance programme and strain the nation's crop
reinsurance resources. Crop insurers liabilities could rise to Dollars 40bn,
from their current coverage of Dollars 13bn, according to USDA data.
Mr Joseph Glauber, principal economist in the USDA's Office of Economics,
says the insurance programme is expanding just as reinsurance capacity is
dwindling. 'We're worried there won't be enough capital,' he says. 'The
options markets would allow some wholesale management of production risks
and could bring in other players.'
While innovative, the yield options concept is unproven, and may not attract
any more customers than the CBoT's nearly-moribund catastrophe insurance
futures contracts. However, Mr Richard Sandor, the derivatives wizard who
helped invent financial futures in Chicago, is enthusiastic about the idea.
'This will appeal to many types of traders,' he says. 'These will be the
first contracts to bridge the agricultural, insurance and capital markets,'
at the CBoT.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard 'anxious' about
disease in single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Importers of live animals to the UK must be aware of their responsibilities
in keeping out infectious diseases as the free movement of farm animals
across borders increases in the European Union's single market, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, stressed yesterday.
The government will be holding a seminar in November to offer advice to
importers on animal health problems. Mrs Shephard told the House of Commons
Agriculture select committee of MPs that it was up to individual operators
to 'blow the whistle,' on those that were acting irresponsibly.
Mrs Shephard said she was not entirely happy with the way the single market
worked in all member countries and that there were 'waves of anxiety', in
the Ministry of Agriculture over the outbreak of disease.
But the increase in UK veterinary checks on imported animals since November
had revealed few major problems. All cattle from France had been checked
following an outbreak of warble fly infestation, and 12 consignments this
year had been returned to France.
In addition, the government had launched a series of 24-hour periods of
blanket surveillance of imports and exports that have so far covered 500
consignments. Some form of irregularity had been found in one in seven of
the shipments, but these mostly involved faulty paperwork, she said. Only
about 1 per cent of cases concerned more serious health certification
irregularities. In 2 to 3 per cent of shipments there were welfare problems.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car industry boost forecast for
base metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising car output, growth in the number of cars in use and higher
consumption of non-ferrous metals in each car should see the industry's
demand for base metals grow further in the 1990s, according to Brook Hunt
and Associates, reports Reuters.
But the latest report on the car industry by the metals industry analyst
says that after the turn of the century use of copper and zinc will fall
markedly, although aluminium, lead and nickel consumption will continue to
rise.
Brook Hunt estimates that between now and 2005 consumption by the passenger
car industry of aluminium will rise by 83 per cent to 3.95m tonnes, of lead
by 11 per cent to 1.24m tonnes and of nickel by 10 per cent to 57,000
tonnes.
But usage of copper is forecast to fall by nearly 12 per cent to 480,000
tonnes and of zinc by 7.3 per cent to 457,000 tonnes by 2005.
The passenger car manufacturing industry's share of western world demand for
the major base metals in 1993 was 12 per cent for aluminium, 8 per cent for
copper, 32 per cent for lead, 10 per cent for nickel and 13 per cent for
zinc, Brook Hunt says.
Aluminium's unique combination of physical and mechanical properties make it
the material of choice in a wide variety of applications and will ensure it
has the greatest potential for future demand growth in the car industry, the
report says.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York buyers lead coffee
prices to fresh peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New York traders took the lead in the coffee market yesterday, pushing the
London Commodity Exchange September delivery position to a new 8 1/2 -year
peak of Dollars 4,085 a tonne. But the more subdued London tone dominated
towards the market close and in last minute trading the price dipped just
below the Dollars 4,000 a tonne mark.
By the end of trading the September contract was quoted at Dollars 3,990 a
tonne - a rise of Dollars 92 - while all other positions up to next May
remained above Dollars 4,000. New York prices were continuing firm in midday
trading with the September arabica futures contract showing a rise of 18
cents to Dollars 2.65 a pound.
Reports of large cash purchases by coffee roasting companies eager for
stocks of beans drove the market yesterday. 'This market has reached the
point of panic for most roasters and they have to be extremely aggressive
about buying,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, soft commodities analyst at Merrill
Lynch in New York.
At the same time, traders were concerned about the timing of Brazil's coffee
sales, which it has signalled to alleviate supply tightness. Brasilia
suspended exports while it assesses the damage to next year's crop of frosts
earlier this week and traders are uncertain when the release of stocks will
be resumed.
Mr O'Neill said the market might try to test the next resistance level at
Dollars 2.76 a pound, which was last breached in 1986. 'After that it's into
uncharted water with the 1976 high of Dollars 3.75 a pound to go for,' he
said.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: European sector eases on dollar support
rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds fell back yesterday on rumours that the US Federal
Reserve may act soon to support the dollar by raising official short-term
interest rates.
The shift out of US bonds into European bonds, triggered by the weakness in
the dollar, which caused European markets to rally in recent days, also
seemed to have slowed as the US currency regained some of its composure.
The interest rate rumours were triggered by US data showing a 0.3 per cent
rise in consumer prices in June.
The more pessimistic tone in the German government bond market was
compounded by disappointment over the Bundesbank's two basis point cut in
its securities repurchase rate, from 4.93 to 4.91 per cent.
'Cuts in the repo rate have become smaller and smaller in recent weeks,
suggesting that the Bundesbank is reluctant to lower interest rates further
in the near term,' said Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at
Yamaichi.
Analysts said that data showing a rise in West German wholesale prices in
June of 0.8 per cent, which was above expectations, had provided an excuse
for the market to sell-off.
French government bonds ended the day off their highs as investors squared
their positions in thin trading ahead of the Bastille holiday today and
tomorrow when French markets will be closed.
UK gilts rose sharply in early trading, boosted by weaker than expected
retail prices and employment data, but afternoon rumours of a another US
interest rate hike triggered profit-taking at the long end of the yield
curve, leaving prices to close only slightly higher on the day.
As traders began to focus on Friday's gilt auction announcement, the Bank of
England's announcement that it would issue Pounds 800m in tranches of
existing bonds from today put a further damper on the market's mood.
'The obvious interpretation is that Bank is keen to take advantage of the
market's positive sentiment in recent days,' said Mr Peter Fellner, gilts
strategist at NatWest Markets.
However, many participants said that investor demand remained subdued in
recent sessions. 'We haven't yet got to the point where investors are
willing to chase the market aggressively,' a dealer said.
Italian bonds ended the day slightly weaker on profit-taking after Tuesday's
strong gains. However, prices held up moderately well as dealers anticipated
good news from the government on its fiscal plans.
Still, with most of the package's details leaked in recent days, 'it will be
hard to surprise on the positive side,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international
economist at SG Warburg Securities. There are widespread hopes that the
government will announce dramatic cuts in health and pensions spending to
cut the country's heavy fiscal deficit.
Spanish bonds rose half a point amid fresh hopes that Spanish short-term
rates could ease further after yesterday's encouraging June inflation data.
The headline rate rose by 0.1 per cent on the month, bringing the
year-on-year rate to 4.7 per cent. Analysts were particularly encouraged by
the 0.3 per cent fall in service costs.
In Sweden, bonds weakened again ahead of the special meeting of the
parliament's finance committee, the auction of SKr12.5bn of Treasury bills
and the release of June inflation numbers, all slated for today. The yield
on the benchmark bond due 2003 rose by seven basis points to 10.87 per cent.
US Treasury prices held steady across the maturity range in the wake of a
consumer prices report that was in line with market expectations.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 83
15/32 , yielding 7.666 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99
21/32 , to yield 6.17 per cent.
After Tuesday's better-than-expected June producer prices report had lifted
bonds, investors were hoping yesterday that the second half of the June
inflation data - the consumer prices figures - would be equally positive.
The figures, however, proved unexciting, with the 0.3 per cent increase
reported in the consumer prices index being in line with economists'
forecasts.
A similar-sized increase in 'core' consumer prices (minus the volatile food
and energy components) was also as expected, and consequently, there was
little reaction from bond prices, which traded in a narrow range either side
of opening values throughout the day.

Swiss Bank Corporation has set up a securities unit in Milan, SBS Societa di
Intermediazione Mobiliare (SBS SIM).
The introductory or 'raccolta ordini' SIM, which opened for business on
Monday, will focus on marketing SBC products to Italian clients, across the
main product areas of cash, equities, bonds and derivatives. It may apply to
make markets in Italian bonds or equities at a later date.
Mr Rudi Bogni, chief executive of SBC in London, will be chairman of the
SIM, and Mr Massimo Perazzo vice chairman and managing director. The SIM is
expected to have a staff of 25.
SBC already has a mergers and acquisitions subsidiary, Societa di Mergers &amp;
Acquisitions, in Italy, and has recently been authorised to lead-manage
Eurolira bond issues, the first of which, a L200bn deal for Osterreichische
Kontrollbank, was launched last week.

AMP Asset Management, the investment management arm of the Australian
insurance company, said yesterday that it has completed Dollars 650m-worth
of trades in the last four days, in a restructuring of its Japanese stock
portfolio. The trade, completed by Morgan Stanley, is believed to be one of
the largest rebalancings of an actively managed Japanese portfolio.
The trade consisted of 73 stock positions across 21 accounts.
The changes were initiated by Mr Zac Bharucha, AMPAM's new Japanese
portfolio manager, and comprised changes in specific stocks, rather than a
shift in the weightings of specific sectors.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Credit Foncier's Y75bn offering proves
attractive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Foncier de France's Y75bn offering of eight-year bonds yesterday
commanded most of the attention in the Eurobond market, which is still
absorbing two large dollar fixed-rate offerings launched on Tuesday.
Finland's and Freddie Mac's global offerings, totalling Dollars 1.5bn each,
were both priced yesterday.
Dealers said demand for paper had been helped by the improvement in the
dollar's performance yesterday.
Finland's 10-year issue, priced at 55 basis points over the 10-year
Treasury, was bid at its launch spread of 55 basis points at the end of the
day's trading.
According to one of the underwriters, around 20 per cent was placed in Asia,
with the remainder split between the US and Europe. Freddie Mac's five-year
deal was priced at 17 basis points over the curve, in the middle of the
indicated range. At the end of the day, it was trading at 18 basis points
over the five-year Treasury.
Credit Foncier's deal was shortened to eight years from an initially-planned
maturity of 10 years, due to oversupply in the 10-year area, according to
co-lead manager Morgan Stanley.
Dealers said the issue was very attractively priced. With a coupon of 4.75
per cent, the bonds proved attractive to asset-swappers, who were able to
swap the bonds for floating-rate assets paying around 18 basis points over
yen Libor.
According to dealers, asset swaps on the bonds were completed into dollars
and French francs, as well as yen.
'Clearly, the deal was very cheaply priced,' said one underwriter. 'We have
been taking calls from people trying to get hold of the bonds all day.'
In the lira market, the European Investment Bank launched a L400bn offering
of 10.15 per cent bonds due 1998, fungible with an existing L1,000bn deal,
making it by far the largest offering in the Eurolira sector.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Liberty Life cuts convertible
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty Life, South Africa's largest life insurance company, has been forced
to reduce its offering of convertible bonds, to Dollars 300m from the
planned Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m range.
Poor demand from investors in the US was blamed for the shortfall in the
issue, which was priced yesterday by lead manager Robert Fleming.
But the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African
company was hailed as a success by some.
'The sale represents a considerable achievement in what have been extremely
difficult and uncertain currency and bond markets globally and given a
market that is highly unpredictable,' said Mr James Knowles, equity
syndicate manager at Kleinwort Benson.
'The size of the offering was appropriate for demand and will provide a
useful benchmark. It will be a precursor to a substantial inflow of funds
into South Africa,' he said.
However, the shortfall will throw doubt on the country's to return to the
international capital markets after its first non-racial elections in May.
It was hoped the offering would pave the way for a spate of financings by
the country's under-borrowed corporate sector, and was seen as a test of
market sentiment following the resignation of Mr Derek Keys, the South
African finance minster, on July 5.
'Although it is believed the US was disappointing, there was very strong
interest in Europe,' said Mr Roddie Fleming, a director of Robert Fleming.
'The US seems to have been far more affected by Mr Keys' resignation.'
However, an analyst in London said: 'This deal has not worked and it is not
surprising. Very few people believed that it would be successful.'
The bonds, due in 2004, with a semi-annual coupon of 6.5 per cent are
non-callable for at least the first five years and have 'soft protection'
for the remaining five years. They are convertible into ordinary shares of
Liberty Life at R106.68 per share, representing a premium of 10.4 per cent.
Robert Fleming has the option of subscribing for up to an additional Dollars
60m of the bonds.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Banacci earnings slide 67% in
second quarter

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial
group, reported an equivalent of net earnings of 216m new pesos (Dollars
63.5m) in the second quarter, a reduction of 67 per cent on the same period
in 1993.
Banacci's earnings were hit by a reduction of 380m pesos in the value of the
assets of the company subsidiaries, partly a result of fall in the stock
market over the second quarter, and weakness of the peso.
Operating profits, which exclude the asset devaluation, reached 596m new
pesos, a 6 per cent reduction over the second quarter last year.
The 'C' shares of Banacci were down 4.4 per cent yesterday to close at 21.5
pesos as the results were worse than the market had expected.
Earnings at Banamex, the group's bank, fell by 9.7 per cent to 475m pesos in
the second quarter, reflecting the spike in interest rates which cut the
company's net interest income substantially.
Low economic growth over the period also led to a deterioration in asset
quality, forcing the bank to increase loan loss provisions.
The proportion of non-performing to total loans rose to 5.6 per cent at the
end of June, from 3.9 per cent in the same period last year.
The bank said that loans to small and medium sized companies posed
particular problems.
Banacci said that it was making 'good progress' in the implementation of its
joint venture in long-distance telephony with MCI, the US carrier.
The group said that it expected the government to invite applications for
licences to compete in Mexico's long-distance market from 1997 within the
next few weeks.

<TEXT>
The Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) announced yesterday the joint
establishment with a number of other financial institutions of a company
specifically intended to help liquidate bad loans.
Port Island Acceptance Limited Liability, based in Kobe, will formally come
into existence today.
The company will begin accepting in September the problem loans to 10
non-banking companies affiliated with Hyogo Bank, a troubled regional bank.
It will be the first 'special purpose company' since the ministry of finance
allowed the establishment of such companies in February.
Banks with loans to the non-banks will be able to transfer to the new
company some of the principal on which interest rates have been cut,
allowing them to write off the balance as tax-free losses.
The IBJ and its affiliated companies will be the major shareholders in the
company. Other subscribing companies will include The Long Term Credit Bank
of Japan, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp, the Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo Life
Insurance and Nippon Life Insurance.
The company will be headed by Mr Takao Suzuki, of the IBJ's business
co-ordination department.
The scale of the discount at which loans will be transferred to the new
company is not yet clear, but analysts believe it could be as high as 40 per
cent.

Toyota is unlikely to meet its target for car sales in the domestic market
this year due to a sharp drop in sales between January and April, the
company said.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Japan's largest carmaker, said the company
was now forecasting domestic sales of 2.13m units rather than the 2.17m
forecast earlier in the year. The figure was still 3 per cent up on last
year when domestic sales totalled 2.07m vehicles.
Exports, on the other hand, are expected to be higher than earlier forecast
at 1.44m vehicles, while overseas production is likely to increase to 1.04m
units - up from a forecast 1.02m units, the company said.
Mr Toyoda also indicated that the company expected an average exchange rate
of Y105 to the dollar for the fiscal year beginning this month. At that
rate, the company should be able to increase pre-tax profits in fiscal 1994
to more than the Y200bn (USDollars 2bn) forecast for the year just ended
from July 1993 to June 1994.

Pacific Dunlop, the Australian industrial group, has announced a ADollars

the purchase of equity in companies in China and Thailand.
Mr Philip Brass, Pacific Dunlop's managing director, said yesterday about

expansion of food plants.
The company had also agreed to purchase a 50 per cent interest in Meadow
Gold Investment, the Chinese ice cream maker, and 40 per cent of General
Pacific Foods, the Thai food group. Pacific Dunlop has also acquired the
Asian rights to the Vitari food brand.
Mr Brass said the Chinese and Thai investments had strong expansion
prospects.
He said Pacific Dunlop would provide technology, funding, marketing and
management services to both operations through its Pacific Brands Food
group.
Parker and Parsley, the US oil group, has won control of 75 per cent of
Bridge Oil, the Australian petroleum group, and extended its takeover offer,
which was due to close yesterday, until July 27.

The Taiwan government is planning to sell up to 450m of its shares in
state-run China Steel Corp, the country's largest steelmaker, through an
offering of global depository receipts as early as September. The shares
represent about 6 per cent of the company's equity.
The government is also planning to sell another 198m common shares to
domestic investors late this month as part of the company's phased
privatisation, said an official in the economics ministry's commission of
national corporations. Some of the shares will be distributed though private
placement and the remainder offered to the public.
Lead underwriter China Development Corp said the shares would be priced
between NTDollars 21.71 (81 US cents) - the fixed price in a March share
issue - and NTDollars 22. CSC shares traded on the Taiwan stock exchange
closed down NT30 cents at NTDollars 27.3 yesterday.
The March issue came at a time of waning market sentiment and was not
regarded as a success.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Latin American foreign
borrowings drop to Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American borrowers raised slightly more than Dollars 2bn in foreign
bond issues in the second quarter of this year, a sharp drop on the previous
quarter's Dollars 6.42bn and the lowest figure since the third quarter of
1992.
The Dollars 8.4bn raised in the first half was 21.5 per cent down on the
first half of 1993, according to figures compiled by West Merchant Bank.
The new issue market recovered in June, when Dollars 990m in new bonds were
issued, from a slump in May when only Dollars 345m of bonds were launched.
The second quarter decline - following the rise in US interest rates which
started in February - was most marked in Mexico, also hit by political
uncertainties in an election year.
New Mexican issues in the second quarter dropped to Dollars 995m from
Dollars 3.46bn in the first; in Argentina the decline was to Dollars 904m
from Dollars 1.14bn and in Brazil to only Dollars 81m from Dollars 1.15bn.
As a whole, the bank said it expected between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 17bn
of new issues this year, against last year's record Dollars 26.6bn.
Redemptions of Latin American bond issues will fall slightly this year - but
then rise sharply. The bank estimates about Dollars 3.2bn of Latin bond
issues will be redeemed this year, down from Dollars 3.2bn last year.
But redemptions will rise to Dollars 8.0bn in 1995 and Dollars 8.4bn in
1996, suggesting a continuing heavy demand for bond finance from issuers in
Latin American countries.
Other developments, mostly reflecting the increased caution of investors and
a flight to quality, were:
The average maturity of issues declined. The average for the second quarter
for all Latin issuers was 3.2 years, compared with 4.5 years in 1993. Mexico
continued to issue the longest dated bonds - an average 3.5 years - but
suffered the greatest maturity reduction from an average 6.0 years in 1993.
Public sector bond issuance has outstripped private sector issuance this
year in contrast with 1992 and 1993. This year, 42.2 per cent of the bonds
were issued by the private sector, against 60.1 per cent last year and 63.4
per cent in 1992. The fall was almost entirely caused by Mexican borrowers,
with the private sector accounting for 29.4 per cent of issuance against 64
per cent last year.
Floating rate notes have become more important. They accounted for 38 per
cent of issues in the second quarter against 22 per cent in the first and 7
per cent last year.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 305m at
Prudential Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Securities, the Wall Street securities firm, announced the
addition of Dollars 305m to reserves, set aside to settle lawsuits brought
by thousands of customers who claim they were defrauded when the firm sold
them high-risk limited partnerships in the 1980s.
The addition means Prudential Securities will take a loss of Dollars 215m in
the second quarter. The firm's parent, Prudential Insurance, has agreed to
add Dollars 180m to Prudential Securities' capital.
Even without the cost of adding to its reserves, the firm said it would have
reported a loss of Dollars 35m in the quarter, because of the slump in US
stock and bond markets and the slowdown in the domestic brokerage business.
In the same quarter a year ago, it made a profit of Dollars 35m.
Prudential Securities said it was almost doubling the size of its reserve
fund, to Dollars 635m, because its settlements with customers were proving
larger than anticipated, due primarily to unexpectedly high interest
payments.
The securities house has been making reparations to customers since last
October. Then, it agreed to pay Dollars 371m in fines and restitutions to
settle state charges that it defrauded thousands of investors by persuading
them to buy more than Dollars 8bn of limited partnerships in the 1980s. Many
of those high-risk limited partnerships subsequently soured, and investors
claimed that they were never told the investments were highly speculative.
Its underestimation of the cost of the legal settlements, and the need for a
capital injection from its parent, is a blow for Prudential Securities. When
the firm agreed to the multi-million dollar settlement last year, its chief
executive, Mr Hardwick Simmons, said he hoped the deal represented 'one last
punch'. But since then, the firm has has lost numerous brokers to rival
securities firms.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Merits of open-outcry
challenged - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate over the merits of open-outcry versus screen-based derivatives
trading has been revived by a study challenging the widely-held notion that
electronic exchanges are inherently less liquid than open-outcry markets.
Open-outcry involves dealers in trading pits competing to execute customers'
buy and sell orders. They are joined by local traders, individuals who
usually trade their own capital and supply liquidity by absorbing order flow
imbalances. In an automated trading system, buyers and sellers feed quotes
into a centralised computer system which automatically matches trades
according to time and price priority rules.
Open-outcry trading is practised on many exchanges, including the world's
largest futures exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Europe's largest,
the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe).
However, more and more electronic exchanges have been set up in recent
years, including Germany's DTB, Switzerland's Soffex and Spain's Meff.
While electronic-trading enthusiasts predict that screen-based markets will
eventually supplant pit trading, others counter that computer-based
exchanges will never be able to replace open-outcry, largely because it
offers unparalleled liquidity. This, many say, is largely provided by
locals.
'Locals are an extremely important source of liquidity as they provide depth
to the market, especially when it gets choppy,' says Mr Daniel Hodson,
Liffe's chief executive.
However, a study for the Chicago-based Catalyst Institute by Mr Craig
Pirrong, of the University of Michigan, casts doubt on this conventional
wisdom.
Based on a one-year examination (July 1992 to June 1993) of the German
10-year government bond futures contract traded on Liffe and DTB, the study
rejects the widely-held view that Liffe's contract has greater depth and
liquidity than DTB's and cites empirical evidence indicating that the
opposite may be true. Moreover, it argues that locals are not necessary to
provide liquidity in an automated futures market.
As Mr Pirrong defines it, a market is liquid when traders can buy and sell
without substantially moving the price against them, and deep if traders can
buy and sell in large quantities without substantially moving the price
against them.
To evaluate the contract's liquidity, Mr Pirrong studied two factors on each
exchange: the spread between bid and offer prices, which is widely believed
to reflect liquidity (the tighter the spread, the more liquid the market);
and the market depth.
His analysis of bid-offer spreads concludes that 'for the period (studied),
bid-ask spreads on the DTB were no higher, and were possibly lower, than the
spreads on Liffe'. Moreover, 'the DTB market was deeper than Liffe;
increases in volume on Liffe substantially increased price volatility during
this period, whereas increases in volume on DTB had no such effect on
volatility'.
Further enhancing the DTB market's depth, the study argues, is the fact that
the exchange's order book, showing the 10 best bid and offer prices in the
market, provides traders with an insight into market depth which Liffe
dealers lack. Moreover, it notes that in hectic trading conditions, high
volume can lead to 'market fragmentation' in open-outcry pits, where
different prices can be quoted at the same time. This is impossible on an
electronic exchange.
The study also argues that locals, who tend not to participate in
computerised exchanges, are not needed to provide liquidity there.
'Virtually all liquidity on the DTB is provided by large institutional
traders and market-making firms. These firms can bring substantial capital
to the market and this facilitates the operation of a deep and liquid
market,' the study says.
Some observers complain that locals sometimes engage in practices which can
distort market prices, such as stepping in ahead of large customer orders as
they are being relayed to brokers in the pit. This often means that by the
time the order hits the market, the price has already moved against it.
Nevertheless, locals remain a crucial element of a liquid futures market,
says a senior dealer. 'They do a very good job moving the market around and
keeping things going,' he says.
One point worth noting is that the DTB's bund future actually benefits from
the liquidity provided by Liffe's locals. 'You can't look at the two
contracts separately - they are very much linked by arbitrage trading,' says
a dealer. He also points out that the bund future on DTB, which opens half
an hour before Liffe, often does not show a clear trend until Liffe begins
trading. 'The real price discovery occurs on Liffe,' he says.
Liffe's Mr Hodson argues that measuring a market's depth by looking at an
order book is not particularly useful. 'The capital on Liffe is there when
you need it - you don't have to have a huge order book to demonstrate this,'
he says.
'The reason people trade on Liffe is that they know they can get out a
reasonable price if the water gets choppy, and the locals play a very
important part' in this process, he adds. Besides, 'you only have to take a
look at the volumes to see where the liquidity lies', he says, noting that
72 per cent of bund futures turnover is done on Liffe.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cummins Engine chief stands down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cummins Engine, the US diesel engine maker has laid the groundwork for its
executive succession following the announcement that Mr Henry Schacht, chief
executive officer, will step down.
Mr Schacht has held the top management post at Cummins for 21 years, during
which time he has successfully battled to keep the manufacturing company
profitable in the face of global competition and domestic economic
downturns.
He will be replaced by Mr James Henderson, currently Cummins' chief
operating officer. Mr Schacht will retain his post as chairman and Mr
Henderson will keep his title of president.
Mr Theodore Solso, now a Cummins executive vice-president, will assume Mr
Henderson's old post of chief operating officer, putting him in line for the
chairmanship.
Mr Schacht, 59, said he was standing down now, rather than at 65, so the
company would avoid the double resignation which would occur if he and Mr
Henderson retired simultaneously in six years.
'This management transition reflects the Cummins tradition of orderly
change,' Mr Henderson said. 'Henry Schacht and I have worked together for 30
years.
'The transition plan he has developed in concert with the board preserves
our working partnership, guarantees management continuity, and assures the
ongoing consistent execution of Cummins' highly successful business
strategy.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CBS, the US broadcast television group, yesterday announced second-quarter
profits of Dollars 109.3m, up slightly from Dollars 107.4m a year ago.
The results translate into earnings of Dollars 6.84 a share, a record for
CBS. Last year, the company reported earnings of Dollars 6.73 a share, but
that figure was boosted by two extraordinary items.
Without those items, earnings in this year's second quarter were up 19 per
cent from a comparable Dollars 5.77 a share in 1993. Operating income was
also higher in the quarter, up 14 per cent to Dollars 174.3m, while
consolidated net sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 882.6m.
The CBS television network unit made the biggest contribution to group
earnings, reporting substantially higher income than a year ago. It
attributed this to a strong performance from its prime-time, daytime,
late-night and news programming.
Although it has the weakest sports programming of the three main networks,
CBS said its college basketball broadcasts in the quarter - which included
the highly-popular Final Four championship tournament - posted an especially
big sales increase, as did late-night programming, led by the top-rated Late
Night with David Letterman show.
Higher earnings were also reported by the group's affiliate stations and
radio divisions.
The results had little impact on CBS shares yesterday. However, they fell
sharply in early trading on the news that the company was abandoning its
planned merger with the QVC television shopping network, after
telecommunications group Comcast launched a rival bid for QVC.
The shares recovered later, after CBS said it would buy back 3.5m shares and
split its stock five-for-one. In late trading, they were Dollars 308, up
Dollars 8 on the day.

Charles Schwab, the US retail stockbroker, yesterday reported net income for
the second quarter of Dollars 32.1m, or 55 cents a share. The result was at
the top end of the expected range it announced less than two weeks ago.
The year before, it reported after-tax profits of Dollars 31.6m, or 53 cents
a share. The latest profits were earned on revenues of Dollars 258.2m, up
from Dollars 232.4m, with the growth coming mainly from the firm's mutual
fund service and higher money market balances.
First-half net income reached a record Dollars 70.3m, or Dollars 1.20 a
share, compared with Dollars 67m, or Dollars 1.13, in the first six months
of 1993.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Woolworth slices payout for
quarter to 15 cents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworth, the troubled US retailer that last year disguised losses in its
first and second quarters as profits, yesterday acknowledged the extent of
its difficulties by slashing its quarterly dividend from 29 cents a share to
15 cents.
It also said it was developing a cost-cutting programme to improve profits,
and announced the appointment of Mr Ronald Berens, previously head of its
Kinney Shoe subsidiary, to the newly-created post of executive
vice-president for worldwide specialty operations.
Woolworth said the dividend cut was aimed at bringing the payout level more
in line with historic levels, and to help the company focus resources on its
most-promising retail formats.
Before the cut, the annualised dividend yield on the common stock had been
7.25 per cent at yesterday's opening price of Dollars 16. After the cut, the
implied annualised yield was 3.84 per cent at the closing price of Dollars
15 5/8 .
The Dollars  3/8 fall in the share price was relatively small, because the
market had regarded the size of the payout as unsustainable given the
company's poor financial outlook.
Woolworth's difficulties are largely attributable to the decline of its
general merchandise operations, and its lack of success in replacing the
lost profits by switching to specialty retailing.
Last year, it embarked on a restructuring programme that involved the
closure of about half its US variety stores, and the disposal of its 142
Woolco stores in Canada. In this year's first quarter, however, its net
losses grew from a re-stated Dollars 24m to Dollars 38m.
Its decision to appoint a head of speciality retailing will be seen as an
attempt to give impetus to the lacklustre performance of the worldwide
specialty formats.

increase

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hilton Hotels, the US-based hotel and casino group, bounced back from last
year's profit decline and a weak first quarter by reporting a 26 per cent
increase in net income to Dollars 33.9m for the second quarter.
The improvement was driven mainly by economic growth in the US, which lifted
hotel occupancy levels and helped the company improve average daily room
rates.
Group revenue rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 381.2m. Operating profits on
the hotel side shot up 47 per cent to Dollars 43.7m, while operating profits
on the gaming side fell 2 per cent to Dollars 36.7m.
Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 70 cents.
For the first six months, net income was 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 56.6m,
excluding the effect of accounting changes. Earnings per share were 13 per
cent ahead at Dollars 1.17 on the same basis.
Hilton said it was the second successive quarter in which its hotel
operations had shown double-digit gains. They had been boosted by good
results from the hotels in New York, Chicago, Washington DC, New Orleans and
Hawaii, and by a substantial increase in the contribution from luxury Conrad
hotels, particularly in Hong Kong.
The gaming side suffered from the loss of 500 rooms at the Flamingo Hilton
Las Vegas because of a construction project. However, Mr Barron Hilton,
chairman and chief executive, said Hilton was maintaining its leadership in
the gaming business in an increasingly competitive environment, both in
Nevada and elsewhere.
Hilton's Conrad Hotels subsidiary is to develop a 500-room five-star hotel
in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, helping to ease a shortage of first-class
rooms in the former Saigon, AP reports from Hanoi.
The hotel will be part of the planned Saigon South urban development, which
includes a world trade centre complex, a financial district and a civic
centre.
Construction should start next year, and the hotel should open in 1997.

weakness in wood prices

<TEXT>
Weyerhaeuser, the US forest products company, saw second-quarter earnings
before special items fall to Dollars 128.8m, or 62 cents a share, from
Dollars 181.5m, or 89 cents, in last year's corresponding period.
Sales for the period rose to Dollars 2.6bn from Dollars 2.4bn last year.
The company said that although pulp and containerboard packaging prices had
begun to strengthen, the improvements were offset by weaker wood products
prices.
Prices for logs, lumber, and plywood reached historically high levels last
year. However, rising interest rates this year have dampened the new home
building boom that had underpinned those price increases.
'Our second-quarter results were mixed,' said Mr John Creighton, president.
'We began to see the benefit from higher prices in our pulp, paper, and
packaging businesses at the same time we experienced lower lumber, plywood
and oriented strand board prices, and reduced volumes of domestic log
sales.'
Weyerhaeuser's timberlands and wood products segment turned in
second-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 243.3m, up slightly from
Dollars 241.8m.
The company's pulp, paper and packaging businesses recorded earnings of
Dollars 30.1m in the quarter, down from Dollars 44.4m in the second quarter
of 1993.
Weyerhaeuser's overall first-half earnings slumped to Dollars 255.4m, or
Dollars 1.24 per share, from Dollars 359m or Dollars 1.75 in the 1993 first
half. Sales for the period were Dollars 4.9bn, up slightly from last year's
Dollars 4.7bn.

<TEXT>
L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, has taken control of Lanvin,
one of France's oldest fashion and perfume houses, by buying part of the
stake owned by Orcofi, the luxury goods concern controlled by the Vuitton
family.
Orcofi, which has since 1989 shared the ownership of Lanvin with L'Oreal,
agreed to sell a 16 per cent stake, reducing its own holding to 34 per cent.
L'Oreal will control Lanvin with a 66 per cent majority holding.
L'Oreal and Orcofi acquired Lanvin in 1989. They immediately embarked on an
ambitious investment programme to relaunch the company, in the hope of
revitalising its brand name in the then-buoyant up-market fashion and beauty
business.
However, the luxury goods market has since been depressed by the recession.
Lanvin has incurred heavy losses, and is understood to have sustained net
deficits of around FFr150m (Dollars 28.7m), including restructuring costs,
in 1992 and 1993.
Mr Michel Pietrini, the former Chanel executive who orchestrated the
relaunch, left Lanvin last year to be replaced by Mr Loik Armand, a L'Oreal
executive.
The new management has since cut costs and restructured the business.

<TEXT>
Improved newspaper advertising revenues and steady operating costs helped
Gannett, the US publishing and broadcasting group, report record after-tax
profits of Dollars 131.8m, or 90 cents a share, in the second quarter.
A year before, net income was Dollars 113.6m, or 78 cents.
Gannett, whose publications includes USA Today, earned advertising revenue
of Dollars 540m in the period, up from Dollars 513m, while income from
newspaper circulation edged up Dollars 3m to Dollars 213m. Other sources of
revenue were broadly in line with the year before, while costs, excluding
interest payments, were flat at Dollars 736m.
The company, which publishes 83 newspapers across the US, attributed the
advance to gains in 'help-wanted' advertising. The 13 per cent increase in
classified advertising sales contributed to a 5 per cent overall gain in
newspaper advertising revenues, it said.
Broadcasting revenues fell slightly, to Dollars 107m, reflecting the sale of
three radio stations. However, profits climbed 29 per cent to Dollars 39m.
Profits from outdoor advertising, by contrast, slid 8 per cent to Dollars
8.2m, as revenues fell 1 per cent to Dollars 63m
For the first half, net income of Dollars 210m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, was
up from Dollars 180m, or Dollars 1.23, a year before.
Higher revenues in its information services business were behind a 16 per
cent rise in net income at Dow Jones in the second quarter.
The company, whose interests include the Wall Street Journal, said revenues
from information services such as the Dow Jones/Telerate services, rose 12
per cent to Dollars 239m.
Net income was Dollars 46m, or 46 cents a share, for the period, and Dollars
86m, or 86 cents, for the first half of 1994. These compare with Dollars
40m, or 40 cents, and Dollars 71m or 71 cents last time.

heart drug
</HEADLINE>

   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alza, the California biotechnology company chaired by former Glaxo chief
executive Mr Ernest Mario, has won approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration to sell the heart drug Dynacirc CR.
Alza specialises in drug delivery systems, such as slow release capsules and
skin patches.
Dynacirc CR is a controlled-release version of Dynacirc, a heart drug
developed by Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Sandoz.
Analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimate potential sales of Dynacirc
CR at up to Dollars 100m a year.
Dynacirc belongs to a class of drugs known as calcium antagonists. This
market is dominated by US company Pfizer, whose Procardia is one of the
world's top three drugs with sales of more than Dollars 2bn a year.
Dynacirc CR is the result of a joint effort between Alza and Sandoz. It uses
Alza's Oros controlled-release technology based on the principle of osmosis
 -the movement of a fluid through a membrane - to allow the slow dispersion
of the contents of a capsule.
Sandoz, which will be marketing the drug, said it planned to introduce
Dynacirc CR in the US in early 1995. The medication will be manufactured by
Alza.
Alza made an after-tax profit of Dollars 45.6m in 1993.

The second quarter also showed improvement over this year's first quarter,
with rising paper and packaging prices boosting profits.
'This quarter's earnings performance reflects the pricing improvements
International Paper is now realising in most of our product lines,' chairman
Mr John Georges said.
Second-quarter sales rose to Dollars 3.6bn, from Dollars 3.5bn in the same
1993 quarter. The company said price increases for containerboard, pulp and

First Chicago's lower trading profit, at Dollars 36.7m - down from Dollars
91.6m a year before - is likely to be echoed by other big American
commercial banks which are expected to report their figures during the next
week.
The reversal in bond and equity markets since the US Federal Reserve first
raised interest rates in February has brought to an end a string of
record-breaking profits in the financial markets.
First Chicago's second-quarter net income remained level at Dollars 168.5m
or Dollars 1.71 a share, due in part to a number of one-off factors.
The restructuring of Brazil's foreign bank debt added Dollars 32m to pre-tax
earnings, while the accelerated sale of certain assets brought net gains of
Dollars 22m. The bank's provision for credit losses fell to Dollars 43m,
from Dollars 70m a year before.
The year-ago quarter had been boosted by Dollars 78.7m from the sale of
equity investments, compared with gains of only Dollars 3.9m this time.
For the first six months, net income of Dollars 362.5m or Dollars 3.76 a
share was up from Dollars 347.6m or Dollars 3.78 a share a year before.
The bank's return on equity for the half year, at 18.3 per cent, was down
from 22.4 per cent while in the second quarter, return on equity slipped to
16.5 per cent.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bilfinger &amp; Berger emerges as
Buderus shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bilfinger &amp; Berger, one of Germany's largest construction groups, yesterday
emerged as the surprise owner of a 15 per cent stake in Buderus, the German
heating equipment and engineering group.
The news follows last month's placing of 80 per cent of Buderus on the
German stock exchanges by Metallgesellschaft, the troubled conglomerate.
Buderus shares were suspended yesterday.
The move is widely seen in Germany as a prelude to a possible battle for
control of the highly profitable Buderus. Both Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank
each have a 10 per cent stake in the engineering group.
Mr Christian Roth, Bilfinger chairman, disclosed the news of the
shareholding at Bilfinger's annual meeting yesterday. He said that Bilfinger
was in talks with Buderus management board.
Although a Buderus official statement said that it welcomed Bilfinger as a
long-term shareholder, Mr Reinhard Engel, a director of Buderus, said there
had been no talks with Bilfinger and there was no possibility of business
co-operation.
'There is no evidence to suggest that there is anything suspicious about
this holding,' said Mr Engel. 'We see it in a neutral light: we are not
enthusiastic but we are not disappointed either.'
Secret stake-building is shortly to become illegal in Germany under the
terms of the Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz, the second Financial Markets
Promotion Act, which is likely to come into force on August 1. The law will
oblige companies to disclose stakes once they reach 5 per cent, providing an
early warning system for German companies. There are no takeover rules in
Germany akin to the UK Takeover Code.
The stake-building also appears to contradict the terms of the placing of
Buderus shares last month, in which Metallgesellschaft obtained DM1.2bn
(Dollars 788m) for its 80 per cent shareholding.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank arranged the placing of Metallgesellschaft's
Buderus stake with the declared aim of ensuring that Buderus would be owned
by a broad spread of shareholders.
Deutsche Bank said it had been told about Bilfinger's purchases yesterday by
Dresdner, a 25 per cent shareholder in Bilfinger. Dresdner refused to answer
specific questions about its role in helping Bilfinger buy the Buderus
shares.
Buderus made pre-tax profits of DM133m (Dollars 81.5m) last year on sales of
DM2.77bn.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Renault in pole sell-off
position - John Ridding finds a mix of caution and commitment from Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, chose his words carefully
yesterday. He was not announcing the privatisation of Renault, merely
preparing to select adviser banks for the 'evolution of the capital' of the
French state-owned automotive group.
But despite Mr Alphandery's reticence, the French government has clearly
started the wheels rolling again in its plans to transfer the car maker, one
of the flagships of the French public sector, into the private sector.
It raises the question of how and when Renault might be sold, and who might
be the buyers of stakes in the company, which is valued at about FFr40bn
(Dollars 8bn).
Behind yesterday's announcement lies a mixture of caution and commitment.
The government is keen to signal its commitment to the sale of Renault,
which has proved one of the trickiest proposals on its list of 21 public
sector companies slated for sale.
'The French state should not be in the business of making cars,' says Mr
Gerard Longuet, the industry minister.
Mr Longuet has pushed hard for Renault's privatisation. So has Mr Louis
Schweitzer, the chairman of the automobile group.
Industry observers add that the company is in good shape for sale. It is one
of the few European motor groups to endure the recession of the past few
years without falling into loss.
It reported net profits of FFr1.07bn in 1993, and has developed a successful
range of new models, including the Twingo, the quirky small car, and the
Laguna saloon.
A number of obstacles, however, have prompted a delay in the privatisation.
Most obvious was the collapse last year of plans to merge with Volvo of
Sweden, a merger that was intended to be the final step before
privatisation.
The sale of Renault has also run into political sensitivities. In
particular, the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur has been
anxious to avoid trade union opposition to its plans for Renault, a
stronghold of union groups in the 1960s and 1970s and which remains a symbol
of a corporatist system of industrial management.
As Mr Alphandery demonstrated yesterday, the government remains cautious.
According to the economy minister, the launch of bids for adviser banks
'prejudges nothing' concerning the future ownership of Renault. He added
that there was no deadline for decisions to be taken.
French officials argue that there is no need to hurry. The government has
already named Assurances Generales de France, the insurance company, and
Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer, as the next companies to be
privatised.
Proceeds from the privatisation earlier this year of Elf Aquitaine, the oil
group, and Union des Assurances de Paris, have already taken the government
beyond its targeted receipts of FFr55bn for this year.
Thus a possible scenario for Renault is a partial privatisation which could
take place before next spring's presidential elections. A sale of the
balance of the state's 80 per cent stake could follow.
Auberger, a senior member of the National assembly's finance committee, said
last month that the government was considering a partial privatisation, but
that no decision had yet been taken.
Industry observers in Paris suggest that a partial privatisation could
involve the sale of between 15 and 25 per cent of the company's shares and
the formation of a so-called 'noyau dur' of long-term shareholders.
Such shareholders would probably be drawn mainly from the ranks of France's
largest financial and industrial groups.
They might include Lagardere Group, the communications and defence company
which is involved with Renault in the development of its Espace vehicles,
and which has expressed an interest in its partner's privatisation. Elf
Aquitaine, which co-operates with Renault in several areas, including in
Formula One motor racing, is another potential investor.
Renault has also been seeking industrial partners following the collapse of
its merger plans with Volvo. Negotiations with Fiat of Italy, however,
concerning the sharing of foundry facilities, have ended unsuccessfully.
Privatisation, however partial, could help untangle the remnants of
Renault's complex cross-shareholding with Volvo. The Swedish company has 20
per cent of Renault.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Uralita set to spin off
chemicals
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
URALITA, the Spanish industrial group in which a number of UK institutions
took a significant stake last year, is to group its chemical operations into
a separate company in order to pave the way for a possible outright sale.
The reorganisation would allow Uralita to concentrate more fully on its core
building materials business, analysts say.
The group is Spain's building materials market leader.
A number of UK institutions, lead by Scottish Widows, last year paid
Pta7.6bn (Dollars 58m) for a 15 per cent stake in Uralita. The vendor was
Grupo March, Spain's leading holding company.
Buffeted by recession, Uralita lost Pta7.4bn last year but strong
first-quarter results suggest that losses could be brought down to Pta1.5bn
this year and that the group could be profitable in 1995.
Uralita plans to underwrite a Pta15bn capital increase, a sum equivalent to
the book value of its plastic and chemical assets, for Rocalla, a fibre
cement company that is to acquire Uralita's chemicals assets. Rocalla is to
change its name to Aragonesas.
Rocalla, which is 95 per cent owned by Uralita, and is listed on the the
Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges, will pass its cement business across
to Uralita.
The disposal of the chemical units grouped in the re-launched Aragonesas,
either through a trade sale or through a placement with institutional
investors, is expected to take place early next year.
Uralita is believed to have a placed a price tag of between Pta20bn and
Pta23bn on its chemicals assets.

capital spending

<TEXT>
Japanese semiconductor makers are stepping up capital spending on
manufacturing facilities to meet growing demand from the computer and home
electronics markets.
NEC, the second largest maker of semiconductors in the world after Intel of
the US, plans to increase capital spending on chip production this year to
Y110bn (Dollars 1.1bn). It had earlier set spending at Y90bn.
Fujitsu is also increasing capital spending by Y18bn while Mitsubishi
Electric is considering raising investment in order to meet an expected
surge in demand in years ahead.
Meanwhile, Toshiba, which is Japan's second largest semiconductor maker,
announced that a joint venture semiconductor manufacturing company it has
with Motorola of the US, is investing about Y27bn in a new facility in Japan
to make microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs).
The increased investments reflect the strong demand for semiconductors from
not only the computer market but the home electronics and audio visual
markets in Japan, the companies said.
'Our factories are being squeezed to the pip,' said Mr Mark Pearce, of NEC.
The move in the PC market towards advanced computers and the introduction of
new operating software have increased demand for memory chips, NEC said. The
new operating software, for example, uses more than ten times the memory
required to run earlier software.
At the same time, however, demand for semiconductors from home electronics
makers has also been strong particularly for microcontrollers that go into
products such as mobile phones, air conditioners, washing machines and other
household appliances.
The trend reflects both the growing use in such household appliances of
microcontrollers and a recovery in consumer spending.

FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: US accounting cuts Fiat losses
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US accounts of Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, show a
1993 net loss almost L1,000bn (Dollars 662m) lower than the loss shown by
the group's European results. The disparity is the result of accounting
differences.
In May, Fiat announced a record consolidated loss of L1,783bn for 1993,
after minority interests, extraordinary items and tax.
In the US accounts, deposited with the US authorities at the end of last
month, the net loss is L794bn.
The comparative profits in 1992 were L551bn in the European accounts and
L375bn in the US equivalent.
At the same time, shareholders' equity is slightly higher in Fiat's US
accounts for 1993: L18,724bn, compared with L17,427bn in the European
accounts.
Mr Carlo Gatto, a senior vice-president in Fiat's administration and audit
division, explained that the difference in net results was particularly
marked in the 1993 accounts because the group implemented changes to US
rules on accounting for deferred tax liabilities and assets.
When the cumulative effect of the changed accounting principle was included,
Fiat's US profit and loss account was adjusted upwards by L1,308bn, although
this figure was offset by other negative items.
The adjustment to shareholders' equity was mainly due to differences in
accounting for goodwill in acquisitions.
Fiat indicated at its shareholder meeting at the end of last month, that it
would return to net profit for 1994.

<TEXT>
The Czech cabinet yesterday rejected fresh proposals for restructuring the
country's oil refining and petrochemical industry, potentially clearing the
way for further consideration of two earlier plans which would see private
investors take a minority stake in the sector.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said a revised industry ministry proposal
would be studied again in a month.
The government has already received two proposals for restructuring the
industry, which is estimated to be in need of a Dollars 1bn investment
programme.
One would see four international oil companies, Shell, Conoco, Total and
Agip, take a 49 per cent stake in the refining business in return for an
immediate payment of Dollars 180m and a Dollars 520m investment programme
over five years. This plan would leave the petrochemical business in state
hands.
The second proposal, which the government favours, has been submitted by
Chemapol, a powerful Czech monopoly oil importer which is itself being
restructured.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Suffering pain to recapture past strengths
 -A look at the strategies adopted by the high street lenders in their
efforts to attract funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past five years TSB, the retail bank, has been deliberately making
less and less money from its depositors. It has been telling them to
transfer funds to high interest accounts, and in the first half of this year
a further Pounds 300m drained out of its low interest accounts.
In the past, this loss of cheap deposits would have made most bankers tear
their hair out, but Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB's chief executive, is proud of it.
'Now we can tell people truthfully that we offer competitive products. Five
years ago, we were saying one thing and doing another,' he says.
Mr Ellwood is not alone. Over the past two years, National Westminster has
paid higher interest to attract savers - so narrowing spreads between its
loans and deposits. It has moved from having to borrow Pounds 2bn from
wholesale markets to fund branch lending to having a Pounds 4bn retail
funding surplus.
Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer, says the bank is
accepting lower returns because it must lend the surplus on whole- sale
markets, where margins are narrower than on cor- porate loans. 'We are
taking some short-term pain to achieve a long-term objec- tive.'
Banks' renewed emphasis on deposit-gathering provokes scepticism from
building societies, which have made a name as a better place for savings in
the past two decades. But there is some evidence that it is more than a
passing fad - that banks are serious about recapturing a past strength.
The gloomiest observers say that banks still pay a huge price for past
errors. Mr John Aitken, an analyst at UBS, says banks would have Pounds 50bn
more in retail deposits if they had maintained their 1975 market share. He
estimates that this seepage costs them Pounds 2.5bn in profits each year.
Mr Aitken believes banks stopped growing then, and are now recognising their
loss by cutting branches and staff. 'Banks used to be regarded mainly as
repositories for funds. They were safe, even if they did not give you much
for it, and they did not lose large amounts by unwise lending,' he says.
Banks are now attempting to retrieve this position, and reverse this trend.
they have a number of motives for doing so:
Taking deposits is less risky than lending, the side of the balance sheet on
which many concentrated in the 1980s. Deposit-taking may not earn much, but
it carries no risk of future loss. 'Let us say our strategy is wrong. Well,
we can rectify it in a couple of months by changing rates,' says Mr Goeltz.
It employs no capital, nor is much absorbed by the wholesale assets into
which surplus retail deposits are put. 'The returns do not look frightfully
good, but you do not have to put much capital against it, so it can still be
good business for shareholders,' says Mr Patrick Perry, treasurer of
Barclays Bank.
Retail funds help banks' balance sheets in two ways. One is that they are a
stable funding source. Wholesale funds, lent in large tranches by banks or
by institutions which have surplus cash, fluctuate in price and supply can
dry up quickly if financial markets are volatile, or a bank appears unsafe.
The second is that retail funds tend to be cheaper at the margin. Once a
bank has set up a branch network, the marginal cost of gathering deposits is
usually lower than borrowing from wholesale markets. The relative costs are
more difficult to calculate if branch costs are added to the equation.
Banks are placing more emphasis on selling financial products such as life
assurance rather than lending money. They see savings and deposit accounts
as a risk-free means of expanding their customer base. They hope that they
will be able to persuade such customers to buy other things from them.
The last factor is the highest priority for most. Mr Goeltz says that it lay
behind NatWest's deposit push from early 1992. 'We recognised then that the
bank had to develop alternative income streams. The key is to satisfy more
customer needs from essentially the same infrastructure,' he says.
However, gathering deposits does not bring simple cross-selling gains. Mr
Ellwood says that TSB customers with home mortgages tend to buy an average
of three other products from the bank. This is because mortgages give banks
obvious chances to sell related products such as home insurance.
Mr Dennis Holt, general manager of personal banking for Lloyds Bank, admits
that savings accounts have 'less built-in loyalty'. He says banks can
improve their chances by persuading savers to buy long-term products such as
the three-year stepped income deposit account launched by Lloyds this month.
Mr Ellwood says banks now have greater chances to cross-sell to savers
because of technology. TSB this year achieved a 20 per cent response to a
mailshot offering personal loans - 10 times the normal response - because it
had already credit-scored the customers to whom it sent the offer.
But whatever the attractions of gathering deposits, banks now face a problem
in finding a proper use for them. 'Most of us now have a surplus of retail
deposits because of poor loan demand. It is difficult to find suitable
outlets,' says Mr Richard Orgill, Midland's deputy chief executive.
The problem is compounded by the fact that societies are now having to bid
strongly for retail funds to compete with National Savings, and are offering
attractive rates. Bankers say that some societies are giving savers rates
which are too high to make a profit if the funds are lent wholesale.
This competition for funds is one reason cited by banks for wanting to buy
building societies. Some see it as an opportunity to buy back the retail
deposit strength they have lost over the past 20 years. Without this elegant
solution, banks face a tough struggle to rebuild market share.
Mr Goeltz says that banks must be consistent to re-establish a good
reputation. 'There is a cost to convincing customers that we are a valuable
ally in the savings market,' he says. That cost could start to look very
high if banks cannot quickly achieve the other sales for which they hope.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Yates plans to double retail side after
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent drinks group which claims to
have first introduced wine to the north of England, yesterday announced
plans to double the size of its retail operations following its forthcoming
flotation.
Funds raised by the Pounds 10m placing, giving the company a Pounds 54m
market capitalisation, will be used to reduce group borrowing and launch an
expansion programme which envisages a portfolio of 100 outlets by the year
2000.
Institutions have been offered shares at 140p as part of the float, which
involves 5.7m new ordinary shares and 1.3m existing shares.
Although the placing will dilute the Yates family's 75 per cent
shareholding, some 40 relatives will be left with a 65 per cent stake when
the company obtains a listing.
Mr Peter Dickson, managing director and great-grandson of Mr Peter Yates,
the group's founder, said he was confident ofwinning widespread
institutional support for the expansion.
'We believe there is potential to open a Yates in every town with a
population of more than 75,000,' Mr Dickson said.
The group - which first came to the market in 1986 under the matched bargain
Rule 535 - has set its sights on new outlets in three target areas:
Yorkshire and the north-east, the Midlands and the M1 corridor to London.
Initially, however, most of the funds raised by the placing will be used to
wipe out Pounds 8.5m of secured loans and unsecured bank overdrafts.
Mr Dickson said the company would rely on progressive borrowing to fund new
outlets, but added that gearing was unlikely to exceed 33 per cent.
Gearing in the year to March 27, when the group made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 2.77m) on turnover of Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 35.3m), was
25 per cent.
Dealings are expected to begin on July 19. The placing was sponsored by
Panmure Gordon.

Shares in Colorvision fell 7p to 31p yesterday, as the Liverpool-based
television and video retailer reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds
1.78m to Pounds 203,000 for the year to end-March.
The downturn, which was foreshadowed in April's trading statement, was
struck on turnover marginally up from Pounds 66.8m to Pounds 67.1m - of
which Pounds 951,000 was contributed by discontinued operations.
The directors said that, in line with current retailing practice, the
reported turnover figure now contained commissions received, and
interest-free credit subsidies were included within the cost of sales.
Action had been taken to improve the profitability of the group, the
directors added, and nine outlets had been earmarked for closure, of which
six had been closed prior to the period end. Staffing levels had been
reviewed and appropriate cuts had been made, the costs of which had been
provided for in the results.
Earnings per share were 0.2p (5.6p) and, as previously stated, the board is
not recommending a dividend.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BWD Securities shows 25% advance to Pounds
2.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BWD Securities, the USM-quoted stockbroking and financial services group,
reported pre-tax profits 25 per cent ahead to Pounds 2.25m for the six
months to May 31, on turnover 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 8.73m against
Pounds 7.43m.
Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (6.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted by
13 per cent to 1.7p (1.5p).
BWD began as a stockbroker and unit trust manager in Huddersfield but
expanded by acquiring the Liverpool-based Rensburg. Capital for Companies,
an independent Leeds BES and venture capital fund manager followed. The
group then set up Northern Registrars, a subsidiary using Huddersfield's
lower overheads to compete nationally for share registry business.
BWD Rensburg has now completed a Pounds 650,000 investment to upgrade
electronic systems and equipment ready for the Stock Exchange's move to
rolling settlement next week. The stockbroker's nominee service has grown by
600 clients to 4,000 which should also help smooth the transition, the
company said.
BWD Rensburg has also acquired new buildings in Birmingham and Sheffield,
where significant growth is now forecast.
Capital for Companies raised Pounds 30m for BES assured tenancy schemes,
making a total of Pounds 78m, its last chance to do so before BES is
replaced by the Enterprise Investment Scheme, which the company is looking
at along with venture capital trusts.
Northern Registrars won 15 new clients to bring its total to 85.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sharp increase in activity helps Savills
rise to Pounds 3.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in activity in both the commercial and residential property
markets last year helped pre-tax profits at Savills, the estate agent and
surveyor, to more than double.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 1.44m) for the year to April 30 on
an increase in turnover of only 26 per cent to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 25.3m).
The shares closed 2p higher at 83p.
Mr George Inge, chairman, said: 'There seems to be some uncertainty within
the financial markets generally, which may impact on investor sentiment, but
so far has had little effect on our residential side.'
The commercial division saw a 25 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 13.4m
producing an 82 per cent rise in operating profit to Pounds 1.49m (Pounds
819,000).
The investment team had a record year, and was involved in transactions
worth Pounds 600m. Savills also benefited from the management contract for
the Canary Wharf administrators. However, Mr Inge warned that it would be
difficult for the division to exceed last year's earnings.
The agricultural and residential division reported operating profits up by
2.5 times to Pounds 1.19m, on a 23 per cent increase in sales to Pounds
17.9m, helped by a sharp recovery in luxury residential prices.
Savills sold Pounds 425m of residential property during the period, a Pounds
100m increase from 1993. Mr Inge said that foreign purchasers had accounted
for 40 per cent of its London residential sales.
The company also benefited from a nine month contribution from its new
finance arm, which made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 221,000.
Mr Inge said this would be an important area of growth.
Savills is providing corporate finance and debt financing advice, but with
Pounds 10m of cash on its balance sheet, it plans to start providing direct
finance for transactions.
It also intends to sponsor a number of property funds, in which Savills
would be prepared to take a direct stake.
The company recommended a final dividend of 1.5p, making 2.25p for the year,
up from 1p. Earnings per share were 6.2p (2.2p).

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bonuses of Pounds 1.6m for CE Heath
executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two executive directors of CE Heath, the insurance broker, were given
bonuses totalling Pounds 1.6m in the year to March 31, according to the
annual report.
The payments, intended to reward past performance and secure future loyalty,
indicate the value of leading personnel to commercial insurance and
reinsurance brokers. In the last few years, several have been hit by staff
defections
Mr John Mackenzie Green, group managing director, received a total of Pounds
1m - in addition to his salary of Pounds 183,315 and a profit-related bonus
of Pounds 43,000.
Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, received loyalty bonuses totalling
Pounds 600,000 on top of his Pounds 188,278 salary and a Pounds 29,172
profit-related bonus.
The discretionary bonuses amounted to Pounds 400,000 for Mr Mackenzie Green
and Pounds 240,000 for Mr Presland. Loyalty payments were Pounds 600,000 for
Mr Mackenzie Green and Pounds 360,000 for Mr Presland.
Overall the group paid some Pounds 2.3m in loyalty payments. These payments
are repayable if notice is given - other than in certain limited
circumstances - before March 31 1997 of the termination of the recipient's
service contract with the company.
A new incentives scheme will take effect in 1997. The bonus payments will be
charged to the company's profit and loss account over the next three years.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cray 10% down on lack of exceptional gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of exceptional gains resulted in a 10 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits at Cray Electronics Holdings from Pounds 29m to Pounds 26.2m
in the year to April 30.
Strong underlying growth at the operating level saw the contribution from
continuing operations advance by 53 per cent to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 16.8m).
However, the comparable pre-tax result was swollen by Pounds 8.05m profits
on disposals and Pounds 3.43m of foreign exchange gains.
Turnover in the period under review from continuing operations increased by
50 per cent to Pounds 244.1m (Pounds 162.2m). This included a full-year
contribution from the Dowty IT business, which was acquired in August 1992,
and an initial Pounds 38.3m contribution from the P-E International
business, which was acquired for Pounds 16.2m in September. Discontinued
operations added another Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 38.6m) to total sales.
Earnings per share fell from 13.8p to 8.6p. An increased final dividend of
1.5p (1p) is proposed, making a total for the year of 2.25p (1.5p).
Profit from continuing operations included an initial Pounds 767,000
contribution from P-E International. The discontinued Cray Technology
operations, which were all sold during the year, added another Pounds
473,000 to operating profits. A Pounds 235,000 loss was carried on the
disposal.
Net interest receipts of Pounds 146,000 compared with Pounds 871,000 of
costs previously. The group ended April with net cash of Pounds 15.6m, up
from Pounds 12.8m.
At the divisional level the advance was again led by Cray Communications,
which boosted its input to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 12.7m) on turnover of Pounds
165.3m (Pounds 127m). Margins improved from 11 per cent to 13 per cent and
divisional research and development expenditure increased to Pounds 20m.
Cray Systems, which now includes the P-E Computer Services business, lifted
turnover to Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 35.2m) including organic growth of 15 per
cent. Profits of Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 3.71m) represented a reduced 8 per
cent (11 per cent) margin on turnover which reflected the inclusion of the
loss-making P-E operations.
The P-E International management consultancy business reported profits of
Pounds 581,000 on turnover of Pounds 21.1m.
COMMENT
The reorganisation of the Cray businesses is now complete, the P-E
International operations have been integrated and the group is now organised
into three distinct divisions. Despite persistent rumours of a possible bid
for Racal, Cray's management makes it clear that attention is clearly
focused on expanding these core businesses internationally - mainly by
organic means - and achieving further margin improvements. In particular the
management has has set a 20 per cent margin target for the core
communications division, which has a strong and expanding product portfolio.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.2m look possible this year, generating earnings
of 10.6p. The shares are trading on a deserved premium prospective p/e of
just under 16.

PSIT, the investment company formerly known as Property Security Investment
Trust, yesterday announced that pre-tax profits for the year to March
increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 12m, against Pounds 9.66m.
The company's net asset value per share rose 18 per cent to 168p (142p),
reflecting improving property values in the UK.
Total investment rents rose by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 20.8m, and the company
benefited from lower interest rates and lower debt levels, a result of its
reduced property development programme. Interest payable fell from Pounds
11.1m to Pounds 9m.
Income from investment securities amounted to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 2.14m)
and the company raised Pounds 314,000 from the sale of investment
securities, compared with Pounds 999,000 in 1993.
Mr Albert Perry, chairman, said: 'We continue to look for properties or
sites which can both produce income and offer the potential for future
development, and we are currently in negotiations for further acquisitions.'
PSIT's extension of its Australian shopping centre has been completed and is
98 per cent occupied. New highways are under construction on its Florida
site. The company has also achieved further lettings on properties in
Hampshire and Cheshire.
A final dividend of 2.875p is proposed, making a total for the year of
4.625p (4.125p). Earnings per share were 7.03p (5.86p).

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead to purchase Redwood for Pounds
2.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, announced yesterday that it had
agreed to buy Redwood Publishing, the contract publisher, best-known for its
American Express, Marks and Spencer, and InterCity magazines, for an initial
cash payment of Pounds 2.85m.
AMV also said 537,879 new ordinary shares were being placed by Hambros Bank
at 660p apiece to raise Pounds 3.35m, net of expenses. The balance will be
used by Redwood as additional working capital. Brokers are SG Warburg and
dealing is expected to start tomorrow.
Four additional payments, dependent on Redwoods' performance until the end
of 1998, are also to be made. Redwood's unaudited pre-tax profits for the
first five months of 1994 were Pounds 300,000.
AMV shares rose 1p to close at 670p.
Mr Peter Mead, AMV group chief executive, said that customer magazines had
come of age over the past few years and Redwood's magazines were 'carefully
focused towards existing customers of each of their clients'.
There was considerable synergy between AMV's and Redwood's activities, and
the purchase was part of the group's strategy of offering integrated
marketing to clients, he said.
Redwood was formed in December 1993 after the BBC, which partly owned the
company's predecessor, WPL, decided to sell its contract publishing
interests, retaining just its consumer magazines.
Mr Michael Potter and Mr Christopher Ward, founders and senior directors of
Redwood, will run the business as a separate company within the AMV group.

Service Corporation International, the US funeral company, has extended its
600p a share offer until August 2 for Great Southern Group, despite
receiving acceptances for 0.11 per cent of the UK funeral operator's shares
by the first closing date.
A separate offer has been made to shareholders of JD Field, which owns 56.1
per cent of Great Southern. SCI has received no acceptances from JD Field
shareholders, who are primarily trusts related to the Field family.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Castle Comms jumps 58p on offer talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Castle Communications, the music and video publisher,
jumped 58p to 335p yesterday as it announced that it was in talks that might
lead to an offer for the company.
The statement was in response to recent moves in its share price.
Castle, which was floated on the USM at 200p in March 1987, releases
compilations of pop artists from the 1960s and 1970s and owns rights to some
groups from the period, including the Kinks and the Searchers.
There was speculation yesterday that the rights, valued at 230p a share in
its last balance sheet, might have attracted the attention of large music
copyright holders.
Castle made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 33.4m in
the year to June 1993.
Castle, which is valued at Pounds 22.8m at yesterday's closing price, said a
further announcement would be made as soon as practicable.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Norton revival plans close to collapse as
backers fall out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves to revive Norton, one of the most famous names in British
motorcycling, appeared close to collapse yesterday amid a bitter row between
the company's Canadian backers.
The dispute follows the group's failure to secure a full listing in North
America and has split Wildrose Ventures, the Vancouver-based investment
vehicle which bought Norton for CDollars 1m (Pounds 400,000) last year.
Ms Rozanda Skalbania, who had been managing Norton Motors (1993), has left
the company and lawyers acting for the Aquilini family, Canadian property
developers who hold 10 per cent of Wildrose, are understood to have taken
over at the group's Midlands plant.
Their arrival comes after months of frantic and increasingly bizarre efforts
to generate funds to restart motorcycle production and develop new uses for
Norton's rotary engine technology.
Those efforts centred on Norton BSA, a former shell company listed on the US
bulletin board in pink sheet securities. After that failed to raise the
necessary working capital, Ms Skalbania tried to recall and auction 10
vintage Norton motorcycles on permanent loan to a number of museums. The
museums refused to hand over the exhibits.
Other money-making initiatives included a joint venture with MiG, the
Russian aircraft manufacturer, to produce bicycles from recycled titanium
and plans to produce Norton BSA skis.
With little sign of Norton receiving its much needed cash injection, the
workforce called a meeting with Ms Skalbania and demanded action.
They told her that with working capital in short supply 'we are becoming
increasingly more concerned about the future of the company and more so, our
jobs'.
The developments have prompted concern among industry analysts, who
yesterday said they were pessimistic about Norton's survival.
'Norton's future depended on selling the brand name, but that's not
happened,' said one analyst. 'I'd be surprised if there was anything left to
revive.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bulmer declines to Pounds 3.9m - Loss on
disposal of pectin side and UK provisions total Pounds 17.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP Bulmer, the Hereford cider maker which recently announced further
restructuring plans including a withdrawal from the soft drinks market,
yesterday reported a sharp decline in full-year pre-tax profits reflecting
exceptional write-offs.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 3.88m in the year to April
29. The latest pre-tax figure was struck after the group recorded a Pounds
9.76m loss on the disposal of its pectin manufacturing interests, announced
in November, and took a Pounds 7.84m provision to cover the fundamental
restructuring of its UK operations, announced in May.
However, profits before exceptional items increased by 9.8 per cent to
Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 19.6m) reflecting the strength of the group's brands in
the UK, Australia and Belgium, markets which have all faced increased
competition and pressure on margins. In spite of these pressures operating
margins from drinks activities continued to improve from 9.5 per cent to
10.4 per cent.
Turnover edged up by 1 per cent to Pounds 254.6m (Pounds 251.8m) including
Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 12.5m) from discontinued operations. The modest rise in
turnover masked strong growth from the group's cider business which
compensated for a decline in soft drinks following the termination of the
Perrier/Buxton mineral water distribution agreement in March.
After a reduced tax charge there were losses per share of 0.89p compared
with earnings of 22.89p. In spite of this, the directors are recommending an
increased 6.8p (6.4p) final dividend making a total for the year of 10.8p
(10.15p).
The shares closed 1p lower at 364p.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the results were 'a satisfactory
performance in a competitive market.' He noted that the group's share of the
important draught cider market in the UK continued to grow, reaching 55 per
cent last year.
Bulmer's on-trade volumes expanded by 3 per cent while buoyant Strongbow
sales in the off-trade helped the group to boost volumes by 6 per cent in
spite of strong growth at the economy end of the market.
In the premium sector, Scrumpy Jack's 40 per cent year-on-year growth
substantially outstripped sector growth of 12 per cent.
Bulmer's beer portfolio volumes increased modestly within a market that
continues to be highly competitive.
Operating profits from the Australian business rose 25 per cent to Pounds
2.97m, while in its first full year Cidrerie Stassen in Belgium produced
operating profits of Pounds 1.34m.
COMMENT
Bulmer's decision in May to restructure its business with the loss of up to
300 jobs is a sensible response to the competitive pressures in the domestic
cider market which nevertheless is continuing to grow. The move will
eventually take about Pounds 6.5m out of annual costs - funds which are
expected to be reinvested at least in part in the group's solid brand
portfolio. Overseas activities, including export sales from Hereford, now
represent 21 per cent of group operating profits and the company is looking
to increase this further. This year Bulmer's pre-tax profits should reach
Pounds 24m producing earnings of 29p. The shares are trading on a
prospective multiple of 12.55 and look fairly priced.

FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques stake agreement expires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The standstill agreement between Control Techniques and Emerson Electric of
the US, which holds 29.37 per cent of the Powys-based electronic drives and
controls company, expired yesterday.
Under the agreement, struck in 1991, Emerson undertook not to increase its
shareholding in Control Techniques. Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman of Control
Techniques, said yesterday he was 'not aware of Emerson's intentions.' The
US company was unavailable for comment.
However, Control Techniques said it was holding talks with Emerson over the
US company's 20 per cent stake in CT Drives, the drives systems manufacturer
based in Grand Island, New York. Control Techniques acquired 80 per cent of
CT Drives from Emerson in 1991.
Under the agreement, Control Techniques had the option to increase its stake
in CT Drives, payable in cash or shares.
Control Techniques said it understood that Emerson did not wish to take up
the option to lift its stake, which would trigger a takeover bid for it by
the US company.
Control Techniques shares closed 9p down at 394p.
Pre-tax profits at Control Techniques in the six months to March 31, were
Pounds 3.84m after US reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000. In the
comparable period profits were Pounds 3.72m after reorganisation costs of
Pounds 200,000.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Resisting the bait of equity ownership: A look at the lack
of a share culture in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For deep-seated social, psychological, legal and political reasons Germans
have a problem with shares.
They don't like buying or dealing in them, they don't like shares in their
companies traded on the stock market, and they often can't talk about shares
except in an emotional and illogical way, complains Mr Rolf Breuer.
The chairman of the German Stock Exchange and a member of the board of
managing directors at Deutsche Bank laments the absence of an 'equity
culture' in Germany.
Only 6 per cent of German households own shares, compared with more than 20
per cent in the UK or the US; there are only about 665 quoted companies in
Germany compared with more than 2,000 in the UK; and the market
capitalisation of the German stock market amounts to 25 per cent of GDP -
against 75 per cent in Japan and the US and 127 per cent in the UK.
'This (lack of an equity culture) is a big and growing disadvantage for
Germany at a time of increasing competition between the world's financial
markets,' says Mr Breuer. 'Capital flows to wherever it finds the most
attractive home - that is true both for multinational companies seeking to
raise funds and for international investors looking for somewhere to put
their money.'
By these criteria, Germany's underdeveloped equity market is in the
international 'second division', Mr Breuer complains, with the risk that big
German companies will seek to raise finance in markets outside Germany and
international investors will divert funds elsewhere.
The evidence of this is low liquidity by international standards, an absence
of domestic institutional investors, a hostility to financial innovation, an
unthinking preference on the part of German savers for government bonds, and
an unhelpful tax regime, according to the head of Deutsche Bank's securities
operations.
Such a litany of weaknesses raises the question: what is to be done to
strengthen the German financial markets so that they enjoy a role
commensurate with Germany's position as Europe's leading industrial power?
Help is on the way from the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz - the
Financial Markets Promotion Act due to take effect on August 1 - which will
introduce international standards of regulation for the German financial
markets.
The law, first mooted in January 1992 and passed by parliament this month,
introduces measures to bolster the Finanzplatz - Germany as a financial
centre. The new law will:
make insider dealing a criminal offence; create a regulatory body for the
German securities markets, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur den Wertpapierhandel.
This will evolve into a version of the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission
(SEC), policing financial markets;
require quoted companies to publish details of shareholdings in other
companies when they reach 5 per cent, rather than 25 per cent at present.
Other rules will require prompt publication of price-sensitive information;
allow the reduction of the nominal value of shares from DM50 to DM5, helping
to enhance the attractiveness of equities by reducing the top-heavy share
prices of some big German companies;
facilitate the introduction of money market funds, a form of short-term
investment vehicle which is popular in the US and France, but hitherto
banned in Germany because of the Bundesbank's worries about the impact on
monetary policy.
However, the provisions are not enough to rectify the weaknesses in the
German markets overnight, Mr Breuer concedes, although he says the insider
dealing law will help to enhance the image of Germany as a financial centre.
He accepts that it has long been anomalous for insider dealing to be
permitted in Germany, but is adamant that insider dealing in Germany has
been on a small scale compared with Anglo-American excesses.
'There is not and never has been much insider dealing in Germany,' he
contends. 'But foreign investors have always had the impression that Germany
is a wild west.'
Mr Breuer also thinks the new disclosure rules will encourage greater
transparency in the German equity market, and welcomes the creation of the
German SEC. However, he admits that the structure of the new institution -
which will introduce three levels of supervision of German stock markets -
is not ideal, adding that it will take until 'the middle of next year' for
the new body to be up and running.
More must be done if Germany is to develop an equity culture, Mr Breuer
says. His agenda for action falls into two categories.
First, he would like to strengthen the legal infrastructure further with the
introduction of rules for takeovers in Germany, preferably modelled on the
UK's non-statutory Takeover Code.
The main purpose of such a code would be to give rights to minority
shareholders, whose interests are often neglected. 'If we are to have an
equity culture in Germany the small investor has to participate.'
Mr Breuer says a draft code will be presented to the Bonn Finance Ministry
later this year.
Second, he wants to introduce further reforms to the German Stock Exchange
'with the aim of ensuring that anyone who wants to do business in D-Mark
denominated securities does it via the German market and not in London.
'Ten per cent of turnover in blue-chip German shares is done in London, and
that is 10 per cent too much]'
Part of the problem is that liquidity in share trading is still divided
between seven separate stock exchanges in Germany, Mr Breuer says. But the
creation of the Deutsche Borse - the German Stock Exchange - at the
beginning of last year was a big step forward.
'Everything connected with securities dealing is now under one roof, from
dealing and settlement to software development and clearing,' he says. 'To
have it all together like this gives us a tremendous competitive advantage.
We can streamline investments, pool our resources and develop technology
much more effectively than our rivals.'
Mr Breuer says the focus of development in the next few years will be
investment in new technology to expand on the Ibis dealing system (which
captured 30 per cent of the market in German blue-chip stocks last year) -
and an attempt to forge closer co-operation between Frankfurt, the biggest
exchange in Germany, and its six regional rivals.
These efforts alone will not lead to the sudden development of an 'equity
culture' in Germany, Mr Breuer concedes. The biggest obstacle lies in
people's attitudes. 'When it comes to shares we have a mental problem on the
side of both investors and entrepreneurs.'
Those attitudes are changing and the Financial Markets Promotion Act is
likely to accelerate that change.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Sky to offer up to five new satellite TV services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sky Television is planning to launch a number of new television services,
possibly as many as five, over the next few months.
The satellite television venture yesterday announced the first of the new
services - a second Sky Sports package which will be launched on August 19.
Also under consideration is a travel channel, an education channel and a
science fiction channel.
The aim is to take a number of programme services from cable television to
strengthen Sky's Multi-Channel package of subscription channels.
The new services could also lead to an increase in the prices of some of Sky
subscription packages. At the moment all the services offered by Sky
Television cost Pounds 19.99 a month.
Sky declined to comment on whether prices would change once the new services
were introduced.
The new line-up is not likely to be complete channels. The services will
almost certainly be segments of programming added to the total Sky package
by splitting existing channels.
To begin with, for example, Sky Sports 2 will only broadcast at weekends.
The new sports service will give schedulers an extra 50 hours of airtime to
broadcast more live sport and documentaries.
The new weekend service will be free to existing Sky Sports subscribers.
Sky Television is owned by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.

FT  14 JUL 94 / France makes progress on the sale of Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday took a step towards the privatisation of
Renault, announcing that it was preparing to select banks to advise on the
'eventual opening of the capital' of the vehicle maker.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the decision was not an
announcement of Renault's privatisation. But his statement suggests that the
government is pressing ahead with plans to implement at least a partial
privatisation of the flagship public-sector company, which is valued at
about FFr40bn (Pounds 4.7bn).
Last month, Mr Philippe Auberger, a senior member of the National Assembly's
finance committee, said that the government was considering a partial
privatisation, but no decision had been taken and such an operation would be
unlikely before October or November.
Mr Alphandery said the role of adviser would be open to both French and
foreign banks. Competition for this mandate is expected to be fierce.
Renault is one of the 21 public sector companies slated for sale by the
centre-right government. But the timing has remained uncertain since the
collapse of plans to merge Renault and Volvo, the Swedish vehicles group, at
the end of last year.
During negotiations with the Swedish company, the French government had
committed itself to privatise Renault by the end of this year. The failure
of the merger plan, however, and the dismantling of much of the existing
alliance between the two companies, has complicated the privatisation
timetable.
Industry observers believe the government, which holds 80 per cent of
Renault's shares - Volvo holds the rest - is now leaning towards gradual
privatisation, which could start before next spring's presidential
elections.
'It seems possible that they might want to sell a stake of up to 25 per cent
as the first step,' said one industry analyst in Paris. But it seemed they
had 'not yet made up their minds and might still go for a full-blown sale'.
The sale is complicated by political sensitivities. The Confederation
Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, has expressed opposition -
Renault has been a symbol of state-ownership since the end of the second
world war.
Volvo's stake is also a factor, although a privatisation might provide it
with an opportunity to reduce its holding.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Owners Abroad sees gains for small groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large tour operators are failing to increase market share through their
ownership of travel agency chains, according to Mr Francis Baron, chief
executive of the holiday group Owners Abroad.
Mr Baron, whose group has financial links with Thomas Cook travel agents,
said yesterday that independent tour operators appeared to be gaining an
increased share of the overseas package holiday market.
While large travel agents were concentrating on selling their parent
companies' holidays, they were reluctant to sell those of rival large
groups, but happier to sell the holidays of smaller tour operators which did
not own travel agent chains.
The Office of Fair Trading has been investigating the links between large
tour operators and travel agents after complaints from independent companies
that they were having difficulty selling their holidays. Thomson, the
largest tour operator, owns Lunn Poly, the leading travel retailer.
Airtours, the second largest operator, owns Going Places, the second biggest
chain.
Despite Mr Baron's comments yesterday, he has criticised large tour
operators for giving cash payments to staff in their subsidiary travel
agents as an inducement to sell their holidays. He has said Owners Abroad's
links with Thomas Cook do not provide the same advantages.
Mr Baron's remarks came after Owners Abroad surpassed City expectations by
reporting a pre-tax loss of Pounds 29.3m for the six months to April 30,
down 24 per cent. Holiday companies usually record first-half losses.
The group's performance was improved by the acquisition in February of
International Travel Holdings, the Canadian tour operator. Owners Abroad
previously owned a 25 per cent stake.
Canadian holidaymakers tend to take their holidays during the northern
hemisphere winter. As UK holidaymakers prefer to travel abroad in the
summer, the Canadian acquisition helped to reduce Owners Abroad's winter
losses.
Mr Baron said that Owners Abroad had substantially regained the market share
it lost in the wake of management changes last year. He said that since his
appointment last November, the group's share of the summer 1994 market had
risen from 9.5 per cent to 11.6 per cent in May.
While prices remained competitive, Mr Baron thought a summer price war
unlikely.
Turnover rose 46 per cent to Pounds 228m. Cash balances increased 39 per
cent to Pounds 86.8m. The loss per share fell to 13.8p from 17.4p and the
interim dividend is an unchanged 1.4p.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Warning of extra building society risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit rating agencies believe the UK government's plans to give building
societies greater freedom could increase the risk profile of societies.
IBCA, the European rating agency, said the plans, announced last week by the
Treasury, had potentially negative implications for societies.
While IBCA said it was not revising its positive view of societies 'for the
moment', it appeared more conscious of the mistakes societies might make as
a result of the changes than of the benefits to them.
The government intends to allow societies to raise up to 50 per cent of
their funds on the wholesale money markets; to wholly own a general
insurance subsidiary dealing with house-related lines of insurance; and to
carry out limited lending to businesses without it being secured against
land.
Moody's Investors Services, the US rating agency, was wary about the use
societies might make of the new powers which, by definition, would raise
their risk profile. 'Our ratings are stable but our outlook is cautious,' it
said yesterday.
Moody's highlighted the prospect of greater risk if societies increased the
amounts they raised on the wholesale money markets in terms of short-term,
confidence-sensitive funding.
A report from IBCA focused on the increase in risk from moving into general
insurance, and expressed scepticism about the merits of a building society
lending to businesses.
IBCA's doubt about the wisdom of societies' lending to business reflects the
general view among society chief executives. But the agency's reaction to
the proposal on general insurance is gloomier than that of the sector, which
has welcomed the proposal.
IBCA argued that general insurance in the UK 'has been almost characterised
by its unprofitability', and suggested societies might make losses as well
as profits in the increasingly competitive market.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Santer declares himself ready to succeed Delors: Luxembourg
PM not favoured in poll of MEPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID MARSH AND ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister who has risen from rank
outsider to frontrunner to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission, yesterday declared himself available for the job.
But as momentum behind the Santer candidacy appeared to be increasing, a
Financial Times poll of newly-elected members of the European Parliament
showed little enthusiasm. Euro MPs must vet the choice of Commission
president next week.
Mr Santer - viewed as a safe but uninspiring choice - said yesterday he
would accept the post on condition that the other 11 member states reach a
consensus on appointing him.
However, an FT telephone survey of 150 members of the 567-strong European
parliament showed he was well down the list of candidates favoured by the
Strasbourg assembly. Under Article 158 of the Maastricht treaty, heads of
government are allowed to nominate the Commission chief only 'after
consulting the European parliament'.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany - current holder of the rotating EU
presidency - meets parliamentary leaders tomorrow.
Leading members of the Strasbourg assembly doubt that parliament would
oppose Mr Santer. Since he represents the Social Democratic end of the
Christian Democrat political spectrum, he is likely to gain support among
the two main political groupings at Strasbourg.
However, the lack of enthusiasm displayed for Mr Santer in the FT poll,
conducted by telephone between July 8 and 13, indicates the possibility of
setbacks next week. The survey, conducted among a sample of 59 Socialist
MEPs, 52 Christian Democrat-leaning members, 11 Liberals, five Greens and 23
assorted and unattached members - puts Mr Santer in joint eighth place in
the list of favoured candidates.
Mr Delors and Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Italian prime minister, topped the
poll. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Mr Ruud Lubbers and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
Belgian, Dutch and Spanish prime ministers, as well as Mr Peter Sutherland,
the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also
precede Mr Santer in the list.
In London, most Conservative Euro-sceptics are quietly resigned to accepting
Mr Santer as a candidate. Some Tory sceptics yesterday said they would ask
Mr Bill Cash, leader of the anti-federalist European Movement, to mount a
campaign to stop Mr Santer succeeding Mr Delors. However, Mr Cash said: 'The
key thing is the policies not the personality.'
Mr Santer is credited by the British government with drafting key passages
in the Maastricht treat which allowed the UK an opt-out from the Social
Chapter.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Brussels fines carton-board price-fixers a record Pounds
104m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday imposed record fines on 19 carton-board
producers which had allegedly formed what it described as Europe's 'most
pernicious' price-fixing cartel.
Suppliers of carton-board in western Europe face fines totalling Ecu132.15m
(Pounds 104.27m) with the cartel's 'ringleaders' bearing the brunt.
Iggesund, the packaging unit of the Swedish forestry products group MoDo,
will pay the biggest single sum of Ecu22.75m. All 19 companies must pay the
fines within the next three months.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said 'the massive cartel'
flagrantly violated European laws. The commission described how participants
met in luxury Swiss hotels to agree price rises and concealed their
activities by drawing up bogus minutes of their meetings.
Exercising strict discipline and making virtually no written notes, the
companies were said to have carefully orchestrated price increases every six
months. Having decided what the market could bear, one company would lift
prices, followed on agreed dates by the others.
On each occasion, between 1987 and 1990, prices rose by 6-10 per cent. The
commission said that often the increases were forced through against
'determined customer resistance' and in spite of a fall in raw materials
prices.
The companies involved are: Buchmann, Europa Carton, Gruber &amp; Weber,
Laakmann and Moritz J Weig of Germany, Cascades and Papeteries de Lancey of
France, Enso-Gutzeit and Finnboard of Finland, Fyskeby, MoDo and Stora of
Sweden, BPB De Eendracht and KNP BT of the Netherlands, Mayr-Melnhof of
Austria, Rena of Norway, Sarrio of Italy, SCA Holding of the UK, and Enso
Espanola of Spain.
The cartel was uncovered in a series of unannounced inspections carried out
simultaneously by the commission in April 1991 after complaints by British
and French carton users' trade associations. In August, Stora, which had
recently taken over the German producer of carton-board Feldmuhle - a
ringleader of the cartel - came clean with the commission.
The case is the third incident in which a cartel has been fined by the
European Commission this year for distorting competition in the single
market.
In February, Brussels fined 14 steel producers more than Ecu100m for price
fixing and market sharing.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Jobs and prices figures boost confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further fall in unemployment and slightly lower than expected inflation
last month confirmed recent signs that the UK economy is maintaining steady
growth while keeping prices under control.
The subdued inflation numbers yesterday boosted confidence in the London
equity market, as an imminent increase in short-term interest rates appeared
less likely. The FT-SE 100 Index climbed back over 3,000, finishing 41.4
higher at 3,005.3.
The retail prices index was unchanged in June, leaving the annual rate at
2.6 per cent, the same as in May, the Central Statistical Office said.
Underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, fell slightly to
2.4 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in May. The fall brings underlying inflation
back down into the lower half of the government's target range of 1-4 per
cent.
Reductions in the prices of second-hand cars and personal articles, such as
spectacles, were offset by rises in beer prices and bus fares. Prices of
seasonal food and clothing (due to the summer sales) also fell, but by less
than they did in June 1993.
Fears that wage increases would feed through into price rises later in the
year were eased by figures from the Department of Employment, which showed
that the annual growth rate in average earnings was 3.75 per cent in May,
the same as in April.
City bonuses pushed the annual growth rate of earnings up to 4 per cent in
March, but the effect of those payments has gradually dropped out of the
underlying number, which is based on a three-month average. May's underlying
figure excludes a one-off payment in the coal and coke industries which
pushed the seasonally adjusted rate up to 4.3 per cent, from 3.6 per cent in
April.
Unemployment, as measured by people claiming benefits, fell for the fifth
consecutive month by a seasonally adjusted 18,800 in June, to stand at
2.64m, or 9.4 per cent of the workforce.
However, these figures were greeted with scepticism by opposition
politicians and union leaders who claimed that declining unemployment
reflected falling participation in the labour market, rather than jobs
growth.
These doubts were echoed by analysts in the City, who said the 148,000 fall
in unemployment since January did not appear to be matched by a
corresponding growth in employment. Although manufacturing employment grew
by 2,000 in May, hours worked in manufacturing fell to the lowest level for
over a decade.

FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market seemed comforted by Owners Abroad's reduced interim loss. But
that is not necessarily good news. Bigger losses for tour operators at the
half-way stage often point to an increase in capacity and higher annual
profits. Owners' figures, though, are muddied by its increased Canadian
exposure which counters the seasonality of UK package tours. The link-up
with Thomas Cook also makes it hard to gauge what is happening to the
underlying business. Nevertheless, Owners appears to be making good progress
cutting costs and reinvigorating its operations. Its forthcoming re-branding
exercise will be critical for the second phase of recovery.
Owners' revival is made easier by the strong holiday market, with bookings
up 13 per cent so far this year compared with 1993. BAA's passenger figures
yesterday also confirmed how many Britons are joining the holiday brigade.
But the real test for Owners will come when the market tightens again. The
benign theory of the industry's future suggests that may not happen for a
time. The big three operators, which control well over half the market, have
grown sensible and sophisticated and averse to price wars. Besides, the
industry is maturing and the barriers to entry are rising. More stable
industry earnings should therefore be rated more highly by the stock market
than in the past. But such arguments have been advanced before and
confounded by experience. It still takes a leap of faith to regard tour
operators as dependable investments.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Cruickshank, the UK telecoms regulator, yesterday ticked Mercury
Communications off for being shrill. He is right. The company's latest
campaign about unfair regulatory treatment sounds like special pleading.
Mercury has been cossetted during its 10 years of existence by paying
artificially low prices for use of BT's network. That may have been
appropriate to give the company an initial leg-up. Some assistance to the
latest batch of telecoms players is also reasonable. But, at some point, the
subsidy has to stop.
The snag is that Mercury has not used the seven years when it was BT's only
licensed competitor wisely. Instead of differentiating its services from
BT's and building a sustainable competitive advantage, it offered a slightly
cheaper but similar service. It exploits the wide gap between the wholesale
prices it has paid for using BT's network and BT's high long-distance
charges. Mercury is now facing a two-way squeeze. BT is cutting its
long-distance charges, while the network usage fees are going up.
This is not to say that the ungainly regime which governs network fees is
perfect. The system exists because BT is not allowed for political reasons
to charge customers the full cost of having a telephone line. If the
government had political courage, it would scrap that restriction. But so
long as it exists, Mercury does itself no favours by moaning. It would do
better, even late in the day, to try to build a sustainable competitive
advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The picture of steady, non-inflationary growth painted by the Treasury's
summer forecast has survived this week's batch of economic figures. The
small drop in underlying inflation last month was no more than financial
markets expected. More importantly, after the scares earlier in the year,
there is no sign of upward pressure on average earnings. Add in the good
news on wholesale prices - manufacturers are not passing on higher raw
materials costs to customers - and the inflationary threat looks remote.
The lingering worry is that the economy might accelerate through the second
half of the year. Yet straws in the wind hint that the Treasury's forecast
of 2.75 per cent growth this year is not unduly conservative. Overtime
working fell unexpectedly in May, while the modest drop in unemployment in
June does not smack of overheating. It may be that tax rises and higher bond
yields have been just enough to take the inflationary edge off recovery. The
rise in gilt yields looks all the more ferocious against the background of
yesterday's comforting data.
The sharp rally in gilts this week may mark a realisation that real yields
have risen far enough. If that brighter mood can be sustained, equities will
also have more headroom. With the FT-SE 100 index breaking back through 3000
yesterday, the equity market again looks inclined to take its lead from the
promising fundamentals. But the FT-SE climbed higher than this last month
only to plunge with international markets, and not that much has changed in
the domestic economy since.

FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: CBS switches channels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Comcast's move to acquire QVC certainly scores high marks for audacity. Its
Dollars 2.2bn bid has already scotched the home shopping channel's rival
plan to merge with CBS. Whether it is also a smart move is unclear. If
Comcast flushes out a third bidder, it will be able to cash in its 15 per
cent stake at a handsome profit. But if it ends up controlling QVC and
chairman Mr Barry Diller - whose star status has boosted QVC's value -
walks, the price-tag may look steep.
Though Mr Diller's intentions are unknown, it is clear he feels QVC on its
own is an insufficient vehicle for his talents - hence his plans to acquire
Paramount and merge with CBS. With both schemes dead, Mr Diller could cash
in his QVC shares and options. He could then cast around for another vehicle
into which to inject both his talent and his capital. An accommodation with
Comcast cannot be ruled out - though it would presumably have to involve
turning QVC into something grander than a home-shopping channel.
Meanwhile, CBS may now receive attention from other suitors. Chairman Mr
Larry Tisch has done nothing to discourage the impression that he would
welcome offers. Yesterday's decision by CBS to buy back Dollars 1.1bn of its
own shares is a sign that Mr Tisch is looking to cash in his large stake. He
has even given interested parties a price to aim at. Anything over the
buy-back price of Dollars 325 a share would presumably be acceptable. The
problem is that CBS has effectively been up for sale for some time and the
only suitor to emerge has been Mr Diller. If Mr Tisch really wants out, he
may have to lower his price.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: It's the yen more than the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intervention in the foreign exchange market by governments and central banks
may or may not be justified. But to have a chance of success at least three
criteria must be fulfilled:
It must, if necessary, be massive. Nothing is worse than half-hearted
intervention which merely gives the speculators a taste of blood.
It must be multilateral. At the very least, the authorities of both the
strong and the weak currencies should take part.
It needs to be backed by domestic policies. Either the country with the weak
currency should tighten its monetary policy - that is, increase interest
rates - or the country with the strong currency should loosen monetary
policy; or, best of all, both should move.
There was no chance of these conditions being fulfilled at the time of the
Group of Seven summit at Naples in the case of the dollar. The German
authorities were determined not to intervene to support the US currency. But
the problem is more a dollar-yen one; and joint action by the American and
Japanese authorities was not on the cards either.
The situation may always change if exchange rates move towards panic points
 -what these are have probably not been determined in advance. Central
bankers are now under a lot of pressure to intervene to prevent 'disorderly
markets'; but they will simply be making capital losses for their countrymen
unless they are to implement the three conditions. Anything less will be
worse than useless.
Meanwhile, it would help to clarify thought if we could establish whether
the main trend has been a weak dollar or a strong yen. In the aftermath of
the recent inconclusive summit, market operators merely noticed the dollar
falling against all-comers and the yen rising. But a longer, cooler look
makes it clear that the main development has been a rising yen.
Indeed, the dollar has not been all that weak if examined over a reasonable
period. There are many ways of demonstrating this fact. One of the most
illuminating is to look at the track record of the dollar against the
D-Mark.
In the early and middle 1980s, it was violently unstable. But since the
much-maligned Louvre Agreement of early 1987, the exchange rate between the
two currencies has rarely strayed more than 10 per cent on either side of
DM1.6 to the dollar. Indeed, the dollar's rate against the D-Mark was more
favourable the day after last weekend's Naples summit than it was at its
1990, 1991 and 1992 low points.
The relative stability of the dollar against the D-Mark thus suggests that
the problems have come from the yen side. This is confirmed by looking at
the yen's movement against the dollar, which is marked both by medium-term
instability and a strong trend in favour of the yen and against the dollar.
An alternative way of showing the yen's strength, not involving the dollar
at all, is to look at the yen/D-Mark exchange rate. This important, but
neglected, cross-rate shows the D-Mark falling from a high of more than Y90
at the beginning of 1991 to a low of less than Y60 this year. The move can
be seen as a 50 per cent appreciation of the yen, or a 33 per cent
depreciation of the D-Mark. It has undoubtedly helped Germany to compete in
world markets despite a post-unification upsurge in domestic costs.
These conclusions are confirmed by the trade-weighted indices. Contrary to
popular impression, there has been little trend either way in either the
D-Mark or dollar index in the last three and a half years. The yen, on the
other hand, has shot upwards, although it previously reached something near
to its present level in the summer of 1993.
Japan has had lower inflation than the other G7 countries, but the
discrepancy has not been nearly enough to offset the rising yen. Profit
margins have been squeezed and export prices have fallen severely in yen
terms in 1993 and 1994. Yet whatever yardstick is chosen, the yen has had a
large real, as well as nominal, appreciation in the last few years.
This appreciation has undoubtedly contributed to the severity of the
Japanese recession. The retardation of gross domestic product has to be
judged not just in relation to other countries, but in relation to the much
higher trend previously seen in Japan.
If one looks at industrial production, such analytical contortions are
unnecessary. The absolute fall here has been much greater in Japan than in
both the US and Germany. There are some indications of a slight recovery;
but it will have to go a very long way before the trend rate of growth is
recaptured. Indeed, the OECD projections show Japanese growth as among the
most sluggish of the G7 in the next couple of years.
The strength of the yen should put into perspective the facile belief that a
currency's position is always closely linked with politics. For Japan has
the most unstable government of all the G7 countries and the most uncertain
political future, yet the strongest currency.
The continuing Japanese external surplus is not on its own a sufficient
explanation either. There is nothing new in the high Japanese propensity to
save. The novel factor, which is helping to pull the yen upwards, is the
growing disinclination to invest the surplus abroad.
Irrespective of the precise diagnosis, the policy implications are pretty
clear. Although it remains debatable when or how far US monetary policy
ought to be tightened, it is clear that Japanese monetary policy should be
loosened further. It will obviously help if Japan's finance ministry shelves
indefinitely its plans for indirect tax increases to offset the recent
direct tax reductions. But it is not enough to continue to rely on fiscal
packages, which are seen as temporary.
It may be asked how Japan can loosen monetary policy further when the
official discount rate since last September has been at 1 3/4 per cent - a
post-1945 low - and three-month market rates have averaged about 2 per cent.
The discount rate can indeed be cut further and there are rumours that this
is likely to happen. But if this is not enough, the short answer is to
increase the supply of yen. If Japanese investors are not in a borrowing
mood, the Bank of Japan can increase the supply of yen by issuing them to
buy up dollars and other currencies in the foreign exchange markets (a
process known as 'unsterilised intervention').
The country with a strong currency that is gaining reserves has an
open-ended ability to intervene, which it is well advised to use so long as
it is more afraid of deflation than inflation. The onus is on Japan to
depreciate the yen more than on the US to support the dollar.
The benefits of so doing would clearly make themselves felt to Japanese
business. If the Japanese authorities can reverse the movement of the yen,
the prices of internationally traded products in Japanese markets will start
to rise. Thus, real interest rates would fall and could perhaps become
negative, so helping economic recovery.
The needed US contribution is mainly political and psychological. If
Washington does nothing, markets may fear that it will go back to its old
policy of talking down the dollar against the yen for the sake of US
exporters. Markets will also worry that American trade negotiators may make
direct threats which will unsettle sentiment further. The statements from US
commerce secretary Ron Brown are hardly reassuring here. So any gestures
which show the US in support of Japanese actions will help.
Nor is there any reason to withhold this help. A monetary relaxation in
Japan will give just the boost to the world economy and to American exports
that Washington is supposed to be seeking.

Chris Moncrieff, the Press Association's political editor retiring after 32
years at Westminster, told guests at a lunch staged in his honour yesterday
of the time when Sir Denis Thatcher was unceremoniously deprived of his copy
of the FT.
Margaret Thatcher had a glossy magazine in her hand as she was about to
leave 10 Downing Street shortly after her third general election triumph in
1987.
Alerted that a battery of photographers was assembled outside, she grabbed
the FT from Sir Denis and hid the magazine inside it. 'You didn't see that,'
she told Moncrieff, and, until yesterday, he duly obliged.

Bristol &amp; West Building Society is so concerned to take the public's views
into account that it commissioned research to find out what people wanted
from a mortgage. It found that the public was not seduced by the various
cashback schemes which have cluttered the market recently but looked at a
mortgage in terms of monthly payments. How wise of the society then to
launch a new range of mortgages on the basis of those findings; how sad,
however, for existing B&amp;W borrowers who find that the standard variable rate
they pay is - at 7.89 per cent - the highest charged by any of the ten
largest societies.

While the world is exercised about the vaulting price of coffee, scant

key ingredient in methylated spirits was going for less than DM200 per tonne
last year; it now costs over DM550 per tonne.
Although it is best known as a cheap if unpalatable alternative to whisky,
meths is now an essential ingredient in unleaded petrol. Another sign that
the price of supermarket petrol may soon be heading in the same direction as
the price of supermarket coffee?

Talking of Gaston Thorn, president during a period of deep Euro-sclerosis .

distinguished participant in the depths of an interminable meeting in the
Berlaymont building, or possibly in the Charlemagne, next door. It runs
roughly as follows:
'When a meeting is chaired by
G. Thorn,
It is certain to last until dawn.
He's mumbling and bumbling
and continually fumbling,
And the whole thing is one
bloody yawn.'
A bottle of finest malt for the most inspired guess as to the author of the

Sir Leon Brittan should think about changing the title of his lunchtime
speech at the Policy Studies Institute in London tomorrow. Instead of 'What
next for Europe?', a much more appropriate theme would be 'What next for
Leon?', particularly since just a few hours later, in Brussels, EU leaders
are set to choose Brittan's next boss.
Everyone knows that Luxembourg's Jacques Santer is the hot favourite to take
over Jacques Delors' job as president of the European Commission.
He's the dark horse candidate who has made late strides after better-known
candidates such as Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, Belgian premier
Jean-Luc Dehaene, and Sir Leon himself were either blocked or dropped out of
the race.
But while the prospect of Santer's arrival in Brussels has dismayed some
senior Commission officials who remember the uninspired reign of fellow
Luxembourger Gaston Thorn in the early 1980s, it may not entirely displease
Sir Leon, the competition commissioner.
As a student of German politics, he would no doubt recall the immortal words
of the Bavarian heavyweight Franz-Josef Strauss - a great power in the land
even though he never rose to be chancellor of Germany: 'Es ist mir egal wer
unter mir ist' (I don't care who is below me).

FT  14 JUL 94 / Personal View: Dear rural dweller, you must pay more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's favoured option for the future of the Post Office - to
sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail to the private sector - is to be
welcomed. It will give the Post Office management the freedom it needs to
compete in the international communications market. At present the business
is shackled by political restrictions, particularly access to new capital.
However, the proposal does not go far enough. For ministers have declared
that the uniform charge for letter delivery will stay, whatever the outcome
of the government's current review.
Undoubtedly it would be highly controversial if the common charge went. But
it is difficult to see how competition can develop fully unless competitive
pricing is allowed. At present the Royal Mail cross-subsidises within the
letters business, a practice that is not compatible with big geographical
differences in delivery costs in an unregulated competitive market.
The argument for cost-based charging is straightforward. At present, when
services are priced below the true cost of supply, the value which marginal
customers place on the service - as represented by the price they are
willing to pay - is lower than the cost of the service in terms of the
resources used to provide it. The opposite applies where services are priced
above marginal cost.
There is a case for reducing the supply and raising the price where prices
are currently below marginal cost; and for raising supply and cutting
charges where prices are higher. As costs of letter collection and delivery
are much lower in urban areas than in remote, rural regions, this would
cause prices to fall for town dwellers and rise in parts of the countryside.
The argument for a uniform price is concerned with what some see as the
'unfairness' of charging different consumers differently. Yet it is not
obvious why it should be applied to postal services and not to other goods
and services seemingly just as vital to rural existence. Rural areas suffer
less frequent bus services; they have far fewer supermarkets and hence
higher food prices - arguably food is much more of a necessity than a
letter. Yet no one seriously argues that there should be uniform bus fares
and food prices.
The extent to which those in rural areas gain from uniform charging is, of
course, unclear. The present pricing system conceals the *something in here
(HP) *
amount of cross-subsidisation. There is no evidence, though, that
cross-subsidy goes from the 'rich' to the 'poor'. In any case, postal
charges exist to pay for a service, not provide a means to redistribute
income. This is the function of the tax and benefits system.
A cost-based charging system would open up the possibility of a more varied
service. At present, the uniform charge allows little variety in postal
services. Even those who would prefer a better service are given no
opportunity to pay for it, unless they resort to expensive premium services
such as Datapost.
Local authorities could seek to subsidise services to retain or improve the
quality of service (such as more daily deliveries) or reduce the postal
charge. Those in rural areas facing a higher tariff might prefer less
frequent deliveries and collections, say every other day, to keep the charge
down. Alternatively, they might prefer to collect their mail from the
village shop or garage, or have the mail delivered along with the daily milk
or newspaper. Already the milkman and the newsagent provide doorstep
deliveries. Is it necessary for the postman to visit, too?
The main benefit of previous privatisations came in reducing costs. This has
taken two forms: doing more efficiently what is already done; and doing new
things in new ways. The latter are what economists call 'dynamic' efficiency
gains. The government's privatisation proposal for the Royal Mail is a bold
first step, but many of the potential dynamic efficiencies will come only if
price signals are introduced into the market for letter deliveries. By
retaining a uniform postal charge, the potential gains from privatisation
are restricted.
When Rowland Hill introduced the 'penny post' in 1840, his aim was to
achieve political acceptability. Hill initially recommended a flat charge
between 'post towns' only, where he calculated that the costs of provision
were roughly uniform. It seems once again that the future of the Royal Mail
is to be determined by political necessity rather than sober economics.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Politicians and civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British civil service is justly famed for its impartiality and
objectivity. Such qualities are essential both in the task of administering
public services fairly and in providing high-quality advice on policy
matters to ministers. Yesterday's white paper on continuity and change in
Whitehall must therefore be largely judged by the degree to which it
preserves a non-political civil service that can serve governments of any
persuasion.
Much of the white paper contains good sense, extending to Whitehall the sort
of management reforms already imposed on public services, such as health and
education. Departments will be expected to improve the quality of the
services they provide, with higher performance targets set each year as part
of the Citizen's Charter. They will have to achieve these higher standards
with frozen running cost budgets, putting strong pressure on managers to
strive for efficiency.
To help them reconcile these conflicting demands, permanent secretaries are
to be given much greater freedom to manage. Departments will take
responsibility for the pay and grading of their staff, whose salaries
account for more than half of civil service costs. The cash-based Whitehall
accountancy system is to be replaced by resource-based accruals accounting,
to improve the management of current and capital resources. Managers will be
encouraged to draw on a range of management techniques, such as
market-testing, benchmarking and process re-engineering, to raise their
efficiency and effectiveness. Less day-to-day interference is promised by
the central departments, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office.
Best practice
In principle, such reforms are welcome. They reflect best practice in the
private sector. They have improved the quality of service in other parts of
the public sector and may be expected to do the same in Whitehall.
Also to be welcomed are the proposals to open the upper echelons of the
civil service to outsiders. The top managers in Whitehall who have come from
business or other parts of the public sector have contributed much to
improving standards. A greater interchange between the public and private
sectors is desirable, and will be assisted by the advertising of top jobs.
At the same time, young civil servants with ambitions to reach the top will
be encouraged to acquire experience outside Whitehall.
The most controversial proposals in the white paper are those for putting
some 3,000 top mandarins on personal contracts. The government has sensibly
decided against short-term contracts that would inevitably politicise the
civil service. But it has opted for indefinite contracts which spell out the
rights and responsibilities of top mandarins more clearly. The carrot is
higher pay for those that perform well; the stick is premature departure for
the under-achievers.
Increasing pressure
The white paper says that such contracts will put them on a par with their
counterparts in other walks of life. That may be so, but it is not difficult
to see undesirable consequences flowing from increasing pressure on civil
servants to satisfy the demands of their political masters. Mr William
Waldegrave, the donnish public services minister whose white paper it is,
may welcome robust challenges from his civil servants. But other ministers
appear less tolerant of intellectual dissent, as the recent premature
departure of two high-flying permanent secretaries indicates. And there is
no doubting the unhappiness among many senior Home Office mandarins over the
home secretary's unwillingness to listen to evidence that casts doubt on the
wisdom of his criminal law reforms.
If this reform is to go ahead, an independent appeals body is needed to
which civil servants can turn if they feel they have been badly treated by
their ministers. The present system of internal appeal up the management
chain, ultimately to Sir Robin Butler, the head of the civil service, is
inadequate. The fact that only one case has ever reached Sir Robin indicates
that civil servants have little confidence in the procedure. If the public
is to be assured that the government's shake-up in Whitehall will not
politicise the civil service, a genuinely independent appeals body is
essential.

When 2,000 US marines are stationed off a Caribbean country 'to protect
American personnel', that country should know what to expect. Signals from
Washington suggest, more concordantly than usual, that the countdown for an
invasion of Haiti has begun.
At first sight this seems strange. Why should President Clinton decide on an
invasion now, after 18 months of ducking and weaving and contradicting
himself? A substantial majority of Americans opposes military intervention
in Haiti. So do the Pentagon, at least part of the State Department, most of
the Republican party, most other Caribbean and Latin American governments,
many of the Americans still resident in Haiti whom the marines would
ostensibly be protecting, and - in public, anyway - the ousted Haitian
president whom an invasion would restore to power. Almost the only voices
calling for an invasion are those of the black caucus in Congress and,
increasingly, the inhabitants of Florida who fear an invasion of their state
by Haitian refugees.
Already UN sanctions, imposed in May at the US's request, have cut off all
legal commerce with Haiti and paralysed the economy of what is anyway the
poorest country in the western hemisphere. Should these sanctions not be
given 'time to work' before a resort to force?
Sanctions argument
That argument, familiar from the build-up to the Gulf war, does not take
account of the way that sanctions 'work', if and when they do. Rarely if
ever do they succeed on their own in persuading a government to change its
policy, or even prompt its supporters to overthrow it. What they can do is
to disorganise and demoralise a regime, gradually reducing its will to
withstand a violent onslaught from within or without. In Haiti's case they
have produced a renewed exodus of refugees. In the past the US sought to
label these as economic migrants, in order to avoid offering them asylum.
Now it attributes their flight to human rights violations. The latter are
real and numerous, but there can be no doubt that destitution aggravated by
sanctions is also a potent factor.
The US is desperately building temporary housing for the new refugees at
Guantanamo, its naval enclave in Cuba, and seeking 'safe haven' for them in
other Caribbean countries, whose populations do not want them any more than
Florida does. Mr Clinton cannot afford to let this crisis escalate
indefinitely. Nor can he revert to a more conciliatory policy without making
himself a complete laughing-stock. He has boxed himself into a situation
from which invasion may be the only way out.
Popular enthusiasm
If it comes, it will probably be greeted with initial popular enthusiasm in
Haiti. It will no doubt succeed in removing the three top military leaders
and restoring President Aristide to office. But if it stops there, it will
leave Mr Aristide with the problem that faced him before his expulsion in
1991: implacable opposition from the military and the ruling elite. Only a
much longer occupation, which would purge and disarm the police and army
down to NCO level and encourage the educated Haitian diaspora to return to
the country, with a coordinated package of economic and technical aid, would
give Haiti any real hope.
The US tried something like that in 1915, stayed for 19 increasingly bitter
years and left the country little better off at the end of it. This time,
following a precedent set in Somalia and now followed by France in Rwanda,
it is looking to other countries in the hemisphere to relieve it, under UN
auspices, once the initial, dramatic phase is over.
There might indeed be a case for making Haiti a UN protectorate or trust
territory, as there would have been for Bosnia and might be for a dozen or
more 'failed states' in various parts of the world. There is certainly a
case for any intervention being carried out under UN auspices rather than by
a great power acting alone - if only because of the dangerous precedent that
the latter would set. But the chances of an invasion being followed through
with sufficient generosity and clarity of purpose do not seem good. There is
still time for the Haitian junta to realise what is about to hit them, and
to hand over power voluntarily before it does.

DELORS: Inside the House that Jacques Built
By Charles Grant
Nicholas Brealey, Pounds 12.99, 310 pages
Last week Jacques Delors admitted on French television that he was rather
flattered by all the fuss surrounding the choice of his successor as
president of the European Commission.
As well he might be. Last month the UK government paid him the tribute of
declaring that so important had Delors made the presidency of the European
Union's executive that it was ready to risk a serious row with its European
Union partners over who should fill his shoes.
And it is a British journalist who has paid him the compliment of writing
the first serious book about him. Some skimpy tomes about Delors have
appeared in France, but none is the Compleat Delors that Charles Grant has
produced. It is, of course, Delors' decade in Brussels which has made him
famous, and on which Grant, as former Brussels correspondent for The
Economist, might have been expected to focus most. But Grant has also delved
meticulously into Delors' French upbringing and political career, and served
up a mixture of personal juice and intellectual fibre that makes for a most
satisfying meal.
What most intrigues Grant, and Delors' friends and enemies, are the man's
contradictions. 'He is a socialist trade unionist who once worked for a
Gaullist prime minister and who describes himself as a closet Christian
Democrat. He is a practising Roman Catholic who takes moral stances and
claims not to be ambitious; yet he is a crafty political tactician who
enjoys power and has held the Commission in an iron grip. He is a patriotic
Frenchman with a vision of a unified Europe.'
Thus, one face of 'Janus' Delors is modesty - he was the only socialist
minister in the early 1980s to live in a working-class part of Paris, and as
Commission president he sometimes takes meals with his chauffeur and
bodyguard. His other visage is that of the haughty Eurocrat, telling
national governments in 1988 that 'in 10 years' time 80 per cent of their
economic legislation will come from the EC', or telling French opponents of
Maastricht in 1992 to 'get out of politics'. Such careless outbursts
contrast with Delors' careful approach to important European negotiations.
Most of Delors' main achievements are well known - keeping France, when he
was its finance minister, within the European Monetary System; playing a
leading role in pushing through the 1986 Single European Act and increased
use of majority voting that paved the way for Lord Cockfield's single market
programme; and the launching of the move towards economic and monetary union
(Emu).
Grant is very revealing about the way that Delors has always paid court to
Germany in general and to Chancellor Kohl in particular, though one German,
Karl-Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, now regrets he sat
on the Delors' committee whose 1989 report paved the way for Emu. 'If I had
boycotted (the committee), I could not have stopped the process, but I might
have slowed it down,' Pohl has since told Grant.
But this book also recalls two other achievements. One is how Delors, by
pushing through his EU budget packages of 1988 and 1992, has spared the
Union, up until 1999, the mind-numbing arguments over money that prevailed
before 1988. The second is the European Economic Area (EEA). Delors' aim in
proposing this extension of the single market was to discourage a rush of
members from the European Free Trade Association applying to join the EU as
full members; he did not succeed. But should the Nordic countries fail this
year to get their peoples to approve EU membership, they will at least have
the EEA to fall back on.
On the minus side, Grant records Delors' disappointment in not getting the
EU to adopt his 'Euro-Colbertist' schemes for more R&amp;D spending, and
contrasts that failure with the success, largely unwelcome to Delors, of the
tougher EU competition policy that Sir Leon Brittan and Peter Sutherland
imposed. For the most part, however, Delors and his 'mafia' got their way in
Brussels, frequently riding rough-shod over others. Grant finds major fault
here. 'By the end of his reign, Delors' personal system of command and
control had begun to damage the Commission's internal organisation, sap the
enthusiasm of its officials and contribute to the tarnishing of its image.'
If that sounds a bit like Mrs Thatcher's eventual impact on her own
government, Grant intends it to be so. For, in a comparison neither would
appreciate, he likens Delors to Thatcher in his 'attention to ideas and
implementation, to ideology and to detail, to principle and power'.
How does Europe stand after Delors? Grant, perhaps wisely, offers few
predictions, except to say that Delorism/federalism will live on to do
battle with Thatcherism/Gaullism in the EU's 1996 review of the Maastricht
treaty.
He provides more clues about Delors' own future. Delors' wife, Marie,
apparently does not want him to run for president of France, while Delors
seems to believe his daughter, Martine, a former socialist minister, has a
better chance of entering the Elysee one day than he has. But the vacuum
created in the Socialist party by Michel Rocard's abrupt ousting could yet
suck him into France's presidential election campaign.
So will Delors chance his hand for another kind of presidency? Grant records
Delors' ambivalence about elected politics, and the attitude of the one man
who might prevail on him to run - Francois Mitterrand. In the words of an
Elysee aide, Mitterrand 'has a Darwinian view of the world: people must cope
on their own and take their chances. He won't arrange Delors' political
career for him. Delors has always been appointed to jobs, but the one job
you're not appointed to is the presidency. Mitterrand is not going to send
for him with four horses and a chariot'.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong route to reduce unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your reports ('The Group of Seven summit', July 11)
on the G7 summit in Naples, I very much welcome the fact that measures to
bring down unemployment have at last been placed high on the international
agenda after being spurned repeatedly during the Reagan-Thatcher years. Some
of the G7 proposals for job creation are also to be applauded. However, I am
concerned that so much emphasis is being placed, at least by the British
government, on deregulation of the labour market as a means of achieving
reduced unemployment.
All the talk of 'reduced labour market rigidities, lower indirect employment
costs and fewer regulations' can be translated as lower pay, more precarious
employment contracts, worse health and safety and a weakening of social
security. If the UK government hopes to convince the world's most advanced
economies to adopt the path of deregulation as a means of creating jobs, its
track record must surely undermine its credibility. After 15 years of
deregulation, privatisation, anti-union laws, reduced employment rights and
the growth of low pay, we have 3m unemployed compared to 1m in 1979.
The low pay, low skill, low productivity option simply does not produce
results. Moreover, the evidence is that abolition of the wages councils last
year has produced lower pay; it has not produced more jobs. Perhaps
politicians should reflect on three things before pursuing this argument:
1. The aim of economic activity is to produce decent jobs and a good
standard of living - it is not an end in itself. The most successful
countries have combined economic success with steadily improving social and
employment conditions.
2. How far would standards have to be lowered in Europe so that we can
compete on labour costs with Taiwan, Korea and China?
3. Surely, one of the biggest and most neglected issues facing the world is
how to produce demand in the Third World which can be supplied both locally
and from the G7. This can never happen while countries are hidebound by debt
which they cannot afford to repay. The G7 countries will have to be far
bolder and more imaginative than their proposals in Naples suggest if they
are to break through this vicious spiral of debt and poverty.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Jobs for life' were never the norm
for Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MALCOLM TREVOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is unfortunate that the myth of 'lifetime employment' has been
trundled out again in the FT ('Fujitsu staff go it alone', July 12). Even in
big Japanese companies it has never applied to the large number of temporary
and part-time employees, who can be fired at any time. Small and
medium-sized companies may revere it as an ideal, but cannot afford it -
some 70 per cent of employees work in such companies.
Far from being the norm, 'lifetime' employment, which even some Japanese
companies are trying to rename 'long-term' employment, probably applied to
no more than 30 per cent of all Japanese employees at most - including those
in government offices. In other words, only a minority has ever enjoyed the
job security that it offers, at a price.
In the present recession, such large companies as Pioneer and TDK are making
'permanent' staff redundant, while others are reducing the compensation of
those who will not take early retirement. SME employees must, as usual, take
their chances in an external labour market that is even harder than before.
While not denigrating the significance of 'one career' employment in the
large corporations as an instrument of control and as an ideology or idea
with considerable emotional pull, the fact is that this practice, which has
only ever applied to those at the top of the pile, now applies to even
fewer. While it would be an exaggeration to predict its total disappearance,
a growing number of companies is finding it increasingly unrealistic.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Well-oiled, but still creaking: Economic pressures are
building as Nigeria ponders its constitutional future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's embattled military regime today faces its most serious test since
General Sani Abacha seized power last November.
In the high court in the capital of Abuja, Moshood Abiola, millionaire
businessman and victor in last June's annulled presidential poll, will mount
his latest and most public challenge to the soldiers' authority.
Last month Mr Abiola, comfortable winner in elections intended to return
Nigeria to civilian rule for the first time since the military took power in
1983, defied the government and claimed the presidency.
Arrested shortly after a spell in hiding on a charge of treason, Mr Abiola,
a southerner whose Moslem faith gave him some standing in the predominantly
Moslem north, will today seek bail.
Few observers think he will be successful. But from the public platform of
the court, Mr Abiola's lawyers may turn the occasion into what amounts to a
rallying call for opposition. His legal plea could strain the stability of
Africa's most populous nation, the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, and
Europe's largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa apart from South
Africa.
Already a sympathy strike by workers in the oil industry is gathering pace
and may spread to other unions next week, but the strains go wider and
deeper. The crisis is not just over a millionaire's ambition, or over
soldiers clinging to power. After 34 years of independence, three new
constitutions and half a dozen military coups, Nigeria has yet to develop a
stable system of government which adequately shares the power and wealth
derived from exports of 1.7m barrels of oil a day among more than 200 tribes
and 90m people.
The crisis is about Nigeria's capacity to govern itself, and manage its
recovery from an economic decline as steep as any on the continent. External
debt exceeds USDollars 34bn, and is rising at a rate of Dollars 6bn a year.
An economic reform programme launched with the backing of the International
Monetary Fund in 1986 had begun to falter by 1990. When the January 1994
budget introduced a fixed exchange rate, the main pillar of reform - a
market-driven exchange rate - was abandoned.
Meanwhile, the spectre has arisen of religious and ethnic rivalry between
the largely Christian, Yoruba-dominated south, and the predominantly Moslem,
Hausa-Fulani north.
Whether these economic and political strains can be resolved depends partly
on the outcome of proceedings under way not far from the high court in
Abuja.
Some 360 delegates have gathered nearby at a constitutional conference
initiated by the government and with a qualified mandate from Gen Abacha to
define a path to democracy by the end of October, subject to the military's
approval. About 270 of the delegates were elected in ill-prepared polls in
which few people voted, and the rest were nominated by the government to
debate the country's constitutional options.
Mr Abiola and his supporters say the answer is simple: hand over power to
the man who won the only presidential election since civilians were ousted
in 1983. For the past decade there has been a constitution, but governments
have ignored it, they argue.
They charge that the conference has no real power, is unrepresentative,
needs only a third of the delegates to make a quorum and will be manipulated
by the military to produce the result the regime wants. Much will depend on
the skill of Mr Sylvanus Karibi-Whyte, a judge who has been seconded from
the United Nations commission on war crimes in former Yugoslavia to chair
the conference.
According to government advisers, the military wants three issues resolved
at the gathering: last June's election; a formula for the distribution of
revenue among the states of the federation; and the role of the military in
Nigeria's future leadership.
The government hopes the conference will give legitimacy to the transition
to civilian rule it is due to announce next year, when the ban on political
parties is lifted. It also hopes to appease the US and the European Union,
which have imposed limited diplomatic and military measures against
continued military rule.
The conference could also be a way for the government to neutralise support
within the armed forces for the Lagos-based national democratic coalition
which championed the cause of Mr Abiola.
But no clear direction or leadership is likely to emerge from the wide range
of interest groups represented at the conference. Among the delegates are
sacked ministers, retired state governors, banned presidential candidates
and ex-senators from a national assembly dissolved twice in more than a
decade of military rule. Political leaders in the south-west, in support of
Mr Abiola, boycotted the conference, leaving the Yorubas represented only by
political lightweights.
The north sent some powerful politicians, including Mr Shehu Yar'Adua, a
previous presidential contender, who is expected to use the conference as a
dry run for the formation of his own party next year. One surprise delegate
nominated by the government was Mr Umaru Dikko, who until last month had
been in exile after a previous regime tried to kidnap him for trial on
corruption charges. Mr Dikko is seen as a counter-balance in the north to Mr
Yar'Adua.
Few delegates will stand up for Mr Abiola. 'The Abiola issue will come up
indirectly,' said one. 'It is too late to uphold his right to the
presidency. That should have been done a year ago. He is no longer
acceptable outside his own part of the country.' Mr Abiola's political
enemies say he is an opportunist who lacks the backing of a united party and
that when his victory was annulled his appeal was eventually reduced to his
fellow Yorubas. Others accuse him of only supporting democracy when it suits
him. The presidential candidates who were banned by former President Ibrahim
Babangida in 1992 are also hostile to Mr Abiola. They blame him for failing
to speak out against the ban in his Concord newspapers group, shortly before
he put himself forward as a presidential candidate.
Government sources say the regime is ready to concede a greater share of
revenue to the oil-producing states to pacify their angry citizens who
object to seeing most of the oil wealth go north or west. 'We do not see it
as just a north-south issue,' says a newspaper publisher from the east. 'The
benefits between east and west are lopsided. Senior government posts are
loaded in favour of the Yorubas and they do not want to change it.'
As strikes threaten within days to curtail production of crude oil, the life
blood of Nigeria's economy, the conference is starting to look irrelevant.
Even if there is relief from the strikes, now spreading to water,
electricity and other services, and the conference is a success, it can only
make recommendations to the government which appointed it. Previous military
regimes have shown no inclination to check the dominance of tribal over
national interest and the growing centralisation of power.
'Nigerians' conception of the state is that of a national cake, in which all
sections have to partake in the sharing, otherwise their area will be
neglected,' according to Mr Shehu Musa, a member of the civilian government
in the early 1980s and now a member of the commission which helped to set up
the constitutional conference. 'Political office has therefore produced a
set of emergency millionaires whose main preoccupation in office was to loot
the treasury and divert all development projects to their kinsmen,' he said
in a speech earlier this year.
This observation goes to the heart of Nigeria's predicament.
Its civil service is inefficient and demoralised, its educational
institutions neglected, its youth disillusioned and its civilian leadership
weakened and divided by regional, ethnic and personal rivalry.
In short, Nigeria will have to overcome its chronic institutional weaknesses
if it is to manage its recovery from a protracted decline. Nothing that will
happen in Abuja is likely to change this.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: 3i subscription rate implies good
judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JON MOYNIHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a somewhat odd article ('Exco issue more than three times
subscribed', July 12), Simon Davies appears to be implying that Exco's new
issue on Monday was very successful, because it 'was 3.2 times subscribed',
whereas 3i's flotation last week was less successful, because it 'was only
1.1 times subscribed'. This point of view, apparently quite widely endorsed
in recent newspaper comment, misunderstands the purpose of a flotation or
rights issue, which is to gain maximum value for new shares issued for
pre-issue shareholders of the company.
Since a greater than three times subscription means that, almost inevitably,
one third of those subscribing (all that was needed) would have been
prepared to pay a higher price for the shares, we may deduce that the Exco
offer was at least somewhat unsuccessful in getting top price for its
shareholders.
On the other hand, a 1.1 subscription rate implies that 3i and its advisers,
far from being unsuccessful, judged nicely (even if possibly somewhat too
finely) the highest price they could get.
The reason financial advisers are paid so much by their clients in these
transactions is because they are expected to judge well the highest price
possible, commensurate with full take-up. So it is clear that, on the only
objective evidence available, 3i and its advisers have done extremely well,
and Exco and its advisers not so well, for those for whom this exercise was
conducted - the pre-issue shareholders of those companies.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Panel concept a useful first step to
restoring shareholder purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J R BREWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The shareholder panel concept outlined in the article, 'With strings
attached' (July 12), will doubtless be feared by die-hard captains of
industry as the thin end of the Teutonic wedge in the shape of the
supervisory board. Yet Professor David Hatherley's suggestion would bring
the sort of informed and responsible involvement from a company's owners
that would elude any centralised and bureaucratic audit commission.
Shareholders are the only people properly positioned as the source of
ultimate authority and legitimacy of the corporate form, yet few understand
that along with shareholder rights come the obligation to ensure that
elected managements perform properly. The architects of the joint stock
company could never have imagined that, 150 years after the Registration Act
of 1844, shareholder influence would in so many cases be effectively
debilitated by the imposition of investing institutions between the mind of
the investor and the company into whose shares his money eventually flows. A
shareholder panel would provide a useful first step towards restoring the
corporation's legitimacy of purpose.

One film with a special set of characteristics is an accident. Two with the
same set is a coincidence. Three is a starting gun to the world's
trend-spotting film critics.
Pausing only to grasp their essay pens, they hurtle into action, hypotheses
flailing. Maverick, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones - three
movies based on old American TV series, opening this week and next in
Britain] This must mean that western popular culture is undergoing an
important new spasm.
If only. But if the large screen is raiding the small, it is no more than a
twitch on a now well-established graph line. Where were these 'Eureka]'
critics while the skies were raining Batmans, Star Treks and Addams
Families? In Hollywood, as we in the 1990s surely know, the sons and
daughters of yesterday's couch potatoes are today's popcorn fodder.
The new TV adaptations, like the earlier ones, each take a once popular
series that rejoiced in skimpy production values and give them the
big-dollar treatment. And each trusts that a freshly campy approach to
material that was already tongue-in-cheek will be hailed as the New
Sophistication.
What we have in Maverick is two hours of the new smugness. The 1960s
tele-series, starring James Garner as the poker-playing dandy with the wry,
rictus grin and the six-gun concealed in his corset, was a noted insomnia
cure in its own right: although today's critics are already canonising its
halcyon charm. Maverick the movie kicks Mr Garner upstairs - into the role
of senior gunfighter - while passing Mel Gibson the smirk, the suit and the
stack of cards.
Can our hero win the ultimate poker tournament to be held aboard the
ultimate Mississippi steamboat? Can he get to the steamboat, past a
narrative obstacle course containing Red Indians, enemy gamblers, sudden
guest stars (James Coburn) and thieving saloon beauties (Jodie Foster)? Not
to mention all those slapstick fight scenes, in which every bullet or blow
of fist solicits an audience chortle.
'It's not unlike the Lethal Weapon movies,' Gibson has said in interviews:
in case we thought that the film was based on exhaustive historical
research. This Bret Maverick quips, smirks and double-takes; he turns on and
off the sudden violence; and he is directed by Lethal's very own Richard
Donner with Lethal buddy Danny Glover popping up in a two-second bandit
cameo.
Elsewhere we have a funny bit about politically correct Indians; a funny bit
about a runaway stagecoach; and another funny bit about a sackful of
rattlesnakes at a lynching. The problem with these funny bits is that for
the most part, as directed by Donner and scripted by William (Butch Cassidy
And The Sundance Kid) Goldman, they are not funny. The only thing that held
my attention throughout was Miss Foster. Can Our Lady of the Silent Lambs, I
wondered, stretch her range do a knockabout comical role? Not quite. But
unlike the rest of the rheumatic reflex artists around her, she does try.
The press show of The Beverly Hillbillies saw at least one early walk-out
from a critic. But who am I to wag a finger? I kept falling asleep. I
dreamed that a jalopyful of peasants with twanging accents journeyed to
Beverly Hills, after striking oil in the Arkanas backwoods, and became
enmeshed in a chaotic plot about evil businessmen (Dabney Coleman),
shape-changing secretaries (Lily Tomlin) and sudden guest stars (Buddy
Ebsen).
Ah - that was the film? And there was I thinking I was still in Maverick; or
that my dreams urgently needed a new scriptwriter. This film employed no
less than four, none of whom seems to have been able to come up with an
original comic moment. Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman and Diedrich Bader are
among the Ozark-accented muggers. And the director is the once-promising
Penelope (Suburbia, Dudes) Spheeris.
Elsewhere in this non-improving week, you have a choice of female monuments.
After watching Ma Saison Preferee and Gypsy on the same day - let us call it
Black Monday - a terrible urge came upon me to swap the female leads.
The French film's glacial, torpid study of a brother-sister relationship
riven by love-hate - he (Daniel Auteuil) is a tormented, philandering brain
surgeon, she (Catherine Deneuve) is a repressed public notary - would surely
be livened up if we replaced Deneuve with Bette Midler? And Gypsy, a loud,
stagy rehash of the Styne-Sondheim musical, might have a surreal charm if
Hurricane Bette as Gypsy Rose Lee's all-singing, all-screaming stage momma
were replaced by ice-cool Catherine.
She would delicately urge her daughter to enter the lower depths of show
business, invoking the cultural precedent of Toulouse-Lautrec or the
fruitful existential anguish of Juliette Greco. Meanwhile Midler would be
found somewhere in France, raising vocal hell: a banshee let loose in the
banlieu.
Instead the two stars stand around firming up the cliches of their
respective vehicles. Andre Techine's listless chamber drama embodies
everything bad about modern French cinema. Its tasteful lesson in family
tension, full of pinched-nerve emotions and pseudo-profundities, resembles a
TV daytime soap rewritten by Andre Malraux. And Deneuve is as elegantly dull
as only she today can be. A once expressive actress - remember Polanski's
Repulsion? - is now cast forever as the First Lady of French cinema.
If Hollywood had a star as inanimate as this, they would consign her to
stand-in work for the Columbia torch lady. What France, in turn, would do
with La Midler we can only guess. Position her, perhaps, at the entrance to
the Channel Tunnel as a warning to all French people going west: 'Apres ca,
le deluge.' In Gypsy Midler bawls, screams, wheedles, cries, laughs and
occasionally sings. The rest of the cast, including Cynthia Gibb's pretty
Louise and Peter Riegert's perky Herbie, are wiped out. For Midler in this
form is not so much an actress: more an exploding barrage balloon with
teeth.
By default the week's best film is Renaissance Man, which in a good week
might be the worst. Danny DeVito, failed advertising man turned supply
teacher, instructs six backward army cadets in the delights of Hamlet. They
rebel; they hellraise; then finally - what else - they knuckle down and come
to love the Bard. By final curtain they have all turned into G. Wilson
Knights and are changing the face of Shakespeare interpretation.
You have to love a film like this. It is foolish, sentimental, and as
directed by Penny Marshall (Awakenings) earnestly inspirational. But at
least it is not based on a TV series, does not star Mel Gibson and does not
lean for support on a once-great diva past her prime.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Arts: She Loves Me - Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is true to say that the 1963 musical She Loves Me, now revived at the
Savoy, is by far the best musical in town, but it is not enough to leave it
there. It is the kind of musical nobody writes any more; and it is all too
possible that people today will be too sophisticated to take it seriously.
Who cares about staff squabbles in a Budapest parfumerie and two
correspondents in a Lonely Hearts Club? Who cares about innocent charm?
Well, thanks to She Loves Me, I do - and I am not alone. I would gladly swap
the whole of Lloyd Webber and Sondheim for it. Its scale is miniature, but
it is radiant with rhythm, vitality, and human variety. No, it is not a
great musical, but it is exceptionally dear.
Though there are several highly effective hits here for the leading four
characters, I believe that this musical's spell really lies in its
ensembles. The action begins, so simply, with shop assistants arriving at
work, singing 'Good morning,' 'Good day,' 'Isn't this a beautiful day?' 'How
are you this beautiful day?' - which could be cloying, (the lyrics are by
Sheldon Harnick), save that the words are so timed by Jerry Bock's music
that their good manners become intoxicating. Somehow, Bock catches the
rhythm of shop life and the way that assistants have to suppress their
sincerer emotions behind the brio of salesmanship. Wonderful.
The music draws on a wide panoply of rhythms, and it is this, above all,
that make Amalia and Georg (the two parfumerie assistants who do not realise
that their anonymous Lonely Hearts correspondence is with each other) large
to us. Not only them, but also Miss Ritter (who keeps falling for the wrong
man) and even Mr Kodaly (who makes a career out of being the wrong man for
whom women fall) and their whole milieu, down to the ingenu delivery-boy
Arpad. How judicious the way the emotionally perilous tango of the cafe
where Amalia waits to meet her correspondent for the first time suddenly
switches into a hysterical Viennese waltz as she sends Georg packing; how
witty the way Miss Ritter's big number, 'A Trip to the Library', begins as a
bolero and then changes into a quickstep.
The West End staging almost exactly reproduces the 1993 Broadway revival,
but the opening-night performance here was certainly fresher than the
midweek-matinee I caught of the latter this February. One can find some
fault with the two leads, though the audience certainly seems not to. As
Georg, John Gordon-Sinclair not only carries no hint of the supercilious
pride of which Amalia initially accuses him, he also overdoes the
character's gaucherie; and, as Amalia, Ruthie Henshall tends to a certain
hard-boiled glassiness around the smile, eyes, and high notes. He is
dynamically a bit slack, and her singing would be more engaging if she did
not squeeze into her vibrato and if she conceived each number with a surer
sense of its overall architecture. A few of their numbers - notably 'Tonight
at Eight' and 'Where's My Shoe?' - are too obviously choreographed for cute
effect (rather than for emotional sincerity).
But the bright gleam of her voice is a rare pleasure in musicals today, and
the freshness with which she inflects the lyrics ('Will wonders never
cease?') is winning. She and Sinclair perform with exemplary manners as part
of a larger ensemble, and they catch both the pathos and the comedy of their
characters' situations.
The most successfully re-thought characterisation is Tracy Bennett's as
Ilona Ritter. She not only catches just the right amount of caricature in
this weary good-time girl, she also packs her full of big-time vigour. In
her 'Library' hit, she delivers 'He read to me all night long' on an
ecstatic climax and immediately adds 'Now how about that?' in a glowing
murmur: adorably funny. Gerard Casey, David de Keyser, Simon Connolly, Barry
James, and David Alder all contribute good performances. My only serious
problem is with the exaggerated facial expressions of Jon Peterson as the
Busboy (much better played deadpan), and Robert Scott's sometimes slack
musical direction. Scott Ellis's direction, Tony Walton's set, and Rob
Marshall's choreography sometimes combine to make the show more neat and
cartoon-like, and less touching than it really is.
But the whole production has just enough poignancy and bags of flair. This
musical has the kind of charm that others have been trying to banish from
the genre for decades now. At its heart lies real heartbreak, as well as
good manners and comic vitality: an enchanting confection.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Arts: The Country Wife - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mid-1980s a run of Wycherley's The Country Wife at Manchester's Royal
Exchange Theatre dazzlingly summed up that decade's attitudes through the
prism of Restoration comedy. Nicholas Hytner's strutting, rapping production
portrayed a predatory jungle where people are commodities, where the
innocent survive only by learning duplicity, and where the clowns in
authority are not only buffoons but can be brutes as well. It worked. Above
all, though it disturbed, the production's sheer swish, style and swagger
were exhilarating. The Royal Shakespeare Company now brings what is,
incredibly, its first Country Wife from Stratford (premiered last August) to
The Pit. What does director Max Stafford-Clark see in the play for the sober
and grim-faced 1990s?
Chiefly, sobriety and grimness. A visually conventional production (the only
anachronisms are the modern-looking banknotes oiling the intrigue, and
Horner's skin-tight Lycra breeches) has been decked out with a needless new
prologue (by Stephen Jeffries) and songs by Ian Dury and Mickey Gallagher
that are unnecessary to the point of embarrassment. And nobody seems to have
told some accomplished actors how to play comedy.
This is glaringly apparent in the pivotal relationship between the
over-protective Pinchwife, suspicious of London's debauched society, and his
naive spouse, a rustic fruit ripe for plucking. Robin Soans presents neither
a comically jealous clown nor a grotesquely possessive jailer but a
well-spoken little man who at times seems the most reasonable person on
stage: a basically correct man whose virtue, taken to impracticable
extremes, topples him into social unacceptability. All comedy must be played
straight, consistently and true to its context; but this Pinchwife is given
no context. When he threatens to stab out his wife's eyes or 'write whore
with this pen-knife on your face' the words are neither frightening nor
funny, since the character exists in a vacuum.
This is particularly hard on Debra Gillett who in other circumstances might
prove an outstanding Margery. Round-faced and saucer-eyed, she makes a droll
boy in her masculine disguise, and works hard to play her scenes as comic
though often with no support from a partner who has apparently been directed
otherwise.
Pinchwife's new reasonableness, in a character usually depicted as a boor
and a bully, naturally necessitates some adjustment in his rivals and
competitors. The nearest thing to romantic interest, Harcourt is played by
Jonathan Phillips with a cold, calculating urgency that suits a conniving
machiavel more than a dashing lover. Horner, the compulsive lecher, is not,
by definition, moderate; but he should at least give some inkling as to his
irresistible appeal to women. The excellent Jeremy Northam has incisiveness,
intelligence, voice and physical presence, but nary a glimpse of charm apart
from those Lycra breeches. And when the production comes up point blank
against an inescapeably comic figure, it falls flat. The usually sensible
Simon Dormandy makes Sparkish a stereotype fop. Such characters can be made
to come to life: one thinks of the RSC's own Simon Russell-Beale. No, the
1990s, whether cynically disillusioned or thoughtfully caring, still await a
zeitgeist production of Wycherley's great comedy.

A strong evening for factual programmes. In The Business David Lomax reports
on the economic success of Taiwan and discovers that education plays a major
role in the country's expansion: the constitution requires 15 per cent of
the government budget to be spent on education (7.30 BBC2). That is followed
by another in the Hypotheticals series in which role playing is used to
investigate some hypothetical conundrum. Today's subject: patient
confidentiality (8.00 BBC2). A new series of QED begins by investigating the
recent incidence of streptococcus A which gave rise to the 'Killer bug ate
my face' stories in the tabloid papers (8.00 BBC1). If the other programmes
in the State Of The Ark series are as effective as the opening episode, this
will be a very strong series indeed. Today's programme tries to establish
what constitutes a 'good' zoo (9.30 BBC2). Previous efforts by Nigel Planer
to satirise aspects of showbusiness have tended to be heavy handed. Tonight
he begins a sitcom, Wake Up With .. in which he plays co-host on one of
those daytime sofa shows. Encouragingly the writer is Andrew Nickolds (8.30
ITV).

FT  14 JUL 94 / People: Open door for Hopwood at Atreus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Hopwood, 48, has been appointed chief executive and given the task
of restoring the stock market credibility of Atreus, the shower screen and
mirror company which was floated on the stock market in March 1993 but
failed to live up to its early promise.
Rodney Harnett, the chairman who brought the company to the market, and his
finance director, Gerry Ceclich, both resigned earlier this year following a
surprise profits warning.
The shares, which were floated at 20p and rose to 28p at one stage, have
been trading at 12 1/2 p recently.
Charles Gillam, chief executive of Turnpyke Group, took over as chairman in
the spring, and Andrew Muir, 54, a former finance director of Shanks &amp;
McEwan, has been appointed as the new finance director.
Hopwood, a Manchester Business School MBA, has spent much of his career in
the building products sector. He was general manager of Marley Buildings'
buildings division and managing director of Henderson Group's industrial
doors division.
Hopwood, who had been interested in arranging a management buy-in at one
stage, said yesterday that the previous management had tried to go off in
too many directions too quickly. The company had a good brand name and he
hoped that it would benefit from a 'steadier hand'. Bruce Ledwith and David
Howarth, the two founders of the company who retain substantial stakes in
the business, continue as executive directors.

FT  14 JUL 94 / People: BM picks Bespak's finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the engineering company which fell heavily into the red last year,
yesterday announced the appointment of Alun Hicks as group finance director.
Hicks, 44, leaves Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer, having served
as finance director for six years.
BM has been without a finance director since the resignation of Carl Young
in September. The group almost collapsed last year when it breached
covenants on interest cover and net assets; it had built up substantial debt
following a series of acquisitions.
BM has subsequently sold most of the Blackwood Hodge businesses leaving the
group with process engineering operations and a product manufacturing
division.
In March, after reporting further write-downs and losses of Pounds 14.2m
pre-tax for the first half, the company said it expected debt to represent
less than 90 per cent of the Pounds 58m (Pounds 60.2m) in shareholders'
funds by the end of the year. Shares, which closed at 34p yesterday, have
fallen sharply from a high of 863p in 1991.
Cliff Walker, BM's chief executive, says Hicks was joining the company as
its restructuring neared completion and would 'participate in BM's continued
recovery'.
Hicks has overseen a difficult period at Bespak, which saw a 38 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.1m last year. Shares,
which closed at 265p yesterday, were trading at over 500p a year ago.

Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been
appointed chairman of the steering committee of the London School of
Economics' financial markets research centre.
Pennant-Rea (above), a former editor of The Economist, has taken over from
Sir David Walker, the first chairman of the LSE's financial markets group.
The group, which undertakes basic research into the nature of financial
markets and their links with the flow of savings and investment in the
domestic and international economy, has always had close ties to Britain's
central bank. Sir David is a former executive director of the Bank of
England and Mervyn King, the Bank's chief economist, helped set up the group
in 1987.
The group, which was launched with funding from City sources, has recently
been awarded a Pounds 1.3m funding package from the Economic and Social
Research Council which will result in it being designated an ESRC research
centre.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Technology: Making it in space - A look at research into
processing materials in microgravity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRANDA EADIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of making things in space still belongs to science fiction rather
than reality. In spite of the scientific advantages of manufacturing outside
gravity's reach, sending up the equipment is just too expensive.
But with the launch last week of a unique space laboratory to study what
happens to materials when handled in microgravity - the very low gravity
environment in an orbiting spacecraft - progress towards the processing of
metals, alloys, crystals and glass outside the earth's pull could receive a
big impetus.
The International Microgravity Laboratory, or IML-2, is dedicated to the
study of life and materials sciences in microgravity. It was carried in the
cargo bay of the US space shuttle Columbia that took off on Friday.
The 14-day mission, the second in a series of international Spacelab
missions, will carry out 77 experiments to explore how life forms adapt to
weightlessness and how materials behave when processed in space. The
European Space Agency has provided half of these, the rest coming from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the US and space agencies
in Japan, Canada, Germany and France.
The life science experiments will use biological specimens, from single
cells to whole organisms, to study the effects of space radiation and
microgravity on genetic material, growth, reproduction and bone development.
The well-being of the astronauts will also be studied.
The materials science experiments will cover areas such as metal alloys
processing and the growth of crystals. These are of particular interest
because the microgravity environment is free from such gravity-induced
effects as convection and sedimentation. Normally, these limit the quality
of processing and restrict the scope of studies into the materials.
It was back in the late 1960s that Nasa began materials processing in space
(MPS). The first experiments were conducted during the return of Apollo
spacecraft from the moon, followed by pioneering experiments on Skylab, the
US space station, in the 1970s. The hope was that space would contain
factories of the future, producing miraculous new crystals and drugs and
processing materials of supreme quality.
However, although research has proved that many products processed in space
are of higher quality than those made on the ground, production in space is
unrealistic economically. Transportation costs, at approximately Dollars
100,000 (Pounds 66,000) per kilogram, are too high and the lead times too
long to be of commercial interest.
Yet industry is interested in microgravity research. Although commercial
processing in space is unlikely for at least a decade, the lessons from
research in space can be applied in manufacturing on the ground, leading to
improved industrial techniques and better materials.
To be considered for processing in space, materials have to be pretty
special in the first place. They must have superior or unique properties
compared with any rival material or substitute processed on earth; they must
be key elements in a system for advanced industrial, medical or other high
technology application; and they must have a high cost to weight (or volume)
ratio.
'What is needed to approach such a high risk activity as MPS are long-term
industrial commitments supported by a strong national policy,' says Hannes
Walter, chief scientist for fluids and materials in the ESA microgravity
programme. In Fluid Sciences and Materials Science In Space, an ESA
publication, he says: 'Progress in materials science and engineering
stimulates the growth of many sectors of the economy. The access to new
materials and processes results not only in qualitative improvements, it
frequently generates new technology.'
For example, knowledge from research into microgravity has led to
development of a casting process that produces even dispersions of lead or
bismuth in aluminium alloys - which has applications in self-lubricating
bearings. Germany's Metallgesellschaft is testing these for use in car
engines with the hope that reduced friction and wear will cut fuel
consumption and pollution.
A new technique for making glass fibres used in transatlantic communications
cables was also first studied in space. In the original terrestrial method,
the glass fibre constituents are melted in containers or crucibles. When
heated above 1,000`C, the containers sometimes melt, leading to
contamination and a reduction in the glass fibres' transmission efficiency.
In the space-perfected technique, containers are not needed - the
constituents are held in levitation in an electromagnetic coil - thus
avoiding contamination. Reductions in the loss of laser light (carrying
voice and data traffic) in the glass fibres of up to 10,000 times can be
achieved.
Industry is also interested in space-processed material samples for evidence
of their technical limits. Some companies want to know more about crystal
growth, in particular protein crystals. Humans are estimated to consist of
1m different proteins.
Understanding the three-dimensional molecular structure of proteins is
necessary to understand many biochemical processes and for better design of
therapeutic agents such as drugs and vaccines.
Since materials are a key to technological progress and thus
competitiveness, the IML-2 mission has an important role for industry. So
even if the costs of manufacturing in space remain prohibitive for some
years, research will go on.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Technology: Smart cards take to the streets - Hong Kong's
public transport system is about to be revolutionised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In about two years' time, if all goes according to plan, Hong Kong will have
chalked up another first in the field of public transport. Not only will it
have one of the only profitable public transport systems in the world but it
will also be the most technologically advanced.
By mid-1996, Creative Star, a consortium of transport providers led by the
colony's Mass Transit Railway Corporation, hopes to be issuing the first
batch of 3m credit card-sized plastic 'smart cards'. The consortium - which
brings together rail, buses, trams and ferries - represents one of the most
comprehensive and biggest applications of smart card technology.
This system is being designed by ERG Australia, a Western Australia-based
company which is a leader in the application of smart card technology to
urban transport systems. The system to be introduced into Hong Kong will
have initial capacity for 3m to 4m transactions a day producing annual
revenues of around HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 660m) across all forms of
transport.
ERG, which recently won the HKDollars 400m contract, is also advising
transport authorities in Manchester, London and Melbourne about the
application of smart cards to public transport.
Unlike most ticketing systems, which require the ticket to pass through a
mechanical device, the secret to the smart card being introduced in Hong
Kong is that it does not come into contact with anything. A microprocessor
embedded in plastic - which possesses the computing power of IBM's first
personal computer - is activated when passed over a 'target' device.
This device powers the card and enables it to communicate with the target.
Once a form of radio contact is established there is a two-way exchange of
information between the card and the target. The card is identified and
reports its remaining value; the target assesses if there is enough value in
the card to enter the station. If so, it transmits date, time and station of
entry. A similar process occurs at the end of a journey, with the cost of
the fare being deducted on exit.
This process takes place within the twinkling of an eye - just a third of a
second. The information passes down data lines (or by microwave
communication for buses and ferries) to a 'service provider central
computer' owned by the railway or bus company, enabling it to know instantly
the usage of routes and lines. This management information, which could be
valuable to competitors, is stripped off before the raw billing data is
passed on to a central clearing house. Creative Star totes up and
distributes revenue according to usage.
The card is easy to operate. Creative Star makes much of the fact that a
user need never take the plastic out of his or her wallet or purse. All a
user has to do is pass it over the target to gain access to the station or
bus. According to Brian Chambers, a technical manager at the MTRC in charge
of the smart card project, the target's signal could be powerful enough so
that it detects a smart card on a passenger without his doing anything.
'People could walk through the turnstile without touching the card,' he
says. 'But Japanese research shows that people don't like the idea of a body
scan. They prefer to take the card out and touch the unit. They feel a
transaction has been executed.'
The MTRC is also concerned about the potential possibilities for invasion of
privacy inherent in the smart card. As the card is not disposable, users
will have the opportunity of personalising their card with a photograph and
personal data. This will allow identification of the card in case of theft.
Anonymous cards will also be issued, although the ability of the MTRC to
cancel a stolen card and reimburse the lost money will be diminished.
'We intend to hold the least amount of data possible,' says Chambers. 'We
are endeavouring to make sure there is no link between what personal
information we may have and the usage of the card. But if the card is lost
what we want is some mechanism of cancelling the card and returning the
unused value to the customer.'
Creative Star has set ERG a demanding specification for recharging the smart
card. It wants to offer three methods of recharging. The first is
conventional - take it to the MTRC window and pay the desired amount of
cash. The other two methods, however, have the potential to make the card
into a cash equivalent.
The first is to place the card into an automated teller machine and debit a
bank account. The second is to establish a direct debit on a savings or
current account. When the card falls to a specified level it is recharged
(again to a specified upper level) on passing by a target.
In this way, the introduction of smart cards will not only herald the
beginning of yet more convenience for the users of Hong Kong's public
transport, but also the beginning of the end of small change.
If the executives running Creative Star have their way, people will use
their smart card for transactions ranging from buying a newspaper or soft
drink from a vending machine, to making a public telephone call, paying for
parking, buying fast food or sitting in a booth to have a passport
photograph taken.
Rob Noble, director of marketing and planning at the MTRC, notes that the
card is designed for large volume, small transactions. But in offering
vendors of other non-transport products access to Creative Star's central
clearing system, he says it will not be trying to compete with credit cards.
'We're at the bottom of the market competing with cash,' he says. 'We see it
as a convenience for customers. But the more cards in use, the more able
they will be to use it for convenient things. We don't want it to be an MTRC
card or a transport card, but ultimately a cash card.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / People: Higher and higher at Hyatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshireman Darryl Hartley-Leonard sounds like a character out of Kane and
Abel, one of Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novels. Just 30 years after he
found a job as a desk clerk in a Los Angeles Hyatt hotel, he has risen to be
chairman of the privately-owned Hyatt Hotels Corporation, which oversees 103
establishments in North America and the Caribbean.
Hartley-Leonard, 49, who takes over from Thomas Pritzker whose family owns
the company, has managed hotels in Chicago, Houston and Atlanta. Pritzker
remains president of the parent Hyatt Corporation.
Since settling in the US, Hartley-Leonard has thrown himself into good
causes, including Unicef and the Big Shoulders Fund, which supports Catholic
schools in Chicago where Hyatt has its headquarters.
He helped form the Hyatt Force (Family of Caring and Responsible Employees),
which gives staff four days off each year to work in their communities. His
enthusiasm has been spotted by Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, who has
appointed him as an adviser on travel and tourism.
Hartley-Leonard became president of Hyatt Hotels in 1986, with
responsibility for their operations and development. His new post will leave
him free to concentrate on longer-term strategic issues, including the
company's decision to start franchising hotels, which is expected to begin
in the next few months.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (6): Campus is no longer remote -
Higher education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old industry has been mushrooming anew in the heart of Liverpool. It is
higher education and its local turnover is almost Pounds 300m a year and
rising.
That is at least four times more than 10 years ago. Partly, it is the result
of the expansion of higher education places and the metamorphosis of
Liverpool Polytechnic into Liverpool John Moores University, but it is also
the result of radical changes in attitude.
Merseyside has two universities - the new 'JM' and the 'old' Liverpool
University, the first of the civic redbricks. What characterises each of
them is an obvious and vigorous sense of entrepreneurship.
It was very different 12 years ago, when Liverpool University often appeared
trapped in its own precinct at the top of Brownlow Hill, quite literally a
stone's throw from the 1981 Toxteth riots, from which it was insulated and
aloof.
At the same time, the polytechnic suffered from the second-class status
conferred on colleges of its ilk by local authority control, fewer resources
and a national, externally-controlled, bureaucratic system for validating
its degrees.
Today, Liverpool University turns over Pounds 150m a year on its own, a
third of it on research, with three-fifths of this latter amount
discretionary money won in a tight marketplace from industry and various
research councils.
Liverpool JM has been regenerating much of the elegant Georgian section of
the inner city on its own. Originally a conglomeration of technical, art and
commercial colleges dotted about the place, the dots are spreading, becoming
blobs and coalescing, reversing the spread of a spotty dereliction that was
threatening an overall, seedy decline.
Professor Peter Toyne, who stresses his entrepreneurial orientation with the
combined title of vice-chancellor and chief executive, has rescued a fine
old terraced small mansion in Rodney Street - Merseyside's Harley Street -
as the JM's headquarters.
'Vision is all-important,' he says. 'We are in the business of being a new
kind of university. We have compacts with local schools and are trying to
harmonise the area's potential. We cannot become a remote campus and we
don't want to be. We are all over the city and growing into it osmotically.'
He believes in out-reach - and keeping access open to anyone who can benefit
from higher education and pass the exams at the end. This means that
although there are more than 10 applications for every place now, the JM has
resisted the urge merely to move academically upmarket.
A few mature adults without conventional school-leaving qualifications can
still get in if they can prove their ability in a rigorous interview.
Admission tutors counsel other routes elsewhere, such as vocational courses,
if they think an applicant might fail.
The JM has also modularised its courses so students can mix and match them
over three or four years, studying in bites. This brings Prof Toyne to what
he calls his 'bite and megabyte' philosophy, using information technology
more effectively in education.
So the JM does not have a conventional library, but an architecturally
impressive new Pounds 8m learning resource centre. This has been partly
endowed by the Canadian-born Mr Aldham Robarts, one of the UK's pioneers of
free newspaper publishing when he founded the Wirral Globe, initially an
advertising freesheet, in 1973.
The centre is a library in one sense, but every carrel has a terminal -
there are 700 of them - for access to any database a student might need. It
can also be accessed remotely by modem from personal computers. The JM is
already planning a second centre and other universities are looking to copy
the model.
A few hundred yards away from Rodney Street in Senate House, Liverpool
University's vice-chancellor spells out a complementary philosophy. Prof
Philip Love's greatest selling point is his university's academic reputation
and record as one of Britain's top research institutions.
While Chadwick's pioneering work splitting atoms 60 years ago has been
superseded by a nationally funded interdisciplinary surface science centre
and a Leverhulme-backed catalysis research institute, a university can only
get such prestigious projects if it has a widespread, rock-solid academic
base.
'Our theme is partnership with industry, commerce and the community,' Prof
Love says. 'We have lots of very expensive facilities which we intend to
make increasingly available locally, with emphasis on wealth creation.'
For example, there is a rapid prototypes laboratory which he believes should
be used more by small companies than by large ones. He is also trying to
ensure that Liverpool's graduates are never thought unworldly by industry
and commerce.
'All learn problem-solving skills as part of their courses,' he says. 'We
try to produce people with multi-competences. Instead of just having a
degree in a particular subject, we try to equip them with competences for a
lifetime in work - and with entrepreneurial skills, if possible.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (5): The 'drivers' of change - How the
European funds are likely to be spent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A five-point plan to regenerate Merseyside's lagging economy has been
approved by the European Commission, it was announced yesterday.
The six-year plan will be the basis for spending Merseyside's Pounds 628m of
Objective 1 funds. UK public sector sources will match the sum. The combined
Pounds 1.26bn is expected to lever in more from the private sector.
Under the plan there will be five main 'drivers' of economic change:-
The big-company sector. Projects will relate to preparing, servicing and
accessing strategic sites for large companies and signif- icant inward
investors. Infra- structure spending, marketing and improving the region's
image will also be covered here.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be encouraged to grow, with
EU money helping to fund training, services and advice through TECS and
Business Links. There will be a Merseyside Special Investment Fund, set up
by the clearing banks but with EU money used to subsidise interest rates for
business loans.
Knowledge-based industries will be encouraged, with special attention to
technology transfer between Merseyside's two universities and industry,
particularly SMEs. One idea is a graduate retention programme with local
industry to keep more people in the area after qualifying.
The arts, cultural and tourism sectors will be encouraged.
People-based initiatives will concentrate on training and systematic
development of human resources. Inner city and social problem areas, such as
outer estates with high unemployment, will be especially targeted.
Money will be cascaded into projects on a wholesale-retail basis. It will go
in bulk to 'eligible bodies' - such as local authorities, the three TECs on
Merseyside, or the universities. Other 'eligible' wholesalers include
Merseytravel, English Partnerships and Merseyside Development Corporation,
as well as voluntary sector and non-profit organisations, or other bodies
acting in the public interest.
English Partnerships (EP) is expected to play a leading role as the
big-company driver.
Mr David Taylor, the chief executive, says three main sites will be
involved, headed by the Speke-Garston area near Liverpool Airport, where EP
will commit Pounds 36m to develop what Mr Alan Chape, deputy chief executive
of Liverpool city council, says will be a 21st century business park. A new
link road is already being built to put Speke within a few minutes of the
motorway network.
Another EP investment site will be Parkside colliery in St Helens, which
closed last year. It is well-placed, adjacent to the M6 near the Haydock
interchange with the A580 East Lancashire road and the M62 cross-over.
The third site is the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead, which its owner
VSEL, the Barrow nuclear submarine builder, closed but has been reluctant to
sell. Merseyside Development Corporation has compulsory purchase powers. A
joint venture with EP and the private sector looks possible.
Some SMEs have criticised the plans because under EU rules they cannot apply
for Objective 1 funds directly, since these are for restructuring industry
rather than subsidising individual businesses.
However, Mr Tim Beer, who runs KPMG Peat Marwick's north-west services for
owner-managed businesses, suggests: 'Companies might join together to draw
down training and consultancy money to improve competitiveness.
'Many SMEs have still to tackle how to reduce costs. We need more mergers
and acquisitions among them. I have seen a large number of companies that
are fundamentally good but their individual market shares are too small to
carry their costs and allow substantial growth. There is also a need for
venture capital.'
On this last point, Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of Liverpool chamber of
commerce, hopes to set up an investment fund administered by a trust. It
would work in the equity gap with private sector venture capital partners,
down to as little as Pounds 50,000 invested. Due diligence - the costs of
which make most deals below Pounds 500,000 uneconomic for the private sector
 -would also be met by the fund.
He also sees SMEs as being able to borrow from a fund that the banks would
create, but at interest rates subsidised by Objective 1 money.
In the tourism area, Objective 1 funds can be used to help build hotels. Mr
Berry says Merseyside would also benefit from reviving Liverpool's largely
dilapidated Chinatown, partly by building an underground station in the
middle of it to improve access from Merseyrail's existing services.
Many of the 'people' initiatives will try to target training to upskill the
workforce in jobs, rather than just train unemployed people for stock. The
three TECs - Merseyside in Liverpool, Cewtec in the Wirral and Qualitec in
St Helens - will be the main wholesalers of funds.
As Mr John Stoker, head of government offices on Merseyside, puts it: 'It's
about jobs; it's about enabling. It's a tall order, but Objective 1 has got
to address fundamentals and make things better.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (7): Reskilling emphasised in 'Training
for work' - A look at changing the economic base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wavertree Technology Park was launched in 1983 as a symbol of Merseyside's
future. The idea was to attract value-added, high-wage new employment -
rather than low-paid jobs in retailing and assembly - and help stop the
drift of qualified, able young people from the region in search of work.
The original 65-acre site was a disused railway marshalling yard. Tenancies
were to be restricted, if possible, to high technology and associated
industries. The original park is now approaching full occupancy, with 30
companies employing 2,200 people.
The technology park has always worked closely with the Merseyside Innovation
Centre, which, in turn, has close links with the two universities, Liverpool
and John Moores, and the Merseyside TEC.
MIC was set up in 1981 by the universities and the local authorities, and
has become an important force in providing product development, design
contracts and training.
One of its largest contracts is with Merseyside Training and Enterprise
Council and is aimed at keeping university graduates in Merseyside. Each
year, the MIC has a graduate training and placement programme involving more
than 200 unemployed graduates. About 70 per cent get jobs,
The MIC is also involved in registering companies for the BS5750 quality
standard and helps inventors and small companies obtain seedcorn money from
such schemes as the Prince's Trust and the DTI's Enterprise Initiative.
Dr Brian Job, executive director, says: 'We give signposting support to
individuals and inventors. We have around 1,000 approaches from individuals
or companies a year.'
An adjacent 23-acre site to Wavertree has been acquired and landscaped and
the first building, a business and technology centre, has just been
completed by English Partnerships, the successor to English Estates.
Merseyside Innovation Centre will manage this new centre and strengthen the
links between the park and the universities to encourage more technology
transfer.
However, Wavertree's role as the forerunner of a local network of similar
parks for knowledge-based concerns remains, in the words of Mr John Pugh,
corporate affairs director, 'an aspiration'.
So difficult has been Merseyside's unemployment problem that the area has
been glad of any job-creating investment it can get. The largest employer on
Wavertree is Barclaycard - certainly not low tech, but hardly the model of
state-of-the-art high technology.
However, the desire not to be content with a mix of low paid jobs in
retailing, tourism, leisure and construction remains strong. The evidence
for this is a drive to upgrade skills in all areas, rather than just trying
to reduce unemployment.
Mrs Linda Bloomfield, chief executive of Merseyside Training and Enterprise
Council, feels some criticism of the two main training programmes has been
justified. Many believe the youth training scheme and the employment
training programme have been aimed at reducing dole queues, rather than
addressing the long-term problems of skill mismatches between the jobless
and the jobs available.
She says: 'The employment training programme has been particularly
discredited. People were signing up for a few weeks, then immediately going
back to unemployment.'
The replacement programme - 'Training for Work' - emphasises reskilling and
tries to ensure proper placement for older long-term unemployed people.
Meanwhile, the programme of training credits for young people which has
taken over from the youth scheme stresses training and acquiring skills for
both the employed and unemployed.
Mrs Bloomfield says: 'We start in the schools with 14-year-olds. We try to
raise their horizons, make them believe in themselves.'
School-leavers are given credits which will give them training that leads to
a national vocational qualification. The training credits programme is the
largest scheme undertaken by Merseyside TEC, accounting for Pounds 20m of
its Pounds 46m budget.
At any given time, there are 6,000 young people on schemes. Last year, 36
per cent left with some form of National Vocational Qualification, with a 42
per cent increase in the numbers reaching NVQ level three. Over 25 per cent
went into a permanent job.
Mrs Bloomfield believes that solving Merseyside's chronic unemployment
problem is beyond the remit of the three Tecs - the other two are Qualitec
in St Helens and Cewtec, which covers Chester, Ellesmere Port and Wirral.
'Overall unemployment is 15 per cent against a national level of 10 per
cent, but male unemployment in some pockets is 50 per cent. Merseyside will
go on exporting workers,' she says. 'What we can do is contribute to making
skills available so that the significant money about to come to Merseyside
utilises (the skills of) the local population.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (2): Partnership tackles region's image
 -How companies have been persuaded to put their money where their mouths
are
</HEADLINE>

Money talks. It speaks of harmony: Merseyside's politicians, civil servants,
business leaders, academics, government agencies and local coun- cils are
nearly all paying about Pounds 1m between them for hymn sheets to sing from.
It is the best evidence yet that they have stopped dithering and intend to
make their Mersey Partnership work. 'They have not just signed up, but have
put in substantial sums,' says Mr Jack Stopforth, a Liverpool marketing
consultant. 'It shows just how much attitudes have changed.'
The partnership wants to mount a sustained campaign to market Merseyside
around the world. 'We think we will need about Pounds 11m over six years,'
says Mr Chris Gibaud, the partnership's chief executive. 'We are asking the
EU for 47 per cent of it.'
His organisation has had a difficult birth. Successful partnerships for
economic development elsewhere have depended on a willing marriage of public
and private sectors. Liverpool's confront- ational politics in the 1980s
drove the local private sector away from even contemplating it.
As the politics stabilised, a hesitant, argumentative court- ship began
about four years ago. There were problems finding and keeping the right
chairman, but the partnership eventually appointed an impressive chief
executive.
Mr Gibaud, who learned his economic development skills in securing inward
investment for Swindon and Peterborough - and paradoxically in failing to
get city challenge status for Widnes and Runcorn - is now running the show
in tandem with Mr David Henshaw, chief executive of Knowsley borough
council, as chairman.
Mr Geoffrey Piper, chief executive of the private sector's powerful North
West Business leadership team - a grouping of the region's largest and most
successful companies - takes over the chair in six months' time, but he and
Mr Henshaw may then rotate the job.
Formerly a senior partner with Coopers Deloitte, Mr Piper used to run Boom -
Business Opportunities on Merseyside. It was supported by a large number of
companies at Pounds 250 a year each, to try to counter the troubled image of
Merseyside in the political turmoil of the 1980s.
Since then, Mr Gibaud has argued the time has come for all parties to put
their money where their mouths are: the more people paid, the greater would
be their commitment and the more their endeavour would be worth.
The membership list tells the story. There are four categories:-
A - local authorities, contributing money or support in kind worth Pounds
100,000 each.
B - major subscribers: Merseyside Development Corporation, Merseyside
Training and Enterprise Council, and Manweb, the regional electricity
company. They pay Pounds 150,000 each.
C - large subscribers, including Liverpool's two universities, Merseytravel,
Royal Insurance, which pay Pounds 50,000 each. Contributions in this
category range from Pounds 20,000.
D - smaller subscribers paying a minimum Pounds 5,000. Nearly 25 companies
have signed up so far, with new ones joining at one a month. Merseyside's
city challenge teams fit into this category.
Mr Gibaud says: 'People want their money's worth, so commitment is high. We
have formed a steering group from all the members. Categories A and B get
automatic repres- entation. Categories C and D elect one member per Pounds
100,000 of total subscriptions in their groups. There is real compet- ition
for the elected places.'
Specialists are co-opted when their personal contribution can be telling,
such as the PR director of Royal Insurance and the finance director of
Manweb.
There are worries in some quarters that the partnership may compete with
Inward, the north-west region's inward investment agency, and that there may
be some confusion over one Merseyside borough - Wirral - making its own
partnership arrangements with local large employers.
But there is enough goodwill for no one to want to be quoted on this, in
case it looks like an attempt to create disharmony.
'We are concerned with the image and marketing of Mer- seyside. We are not
trying to do anyone else's job,' Mr Henshaw says. 'The Objective 1 programme
is Merseyside's last chance. If we cannot get a leap in perception, we will
have failed. Ten years ago there was a lot of negativity; there is now an
empty canvas. We have a chance to paint our own picture.'
Mr Alan Chape, deputy chief executive, of Liverpool city council, says: 'We
have still got a drag factor on our image. A lot of it is London-based.
Intermediaries will not put Merseyside on their lists for possible
relocation or invest- ment.'
Mr Gibaud points out: 'We have done some of our best work so far in London
during the last year and have made good contacts.' Thus Mr Paul Newall, lord
mayor of London, visited Merseyside recently with Mr Tamon Kitabatake,
commercial minister at the Japanese Embassy.
Since then, Mr Newall has been extolling the virtues of Merseyside at
meetings in the UK and abroad. Mr Gibaud says it is a good start.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (4): Unfinished business - Merseyside
Development Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
This has not been a good year for the Merseyside Development Corporation. It
is under a cloud because of a debacle over a loss-making opera concert
staged to celebrate the visit of the Columbus Grand Regatta tall ships in
1992.
Mr Chris Farrow, the chief executive, has been grilled by the Commons public
accounts committee over the concert's Pounds 695,000 losses; its report is
awaited nervously by the corporation.
In the meantime, the MDC is having a row with the Mersey Docks and Harbour
Company over development of a ro-ro container terminal at Birkenhead, where
the MDC has planning powers.
The dock company offered immediate development at a cost of up to Pounds
20m, but the MDC has made London &amp; General Property its preferred developer
on its Pounds 70m, more visionary but less certain proposals for a container
terminal, a science park and a student village.
Mr Bob Lane, the MDC's assistant chief executive, says: 'This met the wider
brief that we wanted. We are in the business of job creation. A dock by
itself would not have created many jobs.'
London &amp; General has to produce detailed proposals by the end of this month,
and the deal might still fall through, but the row has been a poor
advertisement for Merseyside's claim that all is now sweetness and light
between public and private sectors.
The pity is that these difficulties have overshadowed the fact that the sums
finally seem to be coming right for the MDC, 13 years after it was founded -
alongside its London counterpart - to bring disused Mersey docklands back
from the dead.
By 1990, the MDC had spent Pounds 180m of public money but had generated
only Pounds 43.5m in private sector investment. Its policy of leisure
development - notably the Albert Dock tourist complex - was criticised for
attracting 5m visitors a year who did not spend enough to create many jobs.
The figures, however, are now better. Total private sector investment is put
at Pounds 301m, slightly ahead of the cumulative total for spending by the
corporation. Since most of the corporation money was spent in the early
years, anything new from the private sector should now push up the multiple
of private to public sector investment rapidly.
The corporation has reclaimed more than 800 acres of land, built 468,000 sq
ft of office space and, most important of all, helped create 10,605 jobs.
There are three pieces of unfinished business before wind-up in 1998. The
corporation wants to help develop derelict land in north Liverpool and
Bootle and plans to spend Pounds 30m making the rest of the A565 Southport
road into a dual carriageway.
Another big project will be the former Cammell Laird shipyard, where English
Partnerships hopes to get EU Objective 1 funding for development with the
MDC and private sector.
A question-mark hangs over the third project, involving King's Dock, next to
the Albert Dock on the Liverpool waterfront. A grand design has been set out
for leisure and business space, but so far developers have not come forward
for the 40-acre site.
However, despite the inquiry into the tall ships fiasco and doubts about
whether there is enough demand to drive projects involving offices and
science parks, the corporation should end its life with a reputation for a
job pretty well done.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (3): Strife on the waterfront -
Dockyard development plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is strife on the Mersey waterfront, but not the kind of labour dispute
that gave Liverpool a bad name in years gone by. This time the protagonists
are the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company and the Merseyside Development
Corporation. The row is over whether 74m birds in the bush are worth up to
20m in the hand.
The MDHC wants to spend up to Pounds 20m - half of it immediately - on a
floating roll on/roll off stage and a 27-acre freight terminal at Twelve
Quays, Birkenhead, across the Mersey from Liverpool, to keep up its market
leadership in the growing Irish Sea trade.
The MDC favours a projected Pounds 74m scheme by London and General Property
which would include a large measure of speculative property development,
such as a science park and a student village. It, too, would have a floating
stage, but a smaller, 15-acre freight terminal to be run by a Belfast
freight company which is not a port operator.
Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director of MDHC, is furious. He says: 'It is
crazy to hand over workable waterfront sites for this sort of development.
It will constrict expansion of the Mersey as a port. Plenty of other sites
are available for science parks and student accommodation.'
He needs the new terminal for the next step in the remarkable transformation
and growth of the Port of Liverpool over the past 10 years. Indeed,
acquisition of the Medway ports of Chatham and Sheerness last year has
already turned MDHC into the second largest port group in the UK.
Last year the company made profits of Pounds 20.3m, an increase of 38 per
cent over 1992. Turnover on Merseyside reached nearly 30m tonnes, a record.
There are now only 400 port operative workers - once known as dockers -
compared with more than 6,000 two decades ago, shortly after the government
had to rescue the company's predecessor when it defaulted on its bonds. The
total workforce now is 1,600.
The government, which wrote off debts of Pounds 130m five years ago, gave up
a golden share this year to free the business from the last vestiges of
Whitehall supervision. But it retains a 14 per cent stake, which it says
will be sold, but not yet. Indeed, if the government holds on long enough,
it stands a chance of eventually getting back much of the taxpayers' money
used to modernise the port.
It is not just more efficient work practices which have brought about the
transformation, for the MDHC has aggressively set out to expand the volume
of business in all directions.
It has ro-ro facilities and is constantly expanding its container terminal.
It is the largest trader in scrap metal in the UK. It trades in oil, bulk
liquids, grain and forest products. It is the largest port trading with the
eastern seaboard of the US and the largest UK port trading with Ireland.
Recent developments include Powergen's Pounds 40m environmentally sensitive
bulk terminal for coal imports. There is also a dedicated Euro Rail terminal
for Channel tunnel freight from north-west England and Ireland.
The new oil and gas field in Liverpool Bay will also bring growing benefits.
Hamilton Oil is using Hornby Dock, in Bootle, for its offshore supply base.
With other oil companies now prospecting in the bay, more jobs should be on
their way to the docks.
Merseyside is also the home of the UK's most successful freeport, which is
contained in 640 of the company's 2,000 acres on the Liverpool side, with
another 120 acres in Birkenhead docks. More than 100 companies use it.
With 200 acres of land not needed for shipping, a subsidiary property
development company has been building houses and business parks. It has also
obtained planning permission from the MDC to build 1.5m sq ft of offices
with P&amp;O at Prince's Dock, a prime site next to Liverpool Pier. But this is
on ice until end-users materialise; there will be no speculative
development.
For the future, the MDHC sees further growth from the Medway ports. Medway
recently announced the start of a new trucked freight service to the
Netherlands.
Mr Furlong is also ready to have another go at Twelve Quays if London &amp;
General cannot proceed. He says: 'It will be a great disappointment if we do
not get our floating stage. But it will not be the end of the world. We will
have to look elsewhere. We are never complacent.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (1): The double-edged sword - A look at
the region's plans to spur economic growth and create business opportunities
with the aid of Pounds 628m from the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY

<TEXT>
Merseyside has been handed a two-edged sword. This week the European
Commission approved outline plans to spend Pounds 628m of EU money over the
next six years to help one of Britain's most deprived conurbations catch up
with other more prosperous parts of Europe.
This is Merseyside's share of the EU's 'Objective 1' funding for those parts
of Europe where the local gross domestic product per head is less than
three-quarters of the EU average. Other beneficiaries include Greece,
Portugal, Ireland, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and parts of the
former east Germany.
The award does bring with it its own dilemma, as Mr John Stoker, head of the
UK government regional office on Merseyside and the man who will be in
charge of the money, points out. 'Objective 1 is two-edged because you can
interpret it positively or negatively.' In other words, if an area needs
such help, that might put investors off.
Yet, if the resources are handled well, they could accelerate economic
growth and create unprecedented business opportunities, reversing the
decline that has enveloped Merseyside for decades.
The trick, as the conurbation's leaders recognise, is to cut with the right
edge of the sword. Worried Eurocrats in Brussels rejected initial proposals.
These would have involved the disbursement of funds on projects not
dissimilar to others that have so far failed to stop the decline.
Training is one of these. Professor Patrick Minford, Liverpool University's
celebrated monetarist, has warned that soft-focus training  - preparing
people for jobs that might never materialise - is likely to encourage
emigration in search of work, further weakening the skills base. He wants
more spent on physical infrastructure, arguing that freer movement
encourages trade.
Brussels called in Mr Peter Lloyd, professor of geography at Liverpool
University, to redraw the spending plans. Among the people he consulted was
Prof Michael Parkinson, whose European Institute of Urban Affairs at
Liverpool John Moores University has done definitive work for the EC on why
some cities succeed while others fail.
The result is a strategy based on five economic 'drivers' - big companies,
small companies, technology transfer, leisure industries and human
resources.
Brussels has accepted the principles involved, perhaps noting some signs
that the tide may already be turning. As Mr Jack Stopforth, former head of
economic development at the abolished Merseyside County Council and now a
marketing consultant, observes: 'The image of Merseyside is now lagging
behind the reality. Before, we used to say Merseyside was great, and try to
make it so. Now it's getting great but it doesn't look like it yet.'
The membership and subscription list of the Mersey Partnership - which will
use Objective 1 funds to market the area worldwide - supports him. Councils
and companies have contributed between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 150,000 each
to raise more than Pounds 1m. They clearly mean to make it work and seem to
have learnt the lessons of what has produced successful regeneration
elsewhere.
The lessons are that there have to be leaders; they have to sink their
differences and work together; and they have to develop a wider vision of
the community than their own role in it.
'There has been a telling influx of young or vigorous people into key
positions. Many are newcomers, unconstrained by the great burden of
Merseyside's past. They have a commonsense approach which is yielding
benefits,' Mr Stopforth points out.
Already in place is Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency
now chaired by Sir Desmond Pitcher, the chairman of North West Water. It has
rescued the Mersey waterfront from dereliction, though it has blotted its
copybook recently with a public relations disaster over financial losses
incurred by a promotional opera concert.
An infrastructure of financial and professional service providers is
re-establishing itself. Among them, KPMG Peat Marwick is playing a central
role in devising and evaluating financial mechanisms needed for
regeneration, while Grant Thornton's Mr Amin Amiri is running a vigorously
competitive corporate finance operation from Liverpool.
The latest newcomer is Mr Ian Lobley, director of 3i's Merseyside office,
the successor to Mr Rob Toomey, who has joined Edward Billington, the
Liverpool sugar merchant and food process group, as development director.
Mr Lobley provides the best evidence of growth where it is needed most
(because more jobs are created there) - in the small and medium-sized
business sector. 'Our local equity book has grown from Pounds 10m to Pounds
35m since 1991. 3i's total portfolio has risen from Pounds 39m to Pounds 63m
in the same period,' he says.
He believes the base of small and medium-sized businesses is too small and
must be seriously nurtured. Mr Tim Beer, in charge of a new operation for
KPMG dealing with owner-managed businesses, thinks mergers and acquisitions
among them - possibly aided by a new fund set up with Objective 1 help - is
one answer.
The region's basic problems, leading up to the need to seek special
assistance from Brussels, have been the changing patterns of world trade,
transportation technology and global economic groupings. Nearly a century
ago, Liverpool was the leading European terminal for transatlantic
emigration to the US and for world trade.
It grew rich on it but has been in relative decline ever since. A body
similar to the new Mersey Partnership was proposed in the 1920s, when it was
already clear that a damaging change to the economic structure was under
way.
The jet age, bulk cargo handling, containerisation of shipped freight, and
Britain's political and economic alliance with an ever-uniting Europe have
all further accelerated Merseyside's decline since the 1981 Toxteth riots.
Church leaders - notably the Rt Rev David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool -
characterised the riots as an explosion of frustrated helplessness in the
face of unbridled market forces, but the aftermath did more damage as
Merseyside demonstrated an unrivalled ability to shoot itself in the foot.
Marxist factions on Liverpool's city council and among its town hall trade
unions sought to municipalise as much of the local economy as they could.
Bitter confrontation with the Thatcher government ended with 47 councillors
disqualified for financial mismanagement and Liverpool in debt to foreign
banks which had financed a series of deficit budgets.
With Merseyside's capital emanating little but bad news, the private sector
and the four other Merseyside councils - Wirral, St Helens, Knowsley and
Sefton - ran for cover and decided to act independently.
Seven years after the House of Lords confirmed the disqualifications, the
Merseyside community is coming together again, though with less than
wholehearted commitment from Wirral, which watches developments warily from
its self-contained peninsula across the Mersey from the other four,
contiguous, boroughs.
In the meantime, the Labour party has expelled most of its known local
Marxists or hard-left former members who would not accept the discipline of
Mr Harry Rimmer, Liverpool's moderate leader.
Most local leaders believe Merseyside touched rock bottom in 1991 with a
seven-month town hall strike But although relative economic decline has
since continued - resulting in Objective 1 status - there are signs it may
now be reversible.
Merseyside seems to have finally got its act together. All it needs to do
over the next six years is to spend Pounds 628m of EU funds wisely.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the British make their annual summer pilgrimage to the beaches of Spain,
France and Greece, they leave behind a country increasingly popular with
tourists from elsewhere.
Britain is the world's sixth largest earner of tourist revenues. Last year,
a record 19.3m overseas visitors spent Pounds 9.1bn in the UK.
The conventional view is that foreign visitors come to the UK for its
historical and cultural attractions. A new set of marketing guides*
published by the British Tourist Authority reveals a more complex picture.
Australians and New Zealanders find British castles, gardens and historic
houses appealing. Greeks, on the other hand, have no interest in such
attractions; they visit the UK to shop, learn English - or undergo surgery.
The BTA's 26 guides show that UK hotels and tour organisers need to adapt
their marketing to the country in which they are trying to sell their
services.
Belgian visitors like golfing, walking and cycling when they visit the UK.
Norwegians like canal cruising. Argentines want to watch rugby.
Visitors from Hong Kong do not like to walk. They enjoy pageantry but do not
like rain. Many Israeli visitors to London go to the theatre every night.
Top attractions for Indian and Pakistani visitors are Madame Tussaud's and
the Tower of London. Although a large proportion of Indian and Pakistani
visitors come to the UK on business or to see friends and relatives, there
are increasing numbers of young, financially independent tourists from the
two countries.
Visitors from France tend to come to the UK to find eccentricity and cosy
pubs.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A most subtle
prescription - Drugs companies are using indirect methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US pharmaceutical companies are bombarding consumers with public health
information in a subtle n effort to market their products. indirectly. The
theory is that the more people know about their health, the more likely they
are to seek help, and the more prescription medicines drug manufacturers
will sell.
Genentech, for example, helped finance a print campaign on how to recognise
the early signs of a heart attack, indirectly promoting its angina drug,
Activase. Merck backed an information campaign on enlarged prostates to
market its Proscar product. Upjohn and Solvay are launching a public
awareness campaign on obsessive compulsive disorder to boost sales of their
new drug, Luvox, a relative of Prozac.
Once, the pharmaceutical industry promoted prescription drugs only to
physicians. Today, drug companies find direct marketing to consumers more
effective. 'We try to empower people with information about their health,'
says
Wyeth-Ayerst. 'Earlier, people didn't really participate in their
treatments. They just took what the doctor gave them. But now, patients are
much more involved.'
Drug companies have been traditionally wary of directly promoting
prescription drugs, because of strict Food &amp; Drug Administration rules. The
FDA requires that all advertising of prescription medicines reveal potential
side-effects and provide a balanced view of the benefits and disadvantages
of the product.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers often provide money for the awareness campaigns
to public health organisations, which then put out information in the form
of brochures, print and television advertisements.
'We're seeing more of this (contributions for public awareness campaigns by
drug companies) as opposed to traditional contributions over the last
several years,' says Steven Erickson, a spokesman for the Arthritis
Foundation. 'There's more of a marketing element involved.'
Yet public health organisations say they welcome the trend. 'It's a win-win
situation,' says Brigid Sanner, vice president of communications for the
National Heart Association. 'We get the information out, patients get a
chance to live healthier lives and the drug manufacturers get their message
out.'
Many health associations have established 'corporate' offices to work
together with companies on the advertisements, which the associations then
vet for accuracy and balance.
The advertisements must contain more than just information about the disease
to be effective, though, says Nancy Glick, a senior vice president with the
public relations firm Hill and Knowlton. 'You need to provide basic
information, but you also need to tell consumers what they can do about it:
either 'call this 800 number for more information', 'write for a brochure
on' or 'ask your doctor about'.'
Sometimes, the public awareness messages are followed up by direct
marketing. Drug companies are becoming less leery about advertising
prescription medicines. Merck, for instance, began a campaign for its drug
Proscar with general health messages detailing 'what every man should know
about his prostate'. More recently, however, the company has switched to
advertisements which declare 'Only one medicine can shrink the prostate:
Proscar.'
The public awareness campaigns as a marketing tool have proved so effective
that other sectors are beginning to jump on the bandwagon. Makers of calcium
supplements, for instance, have sponsored commercials on osteoporosis, and
one sunscreen manufacturer is expected to launch a campaign this summer on
skin cancer and the dangers of exposure to the sun.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Management (Markketing and Advertising): Sour taste of sweet
debate - The row over food ads directed at children is reminiscent of the
tobacco debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During one typical week of children's television programmes on Independent
Television in the UK last month there were 388 advertisements, well over
half of them for food products. Of these commercials, three-quarters were
for breakfast cereals (mostly the sugary kind), confectionery, fast food,
soft drinks, ice cream and lollies. In 22 hours of children's TV, there was
just one ad for fruit.
To the National Food Alliance - a campaigning umbrella group which includes
such unlikely bedfellows as the British Dental Association and the National
Farmers Union - the figures say it all. On Monday the NFA published the
results of a Mori survey which claimed to show that three-quarters of
parents think food advertisements do not encourage children to eat
healthily. According to the poll, two-thirds of parents want to see tougher
restrictions on food ads.
All advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banished from
programmes that large numbers of children are likely to view, says the group
in a submission to the Independent Television Commission, the body which
regulates commercial TV.
The Advertising Association, which represents both advertisers and the
advertising industry, furiously described the survey as 'a superficial and
cynical attempt to steer the political debate about the Health of the Nation
(the government's white paper on strategy for improving health published in
July 1992) on to advertising'. Food advertising is not about diet but about
individual brands, says the association: 'Brand adverts are not tools of
social engineering, even if the NFA would like them to be.'
The AA sees advertising as once again being made the scapegoat. Many of the
arguments, and certainly the level of emotion, are reminiscent of the debate
surrounding tobacco advertising.
In turn, the association is launching the results of its own research at a
seminar in Cambridge today. Conducted by Leeds University researchers, it
concludes: 'Rather than families seeing advertising as distorting the
pattern of their children's eating, in fact, advertising is perceived as
potentially positive in that it may encourage children to try out new
foods.'
The latest row was sparked by the government in March when it said that its
Nutrition Task Force - one of the bodies set up after the Health of the
Nation white paper - would be taking an interest in advertising. The ITC and
the Advertising Standards Authority, the body which polices printed
advertising, were asked to scrutinise their codes of practice in the light
of the white paper dietary targets.
These targets include a huge reduction in the consumption of fat. Diet, and
in particular fat consumption, is seen as a highly significant factor in the
incidence of coronary heart disease and strokes, among the greatest causes
of preventable premature death and disability.
The advertising industry was asked to look at how it could 'encourage
positive use of the advertising message to promote dietary advice consistent
with the Health of the Nation'. Meanwhile, the ITC and ASA were to 'identify
any desirable changes' to advertising codes, paying particular regard to
advertising to children.
The ITC already applies some rules in the area: TV ads must not, for
example, encourage children to eat frequently throughout the day, or to
consume food or drink, especially sweet, sticky foods, near bedtime.
Advertisements for confectionery or snack foods must not suggest they are
substitutes for a balanced meal, and there are also restrictions on health
claims that manufacturers are allowed to make. The ASA applies a similar
code.
The NFA wants these codes strengthened to the point where ads for sweets and
many snack foods would be banned from children's programmes and the 9pm
'watershed' would be applied to ads for fatty or sugary food featuring, for
example, cartoon characters or toys.
The group points to the tougher restrictions applied in some other
countries. For example, Canada, Sweden and the Flanders regional government
in Belgium ban advertising to children during children's programmes. France
bans use of children in food ads. Ads for sweets in the Netherlands, allowed
after 8pm, feature a toothbrush logo to remind children to brush their teeth
although, says the NFA, 'the effectiveness of this has been questioned not
just from a dental health perspective but from the apparent endorsement such
logos give to confectionery products'.
The AA replies that 'the effects of advertising are badly misunderstood.
Advertising restrictions will not improve the nation's health'. In its
response to the government's Nutrition Task Force, it says: 'A strategy for
improved health is best addressed by a targeted programme of public
eduction, encouraged by public authorities and supported by food
manufacturers and retailers.'
The AA's research from Leeds University certainly highlights the extent to
which public education is still needed if government targets are to be met.
One of the most startling findings is that 'nutrition' appears to be about
the least important factor when it comes to planning the family menu.
The researchers concluded that planning, buying, preparing and cooking food
account for 37 per cent of families' concerns, while whether the family
would actually eat and enjoy the food accounted for a further 51 per cent.
Nutrition and health accounted for 7 per cent and even then the subjects
tended to be associated with specialised 'health' foods and vitamin tablets,
rather than daily intake.
The exact role that advertising has to play in the process of raising public
awareness - the AA maintains, self-effacingly, that advertising's role in
these matters is always vastly overrated - is likely to remain a matter of
controversy.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Accountancy Column: Partners contemplate a new existence -
Why liability and more positive factors are making incorporation an
attractive option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just one month after he took over from Mr Jim Butler as head of KPMG Peat
Marwick at the start of this year, Mr Colin Sharman called a meeting of the
firm's inner sanctum of 25 'general partners' to discuss a radical proposal
for change.
He put forward a suggestion that has stirred the profession in the last two
weeks, since the news emerged that KPMG, the UK's second largest firm, was
considering abandoning its traditional legal status as a partnership in
favour of incorporation.
When details of the plan emerged, much of the rhetoric focused on
incorporation as a technique to limit the liability of partners from
vexatious legal actions. In practice, the issue is far more wide-ranging.
For professional partnerships as a whole, the motives are varied and the
results mixed.
At a country hotel in Berkshire at the start of this month, the KPMG general
partners met again and agreed to set up a small sub-committee of three,
including Mr Sharman, to take the idea further. They have until late
September to report back, before making proposals to the full partnership at
its annual meeting in October.
The sub-committee faces some formidable challenges. One of the frustrations
is that little is known about incorporation in professional firms. Few of
any size have so far done it, and little research exists on how successful
it has been.
KPMG is not alone in considering the issue. For example, Mr Ian Brindle,
senior partner of Price Waterhouse, says: 'It is more a case of when than
whether'. He says the firm is examining incorporation, but is unlikely to
make a decision even within the next 12 months.
Like KPMG, Brindle argues that the escalating lawsuits against accountants
is a key force for change. 'The driver is the liability situation,' he says.
'It's got so out of hand.' The same view is taken in a fact sheet issued to
its members last October by the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants.
By incorporating, a firm gets around the difficulty that all the personal
assets of all of its partners are at stake. The firm itself can still be
sued as a corporate entity, but most of the partners would have their own
wealth protected.
Those still at personal risk would be the ones directly involved in the
advice which led to the legal action being taken, who could still be sued
individually. They, like the firm, would attempt to buy insurance cover for
their protection.
'What it gets around is the problem of the Aberdeen tax partner suffering
because of a muck-up by an audit partner in the south east of England,' says
Sharman.
Incorporation also crystallises outstanding legal actions so that new
members joining the partnership would be protected from the legacy of the
past. 'It offers a psychological feeling of well-being to partners for today
and tomorrow that when they go home they still have a home to go to,' says
Brindle.
However, it still falls short of the large accountancy firms' desire to
limit 'joint and several liability', by which they can be ordered to pay all
damages in a court case even if they were only partly to blame.
A firm's reputation may be severely damaged or it may be driven out of
business entirely by legal settlements. But it places the accountants in the
same position as any company.
These worries are less significant in other professions. Mr Chris Bramall,
head of professional ethics at the Law Society, says that firms of
solicitors have been able to incorporate since January 1992, yet only a
handful of sole practitioners have so far done so. 'No one has really shown
any interest in it,' he says.
Mr William Corbett, chief executive of Stephenson Harwood, the law firm,
says: 'The number of outstanding claims against accountants is huge. There
is simply not the same level of against solicitors. When these large
financial transactions go wrong the auditor is a very much closer and easier
target than other professionals.'
He concedes that he has considered incorporation for his firm regularly  -
the last time just six months ago - but has so far ruled it out. He says one
drawback for lawyers is a reluctance to disclose their fee income.
Mr Bramall also highlights drawbacks to incorporation which are as important
for accountants as for lawyers and other types of firm: notably the
transitional tax costs of restructuring. For newly-created partnerships,
this is less of an issue.
More generally, there are considerable cost implications: in the payment of
national insurance and health contributions, pensions and taxes. Yet the
traditional benefits of partnership over corporate structure are now
declining, partly as a result of the move to current year assessment by the
Inland Revenue. Declining profits and falling inflation have reduced the
benefits of deferral of tax that have been possible up till now.
KPMG is in any case believed to be examining some tortuous legal structures
involving a combination of limited partnerships and corporate shells in an
attempt to ameliorate its tax bills.
Incorporation has other clear benefits. Few professions have gone as far as
the chartered surveyors, which relaxed their rules on incorporation as far
back as 1986. A number of firms have now not only taken on a corporate legal
structure, but sought outside capital through investors and stock market
quotations. Access to outside investors is already possible for accountants
and being considered in revisions to Law Society rules.
Mr David Buck, vice chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the surveyor
which floated in 1987, says: 'We were operating in an increasingly
competitive market which promised to put a brake on internal generation of
capital to grow the business. We had aspirations to become a worldwide
property adviser.'
He says that outside investment has not raised concerns from clients about
interference and independence, but has given the company access to
additional resources. He adds that disclosure of profits has proved 'a good
thing' and has no regrets about the decision to go public.
Mr Sharman at KPMG rejects the suggestion that outside capital as a fund for
investment is a necessity - although some of the firm's activities in
eastern Europe and south east Asia do suggest substantial costs that require
funding. But he concedes that his interest in incorporation is far broader
than purely as a response to liability pressures.
He is more interested in the management impact incorporation might have:
whether a corporate legal structure would better permit more corporate-style
governance, or jeopardise the partnership ethos.
A corporate structure might, he argues, make it easier to give long-standing
non-partners an equity stake, relieve the current heavy demands for capital
from newly-elected partners, and make remuneration more flexible, for
example.
These are problems that never troubled his predecessors, which controlled
accountancy firms with partner numbers in double digits. KPMG now has nearly
600 partners in the UK alone.
It is a management challenge for the larger accountancy firms that does not
exist for many of their rivals - neither for the smaller accountants, or
most of the lawyers and surveyors let alone stockbrokers, consultants and
merchant banks that have remained partnerships.
It is one they neglect at their peril.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Regulator seeks more connections: Andrew Adonis meets
Oftel's chief as the organisation enters its second decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is about to celebrate its 10th
birthday. But Mr Don Cruickshank, its second director-general, believes its
task of promoting competition in the UK's Pounds 15bn telecoms market is
still in its infancy.
He said in an interview yesterday that many of the central planks of the
regulatory structure were up for review. Yet by no means all the reforms on
his agenda, particularly his ideas for the future of the price cap on
British Telecommunications, would harm the former state utility - which
still commands about 85 per cent of UK telecoms spending a decade after
abolition of its monopoly.
Mr Cruickshank, a former director of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group,
feels for the 'small guy' up against a former monopoly giant. He
acknowledges that his job is to fix the nuts and bolts of a competitive
telecoms regime, based on the foundations laid by Sir Bryan Carsberg, his
predecessor.
'Apart from Mercury, new competitors are only beginning to make an impact,'
Mr Cruickshank said. The policy framework was 'substantially right', but he
had no doubt that the BT/Mercury duopoly until 1991 held up the process of
establishing a fully competitive regime.
The cornerstones of the regime are the prices competitors have to pay BT for
using its network, and the price cap on BT's charges - which also largely
dictates the prices charged by its competitors. Mr Cruickshank is
open-minded on the future of both.
The first - interconnection - is so arcane that it might as well be
discussed in Latin. It comes down to two issues:
Whether competitors should have to compensate BT for its losses its local
network, caused by the fact BT's rental and connection charges do not cover
the associated costs.
The basis on which competitors should pay BT for inter-connection.
Mercury is crying foul on both counts. Mr Cruickshank clearly regrets that
it has taken Oftel to court. 'We mustn't allow (interconnection) issues to
be determined in the courts - a recipe for the confusion.'
He cited the US judge-created telecoms regime, where 'no-one - regulators or
industry - knows what is or isn't allowed, and that is clearly hampering
innovation and investment. They look with some envy at the way in which our
framework is right and is not hampered by litigation.'
Mr Cruickshank is, however, 'carefully considering' the case for changes and
will publish a paper this autumn on the future of the interconnection
regime. In particular, it is likely to deal with the future of 'access
deficit contributions' - the payments to BT to which Mercury objects.
He is examining the case for continuing to base the contributions on BT's
fully allocated costs, rather than on marginal or incremental costs. He
gives the car as an analogy - the number of times one weighs the fully
allocated cost of a journey before taking it out of the garage are
'extremely few'.
A change to marginal or incremental costs could make a big medium-term
difference to costs faced by competitors.
This autumn's paper will deal with other issues, including the future of
BT's universal service obligation and the basis on which interconnection is
charged. Amendments to BT's licence may be proposed, which could lead to a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry if BT objects.
Perhaps more important for BT is the future of the cap on its prices, which
expires in 1997. Mr Cruickshank said that the 'favourite' remained a new
version of the cap - which constrains BT's prices to a percentage increase
lower than the rate of inflation.
Two other options are on the table. The first is a cap on BT's network
profits or prices - leaving BT, like other operators, unconstrained in
fixing retail prices.
The second option is for a hybrid arrangement, leaving BT free to price in
sectors judged to be sufficiently competitive - such as international calls
 -but restrained in less competitive fields.
The latter two options are problematic. 'I am not satisfied that we in Oftel
have sufficient understanding of market segmentation as yet,' Mr Cruickshank
said.
He believes that by 1996 the position might be different, and he is
impressed by the degree to which BT has separated its network from its
retail divisions in response to competition.
The issue of European telecoms regulation is to the fore, with European
Union-wide telephone competition set to become a reality by 1998.
Mr Cruickshank said: 'What we need is Europe-wide agreement to key
principles.' These were:
Open licensing.
Competing infrastructure, including at a local level.
Interconnection to ensure non-discrimination.
Independent regulators within each country.
'I would definitely not go further than that,' he said, although he sees a
role for the European Commission's competition directorate in policing the
telecoms market.
Mr Cruickshank has no doubt that Oftel is here to stay. 'We will always be
regulating and investigating the behaviour of dominant players.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Mercury in row over network fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A war of words erupted yesterday between Mr Don Cruickshank, the
telecommunications regulator, and Mercury, the main competitor to British
Telecommunications, over payments the company has to make to BT for the use
of its network.
In unusually strong language for a regulator, Mr Cruickshank condemned as
'unnecessary and shrill' recent Mercury statements about the unfairness of
the regulatory regime.
However, Ms Maev Sullivan, Mercury's director of strategy, cited remarks of
Mr Cruickshank's in March in support of her view that payments made by
Mercury to BT for the loss it makes on its local network amounted to a 'tax
on competition'. She said Mr Cruickshank had said that the payments - called
'access deficit contributions' - would come to look like an accounting
fiction.
Oftel said the remarks referred to the case for greater transparency in BT's
accounts, a policy it is currently pursuing.
The dispute came as Mr Cruickshank announced a two-year exemption from the
payments for eight new operators in the UK.
Until March 1996 the operators - ACC, Worldcom, Colt, MFS, Energis,
Telewest, Videotron and Nynex - are unlikely to have to pay BT to help cover
the estimated Pounds 1.45bn it lost last year on maintaining its local
network. The loss is incurred because BT is not allowed to raise its line
rental and connection charges in line with its local network costs.
Under the terms of BT's licence, Oftel can grant waivers to operators,
provided their traffic does not exceed 15 per cent in each of the UK's
international and national telecoms markets. The maximum value of the
waivers to other operators is about Pounds 150m.
Mr Cruickshank said the waivers would 'assist new entrants to establish
themselves in the UK'. But he committed himself to a broad review of the
future of access deficit contributions, which was welcomed by Mercury.
Some analysts were surprised at Oftel's decision to grant waivers to
operators competing largely or exclusively in the international market. They
attributed the move to Oftel's desire to persuade US authorities of the
openness of the UK telecoms market.
Mercury has paid more than Pounds 50m in access deficit contributions in
respect of its international calls. It is estimated to have more than 20 per
cent of the UK's international market, but it is unlikely this year to reach
the level at which it would have to make payments for its domestic traffic.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Ex-power chief's options net Pounds  1/2 m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Wilson, who retired as chairman of London Electricity in April, made
a paper profit of Pounds 516,000 through the company's executive share
option scheme earlier this year.
According to the company's annual report, Mr Wilson exercised options on
150,000 shares at Pounds 2.61 each at a time when the share price stood at
Pounds 6.05p. Three other directors also cashed in options, netting a paper
profit of Pounds 660,000.
Other annual reports showed that directors at Eastern Electricity, Northern
Electric and Yorkshire Electricity exercised options this year, making
substantial profits. They included Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern
Electric, who made a profit of more than Pounds 250,000 on his options on
85,000 shares.
The latest disclosures bring the total profits made on executive share
option schemes in the privatised electricity industry to almost Pounds 10m -
with several companies still due to report. The profits have been denounced
as 'blatant profiteering' by the Labour party, but the companies have
defended them as a way of providing incentives to their top staff.
The options were granted shortly after privatisation in 1989, but only
became exercisable at the beginning of this year for tax reasons. Over the
intervening period, electricity share prices soared, offering the prospect
of large profits for option holders.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Talks progress may hold up Irish summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Dublin are considering postponing next week's UK-Irish summit
because of disappointingly slow progress on agreeing the framework for a
comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, are expected to meet in Brussels tomorrow to decide whether the
summit should go ahead next week as planned.
Representatives of both sides yesterday indicated that the decision was in
the balance.
It is thought unlikely that the meeting will proceed as planned if it is
decided that the framework document cannot be completed in time.
This is in spite of fears in some Whitehall circles that a postponement
until September or later could send out the wrong signal.
Tomorrow's Brussels meeting - at a European Union summit to agree the next
president of the European Commission - comes as tension in the province
again rises in response to a new surge in sectarian violence.
Yesterday saw the second attack this week on the home of a member of the Rev
Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party when a bomb exploded
outside a house in County Tyrone.
The DUP said the device was meant to kill Mr Sam Mc-Cartney, a former
Cookstown councillor.
The bombing, in which nobody was injured, came within 72 hours of an IRA gun
attack on the County Tyrone home of the Rev William McCrea, the DUP MP for
Mid-Ulster. Mr Ray Smallwood, a Protestant militant, was shot dead by the
IRA on Monday night.
British authorities are braced for a new wave of mainland bombings after the
discovery on Tuesday of more than two tonnes of explosives hidden on a lorry
arriving at Heysham in north-west England.
The attacks come at a provocative time, coinciding with the annual Orange
Day celebrations by Protestants.
The main obstacles in the path to a framework agreement are differences
between the two sides over the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to
Ulster, and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance
cross-border co-operation.
London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's
territorial claim is not addressed, but it sees little point in granting
concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected by unionists.
Mr Reynolds continued to adopt a hard line on cross-border co-operation in a
speech on Tuesday in the US, saying north-south institutions 'must now be
established'.
But he said such bodies would be 'without prejudice to longer-term
constitutional decisions'.

FT  14 JUL 94 / MPs demand more cash for primary education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should increase funding for primary schools, a cross-party
Commons committee recommended yesterday.
It said that 'any real-terms increase in funding that becomes available,
from either national or local government' should be distributed
'disproportionately in favour of primary schools'.
There should also be a small annual shift in funding between the sectors,
moving towards a common pupil-teacher ratio for both. The committee said
that at present there was 'insufficient support time' for teachers in
primary schools, where there are 22.21 pupils to each teacher, compared with
15.83 in secondary schools.
An average of 40 per cent more is spent on each English secondary pupil than
for each primary pupil.
The report said: 'If any particular phase of school education is funded at a
disproportionately low level, children of all ages will suffer, and in the
long run the nation as a whole suffers.'
Unions gave the report a strong welcome, but said that funds for secondary
schools should not be cut. The government welcomed the report as a
contribution to debate.
The government intends to spread the common funding formula for
grant-maintained secondary schools to another 16 local authorities next
year. It will add to the incentives for schools still with those local
authorities to opt out.
Under the formula grant-maintained schools are paid the funding they would
have received if their local authority had spent as much on education as was
predicted by the government's standard spending assessment, even if the
authority spends less than that official assessment. But if the council
spends more than its assessment the formula allows for opted-out schools to
be paid more.
The 16 authorities, in all of which 30 per cent of secondary pupils are
taught in grant-maintained schools, are: Barnet, Brent, Cambridgeshire,
Croydon, Cumbria, Ealing, Enfield, Hertfordshire, Kent,
Kingston-upon-Thames, Lambeth, Lincolnshire, Southwark, Sutton, Wandsworth,
and Wiltshire.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Ofgas ready to accept delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it could accept a short delay to the
April 1996 target for the phased opening of the domestic gas market as long
as legislation is in place ensuring full liberalisation in 1998.
The regulator was responding to a disclosure by British Gas that it had
asked the government to put back by six months the 1996 target date to open
5 per cent of the domestic market to competition.
British Gas said such a move would ensure that the information technology
systems which are being put in place in preparation for market
liberalisation 'are fully bedded down'.
It described the development of the new systems as a 'leap in the dark'.
It dismissed fears voiced by some independent gas marketers that the delay
was part of a plan to scupper competition. 'We're not in the business of
scuppering anything.'
British Gas said it wanted to see the legislation needed to open up the
market included in the Queen's speech this autumn. It was also satisfied
with other parts of the liberalisation timetable, which calls for 5 per cent
of the market to be opened in 1996 and 10 per cent in 1997 before full
liberalisation in 1998.
Ofgas yesterday said its priority was to see the new Gas Act in place. 'A
six-month delay would not be too much of a problem' as long as full
liberalisation in 1998 was assured.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Blair outlines fresh approach to welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday signalled his determination to give fresh direction
to Labour's approach to the welfare state by emphasising its role as a
'springboard to success' rather than an instrument of dependency.
In a speech which addressed also the growing insecurity of the nation's
middle classes, Mr Blair signalled that the private sector as well as the
public sector should be given a role in modernising the welfare system.
He said the country's 'anxious majority' needed the security of modern
welfare as much as the poor and the disadvantaged.
Instead of debating the level of benefit spending, Labour would concentrate
on making welfare more effective in getting people back to work and
financially independent. The state should be offering services  - such as
training and the provision of childcare - as well as cash.
Anticipating the conclusions this autumn of Labour's Commission for Social
Justice, Mr Blair said that the welfare state created by the post-war Labour
government had to be adapted to the demands of a rapidly changing world.
He told an audience at the Southampton Institute: 'The world has changed
since 1945, there is no going back. Welfare must be harnessed to manage that
change and create the opportunities and most importantly the security for
people who are finding it hard to succeed.'
In a deliberate attempt to discard the party's image as one of easy welfare
handouts, Mr Blair accused the Conservatives of doubling 'benefit
dependency' since 1979. Labour's objective would be to create a 'nation at
work not on benefit'.
Setting out a series of principles for reform Mr Blair said Labour must
reduce dependency by removing disincentives to taking paid work.
It must address the concerns of the 'insecure majority' by providing bridges
between employment.
Citing the 'absurd situation' of a woman being forced to give up a part-time
job because her husband had become unemployed, Mr Blair said the party
needed to reduce discrimination against women in the welfare system.
Labour would also develop plans for 'lifelong learning' and make provision
of re-skilling a vital complement to benefits. Welfare payments also needed
to be more flexible to provide recipients with greater choice and
opportunity.
Mr Blair made no specific mention of his approach to the universality of
payments such as child benefit but attacked the Conservative party's plans
to extend the means-testing of benefits.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Figures signal end to job slide in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first signs that the 25-year decline in manufacturing employment may be
ending have been detected by the Department of Employment
Official figures yesterday showed a rise in manufacturing employment in May
for the second consecutive month.
The news accompanied a fall in unemployment figures in June for the fifth
consecutive month in all regions - except Northern Ireland - to a seasonally
adjusted 2.64m.
Manufacturing employment rose 2,000 in May. It has risen in seven of the
past 12 months.
Manufacturing jobs fell 17,000 in the year to May, but Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, said yesterday that there were hopes that a 'turning
point has been reached'. Officials said although it was too early to be
confident of strong employment growth in manufacturing, there was at least a
levelling off.
The biggest increases in manufacturing employment occurred in the paper and
printing sector, where jobs rose 3,000 in May and 16,000 over the past year.
Job increases were seen in the metal-goods sector and in mechanical
engineering, which each took on another 1,000 employees in May.
This was offset by the chemical and fibre sector, which lost 5,000 jobs in
May - the fifth consecutive monthly fall.
The rise in manufacturing jobs was welcomed in the City yesterday, although
analysts admitted that they remained sceptical about the unemployment data.
They pointed out that although unemployment had fallen by 148,300 since the
start of this year, there was still little evidence of a corresponding
growth in employment levels.
Meanwhile, they suggested, the rate of the monthly fall in unemployment
slowed last month, which might indicate that the decline was bottoming out.
Unemployment fell 18,800 last month, compared with monthly declines of about
35,000 in the spring.
A further cause for concern was that the number of actual hours worked in
manufacturing fell last month in spite of the increase in manufacturing
jobs. The index of average hours was 96.7 in May, its lowest level for more
than a decade.
The number of overtime hours in manufacturing fell to 8.6m in May, its
lowest level since April last year, and the third-lowest rate ever recorded.
On the positive side, the stock of vacancies in Jobcentres rose 5,000 to
152,800, and new vacancies rose to 209,600, the highest for four years.
Productivity growth slipped, however. Productivity in May was 2.3 per cent
higher than last May, compared with an annual growth rate of 3.7 per cent in
April and 2.9 per cent in January.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Inflation and average earnings unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two important measures of price pressure were unchanged yesterday, providing
good economic news for the government.
The annual rate of headline inflation in June was 2.6 per cent, the same as
in May, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. But underlying
inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, fell to 2.4 per cent
from 2.5 per cent in May.
Average earnings across the economy rose at an underlying rate of 3.75 per
cent in May, the same as in April, the Department of Employment said.
A complex set of factors left the retail prices index unchanged in June.
Price rises included 2p per pint on draught bitter, and there were some
increases in bus and rail fares.
Seasonal food prices, which rose sharply in May, failed to fall as much as
expected in June - a month-on-month fall of 0.5 per cent compared with a 4.6
per cent fall in June last year. Onions, cauliflowers and cucumbers all saw
higher prices.
Retailers' summer sales have started later and have yet to see such sharp
price cuts as last year. Nevertheless, the sales still put downward pressure
on the RPI, as did cuts in the prices of personal articles, such as
umbrellas, spectacle frames and clocks.
The annual growth in prices of non-seasonal food remained very low.
Second-hand car prices fell about 0.4 per cent, the first time they had
declined in June since 1982. The effect was to offset a rise of 1p a gallon
in the cost of four-star petrol and to leave motoring costs unchanged
between May and June.
The newspaper price wars have yet to have an effect on the index. The CSO
said the cuts in the cover prices of The Times and The Daily Telegraph
newspapers would knock about 0.03 per cent off the all-items index in July.
Price reductions from the summer sales should also continue in July, and
further falls in seasonal food prices are likely. The RPI has fallen in July
in each of the past three years.
The standstill in the annual growth rate of annual earnings was welcomed by
the markets, which became concerned about the steady rise in this measure in
the early months of this year. The annual rate peaked in March, when City
bonuses pushed the rate up to 4 per cent.
The seasonally adjusted index - which does not smooth out the statistical
series to account for any temporary influences - rose on the month, with an
annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent in May, compared with 3.6 per cent in
April.
The lowest underlying rate of growth occurred in the services sector, where
wages grew 3.5 per cent - the same as the month before. Earnings in the
manufacturing and production sectors grew 4.25 per cent, slightly down from
the previous month.
The underlying figure was in line with City expectations, and analysts
yesterday welcomed it as evidence that the recent industrial pick-up and
fall in unemployment had not yet fed through to significantly higher wage
demands.
They warned, however, that more settlements were in the pipeline which might
fuel a slight rise later this summer.
A wage settlement for the Agricultural Services Board next month, for
example, has been set at 4.9 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent last year,
the employment department said. A settlement for civil engineering has been
agreed at 2.4 per cent compared with no increase last year.
Growth in the manufacturing sector's unit wage costs remained low - 1.7 per
cent higher in the three months to May than in the same period a year ago.
Manufacturing output per head rose 2.9 per cent over the same period.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Political Notebook: The race for second place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been what you might call an exciting contest. Everyone except Mrs
Margaret Beckett's friends seems to know that Mr Tony Blair will be crowned
Labour leader next week. He professes in turn to be neutral as to whether
Mrs Beckett or Mr John Prescott is installed as his deputy. He has a point.
The obsession of Westminster insiders with nominal hierarchies has persuaded
commentators that the deputy's post is a vital one. There will, after all,
be at least half-a-dozen Tuesdays or Thursdays every year when Mr Blair will
be away hobnobbing with the great and the good abroad. The deputy then will
have to face Mr John Major across the Commons despatch box. This is an
awesome task.
The truth is otherwise. The few hundred voters who catch on television the
occasions when the understudy quizzes the prime minister doubtless will have
views about Mr Prescott's rhetorical style or the colour of Mrs Beckett's
outfits. The rest will regard the choice of runner-up as irrelevant.
Mr Blair will not be an all-powerful leader. After the internecine warfare
in the 1980s Mr Neil Kinnock's invaluable legacy was a party ready once
again to listen to the leadership. Attentiveness however is not the same as
subservience. The new leader will secure real control when he wins a general
election.
His starting point though will be stronger than that of the late John Smith
or Mr Kinnock. The election will be as near-as-dammit democratic. Shadow
cabinet colleagues believe he has a real chance of ending up in 10 Downing
Street. They want to sit round a real cabinet table. So they will behave.
But back to the contest. Mrs Beckett has emerged as the candidate of the
party's we-mustn't-betray-our-principles tendency. Never mind that her views
changed somewhat between her infamous denunciation of the treachery of Mr
Kinnock in 1981 and her ready acceptance a decade later of John Smith's
offer of the deputy's job.
Now she has rediscovered her radical roots. She has said little about
policy, preferring instead to stress her experience. In a party still
over-subscribed with male chauvinists she has emphasised the need for a
balanced ticket.
But the overall tone of Mrs Beckett's campaign has been unapologetically
that of the blinkered left. She has spoken of the need to sweep away the
Tory union laws, of re-nationalising the water industry and of ridding
Labour of the obsession with costing which has stifled its ambitions.
So most in Labour's hard-left Campaign Group have been trailing after Mrs
Beckett as if she had never jettisoned a principle in her life. Never mind
that before the last general election she stripped the manifesto of spending
pledges. Doubtless Mr Blair assumes that if Mrs Beckett wins she will
rediscover the virtues of modernism.
The Conservatives, of course, want Mr Prescott to win the deputy's post. He
may well do so.
Mr Prescott has been followed around for the whole of the campaign by a
little man from Tory Central Office clutching a tape-recorder. The basement
of Smith Square, we are told, is already crammed with evidence of the rash
pledges and policy contradictions uttered by Mr Prescott. Then there is the
promise of more 'gaffes' when he is quizzed by the media during the election
campaign itself.
The trouble is there is no longer much mileage for the Conservatives in the
look-what-he-said-then approach to politics. Look what they once said about
taxes and about the European exchange rate mechanism and the European Union
and you will understand why.
Anyway, few Tories understand Mr Prescott and most underrate his
intelligence and political skills. He does have an acute sense of Labour's
history. It is also fair to say his burning ambition for full employment has
not caught up with the painful realities of a global economy.
But he has moved on since his days as a steward on Cunard liners turned him
into a union radical. Mr Prescott does not belong to the Labour tradition
which thinks it is the job of the party to make life comfortable for the
workers on the factory floor. The language may be different, but Mr Prescott
shares Mr Blair's view that the job of socialism is not to patronise the
working classes but to provide them with escape routes. Nothing is too good
for the workers.
Some say that if he had not drifted into Labour politics, Mr Prescott would
have made a personal fortune as a northern entrepreneur. Many of his friends
in Hull have done just that. He might even have ended up voting
Conservative.
Mr Prescott would regard that last comment as libellous (but would never
sue). He is irritated still by the easy confidence of Mr Blair and his
friends among Labour's 'beautiful people'. His weakness is his
unpredicatability - but as deputy to Mr Blair he would be loyal. That
counts.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Truce agreed in glazing dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A truce was agreed in the High Court yesterday in a poaching dispute between
Anglian Windows, the Norwich-based double-glazing company, and Aspen
Windows, set up by Mr George Williams, Anglian's founder and former chief.
Anglian, the UK's biggest double-glazing group, is suing Aspen, Mr Williams,
and 10 salesmen who left Anglian to join Aspen. It claims the 10 are in
breach of their contracts.
Pending a full hearing of the dispute, the salesmen gave undertakings to Mr
Justice Aldous not to solicit customers who were Anglian customers during
specified periods. Aspen pledged not to induce breaches of contract by the
10 or any other Anglian representatives.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Number of pay freezes declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay freezes are declining as the recession recedes, the Institute of
Directors said yesterday.
Its survey found that the proportion of company directors planning to link
pay to inflation over the next year had increased from 38 per cent to 43 per
cent. Only 11 per cent were planning a pay freeze.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Business 'backs training levy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, yesterday said there
was growing support in the business community for a levy to pay for
in-company training, Lisa Wood writes.
He was addressing the annual conference in Birmingham of training and
enterprise councils, which administer government training schemes in England
and Wales.
Mr Monks later said there was 'closet support' for the levy among employers,
who consider it 'disloyal to pipe up in favour of anything that involves new
regulation of the labour market'.
A survey of Tec directors by the Financial Times showed interest in a more
regulatory path towards training.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Fast-stream system faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial fast-stream entry scheme for recruiting high-calibre
graduates to the civil service is likely to survive, following a review by
the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit published yesterday.
The scheme takes just over 100 graduates each year on what has been seen as
a ticket to the top of Whitehall. The programme has been criticised for
being too elitist and biased towards Oxbridge graduates.
The Efficiency Unit study recommends retaining the scheme to attract top
graduates in a recruitment market where most other large employers compete
for the best people. It says this is the best way of attracting a share of
the most able graduates with the quickness, sensitivity and flexibility to
manage change successfully.
But the study also says acceptance into the fast-stream should not be seen
as an automatic route to the top. Those who enter it should receive limited
but intensive training to help them develop their skills and acquire
relevant experience. But they should then compete with others, inside and
outside the civil service, for top jobs.
The unit recommends that the scheme be renamed the Policy Management
Programme to get away from the 'fast-stream' concept. It says that the
selection processes should be re-examined to eliminate bias towards Oxbridge
graduates.
The review was published on the same day as the civil service white paper,
which welcomes its conclusions and invites comments. It is clear from the
white paper, however, that those who rise to the top of Whitehall in the
future will be less likely to have spent their entire career in the civil
service as most of today's permanent secretaries have.
The government believes that the advertising of many top jobs - especially
at the higher salaries likely in the three highest grades - will attract
more outsiders into Whitehall. Eight out of the 35 permanent secretaries are
already outsiders, including Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the
Treasury.
Ambitious young entrants to the new Policy Management Programme will be well
advised to think about spending a period outside the civil service even if
they hope to rise to the top in Whitehall.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said: 'The top mandarins in
30 years time will be more likely to have spent long periods outside the
civil service or to have joined after a career elsewhere.'
A second Efficiency Unit study published yesterday suggests a new role for
the Civil Service Commissioners in monitoring Whitehall's recruitment
procedures to ensure that they adhere to the principles of openness,
fairness and merit.
The study says the commissioners should lose their remaining responsibility
for recruitment in favour of regulating departments which will take over all
recruitment responsibilities.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Tory revolution reaches heart of the civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's white paper brings to Whitehall, heart of the British civil
service, the management revolution the Conservatives have introduced in
public services such as health, education and local government over the last
15 years.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said: 'We must continue to
cut the state down to size by demanding quality at a price the taxpayer can
afford.'
With the freeze in running costs announced in November's Budget, civil
servants will have to join the struggle to find 'more for less.' As
resources fall in real terms over the next four years, they will be expected
to seek constant improvements in quality of service, in line with the
approach of the Citizen's Charter.
To help them, government departments will be given greater freedom over
budgets, including the right to decide the pay and grading of staff, whose
pay makes up more than half of civil service running costs.
Permanent secretaries are to be encouraged to 'de-layer' - to reorganise
their management structures with fewer grades. Senior civil servants at
grade 5 and above - there are currently about 3,000 - will be put on
personal contracts that emphasise their responsibilities to manage.
There will be no targets for reducing the number of civil servants.
Controlling staff numbers is not an effective way of reducing costs, the
white paper says, and can even increase costs if more expensive outsiders
have to be used.
Civil service numbers have fallen by 32,000 since the start of 1993, and at
533,350 are the lowest since world war II. war. Mr Waldegrave said he
expected the total 'to fall significantly below 500,000 over the next four
years.'
Much of this drop will be achieved by normal turnover, of about 5 per cent a
year. Where 'early departures' are needed, the Treasury will cover 80 per
cent of the redundancy costs to encourage reductions.
Departments will be freed of much day-to-day interference by the Treasury
and the Cabinet Office. Annual targets for the market-testing programme of
putting work out to tender will no longer be set, for example.
But permanent secretaries will require all the tools of modern management to
achieve their departments' aims with declining resources in real terms, the
white paper says. These will include contracting-out and privatisation, but
the white paper adds three more items to the 'toolbox':
Priority-based cost management, using customer preferences to decide how to
spend limited budgets.
Benchmarking, which compares performance with similar organisations in the
public and private sector to identify the most efficient practices.
Process re-engineering - redesigning how work is done from scratch, ignoring
current approaches.
There will be improved rewards for top mandarins, with increases in pay for
the top three grades recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body in
February but only partially implemented by the government.
The range of pay for permanent secretaries, the top grade, will be widened
to reflect the responsibilities of the 35 posts. A remuneration committee
with a majority of non-civil servants will determine the pay of each
permanent secretary.
'The government believes it will be in the national interest to have over a
period a somewhat smaller but better-paid senior civil service,' the white
paper says.
Many of the white paper's recommendations reflect proposals in a Cabinet
Office Efficiency Unit report on career management and succession planning
in the civil service, published in November.
The report said more top Whitehall jobs should be advertised openly to
ensure that the best candidates are considered. In future, departments will
have to consider advertising all senior posts. A decision not to advertise
vacancies in the 160 jobs at grades 1, 1A and 2 will have to be approved by
the Cabinet Office. There will be an annual report on advertised jobs.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Departments to adopt resource accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All central government departments will be required to comply with radical
new 'resource accounting' guidelines within the next four years, under
official proposals unveiled yesterday.
Departments will have to account for capital expenditure and develop more
accurate and relevant management information, a Treasury green paper says.
The paper describes the changes as 'probably the most important reform of
civil service accounting and budgeting arrangements this century'.
It follows a pledge for reform of the present 'archaic' public-sector
accounting system in the Budget speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
The green paper says that most government departments would implement
resource accounting by April 1 1997 and the remainder a year later. The
accounts would be laid before parliament for the first time in 1999-2000.
At the launch of the document yesterday Mr Clarke said: 'People will find
other ways of celebrating the millennium but few will be more important.
This is one of those highly significant events.'
He said the recommendations would bring public-sector accounting 'up to
date' and 'very much more in line' with the best of financial reporting in
the private sector.
The proposals are in stark contrast to the present system - which Mr Clarke
called 'silly' - by which cash is recorded when money is first spent on
capital items, with no account subsequently taken of whether an asset is
still in use, has been sold or reached the end of its useful life.
The green paper says resource accounting encompasses both the adoption of
accruals accounting, similar to that used by companies, and the development
of a framework for analysing expenditure by departmental objectives.
It will lead to longer-term use of resource budgeting for future
decision-making, and to the development of a series of output indicators to
improve civil service management.
The paper stresses the need to link inputs to outputs, with the emphasis on
improved management and on what departments produce rather than what they
have available to spend.
Its recommendations should provide a better basis for treating capital,
encourage a more systematic approach to charging for capital items and make
comparisons easier across departments and with the private sector.
The proposals suggest financial statements for each department would
include:
An operating cost statement, highlighting resources consumed during the year
net of department income from customers.
A balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, provisions and an analysis
of capital employed.
A cashflow statement, analysing capital and current cash outflows and
sources of finance.
Mr Andrew Likierman, head of the government's accountancy service, said the
computer and associated costs of implementing the system would be up to
Pounds 3m in each department.
Reacting to the green paper, Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the Chartered
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said: 'This is good news and a
very important progressive step. It will generate widespread recognition and
support overseas.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Reforms will 'politicise Whitehall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party was quick to criticise the government's white paper on the
civil service, saying it would bring greater politicisation of Whitehall
with more recruits from the private sector.
The criticisms were echoed by civil service union leaders. Mr Bill Brett,
general secretary of the IPMS union, suggested that individual contracts
would 'politicise' top advisers and fragment pay systems.
Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association, said the
white paper had not dealt with issues which the public cared about, 'such as
high standards, quality services and restoring confidence in public life'.
The only union leader to threaten industrial conflict was Mr John Sheldon,
general secretary of the NUCPS, which represents executive officer grades.
He said the paper was a 'cynical con trick on the public'.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow public service minister, condemned the document
as a 'wholly arbitrary exercise' in which the government had 'abdicated
responsibility for the overall direction and general goals of the civil
service'.
He also suggested it was a 'menu for accelerated privatisation of the civil
service which threatened the constitutional principles on which the civil
service has rested for 150 years'. Mr Giles Radice, Labour chairman of the
Commons Treasury and civil service committee, welcomed the government's
intention to consult opposition parties before introducing change.
The white paper won general support from Conservative MPs, who believe the
proposals will accelerate efficiency measures. But Mr David Howell, Tory
chairman of the foreign affairs committee, warned that nothing should be
done that would damage 'the fine tradition of public service'.
The union general secretaries criticised the government's intention to scrap
national civil service pay bargaining and introduce 150 separate bargaining
units.
Mr Brett said the Treasury would 'still pull the strings' over the levels of
civil service pay and this would lead to more strikes provoked by the
government.
Mr Howard Davies, the Confederation of British Industry director-general,
welcomed decentralisation of pay bargaining. 'Without it the government's
pay bill freeze could not work in the long-run,' he said.
He added, however, that the proposals for the senior ranks were 'not
radical' and would leave the civil service monopoly 'essentially intact'.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Gummer starts debate on environmental planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday launched a debate on
how Britain's man-made environment can be improved.
In a speech which officials said could influence planning guidelines, he
emphasised the part quality should play in developing towns and communities.
His speech to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors was accompanied by
a discussion document, Quality in Town and Country, which contains a
questionnaire. Responses will furnish material for a conference Mr Gummer
will organise in the autumn. That, in turn, will provide the basis for
policy decisions.
Mr Gummer said quality set the tone for communities, and could bring
benefits, such as a stronger sense of belonging by local people and
businesses, and greater economic vitality. It could also lead to better and
more viable buildings, and breathe life into town centres.
'While we need new development, we yearn for buildings which will raise our
rights, not dash our hopes,' he says in the document's preface.
Environmentalists welcomed Mr Gummer's initiative as further evidence of a
policy shift in the Department of the Environment which they say is seeking
to move development away from the countryside and back into town centres.
Recent planning guidelines issued by the department to local authorities
discourage out-of-town developments which are seen as increasing traffic
pollution by requiring people to travel.
Officials stress that Mr Gummer wants to take the debate beyond the design
of buildings to include the layout of communities, creation of successful
town centres and preservation of heritage, and to accommodate other policy
areas, particularly transport and housing.
Apart from the atmospheric effects of better quality, he wants to stress the
business benefits - better buildings last longer and are more adaptable, and
well-planned towns are more economically sustainable.
The initiative is being presented as a further step in the direction of
sustainable development to which the UK committed itself at the Rio Earth
Summit two years ago.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Riddick apologises for 'lack of judgment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Riddick, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley who agreed to table
a parliamentary question for a fee of Pounds 1,000, last night apologised to
the Commons for his 'lack of judgment'.
The apology came as MPs approved without a vote a motion authorising the
committee of privileges to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the so-called
'cash for questions' affair.
The committee of senior MPs, picked by arrangement between the parties, will
investigate payments made to MPs for tabling parliamentary questions and the
role of The Sunday Times in the controversy.
Tory backbenchers strongly attacked The Sunday Times, one of whose
journalists posed as a businessman when offering Pounds 1,000 to a number of
MPs for putting down questions to ministers in the Commons.
Mr Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick, the Conservative MP for Bosworth, were
named in the newspaper as having accepted Pounds 1,000 each.
In a contrite speech, Mr Riddick welcomed the fact that it would be his
peers on the committee of privileges 'sitting in judgment' and not the
press.
He said: 'I accept that I made an error of judgment in agreeing to table a
question and agreeing, initially, to accept a fee.' He had later decided not
to accept the fee and sent the cheque back by return of post.
Throughout the debate there were demands from the opposition benches that
MPs should be barred from accepting outside business commitments,
particularly as consultants, which involved using facilities and procedures
of the Commons.
Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark Bermondsey, said that
on stepping down from the leadership of the party Sir David Steel had been
offered a five-figure sum for one year to book rooms in the Commons where he
could join in entertaining the clients of a consultancy.
Mr Hughes said that Sir David had been, in his own words, 'astounded' by the
offer, which he had declined.
Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, called for all MPs to be subject
to the rules which prevent ministers accepting gifts or hospitality which
could be said to influence their decisions.
Insisting that MPs should not accept payment for acting as consultants, he
said: 'We are elected to be consultants to the British people.'
Moving the motion authorising an inquiry, Mr Nick Brown, shadow leader of
the House, said the role of The Sunday Times in subjecting MPs to entrapment
should be investigated along with the conduct of MPs.
Sir John Gorst, Tory MP for Hendon North, condemned the undercover use of a
tape recorder by The Sunday Times journalist when he agreed to see him, in
the belief that he was a genuine businessman, within the parliamentary
precincts. He said that those who sought to cause an MP to commit a contempt
of the House by accepting bribes were themselves guilty of contempt.
In the aftermath of the debate, some senior Tories expressed concerns about
the extent of the reforms that the investigation might bring in its wake. 'I
detect a sea-change,' said one. 'I think we are moving towards full-time
MPs,' said another.
The expectation last night was that the names of the MPs chosen to sit on
the committee would be decided within days and that the inquiry would get
under way before the summer recess, which starts next week.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Delay in shares report may hit Archer's hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is still waiting for the inspectors'
report into the share dealing in connection with which Lord Archer, the
former Conservative deputy chairman, was named.
Lord Archer had hoped that he would be cleared before the coming reshuffle,
enabling the prime minister to bring him back into the government.
The department has acknowledged the need to settle the affair as soon as
possible. However, in reply to a written question from Mr Robin Cook,
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, the department is expected to say
today that it has still not received the inspectors' report. It is expected
to reveal that informal discussions have taken place between the department
and the inspectors.
The department believes it was unfortunate that Lord Archer's name was
leaked and would like to clear the best-selling novelist as soon as possible
if, as expected, the report shows no wrongdoing by him.
But ministers are determined that no pressure should be brought on the
inspectors to conclude their report before they are ready.
That means Lord Archer may have to wait until after the reshuffle before
being cleared.
Such a delay would undermine his chances of joining the government. He was
widely believed to be a candidate for a junior ministerial post, such as
sports minister.
The investigation, launched in February, centres on share dealing in Anglia
TV before an agreed takeover bid which sent shares soaring. Lord Archer's
wife, Mary, is a non-executive director of Anglia.
The department has refused to discuss details of the inquiry but it is
understood to involve a single transaction involving 30,000 shares and a
profit of about Pounds 50,000.
In a Commons written answer yesterday Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry
minister, said seven reports by the department's inspectors completed since
1983 had never been published.

Mr Gregory Stranger, 26, of west London, who worked for the Swiss Bank
Corporation, is accused of taking the SFr3.821m between May 16 and 27 this
year. Magistrates adjourned the case for three months.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Lloyd's to probe Sturge losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is to launch an investigation into losses suffered by two
syndicates of the Sturge agency.
The investigation, to be supervised by the insurance market's regulatory
board, will concern losses registered by syndicates 210 and 428 in the 1990
underwriting year.
Such investigations, known in the market as 'loss reviews', are triggered
when losses exceed more than 100 per cent of stamp capacity, the amount of
premium income a syndicate is allowed to accept.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Big rise in air traffic reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong air-traffic growth figures for June were reported yesterday by
airlines and airports. The figures confirm the recovery in the UK air travel
business, a traditional early barometer of overall economic activity, Paul
Betts writes.
British Midland Airways, the UK's second-largest scheduled airline, said
passenger traffic last month rose 9 per cent compared with June last year.
BAA, the privatised airports operator, also reported a 9.1 per cent increase
in passenger numbers at its seven airports last month compared with June
1993. Traffic at Gatwick grew nearly 10 per cent, the biggest monthly
increase for more than three years, while Heathrow was up almost 9 per cent.
Both Stansted and Glasgow grew 12.3 per cent.
Manchester Airport, which is not owned by BAA, reported an even higher
increase last month of 14.2 per cent. The figures follow a strong
performance at British Airways which last week reported an 11.2 per cent
increase in passenger traffic last month.

FT  14 JUL 94 / FT man offered Independent editorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shareholders of The Independent yesterday decided to offer the
editorship of the loss-making newspaper to Mr Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor
of the Financial Times.
Mr Hargreaves, 43, has been the favourite for the post - which is one of the
most challenging in British national journalism - for some time.
The decision by the shareholders to make a formal offer was taken at a
telephone conference yesterday morning.
The main shareholders of Newspaper Publishing, the holding company of The
Independent and The Independent on Sunday, include El Pas of Spain, La
Repubblica of Italy, Independent Newspapers of Ireland and Mirror Group
Newspapers.
Some weeks ago Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The
Independent, agreed to stand down as editor once a replacement had been
found.
Mr Whittam Smith will remain as chairman of Newspaper Publishing.
It was Mr Whittam Smith who last night offered the editorship of the
newspaper that he created to Mr Hargreaves.
Mr Hargreaves is now considering the offer, but has not yet accepted it.
Newspaper Publishing is believed to be losing about Pounds 1m a month
although this could be halved once the business side of the company is fully
integrated with Mirror Group Newspapers.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Tebbit fires salvo for disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, yesterday criticised
hoteliers for not doing enough to help disabled guests and warned the
industry to take action to reduce pressure for legislation.
He said at the annual lunch of the British Hospitality Association, which
represents hoteliers, restaurateurs and caterers: 'When as hoteliers you
order new tables for dining rooms, does anyone say: 'Would the knees of
someone in a wheelchair fit under that table?' '
Lord Tebbit said his wife would not forgive him if he did not raise the
issue. Lady Tebbit was disabled by the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in
Brighton during the Tory party conference in 1984.
Lord Tebbit said proposals in the recent backbench bill on the rights of the
disabled, which was defeated in May, were 'quite absurd' and would have
imposed unjustifiable costs on organisations such as London Underground.
But he told the association's members that support for the bill had been
increased by a perception that the interests of the disabled had been
ignored.
He added that the tourist industry had to do more to protect the environment
on which it depended for its success.
One step the association could take would be to campaign for someone to take
overall responsibility for the movement of London traffic. When he had asked
who was responsible for traffic in the capital he had been given a 'list as
long as my arm'.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Knapp ready to escalate strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union's executive is expected to announce details today of
an escalation of the railway signalling dispute with a move to two
strike-days a week from July 24.
With no sign of an early return to negotiations with Railtrack at Acas, the
conciliation service, the union's leaders are becoming reconciled to a
drawn-out conflict.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, said that yesterday's strike had
been solidly supported by signal workers. 'Even on Railtrack's dubious
figures, four-fifths of trains were not running,' he said.
'Services that were running were little more than cosmetic in some parts of
the country, with services starting late and finishing early.'
Mr Knapp said managers and supervisors had been dragooned into signalboxes.
He suggested that safety guidelines were being stretched to breaking point
as Railtrack tried to defeat the strike by using staff with no previous
knowledge of signalbox working.
He said the RMT was pursuing ways of using the law, including injunctions,
to block 'unsafe' working practices by Railtrack.
Railtrack and British Rail said they had achieved their target of running
about 3,000 trains, one-fifth of the usual number. InterCity expresses ran
through to Birmingham New Street instead of stopping at Birmingham
International.
Great Western said more travellers were using its trains than on previous
Wednesdays.
The rail stoppage is producing benefits for some airlines. British Midland
has gained 1,000 to 1,500 passengers on each strike day as travellers unable
to get to Gatwick and Stansted airports by train have switched to Heathrow,
which can be reached by Underground.
But the Freight Transport Association, whose members generate 90 per cent of
rail freight traffic, said that the strikes were damaging the image of the
railway just when the opening of the Channel tunnel was making rail
shipments more attractive.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Rifkind to set out Pounds 750m defence cuts: Fighting
capacity to be maintained; Job losses to be sweetened by procurement plans;
Unions issue plea to cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will today outline to the Commons
his plans to trim more than Pounds 750m a year from defence spending without
affecting fighting capacity.
As a 'sweetener' to balance up to 20,000 job losses, Mr Rifkind will also
confirm procurement of several weapons systems. Some of these announcements
may be restatements of decisions which have already been taken in principle.
The economy drive, which comes into effect from 1996-97, has been billed as
a way of saving money on support services without harming the military's
fighting ability.
The axe is expected to fall heavily on logistics and maintenance personnel
in the Royal Air Force, with widespread privatisation of repair work.
Rosyth naval base in Fife, initially tipped for closure, has won a partial
reprieve, with more than half the 1,300 civilian employees keeping their
jobs.
Mr Jack Dromey, chairman of a group of defence unions, yesterday appealed to
the government to spare the axe. He said: 'We ask the cabinet not to proceed
with the break-up of Europe's most efficient naval-support network.'
Today's announcement will mark the conclusion of 33 separate studies. Ideas
under review have included the closing of defence buildings on lucrative
London sites; the merging of three staff colleges; the scaling down of
medical services, including hospitals; and the leasing, instead of buying,
of non-combat vehicles - the defence establishment operates more than 90,000
such vehicles.
The most likely procurement orders include the second batch of 259
Challenger II main battle tanks for the army, for which Vickers was asked to
tender last year.
Also likely to be announced is the mid-life update for Tornado aircraft, and
replacement command and control systems for some Trafalgar submarines from
BAe/Sema.
There will also be invitations to tender for the replacements to landing
ships Fearless and Intrepid, which could be built at Swan Hunter in Tyneside
or VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Formal tender invitations will also
be issued for the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards, which are due to be
privatised by 1996.
Less certain are orders for the next batch of Type 23 frigates, which are
expected to go to Yarrow on the Clyde, and orders for Sandown minehunters
which are being contested between Vosper Thornycroft at Southampton and
Yarrow. The orders are expected shortly, but may not yet be ready for
signing. Still in the pending tray is the decision on support helicopters
for the RAF. A mixed fleet of Boeing Chinooks and Westland EH101s is
expected to be ordered towards the end of the year.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Go-ahead expected for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today announce what is in effect approval for a fifth
conventionally transmitted television channel, after months of delay,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
A compromise plan designed to enable a new channel to be created while
protecting the prospects for digital terrestrial television will be sent to
the Independent Television Commission. The ITC will then decide whether to
advertise the licence for Channel 5.
A number of consortia are thought likely to bid. These include one combining
media organisations MAI, Time Warner and Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times.
The frequency offered by the government would allow the new channel to reach
63 per cent of the population - 53 per cent immediately and a further 10 per
cent subject to international agreement on frequency allocations.
It is believed the government plan rejects use of the frequency known as
channel 28 in London - something that would have cut costs - because
interference would be caused to other viewers. One problem posed by Channel
5 has been the cost of retuning video recorders.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Status quo is proposed for Northumberland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission yesterday recommended that there should be
no change in Northumberland's council structure.
This is the first time this year the commission has recommended that a
county's governing structure should remain intact, with no change to the
two-tier system of districts and a county council. It said the county's
sparse population was the main reason.
Mrs Ann Levick, commissioner responsible for the area, said 48 per cent of
people had supported unitary authorities - combining the functions of
districts and counties - in principle, but 'when you give them something
specific the principle fades slightly'.
The commission also proposed yesterday that Northamptonshire county council
should be abolished and split into three unitaries. These would be West
Northamptonshire (merging the Daventry and South Northants districts); East
Northamptonshire (merging Corby, East Northants, Kettering and
Wellingborough); and Northampton.
Start-up costs would be between Pounds 11m and Pounds 15m. These would be
met 'over four years or less' by estimated annual savings of between Pounds
4m and Pounds 7m.
An alternative of creating only two unitaries, merging Northampton with West
Northants, would be cheaper, with annual savings of between Pounds 8m and
Pounds 11m.
Another option discussed by the commission was that of leaving the two-tier
system intact, with the exception that Northampton should become a unitary
borough. This would cost less to set up, at between Pounds 3m and Pounds 7m,
but would generate few savings.
In Northumberland one alternative - to abolish the county council and create
two new unitaries - was proposed. One would cover the districts of Blyth
Valley and Wansbeck in the county's southern industrial area. The other
unitary authority would cover the rest, merging Alnwick, Berwick-upon-Tweed,
Castle Morpeth and Tynedale.
However, as the county and five of the districts support the status quo,
this split is unlikely to happen. It would cost between Pounds 13m and
Pounds 15m and generate annual savings of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m.

FT  14 JUL 94 / BBC may buy more shows from external producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is considering buying more television programmes from ITV, Channel 4
and independent producers, Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general said at a
London media conference yesterday.
The corporation, which already has programme deals with Granada and Central,
two of the largest ITV companies, is seeking flexibility in programme supply
in the wake of last week's white paper, which promised it more commercial
freedom.
Mr Phillis also told the conference, organised by the Labour party, that he
would not rule out wider co-operation with ITV companies in particular
regions or on launching new satellite channels.
The BBC has already announced a strategic alliance with Pearson, the media
group that owns the Financial Times, with the intention of launching two
satellite channels for Europe this year. These will feature news and
entertainment but the corporation is also looking at specialist channels in
areas such as education and documentaries.
Mr Phillis said some ITV companies had great expertise in areas the BBC was
interested in developing.
He also told the conference that the corporation had set up a further study
of digital terrestrial television which would be completed by March.
The government last week linked the possible privatisation of BBC
transmission services with the launch of new digital channels.
Mr Phillis said yesterday: 'Our concerns are to ensure the most reliable and
cost-effective service for our audiences and we will judge any possible
changes on that basis.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Japanese premier backs defence policy overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, yesterday
pledged his backing for the first overhaul of defence policy for 18 years.
The defence review, by an independent panel set up in February and due to
conclude its work next month, is expected to propose heavy cuts in the
number of ground forces but prepare for fast responses to regional crises
and increased spending on defence electronics.
Japan is one of the last leading industrialised countries to adjust its
defence guidelines to the end of the Cold War, a reflection of a taboo on
defence debate, linked to the pacifist constitution.
Panel officials are understood to lean towards reducing the number of ground
troops from the present 150,000 to between 100,000 and 130,000, which is
likely to win support from Mr Murayama's pacificist Social Democratic party.
But the SDP may find it harder to accept the panel's proposal, in a draft
report yesterday, that the military should establish an organisation to
oversee Japanese contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. Mr Murayama
hinted at his own reservations over UN peacekeeping by responding cooly to
the German constitutional court's decision, the previous day, to permit
German troops to take part in UN operations. 'Each country has its own
situation,' he said.
The draft plan also aims to prepare Japan to defend itself against several
regional threats, such as North Korea, and to support the US presence in
east Asia. It calls for co-operation with the US on anti-missile systems, a
response to Washington's calls for Tokyo's participation in its theatre
missile defence programme, designed with North Korea in mind.
The existing 1976 defence programme, on which equipment procurement is still
based, says Japan must prepare to defend itself, with US help, against a
single large security threat, the former Soviet Union. It is clearly out of
line with present threats.
The government wants to adopt the new guidelines before it prepares next
year's budget. It has already started to squeeze military spending, up a
mere 0.8 per cent this year, the smallest rise in 34 years.
Mr Murayama's moderate stance reflects the dominance of the conservative
Liberal Democratic party in his three-party coalition. Officially, his own
SDP believes Japan's military self-defence force is unconstitutional and
that the US-Japan defence treaty, which allows US forces in Japan, should be
revoked.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Hutu refugees pour into Zaire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of Hutu refugees, mainly emaciated women and children,
have begun crossing from Rwanda into eastern Zaire, to flee advancing
Tutsi-led rebels, agencies report.
Aid workers said yesterday they could not cope with the refugees trekking
into a game park north of the Zairean town of Goma. About 10,000 an hour had
streamed across the border and many more were coming. 'It's simply
overwhelming,' one aid worker said.
Zairean officials said they feared as many as 500,000 refugees would cross
the border in the next few days. 'We expect the worst and we are clearly not
ready for it,' a Zairean army major said.
The refugees are predominantly from Rwanda's majority Hutu tribe, whose
militia have killed an estimated 500,000 members of the Tutsi tribe in three
months of carnage.
The Tutsi-led rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) now control more
than two-thirds of the country and are advancing towards the Hutu-held areas
in the west.
Officials at the Goma office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
estimated 100,000 refugees had crossed the frontier but the UNHCR only had
resources for an influx of up to 50,000 refugees.
'It is a humanitarian catastrophe,' said Ms Johanna Grombach, Red Cross
chief in Goma. 'We cannot feed all these people. The medical needs are also
enormous.'
The RPF, set to form a broad-based government in the next few days, stepped
up its bombardment of Ruhengeri, a garrison town 60km from Gisenyi, where
the retreating Hutu government has based itself. One aid worker estimated as
many as 1m refugees - 'a wall of people' - were streaming along the road
from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi.

China is to despatch its chief Taiwan negotiator to Taipei later this month,
making him the most senior mainland official to set foot on the island since
the two parts of China split in 1949.
In an apparent easing in cross-strait ties, Taipei and Beijing have agreed
to resume talks over fishing disputes and repatriation of illegal immigrants
and airline hijackers.
Mr Chiao Jen-ho, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, yesterday welcomed the
planned July 27 visit to Taipei by his Beijing counterpart, Mr Tang Shubei,
who notified Taipei late on Tuesday of his intention to accept its
invitation.
The news came as China responded to a recent Taiwanese white paper, by
saying Beijing 'firmly opposed' any moves 'detrimental to China's
territorial sovereignty and the cause of peaceful reunification'.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Signs of change in Golan deadlock
</HEADLINE>

   KUNEITRA, SYRIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The back garden of the Burgh al-Kuneitra restaurant in Syria is a minefield
which marks the 1974 ceasefire line with Israel. The terrace offers a
panoramic view of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, with lush green
fields, neat rows of cherry trees and high-tech surveillance posts.
The front entrance opens into the ghost town of 'liberated' Kuneitra, once
home to more than 50,000 Syrians but now abandoned and in ruins.
While Jordan and the Palestinians are pushing towards peace with Israel, the
future of the Golan Heights bedevils talks between Israel and Syria.
Damascus demands a complete Israeli pullout from the plateau while Israel
talks about withdrawal.
No big breakthrough is expected during a visit to the region this weekend by
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. But most Syrians believe a
peace deal is inevitable. Signs are there that President Hafez al-Assad is
preparing for such an eventuality.
Nearly 80 per cent of the Golan Heights was captured by Israel in the
Six-Day War of 1967. Six years later, in the October War of 1973, Syria
tried to win it back but failed when Israeli forces pushed Syrian troops to
the edge of Damascus. A ceasefire line was negotiated by Dr Henry Kissinger,
then US secretary of state, whose shuttle diplomacy entailed 43 visits to
Damascus in less than eight months.
In June 1974, most of the newly-occupied land was returned, plus around 300
sq km of territory lost in the 1967 war, including 'liberated' Kuneitra and
its restaurant.
Since then, there has been deadlock. The Israelis have built 40 settlements
on the plateau which are home to about 15,000 settlers. They cultivated the
fertile soil and set up listening posts in the hills. In 1981 the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, formally approved annexation of the area.
Syria left most of the Golan left to it as it was at the end of the war.
Some 400,000 displaced Syrians got temporary housing in and around Damascus.
President Assad proceeded to shape nearly all his foreign and domestic
policies around the goal of achieving full return of the Golan Heights.
So far, real progress between Syria and Israel has been virtually
imperceptible. But serious and detailed negotiations have been going on,
primarily through the US administration, with President Bill Clinton's
meeting with Mr Assad in January and Mr Christopher's three stops in
Damascus this year. This week Syrian officials were saying they have nothing
new to offer from their last proposal which demands the following from
Israel:
It must scrap its annexation of the Golan Heights.
It must recognise Syria's sovereignty over the Golan.
It must commit itself to a full withdrawal, as required by UN Resolutions
242 and 338.
There must be equal security arrangements in the area.
Normalisation of relations must be linked to the speed of the Israeli
withdrawal.
While negotiations continue, President Assad has been quietly making changes
in expectation of a peace settlement. A new road is being built from
Damascus to the Golan. Scores of long-serving governors and party officials
have been or are soon to be replaced. A reshuffle has taken place in one of
the main pillars of Mr Assad's regime, the armed forces.
New appointees to the civil administration are seen as more liberal and open
to peace than their predecessors. But the new generals are hardliners. Much
to Britain's dismay the new air force chief Gen Mohammed al-Khouli, is
believed to have masterminded the 1986 Nizar Hindawi plot, when Syria
allegedly tried to blow up an Israeli aircraft at London's Heathrow Airport.
As usual, President Assad is ruling with a two-edged sword. After decades of
anti-Israeli propaganda he needs fresh bureaucrats who can work with a peace
settlement. But at the same time he needs hardline loyalists to maintain
discipline in the 450,000-strong armed forces which have the most to lose
from peace.
This approach will not be welcomed by Israel or the US, but such is the
nature of the president's hold on power.

FT  14 JUL 94 / HK pension plan is aimed at a maturing society: Colony's
government wants to provide for growing number of over-65s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The words 'welfare state' and 'Hong Kong' have always seemed to be at odds,
given the colony's free-wheeling capitalist image. But when on Tuesday the
government outlined plans for a comprehensive old-age pension scheme, some
in the colony began to wonder whether a society whose state provisions had
always stopped at the basics of housing, health and education was now about
to be taken a benefit too far.
The consultation paper issued for comment drew a strongly negative response
from business leaders and their representatives in the colony's Legislative
Council (LegCo), which may eventually be called on to turn the proposal into
law. China, which would have to approve any scheme through the Joint Liaison
Group before the government can proceed, gave conflicting signals.
Hong Kong's aged residents currently rely on a fragmentary system of old age
allowances and invalidity benefits.
The scheme would provide those over 65 years of age with a pension of
HKDollars 2,300 (Pounds 193) a month, index-linked to the rate of inflation.
In all, 3 per cent of Hong Kong's annual wage bill will be collected and
transferred to a specially established fund that will be isolated so that
all of it would be dedicated to pension payments and administration of the
scheme.
Employees would contribute 1.5 per cent of their pre-tax income and
employers would make a matching contribution. The pension would be
means-tested at first - to exclude those with assets, other than the family
home, in excess of HKDollars 2m - but after 10 years would become a
universal benefit. All employees would make contributions from the outset.
The government's defence of its initiative - which will be subject to a
three-month consultation exercise - is that Hong Kong is becoming a mature
economy and that there is growing community pressure for a state pension.
People over the age of 65 will double as a percentage of Hong Kong's
population to 18.5 per cent by 2056.
'There is a need to fund a growing number of poor, old people in Hong Kong,
especially with the decline of the extended family in recent years,' said
one official. 'It will not be up and running for 18 months to two years so
we will have to consult closely with China; they will have to administer
it.'
Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, yesterday delivered a
blistering attack on the plans. Having done nothing about pensions for 150
years, Britain had 'suddenly raised such a ridiculous and imaginary idea'
just three years away from the 1997 transfer of sovereignty, the paper
commented.
It was unclear, however, if this represented Beijing's authoritative
response to the plan. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, a leading pro-Beijing politician in
LegCo, said he supported the plan, which was made available to Beijing
officials last week.
Unions also lent their support to the plans. The pro-business Liberal party
said it opposed the scheme in principle, but hedged its position until it
had 'consulted' more widely. The immediate reaction from businessmen was to
warn that employers were likely to recoup the costs of contributions through
higher prices.
The pension would be paid only to those who are permanent residents of Hong
Kong; yet contributions will have to be paid by all who work in the colony,
including expatriates .
The provision of a state pension has always been opposed by the colony's
strongly pro-business elites which have seen it as symbolising creeping
'welfare-ism'. Although more than 50 per cent of Hong Kong's population
lives in public housing and enjoys subsidised health care and free
schooling, there is no provision for unemployment benefit, and other forms
of income support are primitive.
In the mid-1980s a proposal for a Singapore-style, compulsory savings
central provident fund (CPF) was killed off, with prominent businessmen
siding with the government. It resurfaced two years ago when China and
leading Hong Kong business figures united to push the idea. Beijing is very
keen on the CPF, to which it attributes much of Singapore's economic
success, and plans to experiment with one in Shanghai.
The Hong Kong government, however, rejected a CPF and a mandatory
privately-run retirement scheme because both would take too long to produce
returns to contributors. By contrast, the pension scheme now being proposed
would be operational from day one by virtue of a HKDollars 15bn contribution
from the government.
The proposed pension would be index-linked to inflation rather than
earnings. The government estimates that in 2056 earnings related indexation
would be HKDollars 145.5bn (in 1994 prices) more than inflation-related.
The government has rejected suggestions that the introduction of a pension
would be the beginning of a first-world type welfare state in Hong Kong. It
said that under its scheme, pension payments would amount to about 1.5 per
cent of gross domestic product, compared with an average of 15 per cent of
GDP for total welfare payments in west European countries.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Kim's challenge is to save his nation from collapse:
Pyongyang's economy is caught in a seemingly endless downward spiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principal challenge confronting Mr Kim Jong-il, the new leader of North
Korea, is whether he can reverse the country's economic decline and save it
from possible collapse.
The North Korean economy is caught in a downward spiral, with gross national
product having shrunk at an average annual rate of 5.2 per cent during the
past four years.
The immediate problems have been caused by the collapse of the Soviet bloc,
which ended a barter-trade system that supplied Pyongyang with cheap and
vital oil imports.
The resulting energy shortage has caused factories to work at half their
capacity or less.
The problems have been compounded by food shortages caused by four years of
poor harvests. Bad weather and the backward agricultural system in a mostly
mountainous country have been blamed for an estimated 40 per cent shortfall
in grain supplies needed to feed the 22m North Koreans.
The economy has also been undermined by more fundamental flaws, including a
highly centralised and inefficient planning system, a large heavy-industrial
sector working with outdated equipment, and a huge diversion of resources to
support one of the largest military forces in the world.
The country's governing juche (self-reliance) ideology and its attempt to
create a self-sufficient economy is another main cause of the decline. Trade
accounts for 13 per cent of North Korea's GNP of Dollars 20.5bn (Pounds
13bn), an exceedingly low ratio by international standards.
The adverse developments represent a potential political threat to the North
Korean government, since the poor economic condition may eventually provoke
a popular uprising.
In an unprecedented admission last December, the government acknowledged the
country's economic woes and signalled an important policy shift by
downgrading the role of heavy industry.
Instead, increased emphasis was placed on agriculture, the growth of light
industry to supply more consumer goods, and the development of export
industries that could provide North Korea with badly needed hard currency to
buy oil and food supplies from abroad.
Some analysts believe Mr Kim Jong-il was behind the changes. 'Although Kim
Jong-il has not made any public pronouncements on economic reforms, the
people who surround him are primarily technocrats who want a change in
economic policy,' one western diplomat said.
The key element in a future North Korean economic strategy is to attract
foreign investment which would support new plant facilities that could
produce goods for export.
North Korea is already taking part in a project sponsored by the UN
Development Program to develop a free-trade and investment zone around the
cities of Rajin and Sonbong in north-eastern North Korea. Other free
economic zones are being proposed for the port of Nampo near Pyongyang and
Sinuiju on the border with China.
The country over the past year has also revised its foreign investment laws,
basing them on Chinese practices, to attract foreign capital and technology.
But political considerations will probably limit the opening of North Korea
to foreign investment, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of the
proposed reforms in saving the economy.
Officials in Pyongyang worry that an extensive opening of the country will
undermine the government as the population becomes exposed to outside
influences.
Mr Kim Il-sung, the late president and father of Mr Kim Jong-il, summed up
the dilemma that foreign investment poses for North Korea: 'We must open the
window to let the wind in, but not the mosquitoes'.
In an attempt to retain control, the proposed free economic zones are mainly
located in sparsely populated regions.
This may prove to be a disincentive to foreign investors. Samsung, the South
Korean conglomerate, recently dropped plans to help finance a railway
connecting the Rajin-Sonbong region with China because it regarded the area
as being too isolated.
Foreigners are also concerned about how well their investments will be
protected; North Korea has shown little inclination to repay Dollars 1.6bn
to foreign banks on loans it borrowed in the 1970s.
But South Korea's main business groups at least are eager to set up
factories in North Korea, to take advantage of a cheap, disciplined and
Korean-speaking labour force.
Initial investments would focus on production of textiles and electronic
goods, but activity could eventually expand to the operation of
heavy-industry plants such as steel, and the construction of ports and other
infrastructure projects.
Seoul has so far blocked business ties with the North because of the
continuing dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. But if the issue is
resolved, South Korean investment is expected to receive the active backing
of the government.
Seoul wants to prevent a sudden economic collapse of the North, which could
trigger a costly and rapid reunification of the two Koreas. Instead, it
hopes to promote the gradual upgrading of the North's industrial structure,
which would reduce reconstruction costs in the future once the countries are
united.

FT  14 JUL 94 / EU in danger of losing out on Asian economic miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union risks losing out on the 'economic miracle' taking place
in Asia unless it strengthens political ties and boosts investment in the
region, according to a European Commission policy paper.
The document agreed in Brussels yesterday calls for a radical rethink of EU
strategy toward Asia, which it treats as a coherent economic region
encompassing Japan, China, and East Asia. By the end of the century, the
paper notes that 1bn Asians will have significant consumer spending power,
with 400m having average disposable incomes at least as high as Europeans or
Americans.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, drove home the
increasing importance of Asia during last weekend's Group of Seven summit in
Naples. By the year 2010, the G7's share of global output would fall from 75
per cent to 50 per cent, he predicted.
The German presidency of the EU encouraged the Commission to produce a paper
on Asia as a means of increasing awareness of the region's economic
importance and making the Union more outward-looking.
The paper lists several priorities for action:
A wider political dialogue to extend the coverage of the UN conventional
arms register and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. Deeper co-operation
on controls of sensitive technology, and 'strengthening the policy of
encouraging the improvement of human rights'.
Raising Europe's profile in Asia, through more education visits and training
programmes, cultural exchange and twinning cities: 'The EU needs to make a
far greater effort to explain its policies.' says.
Strengthening Europe's economic presence, by lobbying more forcefully for
the removal of laws restricting trade and investment, as well as the
discriminatory use of intellectual property rights, standards and testing.
The paper also calls for more joint ventures between European and Asian
companies; extending scientific co-operation, opening up 'European Business
Councils' in China, Indochina and Pakistan; and following up the EU's
'market transition programme' in Vietnam with other moves to offer policy
advice to former command economies now embarked on economic reform.
The EU is now the second biggest market for exports from developing Asian
countries after the US. It absorbed Ecu128bn (Pounds 101bn), or 27 per cent
of their total exports, in 1993.

FT  14 JUL 94 / 'Dear Leader' takes complete power in N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Seoul and Beijing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio broadcasts from Pyongyang indicated yesterday that Mr Kim Jong-il had
assumed complete political power in North Korea following the death of his
father, President Kim Il-sung, Our Seoul and Beijing Correspondents report.
Mr Kim, the country's 'Dear Leader', has been raised 'to the highest
position of the (ruling Korean Workers') party, the state and the
revolutionary armed forces,' the state-controlled Radio Pyongyang said. The
statement suggests Mr Kim now occupies the three key posts in the country,
including general secretary of the party and president, in addition to his
current role as supreme commander of the armed forces.
But the radio broadcast did not mention the official titles of these
positions, indicating Mr Kim would not formally be named to them until next
week after his father's funeral on Sunday.
In Beijing Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, on his return from a central
European tour hailed Mr Kim Jong-il as North Korea's 'new leader'. Mr Li led
other Chinese leaders to the North Korean embassy where they bowed to a
large portrait of the late leader and wrote condolence messages.
According to China's official Xinhua news agency, Mr Li then asked the
ambassador, Mr Chu Chang Jun, 'to convey his regards and respects to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's new leader, Kim Jong-il'. The
ambassador replied that under the leadership of Mr Kim Jong-il, the Korean
people would turn grief into strength.
Radio Pyongyang announced that North Korea would hold preparatory talks with
the US in New York next week on resuming their negotiations on the
international inspections of the North's nuclear facilities. The
discussions, begun in Geneva last Friday, were suspended after President
Kim's death.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil in final thanks to Romario
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's 24-year wait for a place in the World Cup final ended yesterday
when they beat Sweden 1-0 in the Pasadena Rose Bowl to set up a rematch of
the 1970 final in Mexico against Italy, when a Pele-inspired Brazil won 4-1.
Barcelona striker Romario headed home the only goal ten minutes from the end
after Brazil had dominated much of the match, only to be frustrated by some
inspired goalkeeping by Thomas Ravelli, but more by their own inability to
finish countless chances.
Romario should have put Brazil ahead in the 26th minute after Branco's
through ball split the Swedish defence, but the attacker waited too long to
shoot and Patrik Andersson scrambled the ball off the goalline. Mazinho then
smashed the rebound into the side netting.
Bebeto sent Romario clear with a brilliant flick 7 minutes later but he
stumbled over the ball, allowed Ravelli to head him off and shot into the
side of the net.
Sweden created very few chances in the first half, seemingly content to rely
on long, high balls, which were largely ineffective.
The Swedes, trying to get to the final for the first time since Brazil beat
them in 1958, had their captain Jonas Thern sent off in the 63rd minute for
a bad challenge on Dunga.
The ten men defended well and looked for a break from set-pieces, but the
Brazilian forwards wore them down and Romario's fifth goal of the tournament
deflated the Scandinavians. In Sunday's final, both Italy and Brazil will be
going for a record fourth World Cup title. Of the two, Italy was last to win
it in 1982.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Baggio books Italy's date with destiny - The
Azzurri dash the dreams of Bulgaria to reach the final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So history means something even in soccer. Italy, the three-time winners,
yesterday beat Bulgaria, a side which before this tournament had never won a
game in the World Cup finals.
The score was 2-1, which was about right. For once, Italy scored early and
twice, with Roberto Baggio now well into his role as the second coming of
Paulo Rossi.
Bulgaria, conquerors of two past champions in Argentina and Germany, kept
the gap to one with a penalty just before half-time. But in spite of holding
the balance of play through the second half the Bulgarians never looked
likely to break through a massed Italian defence.
It looked as though Bulgaria's original game plan was to play it long, keep
it tight early, then attack the tiring Italians. But Roberto Baggio and
Albertini made nonsense of this strategy in a purple patch beginning in the
21st minute.
A throw-in from the left found Baggio running free. He cut across one
defender, comprehensively beat a second, paused momentarily to assess what
was left in front of him and placed the most careful of right footers beyond
the diving Mikhailov's left hand.
Now it was Albertini's turn. In less than two minutes the AC Milan defender
rattled the Bulgarian post from the edge of the area, forced Mikhailov to
back-pedal furiously to tip over a chip, and then, in the 26th minute, he
set Baggio loose once more inside the area on the right.
Again Baggio seemed to pause for a fraction of a second just to check his
whereabouts before placing the most precise shot across Mikhailov and just
inside his right-hand post.
The Bulgarians were seriously unnerved now as Casiraghi and Donadoni both
went close. Letchkov and Stoichkov, stars of the triumph over Germany, were
to be found back in defence rather than picking the Italians apart.
But to give them credit the Bulgarians did not break and began to respond.
After 35 minutes Stoichkov was on target with a free kick from his favourite
place, well out on the right, but it was too close to the goalkeeper.
Balakov was then just wide from 20 yards. But, for Italy, Maldini went even
closer with an unchallenged header from a corner.
It was Sirakov who took matters into his own hands with a fine direct run
into the area. If Costacurta tripped him, Pagliuca helped him on his way
down and the award of a penalty brought no Italian complaints. Stoichkov
disposed of it, giving him six goals for the tournament, tied for first with
Salenko of Russia.
Stoichkov, who was substituted with 10 minutes to go, also left another mark
on the final. A second-half foul on him by Costacurta was adjudged bad
enough for a yellow card, meaning no play in Pasadena for one of the central
elements of the Italian defence.
Baggio left the game 19 minutes before the end after an awkward turn left
him with a slight thigh injury, but by then he had more than left his
impression on a game played on a steamy, sticky day with temperatures in the
mid-90s and humidity to match.
Neither the stadium nor New York City itself was exactly a sea of Bulgariana
yesterday. A group of intrepid nuns with press passes did manage to locate a
Bulgarian journalist and introduced him round the sweaty media tent.
Otherwise this was a day for one of New York's oldest and biggest
minorities.
They were knocking back the grappa in Little Italy well before noon, did not
seem to mind the switch to cold beer in the stadium, and as the final
whistle sparked noisy celebrations in the stands they were ready to
celebrate all night long.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Mr Atlantic helps fans get into the groove -
Ahmet Ertegun says Major League Soccer will succeed in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On the shelves behind Ahmet Ertegun's desk sit dozens of framed photographs
of the sort you might expect to see in the Manhattan office of Atlantic
Records' co-founder and chairman. There is a picture of Ertegun with Quincy
Jones, the legendary record producer, and one of Ertegun arm-in-arm with
Mick Jagger.
Yet on the top shelf is a prominently displayed picture that has no
connection with the worlds of rhythm and blues, jazz and soul in which
Ertegun has spent most of his working life.
It is a photograph of Ertegun holding a cumbersome gold statuette instantly
recognisable as the centrepiece of international sport's crown jewels - the
World Cup trophy. In the picture, Ertegun is sporting the awed, slightly
sheepish grin that any soccer fan might wear in the circumstances. But
Ertegun is no ordinary soccer fan. He is a member of the World Cup 1994
organising committee.
Ertegun, who is 70, earned his place on the committee for his efforts over
the past 25 years in helping the roots of soccer grow in a seemingly
infertile land. During the early 1970s, he and his late brother Nesuhi
persuaded Warner Communications to provide the financial backing for a New
York team - the Cosmos - to play in the North American Soccer League.
For a few glorious years, the Erteguns, with the help of Pele, Franz
Beckenbauer and other soccer greats, put the Cosmos and the NASL on to the
American sports map, where it stayed until excessive spending and
insufficient revenues plunged the league into bankruptcy and failure a
decade ago.
In spite of the unhappy ending, Ertegun remembers the days of the Cosmos
fondly. He recounts a story about Beckenbauer's astonishment at finding
himself dribbling the ball towards goal in his Cosmos debut while an
announcer carefully explained the rules of the game to the crowd over the
loudspeaker.
But Ertegun is too busy enjoying this World Cup to dwell on the past. As
someone who was always confident that the tournament would be a success, he
is especially delighted with the large numbers of Americans who have
attended the games. He says the television pictures which have shown
stadiums filled with colourful, partisan fans following their national teams
have not told the full story.
'It always looks as if there are more foreigners than Americans, but there
aren't. The foreigners are very visible, and very audible. You know: 'Ooh,
aah, Paul McGrath. Ooh, aah, Paul McGrath.' Right? You hear that.'
Yet, he says, referring to a popular US player, 'there's no 'Ooh, aah, Alexi
Lalas. Ooh, aah, Alexi Lalas'.' Ertegun's point is that traditional soccer
countries may not know it, but Americans have embraced the World Cup
wholeheartedly - but not noisily.
'Soccer in America is a family sport,' he says. 'In Europe men go to see
soccer, and they sometimes take their sons, if they're old enough. Here the
whole family goes. They have picnics in the parking lot. The Americans view
it as a nice day out.'
But can a top-level US professional soccer league be founded on the
enthusiasm of fans who view the game as a nice day out? Fifa awarded the
World Cup to the US in the hope that the interest generated would provide
the basis for a fully-fledged soccer league, one that would last longer than
the ill-fated NASL.
Ertegun is realistic about whether the World Cup legacy will sustain Major
League Soccer, the new league planned for next year. But, he says, 'I'm not
sure that a game between Tulsa and Buffalo will attract many viewers. We've
got to build again from the ground up.'
He believes the best American players should be allowed to play abroad,
because it is only in the big European leagues that they can earn the kind
of money which will start enticing young athletes away from mainstream
American sports and into soccer.
'If some of our players playing abroad start to make a million bucks a year,
we may see a lot of kids from the inner city hone their talents.
'Maybe we'll have some of those young men who can run 100m in under 10
seconds learn how to do the same with a ball between their feet. When that
happens, we could have the world's greatest team.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Goals bring joy to weary people
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In Brazil as elsewhere, the weary people need a glimpse of happiness. Goals
give them that. Recent research has shown that factory workers are much more
productive the day after a Brazilian victory. Should Brazil win the World
Cup, the country will close for at least one day of celebration. If it
loses, experts say, there will be an increase in suicides.
Brazilian players do not consider this a burden. They are protected by their
cockiness - so long as they do not lose. After Brazil's 3-2 quarter-final
win against Holland, Romario told reporters: 'You witnessed art today,'
while Brazil manager Carlos Alberto Parreira said: 'The last 34 minutes
provided some of the most exciting, dramatic moments of the World Cup.'

Prio to yesterday's semi-finals, Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov needed two
more goals to hit the seven-goal barrier at the World Cup, a mark that has
not been reached in 20 years.
He was the only player left in the tournament with five goals. In contention
with four apiece were Sweden's Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin, and
Brazil's Romario. Russia's Oleg Salenko is the leading scorer with six
goals, a record five coming against Cameroon.
Grzegorz Lato of Poland scored seven goals during the 1974 World Cup. Just
Fontaine of France holds the record: 13 goals in the 1958 tournament.

Italy's Giuseppe Signori was simmering yesterday after being dropped from
the starting line-up for the semi-final against Bulgaria.
'I can't tell you how I feel,' he said. 'I must think it over . . . I'm not
happy.'
Signori was dropped to make room for mid-fielder Roberto Donadoni. The
leading scorer for the last two seasons in the Italian league, Signori was
sent on as a second-half substitute in the quarter-final against Spain and
set up the winning goal by Roberto Baggio with two minutes left.
'It was a painful but unavoidable choice,' coach Arrigo Sacchi said. 'I
picked the players who could do better at mid-field.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Tassotti's eight-game ban 'excessive', says
Spaniard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Luis Enrique, the Spanish forward whose nose was smashed by Italy's Mauro
Tassotti during the World Cup quarter-final last weekend, yesterday
criticised the eight-match ban Tassotti subsequently received.
Enrique called the punishment 'excessive' and said he would have been
satisfied with an apology from Tassotti.
Fifa, soccer's governing body, imposed only a four-game suspension on
Brazilian defender Leonardo for elbowing American Tab Ramos in the face
during a second-round match, even though Ramos suffered a fractured skull.
Tassotti's suspension, one of the heaviest in World Cup history, was also
criticised by Italian newspapers. The Corriere della Sera called it 'a mad
decision by the Fifa mafia' while La Voce chipped in: 'This ugly mess over
Tassotti has shaken the national team, in a World Cup ruined by the mad
omnipotence of (Fifa general-secretary Sepp) Blatter.'
Fifa used video evidence for the first time to decide Tassotti's punishment.
Earlier, Blatter had refused to study such evidence to examine the
sending-off of Italian striker Gianfranco Zola.
Spanish newspapers viewed the ban on Tassotti as compensation for Spain's
elimination from the finals.
The Italian soccer federation has said it will appeal against the ban, which
could end the 34-year-old Tassotti's international career.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Derivatives bill put to House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bill to give the US Securities and Exchange Commission greater powers to
regulate the derivatives industry was introduced yesterday by Mr Edward
Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives sub-committee on
telecommunications and finance.
The bill, which would extend SEC oversight to many dealers not now
regulated, follows a call from the General Accounting Office of Congress two
months ago for greater control of the derivatives markets. The rapid growth
of these financial instruments, and the concentration of trading in the
hands of a few companies, has increased the risk of a meltdown in financial
markets, the GAO warned.
The Markey bill runs counter to the more consensual approach to regulation
of derivatives preferred by Mr Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman. He recently
started talks with various securities companies on voluntary regulation of
their derivatives activities.
Wall Street's traditional broking and dealing activities come under the SEC,
but most securities firms have set up separate subsidiaries to trade in the
specialised derivatives markets, putting them outside the SEC's regulatory
net.
The bill introduced yesterday would require all unregulated dealers, such as
those owned by securities firms and insurance companies, to register with
the SEC, and give the regulators power to set capital standards for dealers.
It would also set rules for the sales practices of derivatives firms,
including a requirement for them to assess the suitability of instruments
for particular customers.
The Markey bill follows legislation proposed by the House banking committee,
which would cover the derivatives activities of commercial banks.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil's 'twins' stress team-work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahead of yesterday's World Cup semi-final against Sweden in Los Angeles,
Brazilian strikers Romario and Bebeto admitted they were unimpressed with
Brazil's showing to date.
'Technically, we haven't shown soccer of great quality,' said Romario.
'We're making up for it with strength and team-work. Individually, we have
the obligation to play better.'
US defender Alexi Lalas, out-gunned by Bebeto in Brazil's 1-0 second-round
victory, said the South American team were 'dribbling maniacs' who hurtled
at opponents at 100mph.
Yet Brazil's brightest stars are under-whelmed with their team's showing.
'We're not playing that 'show soccer' people expected,' Romario said. 'We're
playing a modern and efficient soccer.'
Bebeto added: 'What matters is the end result. It's useless to play pretty
and lose. Maybe it's not great soccer, but it's practical.'
Brazil knew bitter disappointment in the last five World Cups. They were
always among the favourites but somehow failed to win, often through
over-confidence or theatrics - known in Brazil as 'playing in high heels.'
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has been criticised for implanting a scrappy
style and causing the demise of Brazil's art-house soccer.
But Romario defends him: 'We haven't yet been able to admire Parreira's
work. But we should be grateful for what he's done. Someone like me wouldn't
put up with the things he's had to take.'
Arguably, Parreira's greatest feat has been to maintain harmony among a cast
of prickly characters. And some observers say he has added desire, spirit
and awareness to the Brazilian line-up.
'For many years, people said Brazil's yellow jersey was very pretty but had
no heart inside,' said Romario. 'After this World Cup, I think they'll say
it's a pretty jersey with 11 hearts inside.'

FT  14 JUL 94 / Ground shakes under homeowners: An insurance policy crisis
is forcing US authorities to act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A swelling insurance crisis in California, following the Northridge
earthquake earlier this year, is forcing US authorities to reconsider how
they should deal with natural calamities.
Tomorrow Mr John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, will host a
meeting to try to find a way around the decision by big US insurance
companies to stop selling new policies to Californian homeowners.
Over the past two months, Farmers, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries,
and Allstate, another big US insurer, have stopped selling new homeowners
insurance in the state, though they are renewing existing policies. State
Farm stopped adding to its Californian risks a year ago, after its losses of
Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) on Hurricane Andrew made the company rethink
its exposure to natural disasters. It was also the biggest loser in
Northridge, with a liability of Dollars 1.3bn.
The insurance crisis has taken six months to develop. At first, insured
losses from the ground-shaker in southern California were put at no more
than Dollars 2.5bn, although that would still have made it the US's third
most expensive insurable event, after hurricanes Andrew, which cost Dollars
15.5bn and Hugo (Dollars 4.2bn). Estimates have since soared: to at least
Dollars 5.5bn, according to an industry group, and possibly to Dollars 7bn
or more, according to unofficial estimates.
One insurance company, 20th Century, nearly folded under the losses and was
ordered by state regulators to cut its exposure to future losses as part of
a recapitalisation plan in April. That put pressure on others to take up the
slack, leading to a domino effect in which, one by one, all big insurers
have stopped writing new policies. Allstate was the last to move, a
fortnight ago. 'We could not afford to be the only game in town,' said Mr
Jerry Choate, president of the company's property and casualty business.
Mr Garamendi has taken steps to ensure Californians are not left uninsured.
He extended the 'Fair' plan - adopted to cover the uninsurable risks of
wildfires which tore through southern California last autumn - to cover
earthquake exposure as well. This scheme offers cover to anyone who cannot
get it elsewhere.
He has also called on state governor Pete Wilson to stop insurers
withdrawing from California, something Florida was forced to do last year
after Hurricane Andrew saw insurers halt sales of new cover to property
owners in the state. Florida has since put a limit of 5 per cent a year on
the proportion of policy holders that an insurer can shed each year.
In front of Mr Garamendi tomorrow will be the insurance industry's own plan.
This would involve putting earthquake risks into a separate 'pool', to be
financed jointly by the insurers. Under one version, only new earthquake
risks would go into this pot, leaving individual insurers with their
existing exposure; an alternative would lead to all earthquake risk being
pooled.
Californian homeowners (only one in four of whom choose to buy earthquake
cover, which must under state law be offered to all policyholders) pay
around Dollars 350m a year in earthquake premiums. That could rise to
Dollars 650m as a result of Northridge, says Mr Robert Pike, general counsel
of Allstate: he bases the figure on the rise in premiums Mr Garamendi has
instituted in the Fair plan to cover earthquake risk.
The problem for the commissioner is that the industry's proposal could leave
state taxpayers picking up the tab from a big disaster. If another
earthquake struck before the insurance pool had built up its reserves, the
pool would borrow against future premiums. That could raise up to five times
its reserves at the time, estimates Mr Pike at Allstate. Losses above that
would be met by a Dollars 1bn levy on insurance companies.
That might be enough for a Northridge-style earthquake. But what about the
proverbial 'Big One' that every Californian fears? The same problem exists
for Florida's catastrophe fund, which has the power to borrow only Dollars
2bn.
Two years ago, Mr Garamendi was forced to cancel a state earthquake
compensation fund which would have paid up to Dollars 15,000 to each
homeowner when it became clear that the state taxpayer could be left footing
the bill from a large disaster. The Californian administration only last
week completed another traumatic annual budget round, in the process
borrowing Dollars 4bn from international banks, and does not want an
open-ended earthquake liability.
Until Andrew, insurers had not contemplated a multi-billion dollar disaster.
Now they talk of the Dollars 50bn incident which could wipe out a large part
of the capital of the US property and casualty insurance industry.
The final answer, say insurers and state authorities, rests with lawmakers
in Washington. The Natural Disaster Protection Act, or earlier versions of
it, has sat before Congress for some time. Like the proposed California
scheme, it would cap the insurance industry's exposure. But there is little
sign federal taxpayers will be any keener than state ones to pick up the
rest of the tab.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Brussels plan for export credit rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union members would be required to move towards common guidelines
for medium- and long-term credit guarantees for exporters under a directive
proposed by the European Commission yesterday.
The draft legislation is intended to limit unfair competition between the 12
governments in export financing and to control their mounting losses on bad
debts, which have totalled Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in the past three years.
Though drawn up in negotiations with EU government officials and export
credit agencies, some of the proposals are likely to arouse concern in
Britain and the Netherlands. The Commission hopes, nonetheless, that the
directive will be approved this year by the Council of Ministers, on a
majority vote, and will lead to a wider agreement between the 25 members of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
EU export credit agencies guarantee medium and long-term contracts worth
about Ecu30bn annually, roughly two thirds of total guarantees by OECD
members. Many national treasuries are unhappy about the costs and risks
involved.
The directive falls short of calling for full harmonisation of export credit
rules, but seeks more common ground in three areas:
By setting guidelines for guarantee conditions, notably in respect of the
types of risks and the proportion of loss covered. Coverage would be limited
to 90 per cent of the value of an exporter's order and 95 per cent of a
project's cost.
In the UK, the only EU member where cover up to 100 per cent is available,
exporters have protested that a reduction in the percentage would raise
their costs and handicap them against bidders from the US, Japan and Canada,
which all provide 100 per cent guarantees. The directive seeks to meet these
objections by allowing 100 per cent cover when there is only one EU bidder
for an international contract, or when several EU export credit agencies
agree to match support available to non-EU bidders.
By laying down rules for calculating export credit premiums. These would
have to be no more than 35 per cent above or 10 per cent below an agreed
norm.
By dividing country cover into six categories, according to the countries'
creditworthiness, economic and political stability and weight in insurers'
overall portfolios.
The directive would also require greater transparency by obliging export
credit agencies regularly to exchange information and explain cases of
unusually large exposure to individual countries.
This proposal is intended to underpin a future common EU foreign policy and
is not expected to be widely applied until further progress is made towards
that goal.
Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department said yesterday it would closely
examine the wording governing exceptions to the ban on 100 per cent cover.
But it welcomed the commission's statement that premiums should reflect
risks, and that rates should cover the cost of claims.
Dutch concern is understood to focus on the proposals for the wording of
policies. Unlike most other European agencies, Dutch policies cover all
risks except for those specifically excluded.
Commission officials said they expected growing budgetary pressures to rally
governments behind yesterday's proposals. These are separate from proposals
on short-term export credit rules, to be made by the Commission's
competition directorate in September.
Efforts have been made to harmonise export credit rules since the European
Community was formed in 1957. Yesterday's proposals are intended to replace
a 1970 directive which was widely ignored.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Itamar Franco of Brazil (pictured above) looks set to order a pay
rise for military and government employees early next week, raising serious
concern about the government's ability to control spending before the
presidential election due in October, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
Mr Franco has asked finance ministry officials to assess the government's
scope to raise salaries. A decision is likely on Monday or Tuesday. 'The
president wants an increase; it is the size which is being discussed,' said
his spokesman, Mr Fernando Costa. The president has come under pressure from
the military, who complain their salaries have not kept pace with inflation
for many years. Mr Romildo Canhim, a minister with close military links and
who has been reviewing pay levels, has suggested an average 28 per cent rise
for most government employees. That would lift government spending by the
equivalent of about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) this year.
Analysts said the request was optimistic but that any increase at this stage
would damage the government's credibility. The current anti-inflation
economic plan needs a balanced budget to help convince markets that the
government will not start printing money to pay its bills.
The president has already proposed an 8 per cent increase in the minimum
wage, to take effect this year, and a package of emergency spending in
Brazil's north-east, together likely to cost more than Dollars 800m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US inflationary pressures remain moderate, despite robust economic growth,
official figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent last month, and by 2.5 per cent
in the year to June, in line with Wall Street projections.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components, rose by 0.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said inflation in the US
service sector, at 3.2 per cent in the year to June, had fallen to its
lowest in a decade. Inflation in the goods sector has edged up in recent
months, but is still at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent.
Following reports on Tuesday of zero producer price inflation last month,
the figures were not seen as putting immediate pressure on the Federal
Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
Most analysts, however, expect the Fed to signal further interest rate
increases in coming months, as part of a longer-term strategy to prevent
rapid economic growth eventually putting strong upward pressure on
inflation.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Cola wars bubble up in Japanese market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cola wars have spread to Japan. Coca-Cola Japan, the subsidiary of the US
soft drinks company, is feeling the squeeze on the shelves as lower priced
retail brands gain popularity among Japanese consumers.
Facing greater competition from cheaper colas sold by leading supermarkets,
the company has imported 300,000 cases of Coca-Cola from the US to sell at
reduced prices in supermarkets and fast food outlets in the greater Tokyo
area.
The move comes as large Japanese supermarkets and discount retailers are
offering consumers cheap non-branded or imported colas. Although the bulk of
Coca-Cola is sold through vending machines in Japan, the company's sales
through retailers are steadily being eroded.
Ito-Yokado, a leading supermarket chain, has tied up with Cott, the Canadian
beverage company, and two other US bottlers to produce soft drinks. The
retailer sells a 354ml can at Y78 (51p), 29 per cent cheaper than the usual
can of cola, while Daiei, the nation's largest supermarket operator, has
started to sell its own brand cola made in the US at Y39.
The Coca-Cola bottlers, the distributing wholesaling companies to which
Coca-Cola Japan supplies beverages, have started distributing the cheap
imports to be sold at a retail price of around Y70 per can, 36 per cent
lower than Coca-Cola's usual retail price, for a limited period this summer.
Private labels are already a familiar phenomenon in Europe and North
America, where consumers have increasingly become more concerned about
getting good quality at a low price than about the name on the product.
In the soft drinks sector, tough competition from Cott in the US recently
prompted Pepsi-Cola to warn of flat profits in its second quarter, causing
its share price to plummet.
Cott's annual sales have climbed from CDollars 43m to CDollars 665m (Pounds
310m) in the past five years. Over the same period, its share of the
Canadian take-home soft drinks market has grown to 28 per cent. Now it is
spreading into the US, Australia, South Africa and - after signing a
distribution agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK - into Europe. In
the UK, a private label cola supplied by Cott to Sainsbury, the biggest
British food retailer, has taken more than half Coca-Cola's sales through
Sainsbury's stores.
Now, for the first time national brand names are facing competition from
cheaper retail brands in Japan. Frugality has been a trend among ordinary
Japanese, whose pockets have been hit by the prolonged domestic recession.
Also, the higher yen and expansion of retailers have lowered the price of
imported private brands.
Retailers' private brand products now range from food to mens' suits to
electronic appliances. And although retailer brand sales still only account
for about 10 per cent of the retail market, in some cases they have won over
national brands. For instance, orange juice prices have declined sharply
recently due to Daiei's private brand orange juice imported from Brazil,
initially offered at half the price of other national brands.
Coca-Cola Japan was dismissive of the impact cheaper private brands were
having on its market share, since sales through retailers amounted to 1 per
cent of overall sales. However, an official at a bottler noted the trend
towards cheaper prices in Japan and said the company was testing the quality
of the imports before possibly distributing Coca-Cola made in the US on a
regular basis.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US business lobbies over anti-dumping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A coalition of 50 business organisations is lobbying Congress to modify what
they term 24 'highly protectionist violations' of the Uruguay Round
agreement contained in the Clinton Administration proposals to rewrite the
anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. With US companies a target of
such regimes in other countries, the concern is that any violation of the
spirit of the pact will be copied by foreign governments.
Clinton Administration officials insist that they have been faithful to the
spirit as well as the language of the Round when they translated the
agreement into implementing legislation. They are defending their view in
both House and Senate committees where the legislation is being scrutinised.
The coalition - which embraces the Pro Trade Group, the Computer and
Communications Industry Association and other exporters - accuses the
administration of 'chipping away at gains made in the Uruguay Round by
slanting nearly every change to the statute in a manner that is beneficial
to those who initiate dumping complaints.'
Privately trade lawyers worry about some proposals which they say continue
excessive and time-consuming procedural requirements. They say the changes
increase the likelihood of guilty findings and artificially inflate the
level of duties to be imposed.
Although the new anti-dumping and countervailing duty codes require reforms,
individual governments still have flexibility in their regulations. New
provisions, for example, agreed at the Gatt would ease the burden on
companies under investigation which often find it a burden to comply with
requests for information and find themselves penalised with duties.
Both importers and exporters are urging the Administration to closely
monitor the compliance of foreign ant-dumping proceedings with the new Gatt
rule. They want the US trade representative to prepare an annual report on
all anti-dumping actions taken against US exports.

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Gatt caught in Congress crossfire - A look
at the threat to US ratification of Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to tell friend from foe as months of back-biting have eroded the
bipartisan majority in Congress which has long supported liberalised trade.
When an agreement was struck among the members of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade last December, there seemed to be few hindrances to its
approval in the US this year, beyond a busy congressional schedule.
There was then no hint of the highly charged partisanship and the soaring
level of distrust that now surrounds the question.
The test comes today as legislation approving the Uruguay Round deal gets
its first inspection today in the key House Ways and Means committee.
The perception that President Bill Clinton stumbled at the Group of Seven
meeting in Naples, where his plan for further trade negotiations was
rejected, has fuelled Republican hopes of gains in the House of
Representatives in the elections in November.
The administration has been scrambling for months to find the Dollars 13bn
or Dollars 14bn needed for passage. Although most economists say the deal
will stimulate business and ultimately increase tax revenues, arcane and
controversial budget rules require that either new fees be imposed or
programmes cut to compensate for the expected loss in tariff revenue over
the next five years.
Congress can waive the budget rules and in ordinary times would. Current
posturing has Republicans such as Minority whip Newt Gingrich calling for a
waiver and insisting that no new taxes would be acceptable.
Democrats, uneasy about presidential vulnerability and fearing that support
of a waiver would make them subject to charges of big spending, have come up
with a number of funding proposals, all of which have been demolished by
lobbyists representing the various interest groups.
Senator Pat Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance committee, fumed on the
Senate floor earlier this week, accusing fellow Democrats at the White House
of 'leaks, distortions and innuendos'. The focus of his ire was a line which
appeared in the Wall Street Journal saying that White House aides were
worried that Congress would not have time 'to get to the world trade pact
this year'.
It was the administration which had failed to submit a funding proposal, the
senator said. It was the administration which encumbered the implementing
legislation with a controversial request for new 'fast track' authority to
negotiate more free trade deals which Congress cannot amend. He threatened
to delay the proceedings unless the White House this week formally delivered
a funding proposal.
A funding proposal is in fact now nearly complete, although as one Senate
staffer predicted: 'The cuts won't be real because the losses aren't real.'
One of its more ludicrous features is the raising of between Dollars 1bn and
Dollars 3bn by more quickly voiding uncashed welfare and food stamp
payments.
The odds are still in favour of passage of the implementing legislation this
year, but obstacles remain. Hoping to proceed with trade negotiations with
Chile and other Latin American countries, the administration has included in
the implementing legis-lation a request for new 'fast track' negotiating
authority.
Republicans and business groups are in open rebellion because the
administration has vowed to include negotiation of labour and environmental
standards in all future trade pacts. Many Democrats say they will oppose a
fast-track provision if mention of labour and environment is dropped from
the fast-track language. The administration may have to drop the fast-track
request, although it will be much more difficult to get later on.
Worries about potential loss of US sovereignty by the new World Trade
Organisation are being skilfully exploited on the left by Ralph Nader's
Public Citizen and on the right by two former right-wing presidential
candidates, Mr Pat Buchanan, the television commentator, and Mr Pat
Robertson, a television preacher. Their latest contribution to congressional
chaos is an amendment - not expected to pass - requiring a 90-day delay in
the proceedings so a panel of experts can study the sovereignty concerns.
The administration had nursed the hope that the Gatt legislation could be
got out of the way next month to make way for the really difficult task -
healthcare. First, it will need the effective intervention of President
Clinton, who sinking in the polls, badly needs a new victory.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Redesign for dollar to beat counterfeiters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury yesterday unveiled plans to change both the look and
security features of the dollar, to try to stem the rising tide of fake
bills.
This is the first significant change to US paper money since 1929, when note
sizes were reduced by 25 per cent.
But, while the dollar may be out of favour on the foreign exchange markets,
it remains the currency of choice among international counterfeiters.
No-one knows the full extent of their work but Mr Guy Caputo, deputy
director of the US Secret Service, the Treasury's anti-counterfeiting
bureau, yesterday estimated that, for fiscal 1994, fake bills with a face
value of some Dollars 130m (Pounds 82.8m) would be seized overseas and about
Dollars 70m in the US.
More than Dollars 350bn of US notes is in circulation, more than half
outside the US. However, the US is becoming increasingly concerned at what
could be destabilising effects of counterfeiting overseas, particularly from
plants in the Middle East, officials said.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, rejected suggestions that the US
should recall its existing currency and issue a new one. The advantages of
that, such as flushing out criminals' cash hordes and disrupting the
laundering of drug money, would be more than offset by the potential loss of
confidence in the dollar, said Mr Frank Newman, Treasury under-secretary for
domestic finance.
The US has never demonetised or recalled its currency, official after
official told the House banking committee yesterday as the plans were
unveiled, nor will it now.
Older bills will continue to be valid but Secret Service operations against
faking the older-style notes would be stepped up and destruction of old
notes, as they wore out, would continue until the vast majority of bills in
ciculation was of the new design, Mr Newman said.
The Treasury does not intend to change the size, colour or portraits on the
notes, but the central portrait that dominates one side of each bill will be
enlarged and moved off-centre, and a battery of new security devices will be
introduced, to try to combat ever more sophisticated counterfeiting
technology.
The Treasury plans to introduce a watermark and an enhanced security thread
in a different position for each denomination. Such threads were first
introduced in 1990 for Dollars 50 and Dollars 100 notes. The plans also
include increased use of microprinting, in the design and in reflective
material embedded in the paper.
The new bills would also feature 'interactive or moire'' patterns that
distort when copied photographically. Covert, machine-readable features
would also be introduced.
The changes would increase the cost of producing an individual note by an
estimated 1 per cent and the first new Dollars 100 notes would be in
circulation by 1996, officials said, with other demoninations to follow.
Despite the fanfare with which the Treasury unveiled its proposals,
officials admitted that they are now on a treadmill of introducing new
design features in efforts to thwart forgers.
'In the future, more frequent changes will be required, to meet the threat
of advances in technology, and each change will necessitate further public
education,' said Ms Mary Ellen Withrow, US Treasurer.
'Our plan is a pre-emptive step to protect US currency from high-tech
counterfeiting,' Mr Bentsen said.
Although forged bills made up only a tiny fraction of those in circulation,
'we would risk eventual diminishment of confidence in the integrity of our
currency if we did not change it to meet the challenges of a new generation
of technology,' he said.

FT  14 JUL 94 / US oil loses its clout: A troubled industry finds political
support hard to come by
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the maxims of political life in the US is that Big Oil can grease any
jammed government wheel in Washington.
If so, some US oil executives and entrepreneurs must be wondering whether
they have lost their touch.
Last March, more than 100 federal lawmakers requested a meeting with
President Bill Clinton. They were concerned that low oil prices were
accelerating the decline of the industry, which has seen daily average
production fall from 10.245m barrels in 1983 to 8.565m last year.
The lawmakers also feared that the accelerating pace of lay-offs in the
industry - 22,000 jobs have been shed since November 1993 - would depress
regional economies. Some also feared that US dependence on foreign oil,
which now accounts for more than 50 per cent of daily consumption for the
first time, jeopardised national security.
That meeting was not held until June 16, when Mr Clinton and other
administration officials sat down behind closed doors with more than 80
members of Congress to review ways of bolstering the domestic oil industry.
Mr Clinton listened to dozens of proposals, ranging from tax incentives to
regulatory reform, but offered no firm commitments, according to those at
the meeting.
That cautious approach has characterised the administration's dealings with
the sector, a fragmented mix of companies that includes the largest US
corporations as well as some of the smallest. Some analysts say the often
conflicting needs and expectations within such a diverse industry has
hampered its ability to get a strong message across to the administration.
They cite the gulf between the concerns of an Exxon, and those of the
freewheeling entrepreneurs or the small 'Ma and Pa' oil companies that
operate across the 'oil patch' states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
California, Colorado.
'Independent (producers) get all their investment from well revenue,' says
Ms Denise Bode, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of
America, a lobbying group for many of the small producers.
'They need something that can stabilise these erratic prices that are beyond
our control. A modest sense of security is the least the government can do
to provide a little downside protection.'
Tax incentives to keep operating the 15 per cent of US wells defined as
marginal - producing less than 15 barrels a day - if oil prices fell below
Dollars 20 a barrel and the wells' viability were in jeopardy, have won
tentative approval from the White House. But Mr Clinton said any incentives
should not increase the budget deficit.
The requirement that any help be 'revenue neutral' also affects proposals
aimed more at the 50 or so big independents and oil majors that account for
almost three-quarters of total US oil production.
Mr Clinton endorsed the concept of royalty relief and tax incentives for
operations employing new drilling methods or those undertaking oil
exploration - including the deep-sea drilling which promises to unlock big
new oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Relief would only be granted, however,
if the interior department determined that drilling would not otherwise
occur, according to Mr Bill White, deputy energy secretary.
But details of such schemes have yet to materialise, and many industry
figures remain sceptical that the administration will offer anything more
than marginal relief. 'I think there has been a tremendous amount of
sympathy expressed but we haven't seen a lot of action,' said Ms Bode.
The debate over whether to lift the 20-year old export ban on Alaskan North
Slope oil exemplifies the dubious political rewards of getting too deeply
involved in oil issues.
Amid warnings that the US would be running foul of international free trade
provisions, Mr Clinton has offered tentative support to a deal between oil
producers and some labour unions to lift the export restrictions.
The prohibition was a 1973 oil crisis trade-off for congressional approval
of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The ban has since been championed by a
range of groups, including environmentalists who fear further exploitation
of the Alaskan wilderness.
Under an arrangement engineered mainly by British Petroleum, the largest
Alaskan oil producer, the ban would be lifted on condition that only US
flagged and crewed tankers be used for export. But international shipping
groups have warned that such a restriction would be prohibited under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and might interfere with Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development negotiations on shipping
liberalisation.
Mr White said Mr Clinton was aware of the 'substantial' trade complications
lifting the ban poses and would only support eliminating it if these issue
were resolved.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Bill to outlaw replacement of strikers fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bill to outlaw the permanent replacement of striking workers was thrown
out by the Senate yesterday, in a blow to US organised labour and the
Clinton administration, Ken Warn reports from Washington. Backers of the
bill failed by seven votes to muster sufficient support to overturn a
Republican filibuster of the bill, meaning it is unlikely to be reintroduced
this year.
The legislation, a version of which was approved last year in the House,
would have prevented companies from permanently replacing workers on strike
for more pay. But employers would not have been prevented from using
managers or temporary replacements to continue operations during a strike.
The bill was opposed by US business. 'Senators understand this bill would
have serious consequences for the economy and US competitiveness,' Mr Jeff
Joseph, vice-president for domestic policy at the US Chamber of Commerce,
said.
Unions pushed for the change, and President Bill Clinton had promised to
sign the bill if it passed Congress. Permanent replacement of strikers has
been legal in the US since 1938. The issue became controversial in the
1980s.

Despite the uncertain prospects for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina, work is
about to begin on a Dollars 540m (Pounds 343m) UN co-ordinated action plan
for the restoration of essential services to Sarajevo, United Nations
officials said yesterday. Nearly half the money is needed for projects
described as 'urgent' and scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
Immediate priorities include restoration of the city's gas supply, water
chlorination, refuse removal, restoration of power lines and repairs to
schools in time for the autumn term. Mr Edouard Rousselot, operations
director for the action plan, said more than Dollars 68m had already been
raised following a pledging conference in New York at the end of June, the
three largest donors so far being the US, Britain and Japan. The action plan
relates to 'greater' Sarajevo, including Bosnian Serb-controlled areas.

The foreign ministers of Britain and France yesterday tried to tighten the
screws on Serb leaders and warned of a wider war if rival communities failed
to endorse the plan for Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb
leaders told the foreign ministers of Britain and France yesterday they
would neither endorse nor reject the 'last-chance' plan. In meetings with
Bosnian Serb leaders, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Alain
Juppe, his French counterpart, said earlier the international community
expected Serb forces to hand over one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnian
territory they hold. Under the plan, the new Moslem-Croat federation would
gain control over 51 per cent of the war-torn country leaving 49 per cent to
the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Hurd warned that if the plan was rejected, the
five-nation 'contact group' - comprising the US, Russia, Germany, the UK and
France - have considered lifting the arms embargo against the Moslem-Croat
federation, further tightening of UN sanctions and withdrawal of the
18,000-strong UN force from Bosnia. The ministers were later due to meet
President Slobodan Milosevic, who they hope will join them in persuading
Bosnian Serbs to accept partition. The Serb assembly - far more radical than
its leadership - has rejected previous peace plans despite intense
international pressure.

The management of Alitalia, Italy's state-run national airline, yesterday
reached a ground-breaking agreement with the main trade unions that involves
the ending of damaging restrictive labour practices. The outline agreement
follows a strike on Monday and a series of wildcat strikes which caused
chaos to Alitalia's operations last week. The deal centres on a commitment
by unions to end their ban on cabin crew being allowed to switch between
different types of aircraft, longer working hours, an unspecified cut in
wages and a freeze on pay increases through to 1996 plus a stop on new
recruitment. Against this, redundancies among ground staff, originally
planned at 4,000, will be 1,570. But this figure does not include 800 people
approved for early retirement by the previous Ciampi government and natural
wastage envisaged at about 800 a year during the course of the three-year
restructuring plan. Yesterday Alitalia declined to give details of the
agreement, which must now be put before union members for approval. Sulta,
the militant cabin crew union, excluded from the negotiations and which
caused the wildcat strikes of last week, said it would reject the deal.

FT  14 JUL 94 / MEPs show little support for Santer: The FT polled Euro-MPs
on their preference for Commission president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht treaty sought to strengthen the European parliament's
standing by giving the Strasbourg assembly the right to be consulted on the
choice of Commission president.
Judging by an FT opinion survey carried out by telephone with 150 of the 567
MEPs elected on June 9 and June 12, the innovation could misfire.
Mr Jacques Delors, the present European Commission president, and Mr
Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister, top the list of favoured
candidates.
Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister who is favourite to be
chosen by the special summit in Brussels tomorrow, comes well down the poll.
When the newly elected deputies meet next week to ponder the new president,
there is likely to be no more than an unenthusiastic endorsement of Mr
Santer.
Mrs Pauline Green, the British Labour Euro-MP who leads the dominant
Socialist group at Strasbourg, said yesterday: 'We want somebody of the
right stature and ability to deal with world leaders.'
She warned that, under the Maastricht treaty 'we have a constitutional right
to veto and we're prepared to use it'. She also suggested that 'if the
(European) Council can't decide' on a successor to Mr Delors 'then maybe we
should nominate someone.'
The FT's opinion poll, carried out between July 8 and 13, gives only an
incomplete guide to MEPs' sentiment. Nonetheless, the sample of 26 per cent
of MEPs, spread throughout the European Union and including a representative
selection of all the Strasbourg political groupings, has produced the first
insight into the assembly's views.
MEPs from the following countries gave firm responses to FT researchers
conducting the poll: Germany (22), UK (33), France (15), Italy (20), Spain
(5), Belgium (9), Ireland (8), Netherlands (18), Portugal (12), Denmark (4),
Greece (4). None of the six MEPs from Luxembourg could be contacted.
A total of 177 MEPs were contacted by telephone and asked to take part in
the poll, with 27 declining. The MEPs were asked to list in order of
preference their three favoured candidates. Mr Delors was given 35 first
places, seven second places and eight third places. Mr Amato gained 23 first
places, 15 second places and six third places.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who was the leading
candidate until opposed at the Corfu summit, gained 15 first places, 14
second and 14 third.
By contrast, Mr Santer was given first place by only six MEPs, with one
putting him in second place and five in third.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor and current president of the European
Council, is likely to be told of MEPs' hesitancy about Mr Santer on Friday.
At Mrs Green's insistence, he will then meet the leaders of the main
political groups in the parliament to sound them out before joining heads of
government at the Brussels summit.
Whoever emerges as the European Council's nominee from tomorrow's summit
will be expected to appear before the Socialist group in Strasbourg next
Tuesday, and then the parliament's full plenary session on Wednesday.
On Thursday, MEPs intend to vote on the candidate. Although Maastricht
entitles them only to approve or reject the Commission as a whole, if the
vote were negative or even close it could badly damage the credibility of
the choice.
The parliament insists all members of the Commission be named by the end of
October, and intends to hold individual, US Senate-style confirmation
hearings of the member states' nominees before voting on the whole
Commission in December. There is no provision in Maastricht for these but
the assembly says it will not put ratification of the Brussels team on the
agenda unless they are held.

McDonald, FT Research Unit, 071-873-3385.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's trade deficit fell 15.7 per cent during the first three months of
1994, compared with the same period last year, to Es300.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn),
the National Statistics Institute said yesterday. An 11.9 per cent increase
in first-quarter export earnings to Es663.2bn strengthened signs of recovery
after recession in 1993 caused mainly by a fall in exports. Spending on
imports rose 1.4 per cent to Es963.7bn. The trade deficit with the European
Union, which accounts for 72 per cent of Portugal's foreign trade, fell 26
per cent to Es178.6bn for the first quarter. Exports to the EU rose 10.8 per
cent to Es496.7bn. Imports fell by 2.1 per cent to Es675.3bn. In a further
sign of recovery, the government yesterday forecast an increase of almost 50
per cent in tourism earnings this year to about Es1,000bn.
French M3 money supply shrank 0.8 per cent in May from the previous month,
giving a year-on-year fall of 4.1 per cent, the Bank of France said.
Western German wholesale prices in June rose at their fastest pace of the
year, rising 0.8 per cent from May and up 1.8 per cent year on year, the
Federal Statistics Office said.
Spain's broad M4 money supply rose 11.6 per cent in June from May, the Bank
of Spain said, while lending to the private sector rose 5.8 per cent from
May.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Struggle for control of TV in Italy: Robert Graham in Rome
surveys the battlefield as new RAI board takes over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<TEXT>
A new five-strong board yesterday took control of the RAI, Italy's state
broadcasting corporation, amid a growing debate within the country over
control of the media by the government.
This is the first European administration whose prime minister, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, not only owns television interests but controls almost half the
nation's airtime through his Fininvest media empire.
The board was approved late on Monday as a result of a compromise between Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the other two main partners in the
right-wing coalition - the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance.
The members include a medieval historian, a prominent female stockbroker,
and businessmen close to Confindustria, the industrialists' organisation.
Their backgrounds reflect a sharp swing away from the cultural influences
inspired by the left in the post-war era.
They displace a transitional team, dubbed the professors because of their
academic backgrounds, which was appointed last year to manage the RAI,
pending the outcome of general elections and an eventual reform of
broadcasting. Its mandate was due to run until 1995.
As he prepared to hand over the chairman's office, Prof Claudio Dematte was
less concerned at his enforced departure than that of the ill-defined future
of television. 'A year ago, on July 13, I accepted this job - to act like a
civil servant carrying out a transitional role at the RAI,' said the
52-year-old, Harvard-educated professor of business administration. 'The
government is perfectly entitled to change the RAI. But the way it was
handled was unfortunate.'
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was obliged to intervene so as to prevent Mr
Berlusconi exercising direct control over the appointment, leaving it in the
hands of the speakers of the two houses of parliament. As a result, the
league has ensured that the board is not completely under the thumb of Mr
Berlusconi.
'As a teacher of business administration, the first thing I tell students is
that the shareholders of a company must entrust management with a clear
mission .. But the new management has not yet had its role defined,' said
Prof Dematte.
So far, the government has only talked of improving the RAI's finances - the
formal excuse for sacking the board. With losses of L479bn (Pounds 199m) and
outstanding debts of L1,496bn in 1993, no-one disputes the financial
fragility of the RAI. But a savage cost-cutting programme is under way that
includes a 15 per cent reduction in staff and the ending of abuses of
overtime and foreign travel. By 1995, a modest surplus is projected.
With what seems a reasonable restructuring plan in place, it is hard to
escape the conclusion that the government is more interested in exercising
control over a medium which every Italian watches for an average of four
hours a day. Control in this sense is not simply a question of the political
content - just as important is the ability to shape the RAI's future and
decide whether the state should retain a presence in broadcasting.
'RAI's three channels are too many,' said Prof Dematte. If changes are to be
made, he argues, the government should clarify whether the RAI either
continues to offer a broad base of programmes or concentrates on specific
and minority interests.
For instance, the focus could be on news, current affairs and culture,
ignoring entertainment. Or it could operate one general channel and other
specialised channels (sport, films, etc.). At present, Fininvest's channels
are heavily oriented towards entertainment, presenting almost 40 per cent
more hours of films, chat shows and soaps. Its news side loses money.
Prof Dematte insists that any changes in the structure of the RAI must take
account of Fininvest's own three commercial channels. 'There is an effective
duopoly between the RAI and Fininvest, where both have been conditioned by
competing against each other.' Ferocious competition in the late eighties
forced up the cost of each other's stars and imported programmes.
'Whatever service you take from the RAI potentially benefits the
competition,' claims Prof Dematte. This also applies to advertising,
Fininvest being especially sensitive to the RAI's 7.2 per cent increase in
advertising revenue when the market was stagnant in 1993.
Thus the reform of the RAI inevitably raises a conflict of interest between
Mr Berlusconi reshaping state television and his continued ownership of
Fininvest. Beyond this, as emphasised in a debate staged on Tuesday in Milan
by Mr Indro Montanelli, a veteran newspaper editor, it raises the issue of
the lack of an adequate system of checks and balances on government attempts
to control the media.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Brussels tries to force the pace on visas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday produced its proposed format for a
European Union visa for non-EU citizens which would come into force from the
beginning of 1996. The proposal was discussed at a meeting where the
Commission was highly critical of member states' failure to reach agreements
on justice and immigration affairs, the 'third pillar' of the Maastricht
treaty.
Brussels' attempt to introduce a common visa is part of an initiative to
allow free movement of people, including third country nationals, in Europe.
If its plans are implemented, non-EU citizens will ultimately be able to
apply for one visa granting them entry to all countries of the Union.
However, this idea has met with considerable opposition from some member
states. In particular, the UK government was concerned that citizens from
Commonwealth countries who did not require a visa to enter Britain would
have their movement restricted under a common EU visa. The introduction of
the new European format, a preliminary step in the Commission's initiative,
will constitute a change in design only for national visas and will not be
effective as a European-wide visa until member states have agreed
unanimously on a proposed list of 129 countries whose citizens will require
one for entry.
When the list was published in November it prompted much controversy.
'An agreement is going to be very hard to achieve,' one British official
said. 'The Maastricht treaty demands a common (visa) format. The British
will accept the format. It is accepting the common list that will be a
problem,' he said.
The visa, and the list of nationalities requiring one, follow closely work
done by the nine members of the intergovernmental Schengen free travel
agreement, which covers all the EU members except Britain, Denmark and
Ireland.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, who led yesterday's debate,
is understood to have told his colleagues that 'it is not possible to detect
any sign of movement towards seeking, let alone finding, compromise
solutions' on a range of initiatives the EU has set itself.
These include the Europol organisation to combat organised crime and drugs
trafficking within the single market; the external frontiers convention,
meant to permit freer movement within Europe by tightening up controls on
non-EU nationals at port of entry; and a common customs information system.
Last December's EU summit in Brussels gave justice and interior ministers a
deadline of this October to finalise the Europol convention.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Berlusconi plan to hold down deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government last night gave a long-awaited foretaste of its
economic policy, committing the right-wing coalition headed by prime
minister Silvio Berlusconi to finding extra revenue to meet shortfalls in
the 1994 budget and to reduce the 1995 deficit.
Full details of the government's macro-economic plans were promised after a
cabinet meeting on July 21. Release of the bare outlines last night appeared
a response to impatience in the markets.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said L5,000bn (Pounds 2bn) would be
found this year to hold the public sector deficit down to L159,000bn, over
10 per cent of gross domestic product.
He said this would come from extra revenue, relying on two main sources  - a
pardon for illegal buildings and an easing of tax assessment procedures.
The building pardon will permit formal registration of some properties put
up without proper planning permission. This will lead to registration fees
and property taxes.
Easing of tax assessment procedures will enable the finance ministry to
clear a backlog of 3.2m cases involving L85,000bn at present in dispute. The
ministry's short-term aim is to let tax authorities be more flexible, but
the longer-term aim is to encourage dialogue instead of confrontation
between taxpayers and the state.
The government has been forced to seek new revenue because of lower receipts
as a result of the recession and higher spending on pensions and social
security than anticipated.
On the broader aims of the 1995 budget and three-year macro-economic plan,
Mr Dini said the aim was not to raise taxes, so as to avoid fiscal pressure
rising above the 1992-93 levels. But he warned that spending cuts were
inevitable, with the government holding the increase in current spending to
2.5 per cent in line with inflation. The cuts would come from health, social
welfare and probably pensions.
Mr Dini said the 1995 budget would reduce the budget deficit to L140,000bn,
based on current interest rates. He said measures would have to be found to
raise an extra L40,000bn - an ambitious target without increasing fiscal
pressure. If achieved, this would produce a primary surplus (the balance
between receipts and expenditure excluding debt service) of L34,00bn.
This is equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, double the 1994 primary surplus.
But, if the cost of servicing Italy's huge stock of debt is included, the
1995 public sector deficit is still only just below 10 per cent of GDP,
almost double the average in the European Union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's president-elect, Mr Leonid Kuchma, yesterday sought to unite his
divided nation and affirm his commitment to Ukrainian independence and
economic reform.
In his first public appearance since his victory at the polls, an ebullient
Mr Kuchma said: 'I have never suggested that Ukraine should return to the
Russian empire.'
Pointedly, he spoke only in Ukrainian, even in response to questions
addressed to him in Russian. 'I will work only for the benefit of
independent, sovereign Ukraine,' he said.
Mr Kuchma also held out the hope that the contested Crimea peninsula - the
most dangerous flashpoint in Ukrainian-Russian relations and the most
serious challenge to the integrity of the Ukrainian state - will be appeased
with his electoral victory. 'Crimea has voted for Ukraine,' he said,
alluding to the region's overwhelming support for his candidacy in Sunday's
poll.
He made encouraging promises to potential western investors and welcomed the
Group of Seven industrialised nations' offer of Dollars 4bn in aid to
Ukraine if it begins market reforms, but he refused to commit himself on the
controversial issue of the country's nuclear status.
'I will refer to the nuclear question in the future, but first we must
analyse it in greater detail,' he said, in answer to a question as to
whether Ukraine will sign the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, which
expires this year.
Mr Kuchma said his priority would be to act on his campaign promise to
revive the economy, beginning with changes to Ukraine's punitive taxation
policies and its fixed exchange rate system which often makes exporting
unprofitable.
'The more we tax the less money we get in the state budget,' he said. 'The
current taxation system is killing business. If we stop doing that I am
confident that more money will flow into the government's coffers.'
Before implementing his economic programme, Mr Kuchma must assert his
control over Ukraine's government, thrown into confusion by the unexpected
defeat of President Leonid Kravchuk. The president-elect struck an initially
conciliatory tone, promising that there would be 'no witch hunt'. He also
said he had met Mr Vitalii Masol, the prime minister, and was prepared, for
the time being, to work with him, although there would soon be changes in
the cabinet.
Behind the placatory phrases, however, were signs that once he has
established himself in office, Mr Kuchma intends to rule Ukraine with a
strong hand. 'I did not take power in order to give it away,' he told
reporters.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Water group faces funding inquiry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French justice ministry said yesterday it had asked police to conduct
two 'preliminary' inquiries into alleged irregularities by Compagnie
Generale des Eaux (CGE), the construction, utilities and communications
group, in funding political parties.
CGE yesterday denied one allegation that it had paid money to a company
associated with the Communist party for what CGE knew to be bogus services,
but said that it understood that police were inquiring into whether it had
exceeded the FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,240) limit on what a company and each of
its subsidiaries can give political parties per year. CGE has 2,400
subsidiaries.
Meanwhile, France's other big contracting-communications group, Lyonnaise
des Eaux, said it had yesterday brought a libel suit against Mr Thierry
Jean-Pierre, a former magistrate, who last month was elected to the European
parliament. In May Mr Jean-Pierre published a document claiming that '80 per
cent of political corruption was organised by two big groups. . . .carrying
out services for public authorities'.
Lyonnaise des Eaux said the reference was 'sufficiently clear and precise
for a large number of newspapers to designate it (the company) without
hesitation'. It complained that these 'groundless' allegations had caused
'real prejudice' to the company's interests. The share prices of Lyonnaise
des Eaux and CGE fell immediately after Mr Jean-Pierre's allegations.
Police interest in CGE's political funding stemmed from a corruption
investigation in the French territory of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. A
magistrate there, in his investigation of alleged kickbacks in the awarding
of building and waste treatment contracts, has formally charged the former
Socialist mayor of St Denis, the island's capital, as well as current or
former local managers of CGE and Lyonnaise subsidiaries.
Pursuing his inquiries at CGE's offices in Paris in March, the Reunion
magistrate came across some company papers, unrelated to the St Denis affair
but which he considered suspicious enough to pass on to Paris prosecutors.
These papers form the starting point of the police inquiry that the justice
ministry confirmed yesterday. This week's edition of the Canard Enchaine
satirical paper claimed that Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister,
was deliberately restraining the inquiry by refusing to call in an
investigating magistrate at this stage. But a ministry spokesman said
yesterday it was first important for police to check whether there was 'any
reality to the suspected infractions'.
CGE, which under French law would only have a right to see the results of
any police or magistrate's investigation if formal charges were brought,
said it believed the allegation of irregular funding of political parties
related to 1992, the last year for which parties had filed full accounts.
But in the 1993 parliamentary elections it said it had only given FFr11m out
of the national FFr1.4bn total that went to candidates. 'This 0.8 per cent
of the total is derisory,' said a spokesman.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Police break up protest at German nuclear waste site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several hundred German police moved at dawn yesterday to clear some 400
protesters from a makeshift village outside Germany's proposed nuclear waste
disposal site, in an escalation of the campaign against nuclear energy.
The confrontation comes as the first delivery of highly radioactive nuclear
waste is expected at the remote Gorleben plant on the banks of the river
Elbe, where it is supposed to be stored temporarily pending a legal decision
on how to dispose of such waste permanently.
Fears of violence evaporated when police approached the impromptu roadblocks
unarmed, and the demonstrators offered only passive resistance. But they had
to be carried away from the site before bulldozers moved in to clear the
road.
It was uncertain last night how soon nuclear waste deliveries could start,
because the protesters had dug tunnels under the entrance roads at the
Gorleben site, although the storage plant itself is protected by massive
security fences.
Failure to resolve the question of nuclear waste disposal in the face of
anti-nuclear protests has left the industry's future in Germany in doubt.
Attempts to negotiate an overall energy consensus, involving the electricity
industry and state and federal governments have broken down. Local
authorities and the Lower Saxony state government have been pitted against
the federal government in Bonn, causing a stalemate over waste disposal
plans for almost 20 years.
The Lower Saxony authorities, who are in control of the state's police under
the German federal system, instructed them this week not to charge
protesters with any offence. But the local council in the Gorleben area
banned any public assembly, giving police the excuse to move in.
Low-level nuclear waste is already stored at the Gorleben site, but
temporary storage of high-level waste has been blocked by repeated and
extended planning inquiries organised by Ms Monika Griefahn, the Social
Democrat environment minister in Lower Saxony.
She admitted recently her efforts had been exhausted, and the first
vitrified glass containers of high-level waste from the Philippsburg nuclear
reactor in Baden-Wurttemberg are expected imminently, with the approval of
Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister in Bonn.
The so-called Castor containers are to be kept in a huge warehouse, in
conditions of strict security, pending a decision on permanent disposal.
That has hitherto been banned under German law, which favoured recycling. In
the meantime, most nuclear waste from Germany's nuclear power stations is
being sent to reprocessing plants in France and Britain, to be converted
into plutonium and re-used in the nuclear system.
Any question of permanent disposal of nuclear waste at Gorleben - in a salt
mine currently being dug for the purpose - remains in doubt because of
opposition of local authorities. The Lower Saxony government wants to link
any decision on use of the site to a comprehensive plan to phase out all
nuclear power production in Germany.
Until German authorities at state and national level can agree on nuclear
waste disposal, the industry will depend on its reprocessing contracts with
France's Cogema and BNFL's Thorp plant at Sellafield to recycle waste. But
if they reach agreement on the Gorleben project, a second phase of those

FT  14 JUL 94 / Services take lead in Russia
</HEADLINE>

Services are now contributing more to the Russian economy than manufacturing
 -a remarkable sign that reforms, painful and still far from complete, may
be working.
Figures from the state agency Tosaomstat reveal a momentous shift in an
economy which in Soviet times was expressly dedicated to production. It
means that Russia is now developing the beginnings of a profile associated
with advanced economies - where services account for a higher proportion of
gross domestic product and employment than making things.
However, it appears that much of the improvement is due to the informal or
'grey' sector of the economy, so defined because it at least pays no taxes
and parts of it may be wholly criminalised. Studies of this sector differ as
to its size, but the average estimate is that it may account for around 25
per cent of gross domestic product.
The figures for the first six months for this year showed that services of
all kinds generated nearly 50 per cent of GDP estimated to total
Rbs245,000bn. Manufacturing output, by contrast, contributed 42.5 per cent
and has declined by more than 25 per cent in the first half of this year.
Engineering was particularly hard hit, falling by about 44 per cent on the
first six months of last year.
Investment shrank by 27 per cent in the first half, but the share of
investment in private and semi-private enterprises rose from just over 30
per cent to 40 per cent of the total. Foreign investments in the period was
only Dollars 280m.
At the same time, the figures show that real disposable income has gone up
by some 10 per cent over the same time last year.
Experts now in Moscow on missions from the main international financial
institutions say the apparent paradox of tumbling production and rising
income is explicable in large part because of the growth of the 'informal'
sector, which remains largely a matter for estimations.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Japanese cars lose ground in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese carmakers have suffered a heavy loss of market share in the west
European new car market in the first six months this year, their
competitiveness hit hard by the rapid appreciation of the yen.
Overall sales have risen by 6.8 per cent to 6.5m from 6.08m in the
corresponding period a year ago, according to industry estimates. Sales by
Japanese carmakers, by contrast, have fallen by 5.8 per cent to an estimated
712,000 depressing their share to 11 per cent from 12.4 per cent a year ago.
Seven of the eight Japanese manufacturers in the west European market have
seen volumes fall in the first six months - Suzuki and Daihatsu have both
lost over a fifth.
Last month, total sales rose in west Europe by an estimated 12.9 per cent to
1.065m from 943,000 a year ago. The recovery has strengthened significantly
in the past two months, and new car car sales in west Europe have been
higher than a year ago in five of the past six months.
Last year, they fell by more than 15 per cent, the steepest annual decline
in the post-war period.
In June sales were higher than a year ago in all 17 markets across west
Europe led by the UK, Spain and Scandinavia. In the first half of the year,
sales were lower than a year ago in only four markets - Italy, Austria,
Portugal and Greece - while sales in Germany rose only marginally.
Significantly, demand has picked up in the past two months in both Germany
and Italy, the leading European volume markets. Sales in Germany in June
rose year-on-year by an estimated 5.6 per cent; in Italy by 7.1 per cent.
Four of the big six volume carmakers in the west European market - General
Motors (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK), Peugeot Citroen,
Ford and Renault - have all gained ground. Peugeot sales have risen by an
estimated 13.1 per cent in the first six months helped by recovery of the
French market.
Volkswagen is suffering from weak demand for VW and Audi, but has seen sales
rise for Seat and Skoda, its Spanish and Czech subsidiaries. Some of the
biggest gains have been achieved by the specialist makes, Mercedes-Benz,
Saab, Volvo and Rover.

FT  14 JUL 94 / CBS abandons Dollars 7bn QVC merger in face of rival bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) merger between CBS, the US television
broadcasting network, and QVC, the cable television shopping channel headed
by Mr Barry Diller, collapsed yesterday in the face of a rival Dollars 2.2bn
bid for QVC by Comcast, one of the US's leading cable television service
companies.
Comcast, which is one of QVC's three largest shareholders, with a 15 per
cent stake, surprised Wall Street late on Tuesday night with the news that
it strongly disliked the CBS/QVC merger and was itself launching a cash and
stock bid for QVC worth around Dollars 44 a share. That is substantially
higher than the Dollars 38 a share offer for QVC announced by CBS two weeks
ago.
CBS said yesterday that it would not pursue the acquisition of QVC and would
instead launch a cash tender offer for up to 3.5m CBS shares - roughly 20
per cent of its fully diluted stock outstanding - at a price of Dollars 325
a share. The move will cost around Dollars 1.1bn, which is about the size of
CBS's cash pile.
The tender was viewed by Wall Street as designed partly to protect CBS's
share price following the collapse of the QVC deal, which had been viewed
very positively on Wall Street and included a cash distribution to
shareholders of Dollars 175 a share. CBS stock rose Dollars 8 to Dollars 308
at the close of trading, while QVC jumped Dollars 6 to Dollars 42 and
Comcast dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 1/8 .
Comcast said it would sell assets or bring in partners to finance its offer
for QVC, which analysts said would stretch its finances, but it denied
suggestions that it was interested more in derailing the CBS deal than
taking over QVC. Still, yesterday's developments left both CBS and QVC as
sitting targets for bids from other media companies and raised a large
question mark over the future of Mr Diller, one of Hollywood's top
programming talents, who joined QVC 18 months ago.
He aimed to use its television shopping business as a springboard to build a
broad-based, multi-media television programming empire. Under the CBS merger
agreement, he would have become chief executive of the combined group.
Mr Ralph Roberts, chairman of Comcast, and his son, Brian, chief executive,
played an important part in persuading Mr Diller to join QVC and said
yesterday they would 'be pleased' if he chose to remain as the company's
chief executive. Wall Street analysts felt it highly unlikely that Mr Diller
would wish to remain in the humdrum world of home shopping, working for men
who had destroyed his deal with CBS, though many also doubted he would still
want to join CBS, since he is ambitious to head a company in which he has a
large personal stake, rather than being an employee.
It is the second time in six months Mr Diller has failed with an ambitious
QVC takeover deal. In February he lost a Dollars 10bn battle to acquire
entertainment group Paramount Communications - a deal Comcast strongly
supported.
Comcast objected to the QVC-CBS merger because it sees its stake in QVC as a
means of building up a strong presence in television programming, where it
has few interests. Because federal law limits broadcasters and cable
operators to a 5 per cent voting stake in companies in each others'
industries, its clout at QVC would have been significantly diluted by the
CBS deal.
So too would that of Liberty Media, a cable programming group which owns 15
per cent of QVC and is a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest
cable service company in the US. TCI raised no objection to the QVC-CBS deal
and has yet to make clear its attitude to the Comcast offer.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Dollar rallies on hopes of US rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battered dollar bounced back on foreign exchanges yesterday as rumours
circulated among dealers of an imminent tightening of monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve.
The market performed a swift about-turn from Tuesday's fears that low
inflation would delay higher interest rates, and focused instead on the
prospects for an imminent increase in rates.
The dollar closed more than a pfennig and a half higher in London at
DM1.5383. It was also firmer against the yen, closing at Y98.15. The rally
continued in New York, where the dollar closed at DM1.54125 and Y98.225,
while in Tokyo this morning it opened at DM1.542 and Y98.20.
There were suggestions in the markets that US short-term rates would rise by
anything from 50 to 100 basis points, which would take them above German
rates for the first time since September 1990. Although based on rumour, the
calculations inspired greater dealer confidence in the dollar.
Earlier the dollar had weakened slightly on the release of US consumer
inflation data for June. Month-on-month inflation rose 0.3 per cent, in line
with market forecasts, momentarily damping hopes of a Fed tightening.
A quick increase in rates would dispel market fears that the Fed has been
slow to respond to the threat of inflation arising from economic recovery.
It would also quash concerns that the Fed is bending to the will of the
White House, which does not want higher rates. Both factors have contributed
to recent dollar weakness.
Another factor contributing to the dollar's resurgence was the greater
stability in international bond markets. Volatile bond markets had driven
investors towards safe haven currencies such as the D-Mark and the Swiss
franc, and the relative weakness of these two currencies in recent days is a
sign of calmer markets.
Analysts said the dollar's bounce provided evidence that some investors were
becoming nervous about the weakness of the US currency against the yen.
However, sentiment remains bearish and yesterday's bounce was seen more as a
corrective rally than a turning point. Investors are still selling into
rallies, which indicates pessimism about the outlook. But they remain
cautious of taking aggressive short positions against the dollar, for fear
of being caught out by central bank intervention.
'The lower we go, the more nervous the market gets,' said Mr Ian Gunner,
international economist at Chase Manhattan in London. The dollar has fallen
by around 9 per cent since the beginning of June.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Glaxo in investment shake-up after losing Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investments in complex financial instruments have cost Glaxo, the UK
pharmaceuticals group, about Pounds 100m in recent months, the company
indicated yesterday.
Glaxo also said it had switched control of its Pounds 2.2bn investment
portfolio from its own 10-member, Bermuda-based investment management group
to outside experts. 'We are going to concentrate on pharmaceuticals from now
on, rather than investment banking,' it said.
Glaxo's losses stemmed from the investment of its huge cash pile, rather
than from trading in financial markets, which has been the cause of well
publicised losses at other companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble.
The losses are believed to have arisen mostly from the company's holdings of
structured bonds, which amounted to 10 per cent of its investment portfolio,
and collateralised mortgage obligations, which have been reported at Dollars
600m (Pounds 384m).
Structured bonds are instruments whose returns are tied to some other
factor, such as the relationship between two interest rates, while CMOs are
securities created from mortgage-backed bonds which carry greater risk (and
potentially greater rewards) than standard instruments. Although not
strictly derivatives, these securities can share many of the characteristics
of such instruments, as they bring a leveraged exposure to a change in
interest rates or other market-moving event.
A number of big investors in the CMO market in the US have reported
substantial losses in recent months, among them Kidder Peabody, the
investment banking arm of General Electric; Askin Capital Management, an
investment firm which specialised in such instruments, and Bank of Montreal.
The head of Glaxo's investment management activities, Mr John Hignett, a
former managing director of Lazards and head of the City's Takeover Panel,
retired at the end of March at the age of 60. His departure was not related
to concerns about the quality of the investments, Glaxo said. But after his
departure, Mr John Coombe, the company's finance director, launched a review
of the company's investments which revealed the losses.
The company refused to confirm directly that it had lost Pounds 100m.
However, it said: 'That is what the market thinks. If the board thought the
market was wrong, it would make a statement.'
The losses were broadly in line with the decline in bond markets in recent
months, or about 5 per cent, he added.
The scale of the losses could grow as Glaxo moves to sell its securities. It
is believed to have begun the sales last week and confirmed that it had sold
Dollars 55m of securities on Monday.

FT  14 JUL 94 / Whitehall faces sweeping reform: Government outlines
four-year plan to cut 50,000 civil service jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government yesterday pushed its campaign for an improved
public service to the very heart of Whitehall with plans for the most
comprehensive restructuring of the civil service in decades.
In a long-awaited white paper, the government outlined a set of reforms
which will reduce the size of the civil service by about 50,000 people over
the next four years and expose Whitehall to management practices that are
commonplace in the private sector.
The reforms will give individual Whitehall departments more autonomy over
the selection of senior staff and the determination of running costs. It is
proposed that more senior civil service posts should be open to candidates
from the private sector and that the salaries of senior officials should be
partly linked to their performance.
Departments will also be obliged to introduce a fundamental reform of
accounting practice, monitoring capital expenditure more comprehensively.
Presenting the white paper to the House of Commons, Mr William Waldegrave,
the public service minister, said the aim of the reforms was to 'map a way
forward for the civil service to the end of the century and beyond', making
the Whitehall structure 'tauter and flatter' than it is now.
However, he also acknowledged that the civil service had a 'unique role' in
maintaining Britain's unwritten constitution. He assured MPs that the
government would adopt a bipartisan approach to its proposals, and would
consult opposition parties before implementing them.
Some Labour MPs believed the proposals were far less radical than Mr
Waldegrave might have wished, and that some cabinet ministers had ensured
that the apparatus of government would remain in its traditional shape.
'The consolidators have won,' said Mr Giles Radice, who chairs inquiries
into Whitehall by the Treasury and civil service select committee. 'This is
not a radical document and the chance to open up the civil service has not
really been taken.' At the heart of the proposals is the creation of a
Senior Civil Service, which will be composed of the top 3,500 officials.
It is proposed that these officials should receive explicit written
employment contracts for the first time, and that salaries should be partly
based on performance. Fixed term contracts could be used but ministers
underlined that these would be in exceptional cases.
Mr Waldegrave said open competition for posts 'should become a more normal
part of the process of selecting people for senior appointments'. But the
white paper failed to outline any specific targets for such appointments.
The accounting reforms, outlined in a Treasury green paper yesterday,
proposed that all government departments comply with radically different
accounting practices more in line with the private sector within the next
four years.
The planned switch from cash-based to 'accruals' accounting will impose for
the first time on the civil service the need to account for capital
expenditure and to develop a series of more accurate management indicators.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said: 'This is a highly significant event
that will make a great different to how government carries out business,
makes decisions and is made accountable.'
Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, said: 'This is good news. It is part of a continuum of steps to
improve the quality of management of government services.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Swedish oil group pays Dollars
60m for control of stations
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OK Petroleum, the Swedish oil group acquired earlier this year by Saudi
Arabia's Sheikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi, yesterday moved to strengthen its
position in Sweden's retail petrol market by taking full control of the
country's 400 Texaco stations.
OK paid Dollars 60m to acquire the 50 per cent of Texaco's Swedish operation
that it did not already own.
The Texaco chain, with a Swedish market share of just over 7 per cent, is
the first large-scale direct ownership of retail operations by OK. It is
closely associated with the OK chain, but most OK stations are independently
owned.
Together, the Texaco chain - which will continue to operate under the Texaco
name - and the OK stations will have a 25 per cent market share, equalling
the share held by Norway's Statoil which last year became the country's
largest when it acquired the local BP chain.
Mr Sven-Erik Zachrisson, OK's chief executive, said the company intended to
become 'more aggressive' in the retail market in the Nordic region.
The group, with sales of SKr19.5bn (Dollars 2.5bn) last year, has two
refineries in Sweden with combined refining capacity of 265,000 barrels a
day.
It accounts for 23 per cent of the Nordic area's refining capacity.
Skeikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi paid Dollars 1.2bn for OK in March this year,
buying out the previous joint owners: Sweden's KF co-operative group, Neste,
the Finnish oil company, and the Swedish state.
The purchase, one of the biggest foreign takeovers of a Swedish-based
company, was carried out through Corral Petroleum Holdings, a private
company.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Clinton echoes Kennedy in Berlin: US president tells
Germans: 'America stands on your side, now and for ever'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standing in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate, where the Berlin Wall once
divided east from west, President Bill Clinton yesterday followed in the
footsteps of his predecessor John F. Kennedy.
'Nichts wird uns aufhalten. Alles ist moglich. Berlin ist frei,' Mr Clinton
proclaimed, telling his German audience that 'Nothing can stop us.
Everything is possible. Berlin is free.'
In a gesture that self-consciously echoed Mr Kennedy's last minute addition
of the famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' phrase to his speech 31 years ago, Mr
Clinton wrote the words into the text by hand on his way to the Brandenburg
Gate.
Mr Clinton's sally into German - his sixth foreign language in a week-long
trip - achieved a higher level of grammar than his boyhood hero, whose
addition of the word 'ein' changed him from a Berliner to a doughnut.
But it failed to pierce Berlin's present day indifference to pomp and
ceremony. 'Er ist kein Kennedy,' retorted an unimpressed Berlin taxi driver,
suggesting of Mr Clinton that 'he is no Kennedy'.
While Mr Kennedy brought a promise of US support in difficult times, the
only concrete promise that Mr Clinton could bring was more modest, the
construction of a new American embassy in Berlin. Perhaps of more
significance, Mr Clinton promised that US backing for Germany would not end
with the demolition of the Berlin Wall: 'America stands on your side, now
and for ever.'
Police estimates put the crowd at 150,000, but to many observers at the
scene it appeared much smaller, and some White House aides admitted they
were disappointed by the crowd's lack of enthusiasm.
Mr Clinton's promise of US support carried a particular significance on the
day that he presided over the final US military parade in Berlin.
The Berlin Brigade - the name the US military occupation forces have adopted
for the last 33 years - furled its colours for the last time in a ceremony
at the city's McNair Barracks. But the Brigade's servicemen seem less sure
than the president or Mr Kohl that their presence is no longer required.
'I hope we don't have to come back here and do it all over,' said Sergeant
Carlos Ruiz, with a glance over his shoulder to the east.
Meanwhile, the US and European Union agreed in Berlin yesterday to establish
a working group on the integration of the countries of central and eastern
Europe into western security and economic institutions.
The plans for the working group follow admissions from both sides that the
lines of communication on these issues had been inadequate.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Hong Kong plans old-age pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government, usually noted for being non-interventionist,
yesterday proposed an old-age pension scheme requiring compulsory
contributions from personal and corporate taxpayers, Reuter reports from
Hong Kong.
The territory, which has a comparatively low tax regime, has minimal welfare
services and no pension scheme for its aged residents. But it has recently
debated the establishment of a government-administered scheme similar to
Singapore's.
Under a consultation paper issued for comment, Hong Kong workers and
companies would have to contribute 1.5 per cent of earnings to a pension
fund that would be run by a non-government body.
The government would inject HKDollars 10bn (USDollars 1.28bn) to kick-start
the scheme. It would also have to contribute about HKDollars 1.2bn in 1994
on behalf of its civil servants if the scheme became operative. The
government estimated it also would forego around HKDollars 800m in revenue
as employers contributed to the pension fund.
Hong Kong's personal tax rate is currently 15 per cent and the corporate tax
rate 16.5 per cent.
Governor Chris Patten said there was a deep-seated view that the community
needed to do more for its elderly. 'We've put forward proposals which
recognise the debt, the obligation which the whole of our society owes to
our elderly citizens who've helped build and create Hong Kong and have made
it the great success which it is,' Mr Patten told reporters.
No start date has been recommended for the scheme, proposed in a
consultation paper that invites public comment by October. A pension payment
of HKDollars 2,300 (USDollars 295) a month, to be adjusted with inflation,
would be paid to residents aged 65 and above who have lived in the territory
for a continuous period of seven years or more. There would be no exemptions
for contributors to voluntary retirement schemes.
China would be required to continue the scheme after it resumes sovereignty
of Hong Kong in 1997. Mr Patten said he had written to Mr Lu Ping, China's
top official with responsibility for Hong Kong affairs, to inform him of the
proposal.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Turkish privatisation derailed again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's privatisation effort has again been derailed by the courts.
Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, the privatisation chief, publicly insists the programme
will continue regardless but the foreign bankers and investors looking to
buy Turkish assets believe the government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has
been thwarted by last week's constitutional court ruling invalidating its
use of decree powers to push through the sell-off programme.
The court has still not published its justification, but it is expected to
centre on the argument that the powers given to the executive infringe on
the constitutional authority of the elected parliament.
Investors already have a number of misgivings - the lack of a regulatory
framework, and the absence of a pricing regime that would allow a buyer
freedom to manage and restructure the labour force, not to mention the
unfavourable external environment where the devaluation of the lira has made
it all but impossible to put a value on Turkish assets. The prospect that
any sale could also be challenged by the country's highest court fills
investors with horror.
Opponents of privatisation say it is not simply a procedural issue. Even
where privatisation legislation has been approved by parliament as in the
case of the recently passed telecommunications privatisation bill, Mr Mumtaz
Soysal, the deputy masterminding the court actions to oppose state
sell-offs, warns he will challenge the law.
Mr Soysal argues that providing telephone services is a public service.
Privatising the telecoms company would in effect be a concession to a
non-government body to provide those services. And under the constitution,
the award of a concession has to be approved by the administrative court.
Few bankers are probably aware of the Aktas case, where a former employee of
the state electricity utility Tek took a suit for wrongful dismissal against
Aktas, a private power distribution company, contracted by Tek to provide
electricity to parts of Istanbul.
The case was referred to the administrative court in Ankara, which ruled
that Aktas's contract with Tek was invalid because the court's approval for
the award of a concession had not been provided.
The legal conundrum deepens in that under Turkey's foreign investment law
foreigners cannot own concessions. The terms are not defined. However, for
many Turks, the mere word awakens uncomfortable memories of the nineteenth
century when concessions were awarded to foreign interests, as part of the
capitulations when the Sultan provided foreigners with the rights to the
empire's tobacco crop, for example, in lieu of its massive debts to European
treasuries.
Given such a powerful historical resonance, most observers believe that if
challenged on this issue, the courts will take a nationalist line. In the
Aktas case the administrative court took a very broad definition of what is
a concession, as any activity undertaken by government, not just public
services.

FT  13 JUL 94 / European bourse plan for small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of leading European stockbrokers, venture capitalists, investment
bankers and stock exchange representatives have formed an association to
create a pan-European stock exchange for fast growing companies.
The new group, the European Association, has obtained funding from the
European Commission for research into the likely number of potential listees
on the new exchange. The research is expected to be completed by
mid-November.
Existing mechanisms for the trading of small company shares were proving
inadequate in providing capital throughout the economic cycle, the group
said. It cited the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market in London and
the Dutch Parallelmarkt as examples of small company exchanges which have
failed to aid investors.
Participants are seeking to model the new exchange along the lines of
Nasdaq, the US-based stock market, which has grown to be the world's second
largest in turnover by listing shares of small, fast-growing companies.
The European Venture Capital Association is the prime sponsor for the
project. Nasdaq has already said it supports the venture and would like to
be a minority shareholder in a new exchange.
However, the London Stock Exchange has already ruled out participation in a
UK-based specialist exchange for small company shares and has dismissed
suggestions that a pan-European exchange would be effective. However,
several other European exchanges, particularly the Paris Bourse, have
embraced the concept.
Several members believe the main challenge will be to get agreement on
whether the new exchange should be a single entity cited in one centre or a
'federation' of exchanges based in different centres. Other issues are where
to cite the exchange's headquarters and whether to rely on an existing
bourse's trading mechanism or whether to import a new system.

FT  13 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Hasbro gives up on Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th July 1994) appended to this article.
Hasbro yesterday threw in its hand in the battle for JW Spear, the maker of
Scrabble, and said it would accept the Pounds 11.50 a share bid from US toy
rival Mattel.
It described the Pounds 62m offer as 'very generous and above a level which
we could justify in business terms'.
The decision ends a fierce scrap over Spear, which started when Hasbro
launched a 900p a share bid for the company at the end of May. It had held a
26.7 per cent stake since 1990 and had received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
After a frantic search for a white knight, Hambro, Spear's merchant bank,
persuaded Mattel to launch a rival bid at Pounds 10 a share five minutes
before the deadline. Hasbro came back with an Pounds 11 a share offer last
Friday, which was topped by Mattel on Monday night.
Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International, said: 'Our offer at
Pounds 11 per share was a very full one which we are not prepared to
increase. We are very pleased at the outcome for all shareholders and will
of course realise a substantial gain on our own investment which we made in
1990.' Hasbro bought its original stake at under Pounds 3 a share.
The outcome leaves the rights to Scrabble divided between Mattel and Hasbro,
which are fierce rivals in the doll market. Hasbro, maker of Sindy, retains
the rights to Scrabble in North America, leaving Barbie's creator, Mattel,
with the rest of the world.
Mattel's victory is particularly sweet for Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank. It was appointed by Mattel just six hours before the initial offer had
to be launched and completed the task with a few minutes to spare.
CORRECTION
JW Spear's merchant bank, which handled its successful sale to Mattel,
was Barings not Hambros as stated yesterday.

FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures selling reverses early
advance - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncertainty caused by persistent weakness in the US dollar, emphasised
following the announcement of unchanged US producer price statistics for
June caught up with London share prices yesterday. An early run towards the
FT-SE 3,000 mark was abruptly reversed by heavy selling of stock index
futures and the stock market fell away, unable to follow the strong lead
from British government bonds.
The second half of the session was somewhat erratic, with the London market
suffering most of its fall before Wall Street came in with a loss of 20 Dow
points in UK hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,963.9, for
a net loss on the day of 19.9.
Analysts sounded at a loss to explain why UK equities should have reversed
the gains achieved on Monday when the dollar was also weak. But equities
were easier across Europe yesterday, in contrast with bond markets which
remained firm - with UK gilts particularly well supported. Some strategists
saw this as an indication of significant switching by international
investors towards European bonds.
Shares started the day in good form and the Footsie gained 12.8 to reach
2,996.6 before activating the sellers in the futures market. The abruptness
of the turnround, which took the Footsie down to 2,957.4 at the day's low,
suggested technical selling from investors unwilling to trust the stock
market above Footsie 3,000 just yet.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell only 8 points to 3,465.9, reflecting the closer
focus on the futures-related shares which make up to the Footsie 100 Index.
Trading volume increased to 594.6m from 542.5m in the previous session; on
Monday, retail or customer business in equities returned worth of Pounds
1.17bn, still an improvement on last week's average daily figure.
Non-Footsie share trading made up around 57 per cent of total business
yesterday.
The US producer prices were considerably better than the markets had
expected and indicated slack inflationary pressure and, therefore, reduced
pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. An improvement in
US bonds was not fully held, however, and the dollar continued to soften,
reinforcing worries over the implications for the profits of dollar-earning
UK companies. Weakness in sterling also began to upset equity market
strategists.
Among the currency-related stocks, most of the dollar stocks were easier as
the implications for profit repatriation of the slide in the US currency
took hold. Pharmaceuticals gave ground although without suffering heavy
selling pressure. The exception to the trend among blue chip multinationals
was the oil sector which strengthened behind a strong crude price. However,
the firmness in the German mark continued to help some building and
construction issues.
There were signs of profit-taking elsewhere, with many stocks falling away
for little reason other than that they had performed well over the past
week.
The retail sector looked nervous while awaiting publication of the June
Retail price index soon after the stock market opens for business this
morning; analysts expect little change in the year-on-year rate of 2.6 per
cent. However, today also brings statistics on average earnings in the UK
which will be scanned carefully for any signs that wage pressure is building
up.

FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stores upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks &amp; Spencer fell 6 to 400p as UBS featured the stock in a broad change
of heart over the retail sector.
The house moved its recommendation on the stores from overweight to neutral
and its stance on M &amp; S from buy to hold. UBS said the rising cost of raw
materials would be passed on to the retailers who have enjoyed a good run in
share price terms over the past year. Also it was uncertain whether those
price increases could be passed on to the consumer.
Elsewhere in the sector Kingfisher tumbled 12 to 512p and Boots 12 to 536p.
However, Great Universal Stores rose 7 to 574p ahead of figures tomorrow as
the market focused on the possibility that the company might buy back a
percentage of the shares in issue.
Food manufacturer Hillsdown fell 4 to 162 as Strauss Turnbull cut its 1994
forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 167m and next year's by Pounds 9m to Pounds
173m citing dull trading in the UK and overseas competition.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was up in early trading
following encouraging noises on the tobacco industry from US rival Philip
Morris which announced that second quarter said that second quarter earnings
were up by 19.3 per cent. However the dollar-prompted pressure in the
afternoon saw the shares close 2 off at 410p.
Pharmaceuticals were generally weak took no solace from the latest statement
by Roche the Swiss group which warned that sales growth during the second
half would be slower than in recent years.
Dollar weakness played a significant part but Glaxo was also restrained by a
perception that it was falling behind in the race to capture US market share
following the purchase of a distributor by rival Eli Lilly. The shares fell
13 1/2 to 549 1/2 p.
SmithKline Beecham dropped 12 to 388p as traders said about a third of a 9m
share deal believed to have been carried out by Smith New Court still
lingered on the marketmaker's books.
ICI stood out with a rise of 8 to 777p. Mr Andrew Stott of Kleinwort Benson
said that the shares avoided being driven by the state of the US currency as
the chemicals company's dollar related sales were matched by raw material
costs.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte rose 5 to 727p with dealers citing a
recommendation by Goldman Sachs. The Goldman team was unable to comment as
they were taking part in an analysts' visit to a Courtaulds' site in
Germany. The latter's shares, which do react quite strongly to the dollar,
drifted 4 to 495p.
The oil majors moved in opposite directions with BP making good progress and
Shell coming under selling pressure in the wake of news of an escalation to
the strikes in the Nigerian oilfields.
Shell, down 3 1/2 at 694 1/2 p, suffered because of its substantial Nigerian
production interests, but BP moved up 4 1/2 to 384 1/2 p reflecting its high
gearing to a rising oil price. August Brent jumped 75 cents to Dollars 18.57
a barrel on the Nigerian strike news which analysts said could reduce global
oil output by around 1.9m barrels a day.
Several stocks in the transport sector succumbed to profit-taking after a
strong recent run. The list included British Airways, 5 lower at 416p, after
trade of 4.2m.
Broker recommendations boosted Christian Salvesen 9 to 286p.
Shares in British Steel closed 3 1/2 ahead at 151 1/2 p, on volume of 10m,
after NatWest Securities met with the company on Monday evening.
Analysts at NatWest have been cautious on the stock but one said: 'It was a
good and encouraging presentation with the company confident about the
trading outlook.' NatWest said it was reviewing its current profits forecast
of Pounds 270m, 'with a view to raising it.'
Vehicle distributor Euro Motor Holdings eased 2 to 119p, after a 2 for 5
placing and open offer was carried out by its broker Charterhouse Tilney. An
upbeat annual meeting presentation by metals group Johnson Matthey, lifted
the shares 21 to 535p.

FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television stocks resisted the weak market trend after one securities house
pointed out the benefits implied by their leveraged exposure to advertising
growth. Carlton Communications was firm at at 858p and Scottish resilient at
399p.
Hoare media specialist Mr Robert Joliffe said Carlton had a third of the
Pounds 1600m independent television advertising revenue and 90 per cent of
any upturn would go straight to the bottom line. The advertising association
has recently increased forecasts for this year's spending growth from 10 per
cent to 13 per cent.
Hoare also believes that big one-off accounts for the National Lottery and
Channel Tunnel could boost Carlton's forecast profits of around Pounds 175m
by a further Pounds 10m.

FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance brokers suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The insurance broking sector came under substantial pressure and provided
the market's heaviest traded stock in Willis Corroon as well as one of the
day's keenest sell stories in Sedgwick.
It was Willis Corroon, the UK market's second biggest insurance broker, that
caught the eye late in the session when a block of 8.6m shares, roughly 2
per cent of the company's issued capital was sold into the market and
subsequently placed around the 130p level. Willis shares closed a net 5
lower at 137p. The stake sale and other trades took turnover in the stock up
to 22m, the highest single day's activity for almost four years.
Insurance broking specialists said the shares had been among the market's
worst performers since the company caused acute disappointment in the market
by announcing poor first quarter results. Since those figures Willis shares
have dropped from 239p to yesterday's closing level. Willis' interim figures
are expected next month.
Sedgwick, the biggest insurance broker in the UK, also came under pressure,
the shares sliding 7 to 164p as Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker,
reduced its profits and dividend estimates for the group.
The broker focused on a host of minus points affecting the group, notably
concerns about soft US market renewals for July, difficulties in the
wholesale and commercial lines business in London, worries about expense
controls and employee benefit business and the slide in the dollar, although
CLL said Sedgwick had hedged most of its dollar exposure for the current
year.
CLL cut its end-1995 profits estimate from Pounds 111m to Pounds 100m, and
reduced its dividend estimate from 7p to 6.8p.

<TEXT>
A clumsily-executed sell order combined with a slide in US markets
undermined stock index futures pulling the near month Footsie contract
lower, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,006. A firm
rally appeared to be on the way when early buyers quickly pushed September
to 3,010. But this turned out to be the high of the day. A mid-morning US
seller of around a 1000 lots triggered a wave of selling activity reversing
September's earlier gains.
It fell to a low of 2,945 over lunch before the announcement of US producer
prices data brought about an adavance in US bonds. Dealers in London used
this as an opportunity for bargain hunting, helping the contract reduce
earlier losses.
However ,the renewed buying proved short lived and the slide in US bonds
once again saw sellers gain the upper hand
It closed at 2,970, down 27 on its previous finish and 3 above its fair
value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume at 19,972 was healthy.
Traded options were also busy and volume jumped to 46,986 lots of which
22,037 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,930 in the Euro-FT-SE option.
British Steel was the busiest stock option following a 'roll over' trade. It
saw business of 6,432 lots.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation data fails to
lift US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After good news on inflation had failed to lift stock market sentiment
during the morning, a rebound in bond prices and a modest rally in the
dollar helped share prices end flat-to-firmer yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.33 at 3,702.66,
well above its low for the day of 3,672.24. The more broadly-based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.11 at 447.95, while the American Stock Exchange
composite finished up 0.73 at 425.50 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.76 at
709.59. Trading volume was 252m shares.
Stock prices inched higher at the opening, encouraged by early gains in
bonds which were sparked by reassuring news on inflation. The Labor
department had reported that the producer prices index had remained flat
during June, and that 'core' producer prices - the index excluding the
volatile food and energy components - had actually fallen by 0.1 per cent.
The figures were better than economists had been expecting, and provided an
early boost to bond prices. At one stage, the benchmark 30-year bond was up
three quarters of a point. Those early gains were wiped out later in the
day, as bonds retreated in the wake of another big drop in the dollar, which
fell to a new post-1945 low against the yen of Y96.50. At one point, the Dow
was more than 20 points lower, as investors feared that the losses in the
dollar might push the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again to
support the ailing currency.
The sell-off in bonds, however, did not last long. Thanks to a modest rally
in the dollar, which moved up to Y97.43 in late trading, and a
weaker-than-expected report on retail sales from the Johnson Redbook
service, the 30-year bond rebounded more than three quarters of a point from
its lows. Stocks quickly followed suit, although blue-chip issues struggled
to move into positive territory, primarily because in the past week
blue-chips have outperformed other sectors of the market.
Among individual stocks, Motorola jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 50 1/4 as
investors responded positively to Monday night's news that the company had
earned 63 cents a share, up from a comparable 40 cents a share a year ago,
and that semiconductor sales rose 23 per cent in the April-to-June period.
Goodyear fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 in volume of 1.8m shares after the
company's chairman, Mr Stanley Gault, said in a television interview that
Goodyear's earnings in the second quarter would come in between Dollars 158m
and Dollars 164m. Although that would represent a record quarter for the
company, investors were disappointed because industry analysts had been
looking for slightly better results.
Philip Morris dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 in heavy trading after
the tobacco and foods group announced second quarter earnings of Dollars
1.2bn. Although that was up from Dollars 1.05bn a year earlier, the results
from the food operations were disappointing and a large part of the growth
in sales volume was due to adjustments in inventory levels.
Diagnostek rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/2 after being awarded a
contract from the defence department which could generate Dollars 100m in
annual revenues.
Canada
Toronto prices closed with a solid gain in moderate trading. The TSE-300
composite index gained 27.78 points, or 0.68 per cent, to close at 4,131.72.
Winning issues led losers by 377 to 327.
Activity continued at a relatively modest pace, with 43.91m shares changing
hands valued at CDollars 567m compared with 42.06m worth CDollars 515m on
Monday.
The industrial products sector led today's advance with a 1.87 per cent
index gain. In all, 12 of the 14 sub-groups were higher. Among the other key
groups, mining and energy were higher, financial services was up modestly,
while consumer products was little changed and golds fell somewhat.
Alcan Aluminium was up  1/4 to 33  3/8 in active trading after reporting its
first quarterly profit in nearly three years. Second-quarter net was Dollars
7m.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Sao Paulo down 2.27%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo fell sharply in the last half hour of trade to end off
2.27 per cent on speculative selling, correcting slightly from a 13 per cent
rise posted since the July 1 introduction of the new real currency.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended down 911 at 39,198
points.
A major market player bid Telebras TEL. SA preferred at 42.70 reais just
half an hour before the close. But it closed at 41.40 reais, off 1.6 per
cent.
'We noticed a lot of speculators selling stocks in late trade after the
market pared its morning losses,' one broker said. 'That's the best
explanation, because domestic political and economic news were all bullish
today.'
Brokers also said they were upbeat after the central bank trimmed nominal
interest rates at its weekly bond auction to around 8.090 per cent a month.
Mexico
Mexican equities shares closed down as investors kept to the sidelines on
nervousness ahead of the August 21 presidential election, traders said. The
IPC index of 37 top shares retreated 3.72 points, a fall of 0.16 per cent,
at 2,288.28.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Roche puts pressure on Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich came under renewed pressure as Roche tumbled 5 per cent in reply to
lower than expected first half sales growth. The SMI index, marginally ahead
early in the day, finished 54.5, or 2.1 per cent lower, at 2,508.0.
Roche certificates fell SFr300 to SFr5,700 after the group said that first
half sales increased by 7.3 per cent in local currency terms, but only by
2.4 per cent in Swiss francs, due to the strength of the currency,
particularly against the dollar. The market had expected a 10-12 per cent
rise in local currencies, or 5-6 per cent in Swiss francs.
In London, Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley, which cut Switzerland to
an underweight position in its model portfolio, commented that the market
was relatively expensive and earnings growth looked below average.
Mr Davidson said that the franc's sharp rise against the D-mark had made
Swiss industry less competitive, and that the situation was unlikely to
change this year. 'Our analysts', he said, 'find few Swiss companies more
attractive than their peers in Europe, with the exception of BBC and,
perhaps, Nestle.'
The reduction in Swiss weighting was effected by halving the double
weighting of Ciba. Goldman Sachs, however, commented yesterday that Ciba's
valuation had sound support: it retained its market outperformer rating for
the near term and market performer rating long term.

Firmer gold shares came back from their highs on disappointment that the
bullion price had failed to make further headway, while industrials lost a
little ground.
The overall index picked up 35 to 5,454, industrials eased 5 to 6,254 and
golds were 35 ahead at 2,111.
Gencor rose 50 cents or 4.4 per cent to R11.85 ahead of an expected

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's modest decline
as yen rise goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's renewed rise against the dollar pushed share prices lower, but
declines were smaller than most investors expected, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
There were reports that public investment funds were buying equities to trim
inflated cash positions as the Nikkei 225 average recovered from a morning
low of 20,294.06 to close off 72.61 at 20,400.48, down for the fifth
consecutive session but after a peak of 20,419.48 during the last 20
minutes.
In New York, on Monday, the dollar had fallen to the Y96 level. This
prompted new worries in Tokyo over the effect on Japan's exporters, and on
the economy which has started to show the first signs of recovery; in Tokyo
the dollar finally closed Y1.48 lower at Y97.07, in spite of dollar buying
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
Market participants were reluctant to select a level to which the yen would
rise. 'We have a real dollar crisis on our hands and it all depends on how
much the Federal Reserve Bank is going to take,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, an
economist at Baring Securities.
He added that an easing of the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan
to support the dollar would be unlikely until data revealing a worsening of
the Japanese economy was released.
Volume rose from 210m to 303m shares. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 9.01 to 1,647.15 while the Nikkei 300 fell 1.27 to 299.47.
Losers outnumbered gainers by 764 to 228 with 174 unchanged and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.64 to 1,331.77.
High-technology exporters were hit by the yen's rise. Hitachi lost Y10 to
Y1,020 while Toshiba declined Y12 to Y789. Sony fell Y80 to Y5,920 and TDK
plunged Y110 to Y4,530.
Car stocks were also weak, with Nissan Motor down Y15 to Y805 and Honda
Motor retreating Y30 to Y1,730. Large capital stocks lost ground, with
Kawasaki Steel falling Y5 to Y395.
Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, jumped Y50 to Y1,200. The
company announced that it had discovered a second oil field off the coast of
Vietnam, encouraging buying orders. The stock's trading volume amounted for
13 per cent of the first section's activity.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 107.50 to 22,911.15 in volume of 21.8m
shares. The OSE average declined for the fifth consecutive day on a decline
in export oriented stocks.
Roundup
The region saw a mix of performances yesterday.
HONG KONG bounced 2.3 per cent higher in a technical rebound following the
recent sell-off. The Hang Seng index finished up 196.51 at 8,591.45 in
turnover that improved to a provisional HKDollars 2.47bn from Monday's final
HKDollars 1.82bn.
Property issues, worst hit in the recent downturn, were among the day's best
performers. Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai Properties each rose by HKDollars
1.40, to HKDollars 32.20 and HKDollars 44.50 respectively. Hongkong Land
gained 50 cents to HKDollars 18.50.
SYDNEY was lifted during the afternoon session by favourable results from
Advance Bank, up 33 cents at ADollars 9.58, which reported a rise in
earnings for the year ending May 31 of 81 per cent. The bank also announced
that it was raising the dividend to 50 cents from the previous year's 30
cents.
This helped the All Ordinaries index to a gain of 11.7 at 1,972.9, just
below an intraday high of 1,973.9. Turnover was Dollars 417m.
Among retail stocks the takeover target, Foodland, shed 9 cents to ADollars
4.65 after the Federal Court granted a temporary injunction against Rank
Commercial's Dollars 501m bid. Coles Myer, which would have acquired
Foodland's Australian assets under the bid, closed 3 cents firmer at
ADollars 4.23.
SEOUL saw an across-the-board rebound following Monday's falls stemming from
the death of the North Korean president, Kim Il-sung. The composite stock
index added 11.75 to 960.59. Real estate and property issues spearheaded the
rises. Pangrim Spinning went limit up, adding Won2,000 to Won68,600.
SINGAPORE was firmer, led by bargain hunting in selected shipyard and
property stocks while speculators bought shares and warrants of Yeo Hiap
Seng on expectations of a takeover by Ng Teng Fong, the property tycoon.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.10 to 2,159.35 as YHS shares rose
20 cents to SDollars 3.74.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed as volume shrank to 66m shares, one of its lowest
levels this year, as investors shied away from a market lacking direction
and foreign interest.
The composite index gave up 3.26 to 985.62, dragged down by a 50 cent drop
in Telecom Malaysia to MDollars 18.80.
Tenaga Nasional fell 10 cents to MDollars 13.20, remaining under pressure
from foreign funds switching out of the stock.
MANILA was dragged down by a fall in the heavily-weighted stock, PLDT, which
lost more than 2 per cent to a year's low of 1,425 pesos.
The composite index shed 10.43 to 2,533.32.
Turnover rose to 745.02m pesos from 670.9m.
BOMBAY rose on selective buying of the country's biggest mutual fund, the
the Unit Trust of India. The BSE 30-share index ended up 54.62 or 1.3 per
cent at 4,134.79.
BANGKOK moved in a tight range with the SET index improving just 1.69 to
1,280.06 as turnover moderated to Bt4.5bn. Brokers commented that many
investors remained absent from the market following a no confidence vote in
parliament against four government ministers.
WELLINGTON reversed a nine-day losing streak, with the NZSE-40 capital index
closing up 9.28 at 1,954.79 in low turnover of NZDollars 22.7m.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses react to weakness in
the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday Mr Sushil Wadhwani, global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in
London, said that, if the dollar were to go into a free fall, global
equities should underperform bonds with European equities perhaps the most
vulnerable.
The dollar fell again yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff; and, in Europe,
equities mostly underperformed bonds in a big way. However, said Mr
Wadhwani, bond markets were assuming that a strong D-Mark would encourage
the Bundesbank to cut key interest rates, and in this they could be
disappointed.
FRANKFURT saw the dollar fall to DM1.5308, and the September bund future
rise strongly as the DAX index fell 17.61 to 2,048.05 in turnover up from
DM4.6bn to DM6.4bn.
'The dollar decline has really started to hurt,' said Mr Jens Wiecking at
Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The current rate compared with a range of around
DM1.70 to DM1.80 at the beginning of this year, on which German companies
priced their contracts.
Accordingly, he said, it was big exporters, or raw material suppliers with
their contracts expressed in dollar terms which were most severely hit. The
trucks company, MAN, fell DM11.50 to DM408, and Degussa and
Metallgesellschaft in raw materials dropped DM15 to DM460, and DM4.40 to
DM196.80 respectively.
PARIS reflected the fact that the market would be closed tomorrow and
Friday. The CAC-40 index lost 7.67 to 1,942.08 in turnover estimated at just
under FFr3bn.
Both Daiwa Europe and James Capel issued overweight recommendations on the
French equity market. Daiwa noted that investors had been unsettled by the
recent number of alleged corruption scandals, but commented that it did not
expect the downside to be as great as had been experienced recently in
Italy. Forecasting a sharp increase in corporate earnings this year Daiwa
expected a rise in CAC-40 earnings per share of nearly 50 per cent.
James Capel agreed that the corruption scandals could depress the market and
noted that the financial sector in particular was vulnerable to a downward
revision of earnings. However, it said, France had now underperformed
Germany for five consecutive quarters - the longest period since the early
1980s - and most of the risks to market performance had already been
discounted.
MILAN was lower in largely technical trade ahead of today's expiry of
options and the close of the July trading account on Friday. The Comit index
fell 6.25 to 678.10 as investors hoped that today's cabinet meeting might at
last bring clues on the government's plans to tackle the budget deficit.
Mr Enrico Ponzone at Kleinwort Benson commented that the sudden
deterioration of the budget deficit forecasts had exacerbated an already
tense situation. Instead of acting to regain the market's confidence, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, had focused on issues of power rather
than substance. 'In the face of this failure to deliver we are adopting a
more cautious stance but believe that ultimately the government will have
little choice but to follow its predecessor's stringent economic policies.'
Generali fell L309 to L39,891: one large foreign sell order placed at the
start of business helped depress the mood.
Ina lost L25 at L2,375, falling below its L2,400 placing price for the first
time since its launch on July 6.
AMSTERDAM followed the dollar lower and the AEX index closed off 1 per cent
in low turnover, down 4.03 at 383.21. The big multinationals with dollar
exposure bore the burden of the day's activity on the currency exchanges:
Royal Dutch slipped Fl 3.70 to Fl 185.30 and Unilever Fl 2.80 to Fl 181.70.
BolsWessanen, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 36.90, announced that it was in co-operation
talks with Campari of Italy, while Heineken, helped by the summer weather,
went against the trend with a rise of 30 cents to Fl 213.30.
MADRID was minded to follow its bond market but it closed off its best on
profit taking after falls on Wall Street and in other European bourses. The
general index, however, still ended 2.68 higher at 298.72 in turnover of
Pta28.4bn.
WARSAW climbed for the sixth consecutive session as investors became
convinced that the bearish trend of the last few months was over. The Wig
index rose 648.2, or 6.75 per cent to 10,258.2.
TEL AVIV, too, registered its sixth consecutive gain following last week's
1994 low, the Mishtanim index recovering another 4.14, or 2.45 per cent to
172.82.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar decline continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its relentless decline on foreign exchanges yesterday
as hopes dimmed of the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates, writes
Philip Gawith.
June producer price inflation was much more subdued than the market had
expected, and this dampened hopes of tighter monetary policy which might
have helped the dollar.
The dollar closed at new lows in London against the yen and the D-Mark,
finishing at DM1.5235 from DM1.54, and Y96.8050 from Y97.365.
After fairly quiet European trading, the US currency started to slide when
US markets opened. The PPI data were followed by comments from Mr Theo
Waigel, the German finance minister, which appeared to underline the resolve
of Group of Seven nations not to be drawn into a defence of the dollar.
The weakness of the dollar continued to exert a downward drag on sterling
which fell to its lowest level against the D-Mark since shortly after
Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK
currency closed in London more than a pfennig lower at DM2.3958 from
DM2.4081 on Monday.
Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5725 from Dollars 1.5638. The
sterling index fell to 78.8 from 79.
In Europe the D-Mark gave up some of its recent gains, finishing slightly
lower against the Belgian and French francs, the Italian lira and the
Swedish krona.
Despite the continuing decline of the dollar, analysts said there had been
no sign of central bank intervention. The impression that politicians intend
standing back was bolstered by Mr Waigel's comments after meeting Mr
Clinton.
'The economic fundamentals are in order in the US. The agreement by the
finance ministers (leaving the level of the dollar to the market) was the
correct way. The US has inflation under control and good growth. These are
convincing signs for a stable dollar,' he told reporters.
These assurances were ignored in the market. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist at Citibank in London, said there had been heavy selling of the
dollar by US funds - including hedge funds and institutional investors - who
had previously been very bullish about the dollar. He said it was only since
Friday that these funds had been seen in the market.
With the dollar having fallen by twelve pfennigs over the last month - half
of the fall coming since Friday - Mr MacKinnon said that his forecasts,
which have been in the bear camp, had been telescoped. He said a revisiting
of the all time low against the D-Mark of DM1.38, which he had forecast as a
medium term event, was now 'within hailing distance'.
Most analysts are expecting the dollar to decline further. Mr Mark Oliver,
spot trading manager at Midland Global Markets, comments: 'The problem for
the dollar is that once the market feels a trend is there, there is very
little that can stop it unless it gets overbought or oversold.'
Mr Oliver believes that many customers have failed to follow the downward
movement of prices and are still sitting on long dollar positions. Only when
the market has got short of dollars can a rebound of any duration be
predicted.
Sterling's weakness was further evidence of the currency's close ties to the
dollar. Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said a study of
Pounds /DM movements over the past six months showed that 95 per cent of
them could be explained by movements in the Dollars /DM rate.
'Sterling has not really got an independent life of its own,' said Mr
Norfield. The UK currency tends to fall by a ratio of 1:2 compared to the US
currency. With few immediate reasons for independent sterling strength, Mr
Norfield said the currency was likely to remain under pressure.
Analysts cautioned against alarmist conclusions, saying the currency would
have to fall a lot further before panic measures were resorted to.
On its effective index, sterling has traded for most of the last 18 months
in the 79-82 range, with a brief spike down to 76 in February 1993, and a
brief run up to 83 in January this year.
The influx of US and Asian buying into European debt markets helped boost
the short end of the interest rate futures markets. The December short
sterling contract closed at 93.69 from 93.64, with 23,530 lots traded. Most
of the longer contracts chalked up double digit gains.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the picture was confusing.
Last week the fall in sterling had spilled over into selling of short
sterling contracts. This week the reverse occurred.
Euromark contracts traded heavily, with the December contract trading nearly
51,000 lots to close at 95.09 from 95.08.
German call money was unchanged at 4.95/5.05 per cent ahead of today's repo
allocation where the rate is expected to fall up to three basis points from
4.93 per cent.
In the UK the Bank of England provided money markets with Pounds 774m
liquidity after forecasting a Pounds 750m shortage.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Looking for common ground on EU
farm policy - Deborah Hargreaves finds a wide divergence of opinion among
growers in different member countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little common ground between a British farmer who wants to see an
end to most agricultural subsidies and a French producer whose Pounds 34,000
profits last year were almost wholly derived from European Union coffers.
The spread of opinion among EU farmers was highlighted at a recent open day
organised by Ciba Agriculture, the agro-chemicals company, to discuss Common
Agricultural Policy reforms.
Last year, Ciba set up a group of producers from five different EU countries
to meet annually for the next five years to discuss their different
approaches to CAP reform. Already it is becoming clear that the farmers are
altering the way they plan their businesses to fit in with the new regime
and the coming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. Uppermost in
their minds is the need to cut costs and diversify as well as manage their
set-aside land.
Mr Richard Beldam, the British member of the group, was the only farmer to
come out wholeheartedly in favour of abandoning subsidies. But that could
have been because he runs one of the most profitable and lowest cost farms.
His net margin on 1,423 hectares in Gloucestershire this year is projected
at Pounds 491 a hectare. This compares with Mr Jim McCarthy, a producer on
405 hectares in Ireland, where poor weather conditions and high costs are
keeping his net margin at Pounds 150 a hectare this year.
Mr McCarthy, from County Kildare, has been the most immediately affected by
changes to the CAP. The owner of the farm he managed decided to retire from
farming by taking up an offer from the Irish government of a pension for
former producers and Mr McCarthy has now set himself up as a self-employed
farmer leasing 200 hectares from his previous employer and 200 hectares from
nine other landowners.
By renting more land, he has expanded the size of his farm from 294
hectares; but he has had to increase his debts to do so. He is conscious of
the need to continue subsidies, particularly for smaller producers. 'We've
got a lot of small farmers,' he points out, 'and if you stopped subsidies
there would be a lot of hurt and the countryside would be derelict'.
The reduction in aid payments has led some of the farmers to set up
ancillary businesses on their land as a way of increasing profits. Mr
McCarthy is stepping up his sales of straw, which he has traditionally
supplied to nearby racing stables - he is now delivering straw to local
mushroom growers.
Mr Beldam also plans to make more of his straw. He has joined a group of
producers and Southern Electric, the local power utility, in a project to
build a 20MW straw-burning power plant near his farm.
He has also increased the capacity of his grain-driers so that he can dry
crops under contract to other producers. He has contacted Cargill, the
agri-business company, in the hope of growing oilseed rape on his land for
the company's planned biodiesel production plant.
Mr Francis Ringo with a 150-hectare farm 100km from Calais in northern
France, already grows crops for biofuels on his entire portion of set-aside
land. He plants rape for di-ester (a petrol additive) and wheat and sugar
beet for ethanol. The market for biofuels has become well established in
France on the back of government subsidies.
Mr Ringo has tried this year to reduce his costs by reining in his use of
agro-chemicals and fertilisers. This cutback has enabled him to trim his
input costs from the equivalent of Pounds 319 a hectare last year to Pounds
187 this year.
'In the past, we were influenced by the drive for intensive cultivation, but
we were using too many inputs - since we cut them our yields have not
changed,' said Mr Ringo.
Almost all of the farmers in the group were looking to cut down on their use
of expensive chemicals and fertilisers. Mr Reinhard Funk, a producer on 120
hectares in Germany between Stuttgart and Lake Konstanz, can claim an
additional DM200 (Pounds 83) a hectare payment from the Baden Wurttemburg
state government if he does not spray his wheat with a regulator to restrict
growth and stop it being knocked over by rain.
Mr Funk is facing a dilemma common to many of Germany's producers as he
believes his farm will not afford him a full-time living over the long term.
He is planning to set himself up as an agricultural surveyor providing
services for his neighbours as a way of supplementing his income.
Almost half of Germany's 650,000 producers are now part-time farmers with
average holdings of 20 hectares. But in the former East Germany, farms are
huge and producers' views diverge widely from their western German
counterparts.
Mr Udo Bohme manages a 5,300-hectare holding near Leipzig. He has 150
workers on the farm and spends DM2m a year on machinery. As well as wheat,
barley, rye and maize, Mr Bohme has 2,500 dairy cattle, and 5,000 pigs.
Even with a holding of this size Mr Bohme has been cutting costs and
increasing his farmed area. He has reduced the number of workers from 230 in
1992 and added another 400 hectares - leased from 400 separate landowners.
Mr Ted Kallehave who farms near Copenhagen in Denmark, has added 300
hectares to his existing 500 hectares. He has also tried to grow as wide a
spread of crops as possible so as to reduce the farm's dependence on any
single crop. In addition, he has rented out some of his land for hunting and
grows Christmas trees on 182 hectares.
A common theme among the farmers was the need to diversify and get bigger.
Mr Beldam who farms most of his land on a profit-sharing basis with
landowners, hopes to expand his business to 3,000 hectares in the next two
years and eventually would like to manage 10,000 hectares.
Mr Beldam favours a rapid cut-off in agricultural aid combined with some
social support to eliminate the worst problems. 'I think most of us would
survive in Europe - the free market would tell us what to grow,' he said.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP's Chilean copper mine set
to become world's biggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another expansion of the Escondida copper mine in Chile is almost certain to
go ahead to boost its annual output to 800,000 tonnes of the metal a year.
This would put it ahead of Chuquicamata, also in Chile, as the world's
biggest copper mine and make Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest
company, which entered the copper business only five years ago, the world's
major producer of traded copper.
Mr John Prescott, chairman of BHP, says he has 'a high degree of confidence'
that the Escondida partners will give the go-ahead for the expansion within
the next few weeks.
The mine, jointly owned by BHP (57.5 per cent), the RTZ Corporation of the
UK (30 per cent), JECO, a consortium of Japanese smelters (10 per cent) and
the International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent), is still in the throes
of a second-stage expansion, from 320,000 to 480,000 tonnes, scheduled to be
completed by September.
The third-stage expansion would be completed in two years and analysts
suggest the capital investment required would be minimal compared with the
profits generated.
Mr Prescott brushes aside suggestions that Escondida will be contributing to
a glut of copper concentrate (an intermediate material) that will depress
the metal's price at the end of the 1990s. He says Escondida talked to all
its customers before considering the next expansion phase and 'we seem to be
getting a commitment (from them to take) the tonnage we intend to produce'.
In view of this commitment by customers, BHP feels under no pressure to
build its own copper smelter in Chile.
BHP's small Island copper mine in Vancouver, Canada, will run out of ore in
1995-96 and the company has no expansion plans for Ok Tedi, the mine in
Papua New Guinea, in which it had boosted its shareholding recently to a
controlling interest. However, it bid unsuccessfully for the El Abra copper
deposit in Chile and, according to Mr Prescott, 'we are looking at every
opportunity (in copper) that comes up'.
Mr Prescott, in London to talk to customers and investors, says BHP's move
to spread its operations into high-value minerals such as platinum and
diamonds is going smoothly. He expects the Zimbabwe government to give final
approval soon for the Hartley platinum project, which has an initial planned
production rate of 150,000 ounces of platinum and 110,000 ounces of
palladium from mid-1996. BHP's partner is Delta Gold, another Australian
company.
A proposal to link all the platinum operations on the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe
 -where RTZ and the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa also have
projects - has been shelved, however. 'Our mine will be developed,' Mr
Prescott insists. 'It makes sense on its own. It might make more sense if it
was all put together as a joint venture. But it was an idea that did not get
mutual support.'
Although it now looks increasingly likely that BHP may start mining diamonds
in Canada's North West Territories, BHP has still to decide how the gem
rough (uncut) diamonds will be marketed. About 80 per cent of world trade in
such diamonds is controlled by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation but
Canadian companies are forbidden to join cartels. Mr Prescott says: 'We
won't be going into the diamond business without understanding how we will
market them. We have to recognise the (unfavourable) attitude to the CSO in
various parts of the world if we want to deal with them or they want to deal
with us. That is something we will have to address.'
Mr Prescott admits that cuts in contract prices for iron ore, manganese and
coal recently agreed with Japanese customers will have a substantial impact
on BHP's profit but it is working to overcome this.
He says: 'We are a low-cost producer, especially of coal and manganese, and
we can only maintain that position if we continue to invest. I am certainly
concerned about recent trends in long-term prices. But the Japanese are our
most important customers and they must be treated as our most important
customers.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Chinese sales hit copper - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persistent Chinese selling of COPPER gradually undermined market sentiment
at the London Metal Exchange and sent prices lower late yesterday. The three
months delivery price, which had earlier reached Dollars 2,454 a tonne,
closed at Dollars 2,449.50, up Dollars 5 on balance.
'This is a poor close, although the Chinese were looking to buy just under
the market,' one trader commented.
Three months ALUMINIUM came under liquidation pressure when it became
apparent it was not going to hold above the Dollars 1,550 resistance level
that was briefly breached in the morning.
At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures reversed early
losses after see-sawing wildly on thin volume as the market awaited fresh
news on the Brazilian frost damage. The September position closed at Dollars
3,898 a tonne, up Dollars 58.
'Trade and fund buying this afternoon on thin volume caught the market by
surprise and the sellers backed off,' one trader explained.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead likely for Canadian
diamond mine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner have given the clearest indications
yet that they are set to go ahead with construction of North America's first
diamond mine in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
Announcing another round of encouraging drilling results, BHP and Dia-Met
Minerals said that they planned to expand the airstrip at the remote site
300km north-east of Yellow-knife. About 170 people are already working at
the site.
BHP is also assembling data for environmental impact studies, and holding
talks with local communities to address their concerns about mining
development.
The partners are not scheduled to make a final decision on a mine until the
end of this year. But Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in
Toronto, predicted that, based on the latest results, BHP and Dia-Met will
initially develop two high-grade kimberlite pipes, known as Koala and Panda.
The latest sample from Koala, weighing 1,193 tonnes, yielded 6,600 diamonds
with a total weight of 893 carats. The average grade was 0.75 carats a
tonne. The Panda pipe, which is almost adjacent to Koala, yielded a total of
270 carats from 230 tonnes of ore, giving an average grade of 1.18 carats a
tonne.
BHP and Dia-Met also announced the first results from two other pipes,
Misery and Falcon. The Misery deposit, which is 44km from Koala, produced a
grade of 0.75 carats a tonne from a sample of 132 tonnes. These results
included one 4.2 carat stone 'of very significant value'.
The partners were expected to disclose further details of their plans at
Dia-Met's annual meeting yesterday at its head office in Kelowna, British
Columbia.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Further dollar weakness helps European
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets moved further ahead yesterday, as the more
positive tone of recent days continued.
Markets were bolstered by investors continuing to switch out of US bonds
into European bonds, due to further dollar weakness. The higher-yielding
markets, such as the UK and Italy, performed particularly well.
German government bonds rose sharply in early trading amid growing
confidence about the prospects for low German inflation and expectations
that the US will not act to support the dollar by raising short-term
interest rates.
The market fell back slightly in later, volatile trading but retained its
positive tone, finding firm support at lower levels.
Analysts reported buying by retail investors and fund managers, with money
being switched from the short end to the long end of the yield curve, and
some cash activity among small domestic buyers.
'There is the feeling that we have seen the lows for the year,' said Mr
Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt.
'The economic fundamentals are good and the strong D-Mark is encouraging to
a low-inflation background.'
Attention is now on next Wednesday's auction by the Bundesbank of 10-year
government bonds. This will test market sentiment after recent auctions were
cancelled due to lack of demand.
The September bund contract on Liffe was up 0.46 points at 93.78 in late
trading.
Although sterling weakened further against the D-Mark, UK gilts outperformed
their German counterparts, ending about  3/4 points higher. Profit-taking in
the afternoon pushed prices off their highs, but traders said this did not
dent the market's overall positive mood.
'I am a bit more hopeful, especially because gilts have been going up at a
smooth and steady pace,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC
Greenwell.
Traders were also squaring their positions ahead of today's average earnings
and inflation data. Most are looking for an unchanged average earnings rate
of 3 3/4 per cent, and the retail prices index at 2.7 per cent year on year
and 2.6 per cent excluding mortgages.
After lagging most of Europe on Monday, Italian bonds yesterday posted the
biggest gains in Europe. The September BTP futures contract on Liffe jumped
by 1.70 points to 105.00.
Most of the gains were futures-driven, with retail investors preferring to
stay sidelined until the government publishes its medium-term budget plans.
It is expected to announce the outline of its three-year fiscal plan today,
with the details likely to be published next Wednesday.
There was widespread optimism that the government will offer a solid budget
containing no tax give-aways. 'The market wants to see facts, and those are
increasingly pointing in the right direction,' said Mr Marco Pianelli, of
Nomura Research Institute.
After early dollar weakness had overshadowed good inflation news and pushed
US Treasury prices lower, the market rebounded yesterday afternoon aided by
a rally in the US currency and a weaker than expected retail sales report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 83
3/8 , yielding 7.681 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 5/8
, yielding 6.204 per cent.
Prices firmed at the opening after the Labor Department reported that
producer prices were flat in June, and that 'core' producer prices - a
measure excluding the volatile food and energy components - actually fell
0.1 per cent. Both figures were better than analysts had been expecting.
The early gains did not last long, however, as the market reacted to renewed
weakness in the dollar, which fell to a new post-1945 low against the yen of
Y96.50, and to DM1.516, the lowest level against the D-Mark since November
1992. Investors sold bonds because they feared that - good inflation news
notwithstanding - the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates.
Later in the day, however, the market rallied, buoyed by a modest rebound in
the dollar and a Johnson Redbook report of a decline in US store sales.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Finland's Dollars 1.5bn global issue
priced to attract US investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger tone to government bond markets yesterday helped provide a
marginally better backdrop for the launch of two global bond offerings,
totalling Dollars 3bn, for Freddie Mac, the US mortgage agency, and Finland.
However, the weakness of the dollar continued to dampen European and Asian
demand for dollar-denominated paper.
Finland's Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds was launched at an indicated
yield spread of 55 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury. Dealers said
that initial indications had suggested a spread of 50 basis points, but the
wider margin proved necessary in order to attract US investors.
Because of the weakness of the dollar, the deal had to be priced to sell to
US investors, dealers said. Normally, the bid for a European sovereign
borrower such as Finland would be stronger in Europe than the US.
'Our experience at the moment is that European investors will only come in
when they see an anchor bid in the US,' said one head of syndicate in
London. This means that in many cases new issues are being priced more
generously than secondary market levels would indicate.
Freddie Mac's debut global offering, launched after several weeks of
investor roadshows, benefited from having a five-year rather than a 10-year
maturity, which allowed the deal to draw in European retail investors. The
deal will be priced today at an indicated spread of 16 to 18 basis points
over the five-year Treasury yield.
In the floating-rate note sector, Italy's three tranches of notes in
dollars, yen and D-Marks were all priced yesterday in the middle of the
ranges indicated (12 basis points over Libor for the dollar tranche, nine
basis points for the yen tranche and 13 for the D-Mark tranche). In spite of
its more generous pricing, dealers said the D-Mark segment was struggling
somewhat.
In the sterling domestic market, Kilroot Electric, guaranteed by Kilroot
Power, a Northern Irish power station, launched a Pounds 198.5m issue of
bonds via BZW and Salomon Brothers.
The deal is the first limited recourse financing of a power station in
Europe through a bond issue. However, in the wake of privatisation, many
power projects are now approaching a stage of maturity where refinancing in
the bond market may be attractive.
The proceeds will be used to repay existing bank debt. The issue has a
semi-annual coupon of 9.5 per cent and an average life of 16.4 years, due to
amortisation and a sinking fund. BZW said it was placed mainly with UK
pension funds and insurance companies.

<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is offering four new seats for full
brokers at a cost of Bt300m (Dollars 12m) a seat, giving sub-brokers until
the end of this month to apply.
The brokers should start trading by the end of this year. A further six are
to be admitted in 1995 and more will be allowed in thereafter.
At present the exchange has 40 full brokers, and sub-brokers have to deal
through them and share their commissions.
Leading sub-brokers contending for the new seats include Jardine Fleming
Thanakom (which is 43 per cent owned by Jardine Fleming), Ekachart Finance
and Securities (which has a research and trading agreement with James
Capel), Nithipat Capital, and Sitca Investment and Securities.
The SET said new brokers would pay a Bt200m fee, plus 10 per cent of their
monthly commissions for five years, up to a maximum of Bt100m.
According to Mr Seri Chintanaseri, the SET's president, the exchange may
revoke the licences of existing brokers if they fail to meet the criteria
set for new members.
Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, says the offer of more
licences is a way of liberalising the financial sector in preparation for
foreign competition. At present, foreign companies can hold only minority
stakes in Thai stockbrokers.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: European banks lift lending
share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European banks have sharply increased their share of international bank
lending, at the expense of US and Japanese competitors, according to the
latest survey by the Bank for International Settlements, covering the second
half of 1993.
The market share of European Union banks reached 45 per cent at the end of
1993, up from 40.6 per cent in 1990 and 34.8 per cent in 1985, while North
American banks have seen their share fall from 27.8 per cent at the end of
1985 to 14.7 per cent at the end of 1993.
Among EU banks, German banks have the largest market share, with 35 per
cent, followed by French and UK institutions with 22 per cent and 16 per
cent respectively.
The decline of North American banks reflects their retrenchment from
international markets, due to problem loans and the deterioration in their
credits, and a refocusing on domestic lending.
The BIS report also noted a shortening in the maturity profile of bank
loans. The proportion of loans up to and including one year, which has
increased almost continuously since 1989, breached the 50 per cent mark at
the end of 1992, and stood at a record of nearly 54 per cent at the end of
1993.
Cross-border claims were relatively static at Dollars 687bn, down slightly
from Dollars 689bn in 1992 but up on end-1991 levels. However, the pattern
of lending to developed and developing countries has shifted, with a rise of
Dollars 33bn in lending to developing countries since the end of 1991.
Lending to eastern Europe has fallen from Dollars 92.5bn at end-1992 to
Dollars 83.9bn.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alliant Techsystems in Dollars
465m defence purchase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Alliant Techsystems, a Minnesota-based defence company, has agreed to pay
Dollars 465m in cash and shares for the aerospace and defence business of
Hercules, a company whose interests also extend to food additives and
specialty chemicals.
The deal is intended to create a stronger combined business in the defence
and aerospace businesses, the two companies said, and echoes other mergers
which have followed recent cuts in the US defence budget.
Hercules Aerospace, which had sales of Dollars 660m and operating profits of
Dollars 105m in 1993, makes rocket motors for space exploration, weapons
systems and ordnance for the US army. Alliant, with sales of Dollars 775m
and operating profits of Dollars 39m in the year to March 31, makes
munitions and marine systems for the US and other countries.
Under the agreement, Alliant will pay Dollars 365m in cash and issue 3.5m
new shares to Hercules. Alliant's shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 yesterday to
Dollars 28 5/8 . Over time, the company said, it will buy back 3.5m of its
shares in the open market to counter the effects of the deal.
The transaction will leave Hercules with a 26 per cent interest in Alliant,
and two seats on its board.
According to Mr Toby Warson, Alliant's president and chief executive, a
significant attraction of the deal is the ability to combine the two
companies' propellant production activities.
Northrop Grumman has reached an agreement with Carlyle Group to acquire
Carlyle's 51 per cent stake in Vought Aircraft for Dollars 130m, taking
Northrop Grumman's ownership to 100 per cent. The agreement is subject to
completion of a definitive agreement and Rodino anti-trust review.

<TEXT>
International Paper achieved earnings of Dollars 87m or 70 cents a share in
the second quarter, up 13 per cent from Dollars 77m, or 62 cents a share, in
the same 1993 period.
The second quarter also showed improvement over this year's first quarter,
with rising paper and packaging prices boosting profits.
'This quarter's earnings performance reflect the pricing improvements
International Paper is now realising in most of our product lines,' Mr John
Georges, International Paper's chairman said.
'It also reflects the improving economy, both here and in Europe. We are now
seeing positive demand and pricing trends in essentially all of our product
lines, and we expect them to continue for the rest of the year,' he added.
Second-quarter sales rose to Dollars 3.6bn, from Dollars 3.5bn in the same
1993 quarter.
The company said price increases for containerboard, pulp and uncoated
printing papers had held through the quarter.
The printing papers division, the largest segment of International Paper's
business, had sales of Dollars 1.03bn in the quarter, up from Dollars 1.02bn
last year.
Packaging division revenues were Dollars 825m in the quarter, up from
Dollars 788m in the 1993 second quarter, while distribution sales also rose,
to Dollars 820m, from Dollars 775m a year ago.
Forest products sales rose to Dollars 445m, from Dollars 440m, although the
company said a weaker prices for forest products during the quarter led to
slightly lower earnings from that sector.

Gannett, the US publishing and broadcasting group, reported record after-tax
profits of Dollars 131.8m, or 90 cents a share, in the second quarter as its
newspaper advertising revenues climbed and operating costs remained level. A
year before, net income was Dollars 113.6m, or 78 cents a share.
Gannett, whose publications includes USA Today, earned advertising revenue
of Dollars 540m in the period, up from Dollars 513m, while income from
newspaper circulation edged up by Dollars 3m to Dollars 213m. Other sources
of revenue were broadly in line with the year before, while costs (excluding
interest payments) were flat at Dollars 736m.
The company, which publishes 83 newspapers across the US, attributed the
advance to gains in help-wanted advertising. The 13 per cent increase in
classified advertising sales contributed to a 5 per cent overall gain in
newspaper advertising revenues, it said.
Broadcasting revenues fell slightly, to Dollars 107m, reflecting the sale of
three radio stations, though profits climbed 29 per cent to Dollars 39m.
Profits from outdoor advertising, by contrast, slid 8 per cent to Dollars
8.2m as revenues fell 1 per cent to Dollars 63m
For the first half, net income of Dollars 210m or Dollars 1.43 a share was
up from Dollars 180m or Dollars 1.23 a share a year before.
Higher revenues in its information services business were behind a 16 per
cent rise in net income at Dow Jones in the second quarter.
The company, whose interests include the Wall Street Journal, said revenues
from information services, which include the Dow Jones/Telerate services,
rose 12 per cent to Dollars 239m.
The group reported net income of Dollars 46m, or 46 cents a share, for the
period, and Dollars 86m, or 86 cents a share, for the first half of 1994,
compared with Dollars 40m or 40 cents and Dollars 71m or 71 cents in the
same periods a year ago.

<TEXT>
Advance Bank, the regional Australian financial services group, has
announced an 81.5 per cent increase in net earnings in the year to May
following large reductions in bad debt and problem-loan provisions.
The bank has raised its annual dividend from 50 cents to 80 cents a share
after lifting earnings to ADollars 101.4m (USDollars 74.1m) from ADollars
55.9m on a 23 per cent rise in total loans and advances to ADollars 8.2bn.
Total bad debt write-offs fell almost 95 per cent to ADollars 2.1m and
non-performing loans carried on the bank's books were down 81 per cent to
ADollars 16.0m.
Mr Jim Service, the bank's chairman, said the result was achieved in spite
of pressure on margins.
He said the bank's total capital adequacy ratio eased from 11.75 to 11.54
per cent in the year.
The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 57.6m, compared with
ADollars 45.2m previously, and depreciation of ADollars 20.7m, compared with
ADollars 20.0m.
Net interest income rose 17 per cent from ADollars 282.7m to ADollars
331.4m. Parker &amp; Parsley, the US oil group, has taken control of Bridge Oil,
the Australian oil group, with its ADollars 378m takeover bid.
Acceptances to the bid, which closes today, yesterday gave Parker &amp; Parsley
more than 51 per cent of Bridge's shares. Woolworths, the Australian
retailer, lifted sales almost 9.5 per cent from ADollars 10.49bn to ADollars
11.48bn in the year to June.
The result exceeds prospectus forecasts issued when the company floated in
mid-1993.
Directors said the performance easily exceeded Australian retail sales
growth of around 5 per cent in the same period and they were confident the
company would achieve profit forecasts for the year.

Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, reported a 64 per cent
rise in net profits from Dollars 224m to Dollars 367m for the second
quarter, but said higher interest rates could slow the pace of growth in the
US market.
In April Motorola's shares lost about 10 per cent of their value when Wall
Street took fright at earnings growth that fell short of its expectations.
Analysts had ratcheted up their forecasts after being surprised by
higher-than-expected earnings in earlier quarters.
Turnover in the second quarter rose from Dollars 3.94bn to Dollars 5.44bn.
Net margin on sales was 6.7 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent a year
earlier and 6.6 per cent in the first quarter.
Fully diluted earnings per share, restated for a two-for-one share split in
April, rose from 40 cents a year earlier to 63 cents. Half-year earnings
rose from Dollars 428m to Dollars 665m.
In the general systems sector, sales rose by 75 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn
and orders rose 46 per cent. Semiconductor sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars
1.7bn and orders were up 17 per cent, Motorola said. Communications sales
rose 26 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn and orders rose 28 per cent.
Mr Gary Tooker, vice-chairman and chief executive, said US markets had been
doing very well, although interest rates could moderate the rate of growth.
European and Japanese markets were strengthening, and the company was
experiencing high rates of growth in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America
and emerging markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Raymond Theodoulou, the former chief executive of Standard Chartered
Securities, has been reprimanded by the Securities and Futures Commission
(SFC), Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, for failing to exercise proper
management of the company.
The SFC said yesterday that Mr Theodoulou had voluntarily surrendered his
dealer and investment adviser registrations and undertaken not to apply for
re-registration until the beginning of 1995.
Late last month, the SFC sternly criticised Standard Chartered for funding
illegal share support operations in Hong Kong at the time of initial public
offerings (IPOs) in which it or its merchant bank was adviser. It banned the
securities company from participating in IPOs until April next year.
In a statement yesterday, the SFC said Mr Theodoulou had failed to 'exercise
proper management, supervision and control' over the securities company.
In mitigation, however, the SFC said he did not join Standard Chartered
until April 1992 and was therefore chief executive for only the latter half
of the period covered by the SFC's investigation, which ran from July 1991
until March 1993.
The SFC admitted that the activities for which he was reprimanded were
already 'well established' at Standard Chartered and that Mr Theodoulou made
'a material contribution to the control and compliance environment' of the
securities company.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan's banks get tough on debt
 -Sumitomo Trust's acquiescence in a bankruptcy may suggest hardening
attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision last week by Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation to
acquiesce in the bankruptcy of one of its larger debtors raised a few
eyebrows in Japanese financial circles.
Having been in intensive care for the past three years, Nippon Mortgage Co
was allowed to go under with debts to Sumitomo Trust of more than Y120bn
(Dollars 1.2bn).
The liquidation raised questions about the condition of non-bank financial
institutions - companies like Nippon Mortgage which represent the weakest
link in the fragile financial system - but also about the larger banks'
strategy for dealing with the mountain of bad debts they hold.
Some analysts saw the readiness of Sumitomo Trust to agree to the
liquidation as further evidence of a more aggressive approach to the
writing-off of bad debts.
Mr Mark Faulkner, banking analyst at SG Warburg in Tokyo, said: 'Sumitomo
Trust's action suggests a new level of confidence, which is shared by other
banks, about the fundamental health of banking operations.'
The bank is likely to be able to meet the write-off by using only a small
proportion of its unrealised gains on equity holdings.
Sumitomo Trust's action was said to have filled the boardrooms of some
non-banks with alarm at the prospect of other large banks taking a similarly
aggressive approach to the bad debt problem.
But what are the prospects that banks will adopt such a stance towards their
non-bank debtors?
The main companies in difficulty are the housing loan (jusen) companies.
These were established in the 1970s by the large commercial banks for the
explicit purpose of residential mortgage lending, an area where the leading
banks faced restrictions on their activities.
For more than a decade the residential property sector was the jusen's main
market, but in the 1980s the rules were relaxed so that banks themselves
could take that business.
Casting around for a profitable market niche, the jusen hit upon the
commercial real estate market, at that time in the early stages of the 1980s
boom. With near abandon, they lent thousands of billions of yen, secured on
what was seen as a rock solid property market, for the next few years -
until the bubble burst at the end of the decade.
Since then it has been estimated that as a result of the lending spree, as
much as 60 per cent of the jusen total loan book may be non-performing.
All this would simply be another story of post-bubble collapse, if it were
not for the fact that the companies' primary source of funds was the main
commercial banks - already burdened with non-performing loans of their own.
The banks are therefore left with an estimated Y12,000bn in loans to the
jusen.
The main approach in dealing with the problem loans has been 'restructuring'
of the housing loan companies' debt. The ministry of finance - as ever,
anxious to avoid a large collapse - has orchestrated the strategy.
The current plan is aimed at spreading the burden among the leading banks.
Of the main lenders, the country's agricultural banks have the greatest
exposure to the non-banks - accounting for nearly half the total lending.
Though precise figures are sketchy, it appears that interest paid to them on
the debts of the housing loan companies has been cut to 4.5 per cent, while
other banks - notably trust banks, who have been particularly hard hit by
the non-banks' problems - are lending at 2.5 per cent or lower.
Some of the healthier banks would undoubtedly like simply to cut their
losses on these non-performing loans. But while they may be able to deal
with smaller debtors in this way, liquidating the jusen is unlikely to be
easy.
For one thing, while the finance ministry might be content to see the
isolated disappearance of a few finance companies like Nippon Mortgage, it
would surely balk at a domino-like collapse of non-banks.
Later this year, under ministry of finance guidance, banks will start to
establish special purchase companies to which they will be able to sell
their non-performing loans at a discount, partially removing them from the
balance sheet.
But more important, the banks themselves would find it difficult to turn off
the life support system of the jusen.
Nippon Mortgage was a special case, since its liabilities were heavily
weighted towards one bank - Sumitomo Trust. The jusen's liabilities are
spread across many of the commercial banks, and any decision to liquidate
would need to be taken in agreement with all the banks - notoriously hard to
achieve, since some banks are healthier than others and would be more
willing to act.
In any case, commercial logic does not dictate that the banks should bring
about the closure of more than a few small non-banks. Many of the non-banks,
though technically insolvent, are able to maintain positive cashflow, since
their interest payments to the banks are now so low.
As Mr David Threadgold, banking analyst at BZW in Tokyo, says: 'It is as
though the housing loan companies are brain dead, but on life support. Their
cashflow is such that they can continue operating for some time.'
Any decision by banks to turn off the machine would expose the balance-sheet
problems of the non-banks, and reveal the true scale of their bad debt
problem - something that they may not yet wish to do.

buy-out

<TEXT>
Hicks Muse, a Texas-based buy-out firm, is to lead a Dollars 850m
acquisition of Home Interiors and Gifts, a privately owned direct-sales
company, making it one of the biggest US buy-outs of the 1990s so far.
Home Interiors and Gifts, which has annual revenues of Dollars 850m, sells
decorative accessories and gifts through 42,000 independent sales agents.
The agents make sales from their homes, using techniques made famous by
Tupperware in the 1960s.
The deal will be backed by Dollars 400m of bank debt, Dollars 300m of junk
bonds and Dollars 150m of equity finance, according to Hicks Muse.
The company has still to receive a firm commitment for the bank debt, but is
in discussions with four institutions. The junk bond issue will be led by
Bear Stearns.
The high debt level would make the deal one of the most highly leveraged of
the decade.
While the equity portion in many 1980s buy-outs accounted for as little as
10 per cent of the total financing, it has made up between a quarter and a
third of many transactions since, reflecting a more cautious attitude on the
part of lenders.
Under the terms of the deal, Hicks Muse would acquire 51 per cent of Home
Interiors. The rest of the shares would be retained by members of the Carter
family, including the son and three grandchildren of the company's founder,
Ms Mary Crowley. The family owns a majority of the company's shares.
The total purchase price for Home Interiors is Dollars 1bn, although the
company has net cash of Dollars 150m. Hicks Muse said it planned to take the
company public, though no timetable has been set.
Hicks Muse's equity investment in Home Interiors is being made from a
Dollars 625m private equity fund raised last year. The deal, if completed,
will be the biggest yet initiated by Hicks Muse.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Forecast hits Goodyear shares

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Goodyear closed down at a 52-week low yesterday after the chairman
of the US tyre group forecast record second-quarter earnings of between
Dollars 158m and Dollars 164m, or between Dollars 1.05 and Dollars 1.09 a
share.
But the forecast results - which also represent a solid improvement on the
same quarter a year ago, when Goodyear earned Dollars 137.6m, or 95 cents a
share - were slightly lower than Wall Street had been expecting.
Industry analysts had forecast that Goodyear would report earnings of
between Dollars 1.10 and Dollars 1.15 a share in the quarter.
It was this disappointment which prompted some investors to sell Goodyear
shares yesterday. Earlier they had fallen as much as Dollars 2 to Dollars 34
3/4 but later rallied to close down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 35.
Mr Stanley Gault, Goodyear's chairman, outlined the company's expectations
for the second quarter in a television interview. He said sales in the
period would be just over Dollars 3bn, marginally higher than a year ago.
Excluding revenues from previously divested assets, however, April-to-June
sales should set a record.
Mr Gault also said that demand for Goodyear products in North America was
strong, with plants running at near full-capacity, and that Latin American
and Asian operations should report strong performances. But the European
market was soft.

The cost of a restructuring plan recently announced by CPC International,
the US food manufacturer, resulted in a net loss of Dollars 14.9m in the
second quarter, compared with net profits of Dollars 116.9m a year earlier.
Last month CPC said it would shed 2,600 jobs from its international
workforce of 39,000 during the next two years, as part of a plan to increase
efficiency by consolidating some of its manufacturing operations.
The company had warned that the restructuring would produce a pre-tax charge
of Dollars 227m to second-quarter profits, equivalent to Dollars 137m after
tax, and the shares closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 5/8 yesterday.
CPC, whose brands include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn
oil, said net income would have risen by 4.7 per cent to Dollars 122.4m
without the restructuring charge, and earnings per share from 76 cents to 81
cents.
The growth was driven by a 9.9 per cent increase in worldwide sales to
Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.69bn.
Part of this came from acquisitions, but CPC also suffered from the negative
effect of exchange rates on European currencies, which continued weak
against the dollar in the second quarter.
CPC said the European operations had resumed strong earnings growth in spite
of exchange rate weakness.
Asian volumes increased substantially, and Best Foods, its North American
operation, 'turned in an acceptable performance in a difficult environment'.
The second-quarter loss per share was 11 cents.
For the first half, net income fell from Dollars 207.3m to Dollars 83.2m
after the restructuring charge, and earnings per share dropped from Dollars
1.34 to 52 cents.

Alcan Aluminium of Canada yesterday reported its first quarterly net profit
since late 1991.
Net profit for the second quarter was USDollars 7m, or 1 cent a share after
preferred dividends, against a loss of Dollars 35m, or 18 cents a share, a
year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 2.07bn, up 11 per cent from a year earlier because of
higher volumes in fabricated products and higher ingot prices and shipments.
Canadian operations improved and the US posted a small profit with higher
can sheet sales. Latin America also made a small profit as it benefited from
the improved fabricated products business in Brazil.
Europe continued to strengthen, with better results from fabricated products
and alumina operations. Australia also recorded further improvement.
First-half revenues were up 7 per cent to Dollars 3.88bn, and the net loss
was Dollars 18m, or 12 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 55m, or 29
cents a share.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody dismisses senior
options trader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank which dismissed its top US bond
trader in April, accusing him of faking Dollars 350m in profit, faces
further embarrassment following the revelation that it has fired a senior
London options trader for allegedly concealing about Dollars 6m in losses.
Mr Peter Bryant, 34, a senior vice-president of the company's futures and
options operations in London, is alleged to have hidden losses, incurred
during recent bond market volatility, on trades of French and Spanish
government bond options. Mr Bryant denies the allegation.
Company officials said yesterday the concealment was discovered last month
during normal review procedures.
The sacking raises fresh questions about the effectiveness of the way the
company monitors the activities of its traders.
'The normal controls worked well,' said Mr Tony Zehnder, director of public
relations at Kidder Peabody in New York. He stressed that Mr Bryant's
dismissal was unrelated to the sacking in April of Mr Joseph Jett, the head
of Kidder's government bond trading desk in New York, for allegedly
conjuring up Dollars 350m of fictitious profits through his bond trading
activities to mask losses of as much as Dollars 100m.
Mr Jett has since hit back, suggesting senior Kidder executives were aware
of his trading strategy and saying he is being made a scapegoat. The case is
in arbitration.
Soon after firing Mr Jett, Kidder, a unit of General Electric, dismissed Mr
Neil Margolin, a trader on its interest rate swaps desk in New York, for
concealing about Dollars 10m in losses from derivatives trades.
As a result of Mr Bryant's alleged concealment, the company will make a
Dollars 10m write-down against pre-tax profits, of which Dollars 6m is
directly attributable to Mr Bryant's activities, it said. The remaining
Dollars 4m is due to a change in the way it prices its options positions.
The volatility in European bond markets, blamed for the losses, has led
Kidder to cut its options positions by about 35 per cent in the past week
alone. Officials said this year the company has cut its options portfolio to
about Dollars 3.3bn from more than Dollars 6bn.
Mr Bryant joined Kidder in 1986, from Lazard Freres. He was the company's
leading futures and options salesman in London for several years and earlier
this year was promoted to his position as senior vice-president.

was Dollars 18m, or 12 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 55m, or 29
cents a share.
Mr Jacques Bougie, president, said Alcan continued to be cautious for the
near term. The company was reaping benefits from its cost-reduction
programme, but prices for fabricated products were only beginning to reflect
recent gains in ingot.
He added that the large proportion of Alcan's fabricated product sales were
set on an annual basis, so the price improvement would be seen later this
year and early in 1995.
Total shipment of ingot and fabricated products were 1,386,000 tonnes in the
first half, against 1,218,000 tonnes last time. Fabricated volumes hit a
peak in the second quarter.
Alcan is selling off its remaining building products plants in North
America, for a price estimated by analysts to be more than Dollars 100m, and
will concentrate on its basic smelting and fabricating operations worldwide.

Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the diversified Swiss industrial group, has sold
its Lonza Graphites and Technologies unit to Mircal, a subsidiary of Immetal
of France. The price was not disclosed.
Alusuisse said the unit did not fit into its core chemicals businesses of
fine, speciality and polymer chemicals. Lonza Graphites, with a 1993
turnover of SFr57m (Dollars 44m) and gross earnings of SFr12m, makes
synthetic graphites and lubricants for high temperature applications.
Alusuisse is nearing completion of a radical restructuring programme
involving the sale of loss-making and non-core activities.
Lonza Graphites, which has two manufacturing plants in Switzerland, will be
integrated with the industrial minerals division of Immetal, another
diversified group with activities in building materials and metals
processing.
Last year Immetal recorded gross profits of SFr75m on turnover of SFr1.6bn.

Docunet, a California-based company developing a system for electronic
distribution of travel and other documents, has linked with Olivetti, the
Italian computer group, and three other partners to build a network of
touch-screen self-service machines in the US.
Over the next three years, the Italian company will supply Docunet with
6,000 machines, capable of delivering travel documents or theatre tickets
instantly to customers in shopping malls, office buildings or airports.
The agreement will be worth about Dollars 96m to Olivetti, the Italian
company said. It also said it would buy a stake in Docunet but did not say
how large.
The agreement announced yesterday will also involve EDS, the computer
services company owned by General Motors, which is to provide the network to
link the machines.
Bell Atlantic, the telecommunications group, and Chemical Bank of the US
will also take part in the scheme, helping to market Docunet machines on the
east coast of the US.
Two agreements have already been signed with the Giant Food stores chain in
the Washington area, and with the Ralphs supermarket chain in southern
California, to install new machines in 170 shops by the end of the year.
Docunet said it had already signed agreements with American Airlines and
USAir, to issue tickets through the Docunet system. 'Certain large US
(travel) agencies - US Travel, Thomas Cook, Travel One, Giselle's and
Travelogue - intend to issue tickets through Docunet,' the company added.
The system is the latest evidence of the growing use of 'information
superhighways' in the US. The machines are likely to resemble automatic cash
machines, and operate with credit cards or cash.

Electrolux, the world's leading maker of household appliances, has taken a 6
per cent stake in Refripar, Brazil's second-largest producer of white goods,
in a strategic move to increase its presence in the South American white
goods market.
Electrolux is paying Dollars 10m for the stake, which will underpin an
alliance to supply equipment for the production of washing machines by both
Refripar and Electrolux's subsidiaries in South America.
The Swedish group recently set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina to
distribute household appliances under the Electrolux, Zanussi and Frigidaire
brand names.
Refripar, with 1993 sales of more than Dollars 350m, has a 50 per cent
market share in Brazil for freezers, and a 35 per cent share of the
refrigerator market. However, it is weak in washing machines.
Electrolux sales in South America were SKr2.4bn (Dollars 315.8m) last year,
but were mostly accounted for by floor cleaners.

burdened'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks will remain burdened for many years by their high proportion
of bad loans, a US credit rating agency said yesterday.
The report, by Moody's Japan, said poor asset quality was compounded by the
fact that the banks' underlying profitability was among the weakest in the
world. Problem asset levels were very high in relation to core earnings.
'Since there is little prospect for a massive (government) bail-out, or for
significant profit improvement, we see a prolonged period of uncertainty,'
the report said.
Margins were expected to remain under pressure because of the heavy cost of
carrying non-performing loans, and the limited lending opportunities.
In the last three years, Moody's has cut its ratings of large Japanese banks
from an average of Aa2 to A2. Only four leading banks - Bank of Tokyo,
Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and Sanwa Bank - received
long-term ratings of Aa3.
Moody's said that while it was confident the risk of default by any big bank
remained remote, 'the unwillingness of the authorities to move decisively in
resolving the banks' asset quality problems has created an atmosphere of
risk and uncertainty on the part of market participants at home and abroad.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of United Airlines, the biggest airline in the US, yesterday
voted by a large majority to hand control of their company to its 75,700
employees in return for wage cuts and other labour concessions worth Dollars
4.9bn.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, called the decision 'an event
of monumental proportions'.
He was speaking at the company's annual meeting in Chicago shortly before
stepping down in favour of Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former Chrysler
vice-chairman chosen by employees to become United's chairman and chief
executive.
Under the plan approved by shareholders, United's employees will get a
controlling stake of 55 per cent of the airline's equity - rising later to a
maximum of 63 per cent - in return for the concessions.
The aim is to lower the company's operating costs so it can compete on
short-haul routes in the US with smaller, low-cost carriers like Southwest
Airlines - currently the most profitable airline in the US.
United is heavily unionised and feared a labour confrontation if it started
cutting back operations and shedding staff. Its employee ownership plan,
destined to make it the biggest employee-owned company in the US, is
intended to win employees' consent to a cost-cutting drive by allowing them
to share in the benefits.
Some institutional investors had threatened to vote against the plan, saying
employee ownership would tempt workers to put their own interests above
those of other shareholders. However, as yesterday's meeting opened, Mr Wolf
said the 70 per cent of the shares represented by proxies had been voted in
favour of the proposal.
Existing shareholders will get one half share in the new company and Dollars
84.81 in cash for every United share held. United estimates the value of the
deal at Dollars 143 to Dollars 147 a share, but its stock has recently been
trading at under Dollars 130.
United Airlines yesterday reported net income of Dollars 55m for the second
quarter, up from Dollars 22m last time and including a Dollars 19m after-tax
charge relating to the buy-out. For the half year, before extraordinary
items, the net loss was Dollars 16m, against a loss of Dollars 115m.

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, yesterday
confirmed its effective control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group,
when two ITT representatives were co-opted on to the seven-person board of
the company.
ITT also confirmed it had increased its stake in Ciga, to 20.3 per cent, and
was continuing to buy shares in the market. The stake is held through its
Sheraton International subsidiary.
In New York, Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I'm
confident that they (the new ITT-appointed directors) will make an important
contribution to Ciga's board, as the company moves through this important
period of transition.'
The new directors of Ciga are Mr Robert Cotter, president of ITT Sheraton
Europe, and Mr Charles Goldman, a vice-president of ITT and the group's
associate legal counsel. They replace Mr Michele Saponara, and Professor
Gianguido Scalfi, two of the four directors nominated in February by the
custodian appointed by an Italian court when Ciga ran into financial
difficulties.
The US company's control over Ciga became obvious at last week's shareholder
meeting, when the former directors of Ciga were heavily criticised. However,
control was only achieved after months of complex financial manoeuvring, and
will be exercised under the supervision of Ciga's vociferous minority
shareholders.
The Italian stock exchange authorities have also yet to rule on whether ITT
has to make a public offer for further shares in the group.
Even yesterday, ITT could not declare a complete victory. A third director -
Mr Pietro Guerra - was supposed to step down and be replaced by an ITT
nominee. Mr Guerra is the representative of Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding
company which used to control Ciga. Yesterday, he decided not to resign,
although he could step down later.

CAE, the big Canadian electronics group, expects to hold its share of the
world markets for commercial flight simulators well above 50 per cent this
year.
The company has won most of the new commercial flight simulator orders in
the first half of calendar 1994, including sales to Japan and China, Mr John
Caldwell, president, told the annual meeting. However, this pace was
unlikely to be sustained, he cautioned.
In the year ended March, CAE took 10 out of 18 full-flight simulator orders
worldwide, indicating a 55 per cent market share.
The company is moving into simulation equipment for medical, entertainment
and educational uses, and is looking for acquisitions in electronics,
aerospace and industrial products. However, aircraft simulators will remain
dominant for another five years.
Last year, CAE took a CDollars 396m (USDollars 284.9m) write-down on its
CAE-Link military simulator unit in the US.

BolsWessanen, the Dutch drinks and foods group, is in talks about
'far-reaching co-operation' with the family-owned Italian company Davide
Campari-Milano, the maker of Campari.
Neither company would be drawn on detail, but the plans are understood to
involve Campari taking over the Dutch group's substantial Italian
activities. In return, Bols-Wessanen would acquire a stake in the Italian
company, and distribute its drinks products through Campari's extensive
sales network.
BolsWessanen's interests in Italy range from mineral water and soft drinks
to wines, distilled spirits and aperitifs such as Cynar, the artichoke-based
drink. The company employs 570 people in Italy. Its Crodino non-alcoholic
aperitif leads the Italian market.
In April, Mr Marco Perelli Cippo, Campari managing director, said the
company was seeking to align its traditional products - Bitter, Campari soda
and Cordial - with new brands.
Such is the Italian company's interest in the deal that it may be prepared
to cede a stake of more than 20 per cent to BolsWessanen. If it did, it
would be the first time in the company's 130-year history that shares have
been owned by investors without close links to the Campari dynasty.

of bad loans, a US credit rating agency said yesterday.
The report, by Moody's Japan, said poor asset quality was compounded by the
fact that the banks' underlying profitability was among the weakest in the
world. Problem asset levels were very high in relation to core earnings.
'Since there is little prospect for a massive (government) bail-out, or for
significant profit improvement, we see a prolonged period of uncertainty,'
the report said.
Margins were expected to remain under pressure because of the heavy cost of
carrying non-performing loans, and the limited lending opportunities.
In the last three years, Moody's has cut its ratings of large Japanese banks
from an average of Aa2 to A2. Only four leading banks - Bank of Tokyo,
Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and Sanwa Bank - received
long-term ratings of Aa3.
Moody's said that while it was confident the risk of default by any big bank
remained remote, 'the unwillingness of the authorities to move decisively in
resolving the banks' asset quality problems has created an atmosphere of
risk and uncertainty on the part of market participants at home and abroad.
'In the absence of decisive action, it may take up to a decade for the
banking system as a whole to work through its asset quality problems.'
The outlook for the country's city banks was brighter than for the long-term
credit banks and trust banks, since these two sectors had been most exposed
to commercial property, the principal cause of the bad debt problems.
The agency saw the prospect of a significant number of mergers within the
industry, driven by the weakness of the less-efficient banks.
The ratings for Japanese banks were likely to experience more downward
pressure in the next few years, the report said.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bank unveils Fnac sale terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, yesterday announced the terms of
its FFr1.9bn (Dollars 359m) deal to sell a controlling stake in Fnac, the
French music and book retailer, to Mr Francois Pinault, the entrepreneur.
The deal, which coincides with the publication of a French parliamentary
inquiry into the causes of Credit Lyonnais' financial problems, involves
Artemis, the Pinault family holding company. Artemis is buying the bank's
64.6 per cent stake in Fnac for FFr3.065 a share, valuing the whole of Fnac
at FFr3bn.
However, Credit Lyonnais must first offer the Fnac stake on the same terms
to Generale des Eaux, the French utility with which it collaborated last
year to buy Fnac from GMF, the troubled insurer. Generale has 30 days to
decide whether to exercise its pre-emptive rights over the shares.
Mr Pinault, who made his name in the 1980s by turning his family's timber
business into the vast Pinault-Printemps retail group, has for months been
manoeuvring to take control of Fnac, one of the best-known names in French
retailing. He tried to acquire Fnac last year when GMF put it up for sale,
but was outbid by Credit Lyonnais and Generale des Eaux. However, Credit
Lyonnais's deepening financial problems - it incurred a net loss of FFr6.9bn
in 1993 and has secured the French government's support for a FFr44.9bn
rescue package - have forced it to sell assets.
The Fnac deal is the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions by Mr
Pinault, who is one of Credit Lyonnais' most prominent clients.
Pinault-Printemps has been selling assets in order to reduce debts. However,
Mr Pinault himself has been expanding his personal interests through
Artemis.
Two years ago, Artemis acquired a junk-bond portfolio from Credit Lyonnais
as part of a debt-rescheduling agreement. Mr Pinault last summer bought
Chateau Latour, one of Bordeaux's most prestigious wines, from UK drinks
group Allied-Lyons, for FFr690m.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Roche cautions on sluggish sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday warned that
sales growth during the second half of 1994 would be slower than in recent
years.
The caution came as growth at its pharmaceuticals division slowed from 16
per cent, year-on-year, during the first quarter, to 2 per cent in the
second.
However, barring unforeseen circumstances, group profits for 1994 as a whole
would show an increase, Roche said. In 1993, net income rose 29.3 per cent
to SFr2.48bn (Dollars 1.9bn), while sales were 10.5 per cent higher at
SFr14.3bn.
Turnover for the six months ended June was up 7 per cent in local
currencies. In Swiss francs, which have appreciated over the last year,
sales rose 2 per cent to SFr7.33bn. Half-year profits figures were not
disclosed.
The pharmaceuticals division posted sales up 9 per cent in local currencies
(4 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr4.04bn from SFr3.9bn.
Roche said it had been unable to avoid the effects of an increasingly
competitive environment. During the second quarter, it was hit by
extraordinary factors.
The vitamins and fine chemicals division rose 7 per cent in local currencies
(2 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr1.63bn from SFr1.6bn. Turnover at the
diagnostics division slipped 2 per cent in local currencies (4 per cent in
Swiss francs), to SFr815m from SFr867m. The group said if last year's sales
from the disposed microbiology business were excluded, sales in local
currencies would have been little changed.
The static result at the diagnostics division was partly blamed on changes
in reimbursement policy in the US, which led to the closure of some local
laboratories.
The fragrances and flavours division posted sales up 13 per cent in local
currencies (8 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr812m from SFr750m.
Roche certificates fell 5 per cent to SFr5,700 yesterday.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen more than trebled at Pounds 3.96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Modwen Properties, property investment and development concern, more than
trebled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.96m in the six months
to May 31. Gross rental income grew 31 per cent to Pounds 5.18m.
Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, described the performance as excellent and
announced a 66 per cent hoist in the interim dividend to 0.5p (0.3p),
covered 4.4 times by earnings of 2.3p (0.6p).
The result was helped by 'significant' contributions from two development
sales at Stoke-on-Trent and Tamworth, Staffordshire.
During the period the company sold three small investment properties at
Rugeley, Staffs, and Torquay and Plymouth in Devon. Mr Clarke pointed out
that the revenue achieved from these sales averaged about 20 per cent more
than their book value at the November 30 year end.
Mr Clarke said that profits from the recent sale of the Octagon Centre,
Oldbury should be judged as being 'one-off' in nature. But even without
this, profits to be realised from the sale of the Oldbury Green Retail Park,
due to be completed in September, should 'ensure a second half result in
excess of the first'.
Following the sales, gearing will fall to about 50 per cent.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Little Chef moves into Spain on Pounds 3m
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a Pounds 1.5m
investment to put Little Chef roadside restaurants, the first of which
opened yesterday, and Forte Travelodges on the Spanish map.
The investment has been matched by Repsol, Spain's largest and partly
privatised energy and chemicals group, in a joint venture worth Pounds 3m.
The first Little Chef, built at a cost of Pounds 488,000 midway between
Madrid and Seville, is on a long-haul route which carries French traffic
bound for south-west Spain, the Algarve and north Africa.
Forte said the opening of the Little Chef was 'in line with Forte's strategy
to expand the brand in Europe' and would lead to a 'widespread network at
Repsol service station sites along Spain's main highways'. Potentially there
was scope for 50 sites, the company said.
Forte plans to open a second Little Chef later this year on the Madrid to
Barcelona highway, about 12km from Zaragoza. A Travelodge is due to be
opened on the same site early next year. A third site has also been
earmarked for development.
Forte said the Little Chef menu had been adapted to cater for local palates,
retaining only 60 per cent of the original UK offerings. The Spanish menu
includes more fish dishes, gazpacho and churros (a crispy doughnut).
Little Chef restaurants have been opened in Dublin and Cork. In the UK Forte
operates 350 roadside restaurants, attracting 40m people a year.
Repsol, which controls 75 per cent of the Spanish fuel market, has been
gearing up for greater competition following its partial privatisation. Last
year the government reduced its share in the company from 54 per cent to 41
per cent and is expected to cut it further to 20 per cent later this year.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rexmore shares rise as recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, saw its share price jump 6p to 88p
yesterday as a continuation of the strong recovery shown halfway was
reflected at the full year stage.
And Mr Michael Rosenblatt, chairman, said he was looking for a further
increase in the year ahead.
Group pre-tax profit for the year ended April 2 1994 came out at Pounds
1.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.4m. This is the first annual profit
since 1990-91 when the group achieved Pounds 1m and follows a first half
profit of Pounds 688,000 (Pounds 143,000)
Group turnover from continuing operations was virtually static at Pounds 32m
(Pounds 31.1m). Discontinued operations produced sales of Pounds 676,000
(Pounds 8.96m) and operating losses of Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 659,000).
In the group's main business - the supply of upholstery fabrics and related
products - turnover rose from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 29.6m, producing
operating profits up from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2m.
The pre-tax figure was struck after reduced interest charges of Pounds
247,000 (Pounds 649,000) with gearing coming down from 13.9 per cent to 7
per cent. Also charged were losses on discontinued operations and asset
disposals of Pounds 313,000.
Mr Rosenblatt said there had been little improvement in the group's market,
but profit for the first quarter of the current year was ahead of that in
the comparable period last time.
The annual dividend is lifted from 1.75p to 2.5p with a final of 1.5p.
Earnings per share were 9p (7.7p losses).

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: United Breweries decision soon - Future may
be resolved after banks consider restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of United Breweries, the financially troubled USM-quoted company
controlled by Indian businessman Mr Vijay Mallya, could be resolved next
week.
Four banks, with a combined exposure of about Pounds 9m, have been
considering their response to a restructuring plan. It involves them writing
off approximately Pounds 2.5m of debt and converting further debt to 'some
sort' of convertible loan stock, say company advisers.
However, Mr Michael Potts of Allied Irish Bank, UB's main lender, said
yesterday that the company was being asked to submit further proposals - for
the third time - so a decision could be made next week.
'We are still to make up our minds,' said Mr Potts, who added that 'We are
fairly confident that the banks will be presented with fresh proposals that
they will look at,' he said.
The company's other banks are the Yorkshire Bank, National Home Loans and
Adam &amp; Co., a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland.
Negotiations followed a Pounds 7.2m write-down in the value of UB's 76
public houses in April, which led to it breaching banking covenants.
Just 18 months earlier, Mr Mallya's Indian-based UB Group had bought 15 per
cent of the company, then called Wiltshire Brewery. UB Group, which has
management control but still has only a 15 per cent stake in the company,
changed its name from Wiltshire Brewery to United Breweries. It still plans
to use UB to expand its UK brewing interests.
According to one of his advisers, Mr Mallya, who is chairman of UB, is
negotiating on the basis that 'the banks must be willing to accept some of
the pain. Mallya is not frightened to walk away'.
Such an outcome would deprive UB of the 'interim financial assistance' which
UB Group has recently been providing.
'The banks are unlikely to pull the plug, but there is a risk that one of
them will fall out of bed the wrong way one morning and say 'sod it, I've
had enough',' said Mr Christopher Stainforth, head of corporate finance at
Guinness Mahon, who is advising UB.
UB stresses that the company's future could be bright if restructuring plans
succeed. Up to three acquisitions are planned, funded by a rights issue, all
to be implemented by a new deputy executive chairman working alongside Mr
O'Neil Nalavadi, UB's chief executive.
Advisers say that the executive is 'an experienced hand, currently director
of a major drinks company'. The banks have been told who he is but he will
not be named publicly unless the negotiations succeed.
The plans are believed to include taking full control of UBSN, the drinks
distribution company jointly owned with Shepherd Neame, the Kent brewer.
UBSN distributes Kingfisher, the Indian beer widely sold in curry houses in
the UK.
UB's turnover for the year to November 30 1993 leapt 68 per cent to Pounds
4.14m, while operating profits before exceptional items improved from Pounds
38,000 to Pounds 463,000.
However UB was left with an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.57m after the
Pounds 7.2m pub write-down, compared with a loss of Pounds 978,954 the year
before.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd holds dividend despite loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the Midlands engineering group supplying the power and
automotive sectors, is maintaining its dividend in spite of a 1993-94
pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.92m.
The loss, foreshadowed in a trading statement last April, compared with a
profit of Pounds 7.08m. It was struck after a net Pounds 7.6m of operating
losses and exceptional costs involved in disposing of the group's
unprofitable building products division.
But even before exceptional items, there was a decline in the operating
profit on continuing activities from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 7.1m, while
turnover rose to Pounds 148.8m (Pounds 133.3m).
The decline reflected losses from engineering, where there have been changes
in senior management. It followed a decline in the power division's
operating margins, associated largely with the bedding down of new equipment
and subsequent lateness in starting work on new orders. The effects of this
will last into the present half.
But by the end of the year, the group order book stood at Pounds 53m,
compared with Pounds 44.2m in March 1993. This foretaste of a return to what
Mr Colin Cooke, the chairman, called 'healthy profitability' led Triplex
Lloyd to dip into reserves and hold the final dividend at 4.5p, maintaining
total payments for the year at 7p.
'The UK economy is at last providing some growth and the worst of the
recession in Europe appears to be over. We remain confident that our capital
investment programme will bring substantial benefit to shareholders,' Mr
Cooke said.
COMMENT
The group has had a year of looking for silver linings in the financial
clouds. The disposal of building products checked one haemorrhage and had
the effect of lowering future tax charges, which will do wonders for the
earnings per share. The engineering division now looks uncomfortable in the
group and is not receiving the high levels of investment going to the power
and automotive sides, from which will come the strongest revenue stream. By
in the second half there should be an uninterrupted flow, leading to 1994-95
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m and producing earnings per share of over
8p. The shares, pushed down and left aside last April at a lower level than
last year's rights, but steadier yesterday at 138p, are on a prospective
multiple of 17.25. Until promise turns to profit, that looks about right.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round increase lifts Jacques Vert to
Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 45.1m, pre-tax
profits of Jacques Vert, the ladies' fashionwear group, doubled to Pounds
2.09m for the 53 weeks ended April 30. This compared with Pounds 1.03m last
time.
Earnings per share expanded from 8.8p to 13.45p while the dividend is
stepped up 50 per cent to 4.5p (3p) with a final payment of 3p.
Mr Alan Green, chairman, said that the level of activity in all areas of the
business continued to increase with retail activities 'particularly
pleasing'. He added that directors planned to extend the group's national
coverage of concessioned units.
Operating profits from continuing activities rose from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
2.33m and were achieved after costs incurred in the setting up of two new
brands, Mr Green stated.
The level of net bank borrowings continued to fall and was reduced from
Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.02m, resulting in gearing of 24.2 per cent (37 per
cent).

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: John Tams declines to Pounds 1.45m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Tams Group, the USM-quoted china and earthenware manufacturer, reported
lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.45m for the year to March 31, against
Pounds 1.71m, on turnover up 12 per cent from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 25.7m.
The company blamed pressure on margins at Duchess and an operating loss at
Royal Grafton. Changes to the design of the Grafton range are being made as
well as to its coffee mugs in an effort to regain market share.
The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 213,000
(Pounds 359,000). Gearing over the year rose from 29 to 33 per cent.
Earnings per share were 3.89p (4.94p) and a maintained proposed final
dividend of 2.41p makes 4.01p (4p) for the year.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall shares fall despite OFTstatement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors,
fell 9p to 97p yesterday despite a statement from the Office of Fair Trading
saying it had no evidence that allegations of anti-competitive practices had
any substance.
On Monday, the OFT said it would make 'preliminary inquiries' into
allegations in the press regarding Healthcall's treatment of potential
competitors. Yesterday's statement said: 'At this stage the OFT is merely
seeking to establish the facts.'
Started 30 years ago, Healthcall's service provides GPs with the
out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply.
Under an exclusive agreement first signed in 1966 the BMA promotes
Healthcall's service and monitors its standards in return for a fee set at
0.5 per cent of revenues.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, has asked the OFT to consider
whether the agreement falls under the Restrictive Practices Act.
The OFT said on Monday that it fell outside the scope of the Act and
yesterday added that a decision had been made in June that it did not need
to be referred to the Restrictive Practices Court.
The other allegations centre on the effective monopoly Healthcall has in
many urban areas and its actions against GPs who attempt to set up
co-operatives to compete with it.
The company dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and denied
that it threatened to cut off its service to GPs if they made moves to set
up co-operatives.
Dr John Cockburn, managing director of Healthcall's smaller rival Nestor
Medical Duty Services, said that in many smaller urban areas there was room
for only one duty doctor service and it was reasonable for Healthcall to
warn GPs that it might have to pull out.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Management buy-out at Dollond &amp; Aitchison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of American Brands, has sold the UK's largest
optical retailer, Dollond &amp; Aitchison, and its other European optical
businesses to its management for Pounds 94m.
Mr Peter Wilson, Gallaher's chairman and chief executive, said the optical
business was sold because it 'does not form part of our plans for the
strategic development of the group', which has substantial UK interests in
tobacco, spirits, retail distribution and housewares.
The buy-out is one of the largest in Europe this year, with total financing
amounting to more than Pounds 100m, split equally between debt and equity.
There have been two earlier attempts at an MBO since late 1992. These fell
through because of the complexity of the pan-European transaction, the
uncertain economic climate, and the devaluation of the peseta in November
1992 and May 1993.
The successful transaction was led by CVC Capital Partners, part of Citicorp
Ventures, while the debt portion was led by NatWest Acquisition Finance.
CVC said it planned to float the company within the next five years. The
venture capitalist owns 90 per cent of D&amp;A's equity, with the remainder
owned by the senior management, who will remain with the company.
D&amp;A achieved sales of Pounds 240m in the year to November 27 1993, and a
trading profit of Pounds 14.9m. In addition to its UK business, which has a
13 per cent market share, D&amp;A owns the largest optical chain in Spain,
General Optica, and Italy, where it trades under the Salmoiraghi Vigano
name. It also operates outlets in the IrishRepublic.
The UK and Spanish businesses contribute the bulk of earnings, but the
company also owns the Keeler optical instrument company. The group employs
5,000 people.
Gallaher purchased D&amp;A from Slater Walker in 1970, and built up its European
presence.
Mr Peter Coldwell, D&amp;A's chief executive, said: 'As a bank-backed business
it may make us sharpen our pencils, but I don't think you will see a
dramatic change in strategy.'
The UK business, which fell into losses at the outset of the recession in
1989, is now recovering rapidly. Mr Coldwell said D&amp;A planned to build up
the number of franchise outlets.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Electron House doubles as semiconductors
side grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for electronic components, particularly semiconductors,
together with significant productivity gains helped Electron House, the
electronic components distributor, report doubled profits in the year to May
31.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 4.04m on sales of
Pounds 104.8m, against Pounds 89m including Pounds 10.6m from discontinued
activities. Continuing activities showed growth of 34 per cent.
Earnings per share jumped from a restated 4.34p to 9.66p and an increased
final divided of 2p is recommended making a total up from 2.6p to 3.2p.
The shares, which have risen from about 30p over the past two years, closed
2p higher yesterday at 159p.
The profits were struck after redundancy payments and property write-downs
of Pounds 361,000. Excluding exceptional costs, pre-tax profits would have
been Pounds 4.4m and earnings per share 10.6p.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, described the results as 'most satisfactory'. He
said they reflected the continuing strength of the group's key markets
combined with further productivity gains generated internally which resulted
in operating expenses falling from 17.8 per cent of sales to 15.8 per cent.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 4.64m
(Pounds 3.27m) while the group's strong cash flow of Pounds 5m helped reduce
net interest costs to Pounds 599,000 (Pounds 1.18m) and removed net debt.
Mr Leigh said that demand for electronic components, the group's core
business had remained strong. The semiconductor market, which accounted for
60 per cent of group sales, was the main driving force.
The UK-based components business boosted profits from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds
3.09m on sales of Pounds 59m (Pounds 37.8m) while the operations in
Australia and New Zealand also showed strong gains.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: EMH buys Normand for Pounds 11.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Motor Holdings, the fast growing motor retail and services group,
is to acquire Normand Motor Group in a deal worth Pounds 11.75m which will
double the size of the group.
The proposed acquisition, together with the repayment of Normand's mezzanine
debt of Pounds 2m, will be funded through a placing and 2-for-5 open offer
at 110p a share designed to raise about Pounds 16.5m. The shares closed 2p
lower at 119p yesterday.
The deal is expected to be completed at the end of this month, in time for
the new registrations bonanza in August. It will substantially broaden EMH's
franchise base, particularly in London and south east England, and provide
the group with its first Mercedes dealerships.
Normand, the subject of a Pounds 31m management buy-out in February 1990
from Allied-Lyons, operates 16 car and four commercial vehicle franchised
outlets from 18 locations in the north west, west and south east England and
London. The group made operating profits of Pounds 2.15m from motor retail
operations on sales of Pounds 11.3m in the year to February 28.
Mr Richard Palmer, EMH's chief executive, when reporting a 50 per cent
increase in full-year profits last week, indicated that the group was about
to announce an acquisition which would require a rights issue. Commenting on
the deal yesterday he said it provided, 'an excellent opportunity for the
group to broaden its coverage in the motor industry both geographically and
in terms of the range of manufacturers it represents.'
Under the terms of the proposed deal the consideration will be satisfied by
Pounds 10.6m in cash and the issue of 1.05m shares to certain vendors.
The placing and open offer of 15m shares will raise Pounds 15.5m net of
expenses and has been underwritten by Charterhouse Bank with Charterhouse
Tilney Securities as stockbroker to the issue.
COMMENT
European Motor's management has a solid record for making earning-enhancing
acquisitions and knocking them into shape. The Normand deal is unlikely to
be an exception. The deal will propel European into the UK motor retail big
league and is a good geographic and franchise fit. Meanwhile Normand's
operating margin last year was a modest 1.2 per cent providing plenty of
scope for improvement. Following the acquisition European should report
pre-tax profits of just more than Pounds 8m this year producing earnings of
11.7p. There is little downside risk in the shares and the open offer
deserves support.

Graystone, the engineering company originally Ptarmigan Holdings which

Pounds 2.1m to be used to cut debt.
It is selling Arnold Belford, supplier to the bakery industry, to the API

Belford showed turnover of Pounds 2.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 300,000

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Dutch purchase for Waddington - Fl 113.3m
acquisition of Imca to be funded by Pounds 42m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, yesterday
announced a strategic expansion into Europe with the Fl 113.3m (Pounds
41.7m) acquisition of Imca Beheer, the privately owned Dutch cartons
business.
The deal, funded by a Pounds 42m rights issue, is expected to transform the
company from a UK-dominated group into a pan-European food packaging
business.
Mr Martin Buckley, chief executive, said Imca would complement Waddington's
existing operations - supplying blue-chip clients such as Cadbury and Nestle
 -and provide access to a wider customer base.
'The acquisition should put us at the forefront of the carton packaging
industry in Europe and provide improved prospects for medium-term earnings
growth,' he said.
Yesterday's announcement followed lengthy negotiations between Imca and
Waddington, which has been looking to establish a European presence since
late last year.
The group received a number of approaches but Mr Buckley said only Imca met
its criteria of profitability, modern manufacturing techniques and a secure
order book.
The Dutch manufacturer, based at Hoogerheide near the Belgian border, made
operating profits of Fl 10.8m on turnover of Fl 73.1m in the year to
December 31.
Waddington will pay Fl 71.5m for Imca's share capital and Fl 41.8m to take
over inter-company loans owed to Imca Holding, a private company controlled
by Mr Cornelis Baartmans, the group's founder and chief executive. Mr
Baartmans is expected to act as a consultant to the enlarged group from next
year.
If the deal is approved at an extraordinary meeting later this month,
Waddington shareholders will be offered up to 23.12m new ordinary shares at
190p. The issue, underwritten by Robert Fleming with Cazenove as brokers, is
being made on a 2-for-7 basis.
Recommending the deal yesterday, Mr Buckley said contributions from Imca
would enhance profits this year.
Profits are also expected to grow with increased demand in Britain and North
America, while the provisions which held back last year's results are
unlikely to be repeated.
A Pounds 7.4m provision to settle a US antitrust investigation involving two
Waddington subsidiaries pegged pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.07m in the year
to April 2.
COMMENT
The Imca acquisition raises the prospect of long-term growth at Waddington.
It offers access to new markets and gives the UK group added weight in
negotiating favourable raw material prices. However, the shares fell 9p to
221p on fears that the purchase price could be expensive if the Dutch
company proves earnings dilutive. Yet the strategic arguments behind
Waddington's expansion are persuasive. It will offer product synergies and
lead to substantial cost savings. With the shadow lifted from the US
antitrust action and first-time contributions from Imca, profits this year
are expected to exceed Pounds 23m. The shares, on a multiple of 12.5, are
worth considering.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birse losses cut sharply to Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the third year running Birse Group, the construction company, has
announced an annual pre-tax loss. The deficit, however, was reduced
substantially from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 2.7m for the 12 months to the end
of April.
The group yesterday announced that it had moved from an operating loss
before interest of Pounds 14.3m to a profit of Pounds 855,000. It was helped
by the absence of provisions on commercial property which cost the company
Pounds 3.48m last time.
The contracting division also turned round from a Pounds 9.46m loss to a
Pounds 1.12m profit, with no repeat of the problem contracts which severely
dented the 1993 results.
The group still made an overall loss in spite of reduced interest charges of
Pounds 3.56m (Pounds 4.22m). Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said: 'Despite
evidence of an improvement in all our markets, construction margins continue
to be depressed by surplus capacity in the industry.'
Turnover increased by 7 per cent from Pounds 328m to Pounds 351m. Losses per
share emerged at 2.3p (19.4p), and again there is no dividend.
The plant hire division increased operating profits from Pounds 606,000 to
Pounds 871,000, while the small housebuilding division, which sold 115 homes
last year, moved from a Pounds 1.39m loss to a Pounds 71,000 profit.
Birse also sold some of its remaining commercial properties, for Pounds
6.8m, making a small book profit and further reducing its borrowings.
Overall, commercial property made a Pounds 21,000 loss (Pounds 4.04m).
The biggest improvement has been in the company's balance sheet. Net debt
following last year's Pounds 24m share placing had fallen to Pounds 11.8m by
the end of April, equivalent to almost 35 per cent of shareholders' funds
which increased from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 33.8m.
The company said that in the absence of property sales it would expect to
maintain gearing at an average of about 50 per cent this year.
COMMENT
Birse, having survived the recession by retaining the support of its bankers
and shareholders, must now rebuild its fortunes. Margins are improving, but
competition for work remains intense and progress will be slow.
Housebuilding may be leading the industry out of recession, but Birse's
housing operation is too small to benefit much. Commercial property sales
should improve the balance sheet further. Pre-tax profits, depending on
these sales, may top Pounds 1m this year, but a return to dividends is some
way off and investors will need to see firmer evidence of improvement.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Sir Ian packs bags and leaves Holmes: 'I am too old to spend
my time going back and forth in a crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ian MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and British Coal,
yesterday quit the UK quoted company scene when he resigned as chairman of
security group Holmes Protection.
The 81-year-old Scot is also bowing out of the UK itself having decided to
sell his house in Scotland and retire to America.
Speaking from his home in Massachusetts, Sir Ian said he was stepping down
from US-based Holmes after boardroom disagreements. 'My ideas did not
prevail and I am too old to spend my time in a long, hot summer going back
and forth in a crisis.'
The disagreements stemmed from a deal announced last week under which HP
Partners, a US investor group, would inject Dollars 10m in return for a 34
per cent stake.
Mr Paul Douglas, a director for the past 19 months, succeeds as chairman of
Holmes which plans to delist its shares in London and obtain a quotation on
the Nasdaq exchange in New York.
In recent years Sir Ian has been involved in a number of struggling
UK-quoted companies where things have not gone entirely to plan.
Mountleigh, the property group, went into receivership while he was chairman
and shortly afterwards he was ousted as chairman of specialist printer
HunterPrint. 'Lots of people asked me to give them some help and like a boy
scout I was always willing to try. But like a doctor, not all my patients
survived.'
He blames the Mountleigh disappointment on 'the panic that descended on the
City when Olympia &amp; York went belly up'.
Sir Ian is retaining his directorship at United Gas, the new-born UK-based
gas business where he acted as 'midwife'.
But he is selling his house in Argyll and will divide his time between
Massachusetts and Florida. His children and grandchildren live in America
where he spent much of his early career. 'They have put up with my keeping
the house for years but I finally got the message that they regarded it as
an old man's indulgence. Anyway I have the impression the Scottish climate
was better in my youth.'
He is still involved with several young US companies. 'I spend a lot of time
giving people the benefit of my experience and they spend their time taking
very little notice.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Impossible dreams and irrational benchmarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consistently outstanding portfolio performance is as elusive as ever, but
pursued regardless, according to The WM Company. The Edinburgh firm of
performance measurers has carried out some detailed analyses of its database
of UK pension fund performance in 1993.
The hopes of clients and fund managers spring eternal. WM says that in
extreme cases it has had to knock heads together to cause certain funds to
amend performance targets which had become 'irrational and unrealistic'.
They were chasing an impossible dream.
Even some of the more common performance benchmarks, such as median plus 2
per cent over rolling three-year periods, appear to imply almost certain
disappointment. In most years this result requires top quartile performance,
but only 15 per cent of funds achieve this in three successive years. Over
several consecutive three-year periods the fall-out is almost complete: even
median plus 1 per cent has only been achieved over more than three
successive three-year periods by one in a 100 funds.
WM's computers have crunched not only the numbers but also some of the
illusions of investment management. Does a group of fashionable specialist
managers offer a reasonable chance of outperforming a single balanced
manager? There is no evidence that the specialists do better, says WM, in
fact over the five-year period 1988-92 (inclusive) the specialists'
performance was 1 per cent a year worse.
Does a highly active manager, buying cheap and selling dear and turning over
the portfolio rapidly, add value? Looking at UK equities WM detects that the
skills of managers in trading may have added 0.4 per cent a year. It's not
much, and the problem is that it has cost 0.8 per cent a year to achieve
this modest result.
This is, of course, a very familiar picture of the frailty of investment
performance. Much is promised and much effort is expended, but little is
delivered. Some managers can achieve success for a period of years, but not
indefinitely. Often they attract so much new money that they hopelessly
dilute whatever skills they originally had. Excellence is barely
distinguishable in the statistics, although WM does say that top performance
is achieved slightly more often than could be attributed to pure chance.
This is a very shaky justification for the almost universal chase after
consistent top quartile returns.
Meanwhile contracts are awarded on an unrealistic basis. The clients believe
 -or are advised by consultants - that they can reasonably hope to choose an
excellent manager, despite the evidence of the statistics. The fund
managers, on the other hand, often will not win the business unless they
accept an almost unattainable target.
In fact the more aggressive targets can rebound on clients. Extra
performance will in any case involve higher volatility. But there is also
the extra risk inherent in the nature of the management contract, in that
the manager may embark on a 'double or quits' strategy in order to retain
the contract or to get back into a zone where performance fees can be
earned.
Some of these dangers may have been enhanced in the UK pension fund sector
by the peculiar emphasis on peer group performance - that is, on what the
average fund has done. Pension funds and their portfolio managers feel
trapped into following the consensus asset allocation strategy more or less
exactly.
WM's analysis shows that very little of the difference between the best and
worst performing UK pension funds is explained by variations in asset mix.
It almost all results from stock selection - an area where active managers
evidently feel under obligation to accept a degree of risk rather than be
exposed as closet passive managers.
Perhaps this unhealthy obsession with the consensus will now fade away under
the influence of the growing maturity of funds and the introduction of a
minimum solvency standard, two reasons why in future UK pension funds will
have to select assets with more concern for matching the particular
liability structure of the scheme.
There may be more emphasis on beating an index than on beating the
competition. Of course, by statistical definition comparatively few managers
could hope to achieve that by a substantial margin either.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Charter bid for Esab attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unions at Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment,
have attacked a takeover bid by Charter of the UK, saying the offer
undervalues the Swedish group and threatens its future in Sweden.
In a campaign carrying echoes of last year's revolt that halted the proposed
merger between Volvo and France's Renault, the unions at Esab have written
to shareholders appealing to them not to accept the bid made by Charter at
the end of last month and recommended by the Esab board.
Charter, which offered Dollars 400m (Pounds 255m) for Esab, has already
acquired votes worth more than 50 per cent through the 49 per cent voting
stake previously held by Incentive, the Swedish industrial group controlled
by the Wallenberg family, and further share purchases. But it needs 90 per
cent to take over Esab fully and the trade unions hope that Swedish
institutions will refuse to sell to Charter. The bid deadline is August 12.
White and blue-collar unions at Esab have attacked the fitness of Charter,
which until now has focused on building materials, coal and rail track
equipment, to run the company.
Mr Stefan Larsson, representing Esab's white-collar workers, civil engineers
and metal workers, claimed that many inside the company were alarmed by
public comments by Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter chief executive, suggesting
Esab required further restructuring.
He added that Esab's six-month results, due on August 8, were expected to
show sharply improved profits, with the outlook suggesting that 1994
earnings would top the SKr300m (Pounds 25m) previously forecast. Profits
were expected to grow strongly again in 1995 to between SKr500 and Skr600m.
'In that perspective we believe the bid is too low,' he said.
The largest Esab shareholder after Incentive is Fourth Fund, a state pension
fund, with 6.2 per cent of the votes. It has trade unionists on its board
and played an important role in the Volvo-Renault affair.
Mr Thomas Halvosen, the fund's chief executive, said the fund was aware of
the trade union objections but would not decide on its position until after
it had scrutinised Esab's half-year results.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Tobacco spurs Philip Morris: Marlboro volumes rise 18 per
cent to 99bn cigarettes in three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group that makes Marlboro, the
world's best-selling cigarette, shrugged off strong anti-smoking sentiment
in the US and reported a 17.6 per cent surge in after-tax profits to Dollars
1.23bn (Pounds 783m) in its second quarter.
It was the first profits increase reported by Philip Morris since Marlboro
Friday in April last year, when the company slashed the price of Marlboro
and other premium brands in the US to win back market share from cheaper
products.
Worldwide, Philip Morris sold 18 per cent more cigarettes in the three
months to June than a year earlier. Marlboro volumes rose 18 per cent to
99bn cigarettes and volumes of all Philip Morris brands rose 17.9 per cent
to 187bn cigarettes.
Philip Morris cited strong volume gains in Germany, Italy, France, Spain,
central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea, Argentina and
Brazil. Growth was particularly strong in the domestic market, where Philip
Morris increased sales by 21.9 per cent to 57.9bn cigarettes.
Philip Morris acknowledged that US gains were inflated by an increase in
stocks as wholesalers accelerated purchases in expectation of a rise in
federal excise tax. Last year's second quarter, by contrast, had seen stock
levels cut; so the industry as a whole had experienced 11 per cent growth in
US volumes.
However, the price cuts enabled Philip Morris to increase its market share
by 5 percentage points to 46.6 per cent. Marlboro's share rose by 6.5
percentage points to a record 28.5 per cent.
Although Philip Morris was selling its cigarettes at lower prices in the US,
the increased volumes helped lift operating income in the domestic tobacco
division by 25.1 per cent to Dollars 858m - seemingly vindicating the
strategy of Mr Michael Miles, the chairman and chief executive ousted three
weeks ago, who instigated Marlboro Friday.
Mr Miles fell out with the board over his support for a plan to lift Philip
Morris's share price by hiving off cigarette-making operations into a
separate entity. His successors - Mr William Murray, chairman, and Mr
Geoffrey Bible, chief executive - have ruled out a split for the forsee-able
future.
Paradoxically, the food side of the business performed relatively poorly in
the second quarter: worldwide operating income rose only 2.4 per cent to
Dollars 949m, while operating income on the tobacco side rose 22.4 per cent
to Dollars 1.5bn. Philip Morris blamed investment costs in emerging markets
and adverse exchange rates.
Group turnover rose from Dollars 15.8bn to Dollars 16.4bn. Earnings per
share increased 19.3 per cent to Dollars 1.42, helped by share repurchases.
Net income for the first six months rose 6.2 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UBS settles with Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland has reached an out of court settlement with Mr
Terry Smith, a leading investment analyst, bringing to an end a high-profile
legal dispute which had become the focus of a City of London debate about
analysts' freedom to write impartial company reports.
The settlement, disclosed in high court documents, comes as a surprise, as
UBS has for months been refusing to give in to Mr Smith's demand for Pounds
600,000 in legal costs and earnings due under his contract with the
investment bank. Both sides yesterday refused to discuss the terms of the
settlement.
The two had been suing and countersuing each other over the publication in
1992 of Accounting for Growth, a book written by Mr Smith which attacked the
accounting techniques used by many big UK companies.
Mr Smith was sacked by UBS in October 1992. It said he had breached internal
procedures for vetting the contents of the book.
However, Mr Smith has insisted that he was dismissed in part because of
complaints about the book from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand
Metropolitan, and Sir Colin Marshall, also a GrandMet director and chairman
of British Airways. Both companies are UBS clients.
Mr Smith, who yesterday refused to comment, sued UBS for breach of contract
and unfair dismissal. UBS said: 'We are both satisfied that the interests of
each party have been met.'
Although UBS tried to persuade Mr Smith not to publish the book, it later
sued him for breach of copyright, alleging that the book contained research
carried out by other UBS analysts.
Accounting for Growth is an expanded version of award-winning research
published by UBS in January 1991, which highlighted accounting techniques
used by UK companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise
the level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets. Just before
publication, newspaper articles highlighted Grand Met as the company which
used more of these techniques than any other.
Had the case come to trial, Mr Smith was seeking to cross-examine Sir Allen
and Sir Colin. He now works for a small independent firm of stockbrokers,
Collins Stewart.

FT  13 JUL 94 / 'Cash for questions' inquiry may put MPs' outside interests
at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs will decide today whether to hold a full-scale parliamentary
investigation into the so-called 'cash for questions' affair, in a move that
could have far-reaching consequences for their ability to exploit outside
interests to augment their income.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday gave the go-ahead for an
emergency debate today into whether to refer the issue to the Committee of
Privileges. The matter arose from newspaper allegations that two
Conservative MPs were willing to accept Pounds 1,000 to table parliamentary
questions.
Addressing a packed and tense Commons chamber, Miss Boothroyd said there was
'an urgent need to clarify the law of parliament in this area'.
She said the conduct of The Sunday Times newspaper, which claimed to have
used a reporter posing as a businessman to approach Labour and Conservative
MPs, 'merits further examination'.
One focus of today's debate is expected to be whether or not MPs with
outside consultancies should be allowed to sit on the ad hoc committee of
senior members to which the Commons is expected to refer the issue.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, said any report
produced by such a body would be 'discredited' without an assurance that its
members had no conflict of interest with work they undertook as
parliamentary consultants.
But Labour last night stopped short of demanding that MPs with consultancies
be excluded from the committee. A senior spokesman said he hoped the body
would recommend 'a radical tightening up' of the rules relating to
consultancies.
There is little evidence that either the extent of MPs' outside interests or
the large number of MPs who have them are on the decline in what is said to
be the age of the career politician.
Fewer than 10 per cent of MPs had nothing to declare in the most recent
register of members' interests - a document which requires disclosure of
property holdings and overseas visits as well as consultancies and
adviserships.
Yesterday's announcement came some 48 hours after the two MPs - Mr Graham
Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - were suspended as junior ministerial
aides.
The speed of Downing Street's reaction to the newspaper's claims was
interpreted as a sign of the government's continuing sensitivity to any
suggestion of impropriety in the wake of a series of embarrassments.
A senior government spokesman said yesterday that Mr John Major supported
Miss Boothroyd's decision.
Both suspended MPs deny wrongdoing.

FT  13 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Construction orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK environment department's monthly construction figures are invariably
distorted by lumpy contracts and seasonal blips. But the underlying theme
from May's figures appears to be that there is an encouraging spread of
activity to the productive parts of the economy. There had been worries that
last year's surge of activity had tailed off this spring. Fears abounded
that public infrastructure spending would fall away before private sector
investment took up the slack. But the latest figures suggest spending on
private industrial contracts in the three months to end-May was 33 per cent
up on the previous year while private commercial activity was 29 per cent
higher.
There are other grounds for optimism too. Most construction figures solely
relate to new contracts but repair and maintenance work, which accounts for
a fair chunk of output, also appears to be strong. An 8 per cent rise in
cement sales this year and anecdotal reports from housebuilders suggesting
there is a shortage of the posher types of bricks certainly point that way.
So far, most of the benefits have accrued to the building materials
suppliers. It will be more difficult for contractors to build margins while
over-capacity and pricing pressures remain.

</HEADLINE>

Financial announcements from Roche have been a cause for celebration for so
long that yesterday's disappointing half-year sales figures came as
something of a shock. Sales growth in pharmaceuticals slowed dramatically in
the second quarter, underlining the point that Roche is not immune to the
pressures afflicting its peers. After yesterday's 5 per cent slide, the
non-voting shares stand 20 per cent below the peak reached in early
February. On the surface, Roche looks in danger of losing the magic
ingredient which made it the world's most highly valued drugs company.
Yet pharmaceutical sales growth of 9 per cent for the first half as a whole
is well above the industry average. If that rate can be sustained  - which
seems perfectly possible given the one-off problems encountered in the
second quarter - Roche will still deserve a premium rating. Its position in
essential hospital drugs affords some protection against the price
competition causing havoc elsewhere. A group straddling over-the-counter
medicines, vitamins and diagnostics is also hedged against tougher
regulation in prescription drugs.
These long-term arguments in Roche's favour do not preclude a further period
of weakness for the shares. Financial income, which accounted for around a
third of last year's profits, will be more difficult to achieve in falling
bond and equity markets. Although good on paper, the Dollars 5bn acquisition
of US drug company Syntex, announced in May, must prove its worth. Even at
yesterday's closing price, Roche stands at a heady premium to other drug
company shares. The market may still be asking too much.

Even good news on inflation is now seen as an excuse to sell the dollar.
Yesterday's better than expected data on US wholesale prices were taken to
mean that there was even less chance of speedy action from the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates. It could be argued that, with few
inflationary signs, there is also less need for such action. But currency
traders are having a field day given the White House's apparent indifference
to what happens to the dollar. Moreover, even if inflation seems under
control, worries remain over the yawning US trade deficit.
The quickest way to bring the dollar slide to an end would be a cut in
German interest rates balanced by a rise in US rates. In their absence,
markets seem determined to drive the currency below DM1.50 and Y95. But if
the fall continues much below those levels, dollar assets will start to look
cheap. Following the recent rally in European bond markets, US Treasuries
are yielding three quarters of a percentage point more than German bunds.
The spread is probably still not sufficient to tempt international investors
to buy US assets, but that point cannot be too far away.
Meanwhile, sterling has been caught in the cross-fire. So long as it is
merely the innocent bystander, there is little to worry about. The recent
depreciation vis-a-vis the D-Mark will enhance industry's competitiveness in
its main European export markets, while the earlier appreciation against the
dollar should cushion any inflationary impact from higher commodity prices.
Policymakers will only have to worry should currency markets start to focus
on Britain's trade deficit.

The French banking industry was shocked at the depth of Credit Lyonnais'
problems and the scale of the rescue package announced earlier this year.
Unfortunately, it now appears that the bank's prospects are even grimmer
than outlined then. Yesterday's report into the state-controlled bank is a
corporate horror story of reckless managers and negligent owners. But the
most worrying aspect is the chairman's suggestion that there is more bad
news to come.
It had appeared that Mr Jean Peyrelevade had quickly got a measure of the
bank's problems after taking control last November. But Credit Lyonnais is
now certain to incur further big losses in the first half of this year. That
only increases the need and urgency to raise fresh capital to shore up the
bank's solvency ratios. The likelihood of rights issues at discounts to book
value will dilute the returns available to existing shareholders.
At some point, though, a strong recovery story could emerge. It would be
folly to buy Credit Lyonnais shares while the scale of provisioning is
unknown. But as the Swedish banking sector illustrates, sentiment can swing
astonishingly quickly once hard evidence emerges that the worst is past.
Credit Lyonnais has a solid retail banking franchise in France. It has
bought some sound businesses abroad - even if it paid too much for them -
and controls an Dollars 11bn portfolio of industrial holdings. As a
massively-geared bet on European recovery, Credit Lyonnais may one day have
its attractions. But before then, existing shareholders - and French
taxpayers - will have much pain to endure.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Inquiry spreads the blame for Credit Lyonnais losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A French parliamentary inquiry yesterday criticised ministers and leading
civil servants as well as bank regulators and directors for allowing the
state-owned Credit Lyonnais bank to run up record losses and bad debts.
The National Assembly's nine-week investigation, led by its president, Mr
Philippe Seguin, said that Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who headed Credit Lyonnais
from 1988 until his removal last November, 'carries the chief
responsibility' for the bank's 'bulimic appetite for acquisitions, bad risk
judgment, pursuance of relations with dubious clients, inadequate controls,
and misjudgment of the business cycle'.
But in calling for stricter management controls by the state and the Banking
Commission, the report spreads wide the blame for giving free rein to Mr
Haberer's banking ambitions and excesses.
It also describes as 'astonishing' the government's decision not to dismiss
Mr Haberer outright last summer when - by his own admission - Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, had lost confidence in the Credit Lyonnais
chief. Mr Haberer was instead shifted to another state banking post from
which he was only removed in March on news of Credit Lyonnais's 1993 record
loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 840m). Mr Alphandery told the inquiry the
government had wanted to get rid of Mr Haberer gently so as not to
destabilise Credit Lyonnais in particular and the Paris market in general.
The report's publication has renewed calls for the Balladur government to
carry out its eventual plan to privatise Credit Lyonnais.
The relative speed with which the National Assembly has conducted its
inquiry and the fact that it has not turned up any new skeletons may relieve
the concern of Credit Lyonnais's new president, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, that
his restructuring plans might be jeopardised.
The Socialists who appointed Mr Haberer also seemed relieved yesterday at
not coming in for more criticism from the conservative majority on the
parliamentary inquiry. However, Mr Michel Sapin, a former Socialist finance
minister, is criticised for re-appointing Mr Haberer to Credit Lyonnais in
1992. Mr Sapin now serves on the monetary policy committee of the Bank of
France, whose governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, is criticised for lax
surveillance of the troubled bank when he was director of the French
Treasury.
In his report, Mr Seguin says the effectiveness of the state as Credit
Lyonnais's shareholder was 'close to nil'. But the parliamentary report also
takes the bank's 'independent' directors to task for failing to exercise any
control on the Haberer management, and says only directors representing the
bank's staff made any effort at control.
The publication of the report coincided with the announcement of Credit
Lyonnais's proposed sale of its controlling stake in Fnac, the largest music
and books retailer in France, to Mr Francois Pinault, the entrepreneur who
is a creditor of the bank and who recently joined its board as an
independent director.
Mr Pinault, whose family holdings control the Pinault-Printemps retail
group, has agreed to pay FFr1.9bn for the 64.6 per cent stake in Fnac held
by Altus, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. The disposal is part of an
aggressive programme of asset sales initiated by Mr Peyrelevade.

FT  13 JUL 94 / German forces cleared for UN actions: Historic court
decision removes ambiguity over participation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The green light for German troops to participate in future United Nations'
operations outside the Nato area was yesterday given by the constitutional
court in Karlsruhe, the highest legal authority in the country.
The historic judgment removes the constitutional ambiguity which prevented
Germany from participating directly in the Gulf war and in virtually all UN
military operations.
The decision means German forces will be able to take part in both
peacekeeping and peacemaking exercises of the UN, provided the German
parliament approves each operation.
It says the Bundeswehr can take part in international missions as part of
Germany's international alliances, including Nato and the Western European
Union, in carrying out decisions of the UN Security Council, or directly
under the authority of the UN itself.
The judgment was instantly welcomed by the German government, its Nato
allies, including US president Bill Clinton, and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general, as a move which would enable Germany to play its full
part in international peace operations.
It was also welcomed by the German opposition Social Democratic party (SPD),
which brought the legal challenge to the constitutional court, as an
essential measure to clarify a longstanding grey area in the German
constitution.
In two important ways, however, the constitutional court has given future
German governments greater room for manoeuvre than the SPD had hoped. It
makes no distinction between peacekeeping and peacemaking operations, and it
requires a simple majority vote in the Bundestag rather than the two-thirds
majority necessary to override the constitution.
The decision was announced as part of a 142-page judgment by the court on
the participation of German military personnel in three UN-sanctioned
operations outside the Nato area - the aerial surveillance by Awacs aircraft
of the 'no-fly zone' in Bosnia; the involvement of a German frigate in
enforcing the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia in the Adriatic; and the
attempt to enforce peace in Somalia, from which Germany has now withdrawn.
In each case, the court concluded that the exercise did not contravene the
German constitution, but it called for the two exercises in former
Yugoslavia to be sanctioned retrospectively by the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the judgment as confirmation of the
government's policy of stepping up its involvement in UN missions, but
hastened to say it would not necessarily lead to a rash of decisions to send
German soldiers abroad.
'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he said at a press conference in
Berlin with Mr Clinton. 'We are not going to create a mood of 'Germans to
the front'.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Three into one might go: FT writers examine the
integrationist agenda of Ukraine and Belarus and Russia's possible response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In choosing their new presidents, the citizens of Ukraine and Belarus have
indicated two preferences. First, they have opted for relatively fresh faces
as head of state, who might plausibly offer release from economic and
political collapse and who can claim not (yet) to be corrupted by power and
its pickings. Second, they have indicated that they favour a strategy of
integration with Russia.
The terms of this approach have yet to be defined but, if pursued, a union
of the three former Soviet Slav states could emerge. This idea has been
lurking in the background since their leaders created the nucleus of what
became the Confederation of Independent States in December 1991. Its time,
many believe, may have come again.
Though President-elect Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and President-elect
Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus may prefer this agenda, it will be Russia
which sets the pace. It is not yet clear how strong is Russia's desire for
union. While the first two countries can claim - and sometimes do claim - to
be central European, Russia's concerns sprawl out to the east. It is deeply
committed economically, politically and militarily in central Asia and the
Caucasus to its south and east.
The Russian political class is divided. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian
prime minister, appears to want a union with at least Belarus at almost any
cost. On a trip to the capital, Minsk, two weeks ago to support Mr
Vyacheslav Kebich, the head of parliament whose bid for the presidency,
regarded as a foregone conclusion, crashed to humiliating defeat on Sunday,
he promised that a draft treaty on economic union would be ready by the end
of this month.
But Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier for the economy charged with
producing this text, has been cautious and ambiguous. He has emphasised the
'many problems' in aligning the two states' currencies and in concluding a
union of the two central banks, which would see Belarus again become,
economically, the north-western province of Russia it was in Tsarist and
Soviet times. Belarus baulks at destroying the core institutions of its
economic sovereignty, and wants to exchange its currency, trading at
one-tenth of a rouble, to one to one. Russia's harassed economic managers
know that to cede these demands would drive a hole through their hard-won
achievement of relatively low inflation.
The choice for Russia is between economic reform at home and concentration
on the emotive national feelings which find a focus in the 25m ethnic
Russians outside Russia's borders, many of whom want to be reunited with
their homeland.
Dr Alexei Arbatov, a strategic specialist, says the present Russian ruling
elite is vulnerable because 'it came to power as a result of the break-up of
the Soviet Union which made millions of Russians homeless against their
will'. Eleven million of the 25m expatriate Russians live in Ukraine and
make up the majority in the Ukrainian province of Crimea  - where they are
agitating for a status close to independence.
Russian polls continually show the popularity of integration, and of those
politicians who speak for it - from radical economic reformer Gregory
Yavlinsky on the democratic side, to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
ultra-nationalist deputy, on the totalitarian one. Ethnic and religious
closeness, disbelief in the independent statehoods of Ukraine and Belarus,
great-power pride - all have a part to play in the Russian mood.
But Russian advocates for reunion could be disappointed with Ukraine's new
president. Although Mr Kuchma campaigned for a friendlier co-existence with
Russia, along the lines of Austria's relationship with kindred Germany, he
is no supporter of an Anschluss.
Nonetheless, Mr Kuchma's election is likely to usher in a honeymoon in the
often querulous relations between Moscow and Kiev. For a start, Mr Kuchma is
on kissing terms with his fellow former industrialist and Kremlin
power-broker, Mr Chernomyrdin. Their friendship should get a further boost
from Mr Kuchma's conciliatory stance on the issues which have most deeply
divided Ukraine and Russia over the past months: the contested Crimean
peninsula, whose citizens backed the new Ukrainian president, and the
Ukrainian half of the Black Sea fleet, which Mr Kuchma is willing to sell to
Russia.
Other hard edges in the Ukrainian-Russian relationship, particularly Kiev's
economic policies, which dictate that exporters must surrender half of their
earnings to the state at an artificially low rate of exchange, are also
likely to be softened with Mr Kuchma's victory. The shift is likely to be
one of style as much as substance. In contrast to Mr Kravchuk's
administration, which had an unfortunate tendency to view Russia as a hungry
wolf ever plotting to devour vulnerable Ukraine, Mr Kuchma sees a warm
relationship with Russia, upon which it is utterly reliant for gas and oil,
as his nation's only way out of its economic duress.
But for all his goodwill, Mr Kuchma is likely to discover that drawing the
Russian bear into too close an embrace is a risky business. For one thing,
he must take care not to alienate fiercely nationalistic western Ukraine, an
effort he has already begun with his increasing use of the Ukrainian
language in public appearances and initial conciliatory calls for 'unity'
upon his electoral victory.
Moreover, despite his desire for closer economic links with Russia, Mr
Kuchma himself has made clear he will not pay the price of surrendering real
sovereignty. On the campaign trail, he rejected the idea of abandoning
Ukraine's separate currency in favour of joining the rouble zone, 'because
that would mean the end of our independence'.
The danger is that Mr Kuchma, and many of his supporters in eastern Ukraine,
have a perilous inclination to want to have their cake and eat it. In the
depressed industrial cities of the east, Mr Kuchma's winning slogan of
closer economic ties with Russia tapped into nostalgia for the halcyon days
of the Soviet Union, when cheap Russian oil and Soviet factory orders made
Ukraine's industrial heartland a relatively prosperous region. But those
days are over; if it is to prosper, Ukraine, too, must reform its own
economy rather than look for a saviour from the east.
The outlook for integration is different in neighbouring Belarus, once the
most biddable of Soviet states but now ruled by a firebrand. Mr Lukashenko,
most of whose professional life has been spent managing collective farms,
was a member of parliament who, as head of a commission on corruption, made
a series of allegations against leading ministers that they were corrupt. In
the course of his campaign, he claimed there was an assassination attempt
against him which the police said he had staged himself. His one public
appearance in Moscow was under the auspices of Mr Zhirinovsky, whose Liberal
Democratic party yesterday congratulated the Belarussian people on their
good fortune for having him as a leader.
On Russia he has been super-integrationist, unlike Ukraine's more
independent-minded Mr Kuchma. He was the only deputy to vote against the
creation of the CIS in 1991 because it destroyed the Soviet Union, and he
has said that an economic union with Russia should be complemented by a
political one. At the same time, his programme says he will 'substantially
increase' the independence of the central bank of Belarus, and initiate a
'regime of direct economic management of state enterprises' - moves wholly
out of kilter with the economy's submission to Moscow.
Mr Lukashenko, in short, has either no idea what to do, or too many ideas.
He expresses the very common disgust of Belarussians over their inert and
allegedly corrupt government - but he gives little indication how he means
to do better.
He would seem to be an exotic post-communist flower - produced suddenly,
with the hectic bloom of the ultra-reformer, claiming the mandate of an
aggrieved people. His programme and campaign were unconstrained and vivid
against the greyness of Belarussian politics: but he, like Mr Kuchma in
Ukraine, inherits one of the most constrained posts of any contemporary
state.

Surely there are enough professional bodies of accountants in the UK? The
DTI obviously thinks not for it has just announced that members of the
Gateshead-
based Association of International Accountants are now authorised to carry
out audits.
No doubt, concern about spreading the cake too thinly is at the root of the
dismissive noises coming from rivals.
Perhaps they should not worry too much. The AIA's own auditor, Francis
Hoogewerf who is a member of the AIA, has decided not to apply to be
registered under the new auditing regulations in the UK. He has therefore
had to be replaced by a firm of chartered accountants, BDO Binder Hamlyn.

Given all the hype about the wonders of global communications, making an
international telephone call ought to be getting easier. Yet a growing
number of organisations in the US seem intent on taking a giant step
backwards by installing electronic switchboards which tell callers to punch
in the name of the person they wish to speak to 'using the letters on your
telephone'.
The result is to render incommunicado callers from Britain and many other
parts of Europe, where letters disappeared from telephone dials years ago.
Odder still, the European Commission's Washington office has taken to using
one of the machines. Has it gone native? Or does nobody from Europe ever try
to call?

Is Germany being wholly up-front about its threatened ban on British beef
because of 'mad cow disease'? Some of its ministers seem to be rather
partial to the stuff, even in an election year.
At a ministerial dinner in Dortmund City Hall on Saturday night, hosted by
employment and social affairs minister Norbert Blum for his EU colleagues,
beef was definitely the flavour of the evening.
First course: Fillet of beef Carpaccio. Third course: Fillet of Angus beef.
The Dortmund Rathaus catering staff were under strict instructions not to
comment on the source of the fare.
The German-British Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, had no such inhibitions
about identifying the nationality of the fillet steak served at its annual
dinner at the Dorchester last week.
It was British. Well, it would be mad to miss that opportunity, wouldn't it?

The death of Sir Kenneth Kleinwort, 59, means that another of the City's
merchant banking dynasties is nearing its end.
Sir Kenneth, son of Ernest Kleinwort, started work at the bank in 1955 and
although he never carried the same weight in the City as his father, he
remained the nominal head of a widespread family which is said to control up
to 20 per cent of one of the City's best known merchant banks.
The family will continue to be represented on the board by David Peake, the
former chairman who is married to Susanna Kleinwort, and David Benson, a
member of the other founding family, remains a non-executive director.
However, it is most unlikely that there will ever be another Kleinwort on
the board of Kleinwort Benson.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Maximum factors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nelson Mandela has probably been waiting for this all his life. The final
accolade; the ultimate triumph; the crowning glory. He is - wait for it -
'the international figure with the highest Factor X rating'.
Admittedly, he still comes below Haagen-Dazs (an ice-cream), Sol (a beer),
Jack Nicholson (an actor) and the Scottish Highlands (a geographic
location). But he beats Hillary Clinton (a lawyer), Body Shop (a perfumier)
and Nintendo (a torture).
What precisely is 'Factor X'? Mazda Cars (UK) has found itself with time on
its hands from selling cars and decided to commission a piece of unusually
profound market research. 'In order better to understand what consumers were
saying about Mazda, we needed to clarify two things: what 'a Nineties feel'
is, and what other things, people and places have it,' says the company.
So Mazda bought the services of a social psychologist to interpret some
'qualitative research group discussions'. This has given rise to some
startling insights. 'Something with Factor X certainly has 'je ne sais quoi'
and has undoubtedly got 'it'.'
Beyond that, not much. Mazda tells us sausages have least Factor X of all
food, while Essex is bottom of the list for places.
Funnily enough, Mazda is narrowly beaten into second place (by Mercedes) in
the top 10 list for cars, with poor old Ford at the bottom.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Report card on the Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite nearly 18 months of falling unemployment, the issue of jobs and
skills remains close to the top of the nation's agenda. The Training and
Enterprise Councils, the private sector-led bodies which run UK training,
carry an important part of the responsibility for handling the issue with
care and competence. As they meet in conference in Birmingham today, the
report card - after four years and nearly Pounds 2bn per annum of public
money - is mixed.
About one quarter of young people leaving Youth Training go straight on to
the dole, and less than one-third of adults leave the Training for Work
scheme for a job. These programmes are achieving better results than in
pre-Tec days, but the results are still not good enough and Tec directors
should be pressing their organisations to do better. One reason that they
are not doing so is that directors' real concerns tend to lie in the more
glamorous, but thinly funded, areas of local economic development and
training the already employed.
On the positive side, the message from the survey of Tec directors published
in today's Financial Times is that the organisations are developing a sense
of their own collective identity, and are thinking their way forward in a
constructive manner. They seem to recognise, for example, that the problem
is not simply a matter of an inadequate supply of skilled people, but also a
result of unambitious company strategies which are not placing sufficient
emphasis on improving employees' skills. Hence their legitimate interest in
economic development and in achieving something akin to the financial and
institutional clout of German chambers of commerce. Our Tec survey shows
strong interest in compulsory registration of companies with the local Tec,
in mergers with chambers of commerce, and in some independent funding via a
levy to promote in-company training.
Much of this is not yet on the government's agenda, but persistent pressure
from the Tecs could help to put it there. In the meantime, the Tecs are
right to call for better incentives to take up Investors in People, now
three years old, which acknowledges the connection between skills and the
broader world of products and markets. IIP has attracted disappointingly few
companies to date, although there has been a welcome pick up in recent
months.
Whether bodies which regard themselves as devoted to raising business
quality in general, and in-company training in particular, should also have
a monopoly in running large-scale training schemes for the unemployed
remains an open question. For the time being the arguments for continuity
should prevail. Britain's training infrastructure has suffered from too much
rapid change and, in any case, the best training providers tend to be
organisations which conduct both in-company training and schemes for the
unemployed.
Tecs need appropriate public scrutiny - and it is unsettling to see how many
private sector directors are opposed to greater openness - but the
government should listen carefully to the Tecs' continuing complaints of
muddle and bureaucracy. It should also ensure that as the economic recovery
becomes better established, the urgency does not seep out of the training
debate. The government might, indeed, set an example by bringing forward its
own welcome proposals for a modern apprenticeship scheme, along with the
consultations on universal training and education credits for 16 to 19 year
olds.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Lyonnais losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's French parliamentary report into losses at state-owned Credit
Lyonnais makes sobering reading. The document describes 'incompetence,
imprudence and lack of seriousness' at the helm of one of Europe's largest
banks, which made a net loss of FFr6.9bn last year. Additionally, it
identifies contradictions in the French state's role as shareholder. In view
of grave past errors by the bank and the regulatory authorities, there is
clearly a need for the greatest vigilance on the terms of the rescue package
proposed for the bank by the Paris government.
France traditionally has regarded nationalised banks as a way of expanding
economic policy muscle. Yet the state generally seems not to have encouraged
actively the management decisions leading to Credit Lyonnais' troubles. On
the other hand, the finance ministry failed to carry out its duty to check
the build-up of problematic assets from the late 1980s onwards. In its
involvement with Credit Lyonnais, the public sector appears to have reaped
the worst of bargains: minimum control and maximum losses.
The difficulties stem from ill-judged corporate loans, property losses, and
an unprofitable drive to expand internationally. It would be wrong to blame
these problems purely on public sector parentage. As the US savings and
loans saga illustrates, there is no shortage of examples of private sector
institutions that have had to be bailed out at the cost of the taxpayer,
after suffering large losses from imprudent activities.
Yet the cloying relationships in the French governmental establishment may
have contributed to the excessive amount of leeway given to Mr Jean-Yves
Haberer, a former director of the French treasury, who headed Credit
Lyonnais up to last year. Top French civil servants can over-estimate their
ability to circulate faultlessly among public sector jobs. In a more
transparent system, Credit Lyonnais' mistakes might have been corrected in a
more timely fashion.
The question now is how the bank can rebuild its balance sheet and
profitability. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new chairman, has launched a
radical programme of cost-cutting and asset sales. He has orchestrated a
large package of public sector aid, including FFr3.5bn in direct government
capital injections. The European Commission has indicated it will closely
scrutinise the measures for possible breaches of competition rules. Brussels
must make clear that it will approve help for the bank only if it is
accompanied by measures likely to secure eventual privatisation. Restoring
Credit Lyonnais' fortunes will require hard decisions. The pity is that they
were not made earlier.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Atlantic dialogue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In December 1989, a month after the wall was breached, US Secretary of State
James Baker made a speech in Berlin in which, as well as calling for German
reunification within Nato, he proposed 'a strengthened set of institutional
and consultative links' between the European Community (as it then was) and
the US.
It was a thoughtful and imaginative speech, which foreshadowed almost
uncannily what has become the Clinton administration's policy towards
Europe. Yesterday President Clinton was himself in Berlin, for a visit full
of symbolism. As the first US president to visit a reunited Berlin, and the
last to review a US garrison there, he inevitably struck a triumphal note.
But he also held a US-EU summit in Berlin with Mr Helmut Kohl, as chairman
of the European Council, and Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission.
This meeting was deliberately staged as the climax of Mr Clinton's third
visit to Europe this year. He and his advisers have been working hard to
demonstrate that they do have a European policy as well as a Russian policy,
and that the two are not completely disconnected. They talk, in a conscious
echo of the EU's own phraseology, about 'deepening and widening the
transatlantic community', sometimes even about the need to build a new one
rather than prop up the old. They believe, moreover, that this must involve
a strong bilateral relationship between the US and an EU expanding eastward
under German leadership.
That was very much Mr Baker's theme. He saw that Nato, even if still
essential in an adapted form, could never provide a satisfactory
institutional framework for this new transatlantic community. Nato puts too
much emphasis on military forces, at a time when military aspects of
security are no longer the most immediate or most decisive; and Nato casts
the US in more of a dominant role in Europe than it now needs or is willing
to play. Europe as such is not represented in Nato.
Yet nearly five years after Mr Baker spoke, work on building this new
community has hardly begun. For that the main responsibility lies with
Europe. US presidential visits are still treated as a kind of beauty
contest, with each European country striving to demonstrate that its
relationship with the US is the most 'special'; and yet EU members seem to
find it easier to agree on free trade with Russia than with the US. In spite
of all the sound and fury surrounding Maastricht, Europe has still not
endowed itself with the capacity to manage collectively, in a coherent and
integrated manner, what is surely its most important external relationship.

FT  13 JUL 94 / 'I am just a number . . .': Andrew Adonis asks if a UK
identity system is creeping in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They seek him here, they seek him there, those Frenchmen seek him
everywhere.
Is he in Heaven, is he in Hell? That damned elusive Pimpernel.
The Scarlet Pimpernel had fled to the UK, of course, where there are no
national identity cards to uncloak him. But for how much longer will his
hideaway be safe?
Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, believes the UK is slipping towards
a national identity regime. This is the result, he says, not of a formal
policy but of the growing use of identification numbers and cards for
purposes other than those originally intended, without any public debate as
to the merits of such a course.
The most immediate and serious threat he sees is the plan to put photographs
on driving licences issued from 1996. If that happens, Mr Howe argues
driving licences might become a general means of identification. He cites
California, where the state government has started issuing 'non-driver
driving licences' for that purpose.
Mr Howe highlights another significant trend: the growing use of National
Insurance numbers for non-insurance purposes. NI numbers were originally
used for keeping track of insurance contributions and benefits. Now they are
also used for income tax and, more recently, for personal equity plans and
tax-exempt savings accounts. Further, 'child reference numbers' are now
issued for the payment of child benefit. The number, conferred at birth,
becomes the individual's NI number at the age of 16. It is easy to see NI
numbers becoming, in effect, national identity numbers.
At the same time, the social security department is considering using
'swipe' cards - similar to bank cash-machine cards - to replace benefits
payments books. There is also the possibility of National Health Service
numbers spreading beyond the NHS.
These trends alarm Mr Howe, who is about to retire after 10 years as data
protection watchdog. He says the dangers are 'too fundamental for the UK to
allow itself simply to slip into having a de facto national identification
system without the necessary restrictions and safeguards'.
Should we be concerned at the rise by stealth of national identity cards and
numbers? The case against identity cards has traditionally focused on their
implications for the citizen's relations with the police. Identity cards
used during the second world war were discontinued in the early 1950s, after
Lord Chief Justice Goddard ruled that obliging citizens to produce cards
'tends to make people resentful of the acts of the police and inclines them
to obstruct the police instead of to assist them'.
Increasingly, however, concern is moving to the implication of national
identity numbers - not cards - for the way personal information on
individuals is treated.
Mr Howe is already in dispute with the financial services industry about the
transfer of personal financial details between credit organisations without
the consent of the individual concerned. The industry argues that such
disclosure is essential to prevent fraud; Mr Howe believes that in most
cases individuals should have control over access.
Civil liberties groups fear that access to, for instance, social security
records could spread in a similar way through a national identity system.
The experience of Sweden is a salutary warning. 'Personal identity numbers'
(PINs), which Sweden has had since 1947, are now used in virtually all
public transactions, from health and tax to banking and nursery waiting
lists. 'You need them for everything, and to change your number you need a
sex change,' says Ms Anitha Bondestam, director of Sweden's data inspection
board, a state regulator.
Ms Bondestam believes that assigning all-purpose numbers to individuals
poses a 'serious threat' to civil liberties. She cites a 23-year-old woman
who recently had a care order imposed on her two-year-old son on the grounds
that she was a drug abuser. After much anguish, it turned out that a drug
abuser had consistently been using her number in dealings with the police
and hospitals - 'and nobody challenged it because the number was correct'.
Ms Bondestam says: 'The use of these numbers has been taken too far, without
us quite understanding how it all came about.' She argues that numbers are
rapidly taking the place of face-to-face contact. 'The bank, the insurance
company and the national authorities don't want to have contact with their
customers because, through the numbers, automation is much less trouble. So
now if we walk into a bank, we feel like intruders.'
Sweden is trying to row back. Recent legislation will restrict the use of
identity numbers, notably by the financial services industry, and plans are
under way for a privacy law.
That may go some way to allaying the concerns, but not necessarily slow the
spread of information. After all, the transfer of data, electronically or
otherwise, does not require cards or PINs. Plain old names and addresses are
quite good enough.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Enter at their peril: Europe's pride in itself is undermined
by its treatment of asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro-pean Union has a high opinion of itself. It likes to talk about
'European civilisation' and 'European values', suggesting that such things
as freedom, democracy and human rights are European inventions, which other
parts of the world either have learnt or should learn from Europe.
But does the EU conduct itself, towards people approaching from outside, in
a way that might convince them there is any substance to such a claim? The
question is prompted by a recent paper from Amnesty International (AI),
entitled Europe: the need for minimum standards in asylum procedures.*
People who seek political asylum in Europe are taking talk about 'European
values' seriously. Fleeing maltreatment in their own countries, they expect
higher standards in Europe. So, if it sets any real store by its self-image,
Europe has a responsibility to live up to its claims in dealing with such
people. On AI's evidence, it is not doing too well.
I have previously taken the UK to task for its treatment of asylum seekers,
particularly the practice of detention without trial. After reading the AI
paper, I have to say that Britain is not the worst European country in its
treatment of asylum applicants.
The paper does not deal specifically with the issue of detention, but it is
clear that this practice is pretty well universal. About one country which
we look forward to welcoming as an EU member next January, the authors
observe that 'it appears to be the intention of the Austrian government to
deal with practically all asylum requests while the person involved is in
administrative detention', and 'in many cases the detention centre does not
allow asylum seekers to make a telephone call'.
Here are some other samples of continental practice:
In France, an Algerian policeman and his young wife, who fled after
receiving death threats from the 'armed Islamic movement', were refused
refugee status on the grounds that 'manifestly, they have nothing to fear
from the Algerian state'. In Belgium, lawyers representing detained asylum
seekers obtained a court order requiring the government to give them 48
hours' notice of the date and time of appeal hearings. The minister of the
interior announced he would fight this 'absurd decision' all the way on
appeal and, if necessary, would bring in legislation to overturn it.
Even in the Netherlands, which has a better reputation than most, 35 Zairean
refugees were on the point of being sent back to Togo because the Dutch
foreign ministry stated formally that it had contacted the representative of
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lome, the Togolese capital, and
that UNHCR considered Togo safe enough for them to return there. UNHCR has
no representative in Lome.
All European states have taken measures to make it more difficult for asylum
seekers to get to their countries in the first place. Airlines face fines if
they bring into a country people who do not have the required visa and
travel documents. Yet many bona fide refugees do not have travel documents,
and many countries have imposed visa requirements with the express purpose
of keeping refugees out. Why else would one European country after another,
since mid-1992, have imposed such a requirement on nationals of
Bosnia-Hercegovina?
Every European state, it seems, now seeks to avoid considering the substance
of each asylum application by asking whether there is a 'safe third country'
to which the applicant could be returned because he/she passed through it on
the way from their country of origin; an asylum claim is supposed to be
examined in the first EU state the claimant arrives in. All too often this
leads to refugees being bounced back and forth, as each state tries to claim
they are not its responsibility.
This should be called the Pilate Principle, after its most famous
exponent.** One effect is to prevent the reunion of refugee families. You
get absurd cases, such as that of the Bosnian refugee who was unable to join
his wife and children in Switzerland because he had no passport. Instead he
came to the UK, under a scheme for wounded or disabled Bosnians, but after
12 months he had still not been given refugee status, and his wife and
children had not been allowed to join him.***
So far, efforts to co-ordinate policy have generally made matters worse. As
the AI paper puts it, 'states have shown a tendency to stimulate each other
in changing their asylum procedures in a way which has reduced the level of
protection'. Protection of refugees, that is. States, of course, are more
concerned to 'protect' themselves against unwanted immigrants, and fear that
'a good asylum procedure can be a 'pull factor' which would lead increased
numbers of asylum-seekers to try to come to a particular country'.
At least that fear could be allayed if all European states bound themselves
to observe a common minimum standard of fairness in their treatment of
applicants, as AI suggests. Instead of tightening up procedures for fear of
seeming more attractive to refugees than their neighbours, states could
adopt a more liberal approach, secure in the knowledge that their neighbours
were doing the same. That would give the notion of 'European values' a more
positive content.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Personal View: Rulebook written in a modern style - Donald
Brash explains the thinking behind New Zealand's planned reform of banking
supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD BRASH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In November 1991, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand began a review of the way
in which banking supervision was being conducted. We had been formally
involved in banking supervision for five years, and a review seemed a
sensible course of action. More than two years later we are finally nearing
the implementation of a very different approach.
What took so long? The more we looked at the matter, the more complex the
issues became. Why should we have a special supervisory regime for banks at
all? If we retained a special regime, who should operate it - the central
bank, as at present, or some other public sector agency?
After a great deal of discussion, we decided that banks are 'special' for a
variety of reasons, including their unique role in the payments system, and
do warrant a special legislative or regulatory structure - at least until
the risks in the present payments system can be resolved by moving to a real
time gross settlement system (planned for 1995 in both New Zealand and the
UK).
We were relatively relaxed about who should run that system. We decided to
stay with the status quo and continue to perform banking supervision
ourselves, in part because of the cost of operating multiple, specialised
agencies in a small country.
The question remained - how best could this function be performed?
From an early stage, we had some concerns about what we were then doing,
which was a conventional approach to banking supervision based on Basle
minimum capital ratios, careful assessment of confidential information and
the establishment of prudential rules.
We were concerned first about the efficiency and compliance costs of banking
supervision. In the US, studies suggest that the costs of complying with
prudential regulations can amount to as much as 14 per cent of all
non-interest costs for some banks. Efficiency costs may be even larger.
We were concerned also about the risk to the taxpayer. In a country where
government does not guarantee bank deposits and where there is also no
deposit insurance, there would nevertheless be enormous pressure on
government to compensate depositors if a bank were to fail. Depositors might
well argue, for example, that, since the public sector established the rules
within which banks must operate, and had access to vastly more detailed
information on bank financial strength than was available to the public, the
public sector has a very strong moral obligation to protect depositors in
the event of a bank failure.
This might not have mattered, perhaps, if we could be confident that the way
in which we conducted banking supervision could significantly reduce the
likelihood of bank failure. But we were not confident of this.
To begin with, most of our assessment of bank financial strength was based
on historical information. Almost by definition, bank management had seen
any problem before we received the return - and it was probably at least a
year too late to forestall the problem.
Second, we observed that, over the last 20 or 30 years, most banking
problems which have occurred around the world have been the result of either
fraud or very sharp changes in macro-economic conditions, associated with
dramatic changes in asset prices.
Banking supervision seemed relatively impotent in the face of fraud and not
the most effective policy instrument to deal with dramatic changes in asset
prices.
Perhaps most serious of all, anecdotal evidence began to mount that banking
supervision by a public sector agency tends to reduce the monitoring of bank
behaviour by others, many of whom have primary responsibility for monitoring
banks, namely bank managers and bank directors.
Indeed, in many cases it seemed that the more intensive the supervision by
the central bank, the less intensive was the supervision by bank directors.
If that anecdotal evidence reflected an underlying reality, banking
supervision might actually increase the risk of bank failure.
The way in which we now propose to supervise banks has the following key
features:
We will continue to register banks - in other words, authorise a company to
call itself a bank.
We will retain the Basle risk-weighted minimum capital ratio of 8 per cent.
(This is probably not strictly consistent with the philosophy underlying our
new approach, but is a practical way of retaining a point of contact with
the international regime in a situation where most of our banks are owned
overseas.)
We will require a high level of public disclosure of financial information
about banks, on a quarterly basis, with six-monthly audit, and with
directors required to attest to the accuracy of that information and to the
adequacy of the bank's internal controls.
We will require all banks to disclose any credit rating they may have in
their quarterly disclosure statements - and, when they do not have a credit
rating, to disclose that fact. We will monitor banks essentially on the
basis of the publicly-available information (though we will retain the right
to seek clarification if publicly-disclosed information is unclear or
appears inaccurate).
We will remove most of our existing prudential rules. (The quarterly
disclosure statements will, however, include information on the extent of
risk concentration in banks' portfolios.)
We will continue to maintain a capacity to intervene in a banking crisis, by
appointing a statutory manager if necessary, but only for systemic reasons.
This approach to banking supervision will not eliminate taxpayer risk,
although it should reduce it. Nor will it eliminate efficiency and
compliance costs, although those too should be reduced.
But the new approach should substantially increase the incentives on bank
managements and boards to take full responsibility for the soundness of
their own banks and indeed to improve the soundness of their own.
It is easy to dismiss this approach to banking supervision in New Zealand as
irrelevant to other countries because such a high proportion of our banks
are owned by large international banks.
I argue the reverse is the case. Given the high percentage of foreign
ownership of banks in New Zealand, no system of banking supervision is going
to make a huge difference to the risk of bank failure.
Were more banks finally accountable to local boards the increased incentives
on bank directors to behave in ways conducive to the soundness of their
banks would be of even greater relevance and benefit.
How have banks reacted to this new proposal? Perhaps not surprisingly, the
strongest banks like it. No longer will all banks be 'made equal' by the
central bank's supervision and perceived guarantee; the strongest could well
be able to attract deposits at lower cost than the weaker.
It is also not too surprising that some directors show signs of uneasiness
about being accountable for the quality of their disclosed financial
information.
One bank chief executive, expressing concern at the new approach, insisted
vehemently that the central bank had to continue its present mode of banking
supervision because 'bank directors understand absolutely nothing about
banking'.
This comment is quite unfair about some bank directors, but there is an
element of truth in it in some cases. The blame for this situation almost
certainly lies with supervisors for assuming too much of the responsibility
for the viability of banks.
At this stage we are satisfied that our proposals will strengthen the New
Zealand financial system, at lower efficiency cost than the present regime
and with reduced taxpayer risk. We hope to finalise the proposals and
implement the new approach by late 1994 or early 1995.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No harm from switch to unleaded
petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr David Gidlow of Associated Octel (Letters, July 11), a major
manufacturer of lead additives for petrol, claimed that the switch to
unleaded petrol had resulted in an increase in the aromatic content of
petrol.
This is certainly not true of the UK. Dr Gidlow's own company publishes a
survey of gasoline quality which clearly shows that the aromatics content of
petrol sold in the UK has declined not increased in recent years. In fact,
this data shows that the average aromatic content of UK premium unleaded
petrol sampled in 1992 (the most recent year for which data is available) is
less than that of leaded petrol in 1988, when virtually no unleaded petrol
was sold.
Certainly some petrol will contain more than the average level of aromatics
and some will contain less.
However, if aromatics are a 'sinister threat to health', which I would
dispute, it would be the total level of aromatics that would be crucial; and
the total level of aromatics has declined, not risen, since unleaded was
introduced. This decline is due to investment by the British oil industry in
oil refinery processes such as isomerisation.
Additionally, as catalytic converters are now fitted to around a seventh of
all cars and to all new ones, any emissions associated with aromatics are
declining rapidly. There is therefore no basis for Dr Gidlow's claim that
the switch to unleaded petrol has resulted in an increase in the aromatic
content of UK petrol or of emissions associated with aromatics.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: G7 must show initiative on African
debt burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BRYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Once again the G7 Summit has done little more than utter a few pious
words when it comes to tackling Africa's debt crisis, which is one of the
greatest obstacles to human and economic recovery in the region.
The G7 said it wished to encourage the Paris Club to pursue its efforts to
improve the debt treatment of the poorest and most indebted countries.
However, this is woefully inadequate on four counts. First, repeated
rescheduling operations at the Paris Club have done little more than
marginally slow the rate at which arrears on already unpayable debt are
accumulating. Second, there is little sign of the full Trinidad Terms for
debt reduction being implemented.
Third, even the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms would not resolve
Africa's debt crisis because, as the World Bank acknowledges, only six (at
most) out of the 21 severely-indebted, low-income sub-Saharan countries
would achieve a sustainable debt-servicing position. And, finally, the Paris
Club simply does not address the problem of multinational debt owed to the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund which is a millstone around the
neck of several African countries.
In the circumstances, the UK government could do much more to spearhead a
new debt-reduction initiative. This should include the writing-off of
between 70 and 100 per cent of all debt owed to governments and immediate
action to increase the amount of debt eligible for reduction and
rescheduling. It could also insist on the IMF using its own resources to
write off a substantial proportion of the debt owed to it by African
governments. This could be done by a sale of gold stocks or a new issue of
Special Drawing Rights. Neither option would undermine the financial
standing of the IMF, generate global inflationary pressures or have
implications for the public expenditure of northern governments.
Africa's debt burden is small in global terms but its human costs are
immense. The burden can be relieved provided the political will is there. It
is time that the G7 leaders showed such leadership.

Sir, It is time to recall Michael Prowse, your north America correspondent;
the man has gone native ('Why vegetarians will inherit the earth', July 11).
It is his job to report the aberrations and foibles of the American people,
not succumb to them by becoming a vegetarian teetotaller.
His decision to eschew the pleasures of meat and alcohol seems to have been
brought about by a belief that he is joining a sect that will grow until it
rules the world because of the longevity, if not immortality, that such a
diet must assuredly bring. It may be worth reminding Prowse that earlier
this century a teetotal vegetarian thought he could rule the world. Adolf
Hitler not only spurned the eating of meat and drinking of alcohol, he was
also anti-tobacco. Ian K Lamont,

FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better value for money for water
company customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANET LANGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The suggestion by Joe Rogaly ('Hosing us for all we've got', July 12)
that most of the money from water price increases since privatisation has
been distributed in dividends is ludicrous. Just as ludicrous is the
National Consumer Council's claim in its recent report on water prices that
water companies have increased dividends to shareholders by an average 63
per cent a year.
The dividends of the ten major water and sewerage companies increased from
Pounds 338m (equivalent) in 1989-90 to Pounds 478m in 1992-93. So the
average increase was about 12 per cent a year, or 7 per cent after allowing
for inflation.
Water prices in the UK have risen in recent years for two reasons and two
reasons only. First, because of the demands on the water companies to invest
in quality and environmental standards set mainly by European Union
directives. Second, because of decades of under-investment when water was in
the public sector.
Neither Joe Rogaly nor the NCC mentions that to meet these standards the
water industry is investing twice as much each year as it makes in profits.
Or that two-thirds of these profits are consistently used to fund part of
this capital investment programme.
If this were not so, water prices would be going down in real terms, like
those for other utility services.
Ten years ago the average household bill for water and sewerage was about
Pounds 77. Today it is Pounds 199, an increase of about 160 per cent. Ten
years ago Pounds 737m was invested in water and sewerage. Last year it was
around Pounds 3bn, an increase of about 310 per cent. Is this or is this not
better value for money for water customers?

FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: Cross-dressing Japanese style - 'Takarazuka]' is the
apotheosis of kitsch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takarazuka is a show that needs psycho-analysis more than criticism. The
mysteries of cross-dressing on stage - let alone the mysteries of
cross-dressing in the Japanese theatre - are not to be gone into here.
Suffice it to say, as a television programme and a lot of press coverage
have lately made us aware, this is an all-girl show whose 'male' stars are
the darlings of Japanese house-wives. The girls' training, as television
helpfully showed us, starts them off as housemaids and they end up as Gary
Glitter. Can education aim for more?
Now Takarazuka is at the Coliseum, hideously loud, brash, slick, inexorably
vulgar, and awash with feathers and sequins, transformations, japonaiserie,
cherry-blossom, a stuffed seagull, baritone ladies singing love-songs -
though not a single scene takes place near that celebrated beauty-spot The
Well of Loneliness - and relentless smiles. It is the apotheosis of kitsch,
and is wholly uninteresting on any other terms. Yet given the heady mix of
cliches, of second-hand ideas, of feeble dance routines and witless songs,
anything better would dilute the kitsch-value.
What you must go for is the rampant fatuity, the glitz, the megawatt
seriousness of the thing, purveying mindlessly unreal fantasy in giant
Dayglo dollops. Not for our audiences, of course, those inscrutable passions
that the show inspires in the hausfraus of Tokyo, even unto offers of
marriage. (The local drag-queens are, I am told, also fans of Takarazuka's
chaps: but here we enter a world of treble-bluff identity which sets the
mind reeling). It is sexually quite peculiar, in a sanitised way, and should
be immediately comprehensible to British audiences reared on pantomime,
where the principal boy is a girl and her mother a man.
The show lasts three hours (Was that all?). The first part is the menu
touristique with tripping maidens, a samurai serenading a dead seagull (the
programme alleges it is a hawk; I was surprised it didn't claim it as the
Dodo) and cherry trees. Transformations brilliantly done. Colours very
bright. Pause to wonder why the Japanese, whose popular art - from Kabuki to
wood-block print - is so stylish, so ineffably elegant, so beautiful, can
tolerate such taradiddle. Answer comes there none.
Part two is a scena, based on an O Henry story about a bank vault, in which
a little boy (believe in that performance and, like the White Queen, you
will believe six impossible things before breakfast) is locked in the vault
for 30 years. He is, alas, rescued by a reformed bank thief engaged to the
bank owner's daughter. Songs, sober-sided dancing, a multitude of bar-boys,
a lot of auburn hair, spoken dialogue obligingly given surtitles ('I thought
he was in Africa - or Monaco'). A hero called Ralph - and you may guess how
that sounds in Japanese. Ill-controlled hysteria from your critic.
The last section - by which time I was lobotomised by neon, scene changes
and the curiously shrill tone of the amplified Japanese female singing voice
 -is called A Million Dreams. (Mine were all of escape.) Mira Anju, the star
of the show, appears in a succession of numbers, variously resembling
Michael Jackson, Makarova en smoking, Jack Buchanan, without effacing
memories of these.
She is, like Billy Bennett of blessed Music Hall memory, almost a gentleman.
A pianist goes three rounds with a Chopin etude while a quartet caper. More.
Much, much more. Someone singing By a sleepy lagoon. Someone else having a
go at Besame mucho. The roar of the big-band sound that, even so, cannot
make the score sound like music. At the end, down the obligatory stair-case
come the entire cast in pink: pink tail-suits, pink ostrich feathers, pink
Dubarry frockery. Not so much La vie en rose as L'enfer en rose. Miss Anju,
in gold pailletted tails and feathers, looks splendid. I recalled a
be-plumed Zizi Jeanmaire, whose Mon truc en plumes had more wit in ten
seconds than Takarazuka in its three hours.
It is a very odd experience indeed - a collector's piece, I suppose. My
companion thanked me 'for an unforgettable evening'. I am going to try and
forget the evening as soon as possible.
Takarazuka] is at the Coliseum until July 23. Sponsored by Mitsubishi
Corporation.

Large parts of this evening's schedule on BBC1 and ITV will be occupied by
the semi-final matches in The World Cup. If the light of your life seizes
the remote control and insists upon spending hours watching men booting a
bladder around the park, do not despair; there are treats to be found
elsewhere. The opera relayed Live From Covent Garden on Radio 3 is
Massenet's 'Manon', with Romanian soprano Leontina Vaduva returning to the
title role which won her the 1988 award for most outstanding contribution to
opera. The story (of people always on the brink of taking holy orders, but
meanwhile having a ripping time) is told in five acts. In the first interval
James Naughtie interviews conductor Colin Davies (6.55). If your tastes run
more to folk music, Instrument And Tradition brings together folk fiddlers
from around the world (8.00 Radio 2). Fin de Siecle investigates the state
of Britain after the Wars Of The Roses (8.45 Radio 4). And Robert Robinson
begins a new series of his programme Ad Lib, this time in Australia, talking
to makers of Chardonnay (11.30 Radio 4).

FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: New series freshen up the summer - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High summer, and the heat coming off the London pavements is phenomenal. In
years past this would have been a signal to the television critic to open
the garden doors, half close the curtains, and settle back on the old green
sofa to watch hours of sport, hymning the beauty of blue skies and green
pitches in the coverage of cricket at Lord's, extolling the excitement of
Channel 4's daily reports from the Tour de France, and enthusing over the
BBC's expertise at Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix. Not this year,
though. Whatever the reason - fiercer competition perhaps, or shame at the
avalanche of repeats in summers gone by - the broadcasters have been
launching almost as many new series as in an autumn season.
It would, anyway, have been hard to sustain the enthusiasm for summer sport
programmes now that dear old Johnners has gone from the cricket commentary
box, Dan Maskell and Harry Carpenter from Wimbledon and, above all, James
Hunt from the motor racing circuits. The sense of loss left by Johnners,
Maskell and Carpenter was foreseeable, but the vacuum created by Hunt's
death is a bit of a surprise. There is nothing wrong with his successor,
Jonathan Palmer, who seems highly professional. But Hunt provided such a
telling counterpoint to Murray Walker's high pitched scream. In the old days
you would see a ghastly crash with smoke and flames and wheels hurtling off
the track and Hunt would drawl 'Bit of a shunt there. Charlie Farnsbarns
must have missed his heel-toe racing change' or some such technical insight.
Hunt would have been in his element analysing Damon Hill's winning drive at
Silverstone on Sunday and is much missed.
But what of the new series? Monday brings two. All Night Long on BBC1 is a
sitcom set in an all-night bakery, staffed by life's flotsam and jetsam.
There is a kissogram girl who is periodically called out ('Time and a half
for whip work'), a novelist in a wheelchair, the shortest man who ever
worked for British Rail, Wally the cab driver, and a Romanian termagant
named Wanda. The pudding may be a little over egged, but opening episodes
are notoriously difficult and there were more laughs than in most recent
comedies.
Room 101 on BBC2, hijacked (like so much that is good on television) from
radio, is a counterpart to 'Desert Island Discs'. Here the guests nominate
their pet hates and, human nature being what it is, hearing what people
detest can be a lot more entertaining than hearing what they like. Guest
number one was Bob Monkhouse, a man revitalised by a couple of impressive
recent television performances. He did the host of Room 101, Nick Hancock,
proud, choosing splendid hate objects such as the French, Cilla Black's
singing, and two television series which Monkhouse himself has presented.
The drawback is that Hancock is determined to make the host as important as
the guest and, for no good reason, rejects most of the guest's choices.
There are two more new series on Tuesday, both on BBC2. We have, of course,
seen cook Keith Floyd on screen before, but Floyd On Italy is new. He is now
driving a gold Aston Martin and being very tetchy with his new film crew.
Perhaps the weather, clearly atrocious, is to blame. You have to admire a
man who will set up a picnic table in an ancient market square and cook for
the cameras on a camping stove while a Wagnerian thunderstorm thrashes
around him. However, while past programmes suggested Floyd has a good grasp
of French and English cookery, he seems much less at home with Italian food
and Italian habits.
Heretic which looks at 'unorthodox' scientists began well with Jacques
Benveniste, whose research suggested that homeopathic theory was right and
that water had some sort of 'memory', or could work like recording tape. The
sequence showing the editor of the famous British scientific journal Nature
visiting Benveniste's lab with a team of 'fraud busters', led by a conjuror,
was eye opening and saddening. Science may have moved on since Galileo but
the small mindedness of the doctrinaire seems to go on forever. A valuable
series.
It is the BBC once again which brings us two new series on Thursdays. The
Imaginatively Titled Punt And Dennis Show (oh dear) is a half-hour comedy
sketch programme which opens, ill advisedly, with a front-of-tabs sequence
that seems to be modelled on Morecambe and Wise. Smith and Jones tried it
and never really pulled it off, and the efforts of Steve Punt (the smaller
of the pair and uncannily like Eric Idle) and Hugh Dennis do not look much
more promising. It painlessly passes half an hour, but if this is the best
that a major channel can offer in peak time then comedy is, indeed, in a
trough. The surprise series is State Of The Ark on BBC2. These days we have
enough natural history series to sink an ark (which, according to Richard
Digance on ITV on Sunday was not at all what God told Noah to build: the
idea was actually to make a park for the animals, but being 600 years old
and hard of hearing Noah missed the 'p') yet this is rather different.
Episode 1 showed pictures of the ill treatment of animals in zoos which were
enough to enrage the most cynical of viewers. Episode 2 showed model zoos
whose owners had utterly different beliefs about their purpose: that they
should concentrate on the human onlooker; that they should concentrate on
re-stocking the wild, and so on. Excellent so far.
On Friday, ITV finally contributes a new series. Freddie Starr looks like
some ancient demo tape which might have been studied by Benny Hill at the
start of his career. Starr is keen on sight gags: the unobserved petrol
nozzle which fills up an entire car, the girl whose dress is sucked off by a
vacuum cleaner to reveal black underwear, the clockmaker who reads The
Times. He croons 1950s songs in tribute to Elvis Presley, and last week
managed to get guest Frank Bruno into a kilt . . . albeit over his trousers.
It is deeply traditional and unsophisticated stuff, but then so is Britain's
favourite form of theatre: the pantomime.
The quality of these new series varies; much is below what we might expect
from new series in the autumn season. But having complained for years about
summertime repeats we ought, surely, to acknowledge that the broadcasters
(or the BBC, anyway) have at last responded. Two cheers: hip hip . . .

FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: Glyndebourne's 'Onegin' revisited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the middle of its Glyndebourne run, Eugene Onegin - or 'Yevgeny Onyegin'
as Glyndebourne calls it - has been passed to conductor David Angus for a
couple of performances while Andrew Davies takes a break. On Monday there
was no sense of blurred carbon-copy about the music; it sounded alert,
fresh, crisply balanced.
Now that Graham Vick's production is thoroughly played in, its cool virtues
stand out in relief. (Like Richard Fairman after the first night, I find
myself on the qualified-admiration side.) The first act is played as if
observed from a detached distance: Vick likes his actors to behave as if in
a sober historical film, and nobody is to play directly to the audience for
sympathy.
As Elena Prokina's Tatyana writes her letter in a bare room, she remains
withheld, privately at grips with herself. Her small, natural gestures are
extremely touching, like her broken phrases; at the climax, however, the
voice is a touch strident, and therefore less expressive - not quite the
outpouring of feeling we wanted, just an operatic outburst.
Only Martin Thompson's appealing, desperate Lensky (and John Fryatt's
ineffable Monsieur Triquet) is allowed off the rein to make his full
impression. And that is brusquely extinguished with the duel scene, which we
watch through open barn-doors: he and Onegin march out of sight in opposite
directions before the fatal shot, and Lensky is of course never seen again.
Suddenly he is no more than a old grief of Onegin's, near-forgotten.
In productions more generous with feeling, the big formal dances at the
start of Act 3 often jar. With Vick's cooller vision, they are hardly more
formal than the rest, and he can use them satirically without contradicting
the overall tone; in fact he makes a tour de force of them, the better to
set off good, decent Prince Gremin's avowal (Frode Olsen is admirable here).
As always, Vick insists upon a moral point, and the final scene - Tatyana's
rebuff to Onegin - is played to reinforce that, not to let us wallow in
sympathy for Onegin or Tatyana.
One thing about Angus's conducting: in markedly rhythmic passages, he tried
to allow his singers time to round off phrase-ends gracefully - but they
pressed on unremittingly, leaving him to catch up. Evidently they were too
well-drilled in a tougher reading to bend. I should have liked more bending;
but it might not have suited Vick's stern style.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: La fanciulla del West - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year when even Glyndebourne has gone over to operas set on the empty
stage of post-modernism, this old production looks as if it belongs to
another era. The late 1970s were a high point at Covent Garden and La
fanciulla del West was among its golden successes.
Money was said to be short at the time, but it does not look like that now.
No doubt working on the premise that Puccini's 'Gold Rush' Western is an
opera ripe for Hollywood, the producer Piero Faggioni went to Tinseltown for
his designer, Ken Adam (of James Bond fame). His massive designs still look
impressive, especially Minnie's log cabin in the mountains, the whole
life-size structure built on stage. Who cares if changing the sets means the
intervals last 40 minutes, especially on the hottest night of the year?
The opera has returned this summer for Gwyneth Jones, who sings Minnie.
After 30 years plus service for the Royal Opera there can be few new roles
left for her. Working up through the Wagner heroines, Strauss's Frau and
Elektra, then Puccini's Turandot, she has left Minnie till last - the final
rung on the dramatic soprano's climb up the heaviest roles of the
repertoire.
Puccini himself admired Maria Jeritza in the title-role, probably stunned by
her entrance sliding down the banisters, firing her gun in mid-air. Gwyneth
Jones does not try any antics like that. Her Minnie is warm-hearted, tender,
eyelashes fluttering at the end of Act 1 as she feels love for the first
time. A tendency to lift up into notes in the early half of the evening is a
nagging annoyance, probably a sign that she was not in her best voice, but
there is no shortage of power packed in her holster.
Justino Daz makes a formidable adversary for her. His sadistic Jack Rance,
wrapped in an ankle-length white fur coat, is a dominating figure with
biting, powerful singing on the same scale, easily the best thing he has
done here. Nicola Martinucci is a reliable Dick Johnson, who rises to his
big moments eagerly. It is good to have an Italian tenor in the role and one
with a voice of the right size, even if he lacks some vocal class.
The way he and Minnie warily circle each other captures well Puccini's
subtlety as he edges their relationship forward. It is important to issue a
reminder that La fanciulla del West is not an early work. This is vintage
Puccini, cocooning the lovers at Minnie's snowbound hut with music that
knows exactly how to create a world of its own. Richard Buckley loves the
score, but unfortunately to excess. All the slow music drags and it is only
partial compensation that he finds such high-octane verve when pace is
called for.
Among the miners there are some good cameos, especially Francis Egerton's
trusty Nick, still there after 17 years. Michael Druiett makes a lowering
figure of Ashby, the Wells Fargo man, and Clive Bayley is a striking Castro.
This is not the most exciting revival the production has had (a tighter
sense of pacing would be needed for that) but it is worth catching. La
fanciulla del West is an expensive opera to put on and we can no longer
count on seeing Puccini's neglected masterpiece often.
Revival sponsored by Dr Stanley Ho. Further performances until July 23.
