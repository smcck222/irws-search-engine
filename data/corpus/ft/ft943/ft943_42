FT  13 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Same journey, different routes
 -Peter Knight assesses the effectiveness of Europe's leading environmental
campaign groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is as easy to dismiss the influence of the thousands of environmental
campaign groups across Europe as it is to take them too seriously. This is
because their activities - campaigning, exposing, protecting, conserving and
monitoring - are diffuse and difficult to measure.
Environmental politics is also highly passionate, based largely on
personalities and rife with in-fighting. This does not, however, detract
from the fact that some environmental groups enjoy an influence which is way
beyond what the unwary expect.
It was, for example, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature
which marshalled grassroots dissatisfaction with plans to build winter
Olympic facilities in environmentally sensitive areas. This brought change,
not only in Norway but deep within the Olympic movement.
The change has already affected the criteria on which Olympic bids are won -
as can be seen from the involvement of Greenpeace by the organisers of
Sydney's successful bid to host the games in 2000. The Olympic movement is
now expected to promote the environment as one of its central philosophical
pillars, which will affect the bidding cities and commercial sponsors.
The new democracies of eastern and central Europe have also witnessed a rise
in the number and influence of environment-based political groupings. And in
the UK, near-naked, drum-beating members of the Donga Tribe - a loose
affiliation of activists who practise a mild form of civil disobedience -
have attracted unprecedented middle-class support for their campaign against
the government's road-building plans.
The most influential groups in Brussels are the best established: Friends of
the Earth, Greenpeace, the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) working with BirdLife
International.
'The groups who are practised at getting their message into an easily
understandable form are these four. Top of my list are WWF and RSPB,' says
Ken Collins, MEP, chairman of the European Parliament's Environment
Committee.
The influence of the well-established European Environment Bureau, a
federation of diverse conservation and environmental groups throughout
western and eastern Europe, appears to be slipping. This is mainly because
it finds it difficult to reach consensus on controversial issues. But it
also appears to have a problem with presentation. 'Instead of making it
short and snappy they go in for awfully wearisome and hectoring briefings.
Effective lobbying is about being selective with information,' says Collins.
Ann Robinson, head of policy at the UK's Institute of Directors and the
rapporteur on the European Union's recently enacted habitats directive, says
she found the RSPB 'absolutely brilliant'. The RSPB works on a broad range
of issues, including agriculture policy, coastal issues, the North Sea and
EU structural funds.
But environmental campaigners might be in for a more difficult time in
Brussels. Business has become more effective at lobbying and there has also
been a shift towards issuing discussion papers before moving to a draft
directive.
Environmental groups can be classified according to a sliding scale of
environmental tenacity - their greenness. The scale starts at the paler
shades with groups that largely support and are supported by the
establishment, and moves towards the darker greens who are less
conventional.
WWF is the world's biggest and best-established conservation organisation
with offices in 28 countries. It is supported by business (through
sponsorship programmes), governments and eminent persons, such as His Royal
Highness Prince Philip, its international president.
Its position at the heart of the Establishment is both its strength and
weakness. It might have the ability to influence influential people and so
create change, but its associations can and do hamper its effectiveness
because of the inevitable conflict of vested interests. Maverick groups
recently won worldwide support for a ban on the ivory trade, while the WWF
was compromised by its connections and took a considerable time to swing
behind the widespread grassroots support of a ban.
Colour of green: light. Attitude: diplomatic. How effective: fast gaining a
reputation as a respected critic of some of the EU's policies, especially
its structural funds.
RSPB is the biggest and probably richest voluntary wildlife conservation
organisation in Europe, with more than 850,000 members, mainly from the UK's
middle classes. It is the UK partner in BirdLife International, which
lobbies for policies that will protect birds.
The RSPB's interest affects a broad range of policy making. Its main
principles are that: economic development should be sustainable and
bio-diversity should be maintained; concern for the environment should be an
integral part of EU policies; policy making must be open and democratic;
laws and policies protecting nature must be rigorously enforced.
Colour of green: light. Attitude: diplomatic. How effective: acknowledged as
respected and effective lobbyists in the European Parliament and the
Commission. Friends of the Earth is an international network of groups -
some calling themselves FoE and others by local names - with representation
in most parts of the world. Groups within the network enjoy a large amount
of autonomy, which means that FoE's influence is largely related to its
local strength.
If FoE differs from other environmental groups, it is in the way it extends
its involvement to social and development issues such as the rights of
indigenous peoples. It has programmes, campaigns and projects including
development banks, trade and the environment, tourism, ozone depletion,
packaging, desertification, wetlands, marine issues and forests and climate
change.
Colour of green: medium to (sometimes) dark - depending on locality.
Attitude: emphasises dialogue, sometimes with barbs. How effective:
contributes valuable information to debates, but has a limited effect on
European policy making; concentrates on the Commission rather than the
Parliament.
Greenpeace has grown fast from its Canadian origins as a one-man,
anti-nuclear crusade through highly successful anti-whaling and anti-sealing
campaigns. In 20 years, it has become a Dollars 150m operation located in 30
countries over five continents, with a fee-paying membership of nearly 5m
supporters.
Its successes and failures are based on its ability to operate in aggressive
absolutes - calling for bans and boycotts through clever information
campaigns. While the group continues to run these campaigns, maturity has
brought the inevitable dissension in the ranks and the softening of some of
its approaches. Greenpeace now says it combines its traditional direct
action with market-driven persuasion.
Colour of green: medium to dark. Attitude: prickly, direct action, research,
market-driven campaigns. How effective: good at raising awareness but
organisational problems in Brussels have reduced the group's potential to
influence directly European policy making.
European Environmental Bureau in Brussels represents around 150
environmental groups, including some members of WWF and the FoE network. Its
membership is varied and includes Ecoglasnost from Bulgaria, the
Rhododendron Eco-Club from Romania and the Czech Academy of Sciences.
Colour of green: light to medium. Attitude: represents members' views. How
effective: part of the furniture of Brussels; finds it difficult to
represent varied interests of its members.

FT  13 JUL 94 / People: Leaving Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Hearn, group operations director of Forte, is to leave the hotel and
restaurant group in September.
Management restructuring meant that his role had become less relevant. Each
of Forte's hotel brands now has its own head and the group felt there was
less need for an overall operations director.
Hearn, 52, had been with Forte for more than 20 years and was appointed to
the board in 1988.
Forte said yesterday that Hearn's decision to leave the company was not
unexpected. He had helped to introduce the new management structure and was
largely a victim of his own success.

FT  13 JUL 94 / People: Fourth generation of Bowthorpes at OCS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerald Bowthorpe 55, has been appointed managing director of OCS Group,
succeeding David Cracknell, 63, who has become group chairman, following the
retirement of Derek Goodliffe at 62. Goodliffe and Cracknell assumed control
of the company in 1975, since when it has become one of the UK's largest
privately-owned property support services companies, with annual turnover of
Pounds 230m for 1993-94.
Bowthorpe's connections with the company go back a long way; his father,
Harry Bowthorpe, played a key role in expanding the one-man window-cleaning
operation started by Frederick Goodliffe in 1900.
The group is now on to its fourth generation of Bowthorpes, with 23 members
of the family employed.
Gerald Bowthorpe joined OCS in 1957 and, apart from assisting Her Majesty's
armed forces (during national service), has been with the group ever since.
One of the many roles he has played within the group was as managing
director of a subsidiary, the New Century Cleaning company. Before this
latest appointment, he was chairman of Office Cleaning Services Ltd, the
largest OCS subsidiary.
Through acquisitions and diversifications - within the UK and overseas  -
OCS has extended far beyond its origins of providing office cleaning
services, which now account for less than 50 per cent of group income.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Green issues take off -
Airports are taking pollution to heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noise pollution is the environmental hazard most people associate with air
travel, especially those living close to airports. Other environmental
problems, however, may cause an even bigger headache.
A wide-ranging report* on airports and the environment published recently
set out the issues currently facing the industry. These include the impact
on water quality and waste management and the growing concern over the
effect of emissions on air quality.
It points out that whereas noise is the most noticeable form of pollution, a
great deal has been done to reduce it in the last 20 years  - a definition
of acceptable noise levels has been set by the International Civil Aviation
Organisation, a United Nations agency that governs global air transport.
In contrast, the complex impact on air and water quality is only just
starting to be reviewed and regulated.
Civilian aircraft are thought to emit 3 per cent of the carbon dioxide
created by humans each year, as well as a similar percentage of nitrous
oxide and sulphur dioxide. Although a small percentage, its impact on the
ozone layer is likely to be great because it is emitted at a high altitude.
The aviation proportion of overall emissions is set to rise as other
industries have taken action to reduce emission levels by switching to
alternative fuels or introducing devices such as catalytic converters.
Anne Paylor, the author of the report, writes: 'It has been said that for
every word spoken about noise problems in the aviation industry over the
past decade, 10 will be spoken about emissions in the next decade.'
The predicted boom in capacity also worries environmentalists. According to
the report, global air travel is set to double by the end of the century and
treble by 2005.
The industry is concentrating on trying to improve air traffic control which
would cut delays and excess fuel consumption.
A number of airports are also changing their environmental management plans.
Manchester airport, the third biggest in the UK, is to launch an
environmental strategy document this month which will set out targets in key
areas such as emissions, noise, water quality and waste management for
airport staff and users, including airlines.
While cagey about the exact details of the document, the airport's
environment department says it will penalise those who do not operate by its
environmental rules.
Over the last five years, the airport has spent Pounds 30m on environmental
work. It has built a new drainage system to deal with the problem of surface
water contamination - particularly that caused by the chemicals found in
conventional de-icers - and has a patent application for an infra red-based
alternative to chemical-based de-icers.
Alan Melrose, environmental control manager at Manchester, says the benefits
of such expenditure far outweigh any costs involved.
'The beauty of environmental management is that not only
is it self-financing, but certain aspects are the most profitable activities
in the business
plan.' These include low revenue costs, lower capital costs, improved
customer service and working conditions, and publicity.
The report concludes that self-regulation and financial investment by
airports can represent a high rate of return on investment because of
improved efficiency and customer relations.
Paylor says: 'Airports have taken this issue to heart because they know that
if they don't start acting responsibly now, other people will start to
impose horrendous restrictions on them. If they want to grow, they have got
to take the initiative.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: A surprise Discovery - John Griffiths seeks an
explanation for the Rover four-wheel-drive vehicle's astonishing popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measured by many conventional motoring criteria, the success of 'lifestyle'
four-wheel-drive vehicles defies logic.
They first emerged in the 1980s with aerodynamics marginally better than a
brick's; cornering poise that not even a Citroen 2CV might envy; essentially
crude suspension and other mechanical underpinnings 'borrowed' from trucks
and other utility vehicles; and poor fuel economy compared with an ordinary
car.
There has been some honing and polishing since then. But the fundamentals
are little changed and even smooth-talking motor industry marketing
directors find it hard to explain the vehicles' appeal.
Yet appeal they undoubtedly have. Growth in sales of four-wheel-drive
vehicles, many of which never stray from the highway to use their off-road
capabilities, continues to outpace that of the world car market overall. The
58,561 sold in the UK last year represented a doubling from two years
earlier and was eight times as high as 10 years ago.
Even by four-wheel-drive standards, however, the Land Rover Discovery has
been a spectacular success. Production has been increased on eight occasions
since its launch in 1989; 1,600 additional jobs have been created - and last
week Rover Group's Land Rover subsidiary announced a Pounds 68m investment
programme to expand output by another 20 per cent.
Rover Group executives now talk of the Discovery as one of the most
successful vehicles in the company's (nee BL, nee British Leyland, nee BMC)
long history. They do so not just in sales terms - although at 37,000 units
last year Discovery accounted for one half of Land Rover's global sales -
but because it was designed 'in-house', brought from design screen to
showroom in just 30 months, and has provided Rover with a virility symbol
that its design and development credentials are fully intact.
Precisely why the Discovery hit the jackpot is harder to explain, according
to Peter Wyhinny, Land Rover commercial director.
One reason sometimes advanced is the versatility of the product. Discovery
was not only designed to capitalise on the high-status image of the Range
Rover, and thus be readily accepted by companies on their executive fleets.
It was also designed with seven seats to give the carrying capacity for
school runs and leisure trips previously provided by only a few estate cars
or 'people carriers'. With rear seats folded, there is enough load space for
furniture dealers.
With the capability to tow legally nearly 4,000 kilograms, 'we were able to
make the Discovery appeal to many different people for many different
reasons', maintains Wyhinny. 'Also, once people drove it, they liked the
commanding driving position and the ability to see traffic movements ahead.'
Land Rover describes the Discovery's typical customer as over 30,
professional or with his or her own business. According to Wyhinny, more
than 50 per cent of Discovery sales are 'conquests' from other makes and
types of vehicle. Some are trade-ins from smaller and Japanese
four-wheel-drives, but many are conventional saloons. A large number of
estates are apparently being swapped.
Land Rover, meanwhile, has deliberately responded to criticisms against
four-wheel-drive vehicles in general.
While acknowledging that Discoverys will never perform like sports cars, the
company installed extra anti-roll bars to improve the vehicle's handling.
Land Rover has also gone out of its way to dispel the 'gas guzzler' image.
Owners who do not mind averaging well under 20 miles per gallon can still
specify a 3.9 litre petrol V8. But the company has also developed its own
TDi diesel, with the result that nearly 90 per cent of all Discovery sales
in Europe are 30 mpg-plus diesels.
Pricing, meanwhile, has been another important part of the strategy. The
Discovery's range has been broadened so that it now spans the Pounds
17,000-Pounds 28,000 price sector in the UK, allowing relative easy
trade-ups from the volume car market.
Not least, Land Rover has sought to keep resale values high by frowning on
excessive discounting and encouraging dealers to accept used Discovery cars
as trade-ins.
Not surprisingly Land Rover takes issue with those motor industry analysts
who say the 'lifestyle' four-wheel-drive sector is a fad that could collapse
overnight.
For supporting evidence it points to North America, where such vehicles
account for 10 per cent of the total vehicle market and to Japan, where
there is almost no prospect of off-road travel but where four-wheel-drives
take 6 per cent of sales.
'In the UK and Continental Europe it is around 2 1/2 per cent,' points out
Wyhinny.' They are immature markets and we see plenty of headroom for
growth.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: Losing foreign control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign subsidiary managers of global companies are losing clout and
control, according to a report* from the worldwide business organisation The
Conference Board.
Based on in-depth interviews with 82 such managers in North America, Europe
and Asia, the survey finds that authority over production decisions is in
many cases being transferred to the product division at group headquarters.
The biggest area of conflict between foreign subsidiary managers and the
centre is marketing, with corporate headquarters increasingly issuing
guidelines in this area.
'For many foreign subsidiary managers global competition and integration are
generating negative experiences,' says the report's Paris-based author
Stephen Gates. 'They become frustrated and demotivated since they retain
profit responsibility whilst losing control over decisions. As their
commitment to the company declines, they underperform and may eventually
leave.'
The report highlights the choice between local nationals and headquarters
expatriates when it comes to filling foreign subsidiary posts, and reveals
that it is the former more than the latter who are losing autonomy. It
suggests their strong local affiliation can be a barrier to embracing the
group's global strategy; but
the expatriate type has a tendency to implement strategy in the local market
too rigidly, and is liable to feelings of frustration on returning to base.
The report describes a number of ways in which the foreign subsidiary
manager's role can be enhanced, including taking advantage of
entrepreneurial opportunities in local markets. Head offices, for instance,
can follow the example of NEC USA and Monsanto Canada by assigning
responsibility for a global product or service to a local manager with the
intention of developing a centre of excellence within the group.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: Executives out of hibernation - Senior staff are
moving jobs again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers are on the move again.
There is not yet a return to the carefree years of the late 1980s, when risk
was considered an irrelevance and job-hopping became a way of life. But the
grim determination to cling on to secure but frustrating jobs is giving way
to increased willingness to change employers.
'People are looking round a bit more,' says one executive. 'They are less
scared than they used to be.'
According to Garry Long of MSL, a recruitment consultancy which monitors
advertised demand for executives: 'It will be a long period before people
forget the worries of the recession. But there is a willingness to be a bit
more risky in making a move.'
MSL believes that job opportunities increased by 30 per cent in the quarter
to April and by 22 per cent over the year. Admittedly, this is from a low
base - the number of job openings a year ago was at its lowest level since
MSL's records began in 1959.
The increase in top job mobility has been reflected in the performance of
headhunters. John Viney, chairman of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an executive
search company, says the number of directors' jobs handled by his firm has
doubled in the past two years.
One explanation for brisker executive turnover could be pent-up frustration
after having to tread water during the recession. The downturn, together
with the trend for companies to shed layers of management and flatten
hierarchies, restricted promotion opportunities within companies. Ambitious
executives, who find their progress blocked, may now feel increasingly
tempted to change employer.
The pick-up in economic activity, moreover, may create a need for a
different sort of executive. Just as the recession revealed the flaws of
many of the ambitious, growth-hungry executives who ran companies in the
late 1980s, the recovery may highlight the shortcomings of any cautious,
less visionary executives who in many cases succeeded them.
According to Viney, the focus is moving from cost-cutters towards marketing
people, many of whom have been in hibernation.
'In the recession, companies are interested in financial people who can turn
around the business,' he says. 'As companies come out of recession, they are
interested in business development, marketing or strategy-minded people.'
This argument is supported by MSL's figures. The most striking improvements
in job availability were in marketing and sales, which increased by 39 per
cent over the year.
The pick-up in demand for executives, though, varies with the seniority of
the job. The top jobs tend to be less sensitive than middle management posts
to fluctuations in the economy because companies need a core number of
directors, even when they are shedding jobs.
That said, directors have not escaped the pain. 'Over the last few years, it
has been a very difficult time for directors' jobs as companies have gone to
the wall,' says Ira Chalphin, employment spokesman of the Institute of
Directors.
The number of new directors' jobs is likely to expand relatively slowly as
the economy improves. But Chalphin notes that new directorships are still
being created by the trend for management buy-outs and by the government's
strategy of spinning off businesses out of the public sector.
The activity is nevertheless likely to be greater further down the ranks.
'During the recession, people tended to get rid of middle management and
make senior managers more accountable for activities,' says Steve Garlick,
director of GMBM, a recruitment and research consultancy. 'Now directors are
finding it necessary to direct, rather than manage. There is a need for more
middle managers.'
While this may be possible, in some cases the upturn will not help everyone
seeking to improve their job prospects. Many industries are continuing to
cut costs. Many middle managers are still under the threat of redundancy, as
companies restructure and cut out management layers.
Although opportunities are increasing, they tend to be limited to those who
fit employers' needs precisely.
'As companies are emerging from recession, the skills they need are very
specific,' says Jonathan Wright of Lawrence Caine, a recruitment
consultancy.
Moreover, the recession has blunted the opportunities of many managers to
develop marketable skills and, at worst, excluded some talented individuals
from the job market completely.
In the short term, at least, the pick-up in demand will tend to benefit
those who have been in the right place at the right time.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Euro-picture restores perspective - Salary
comparisons in smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do many of Britain's executives get a raw deal on pay compared with their
European counterparts? A glance at the figures in the table to the right
might suggest that they do.
While the government, even the Confederation of British Industry, has made
pronouncements on the unfairness of certain pay awards to some of the UK's
top executives, it looks as if their increases may have been far from
representative across managerial grades.
Some organisations have been grumbling for a while that the biggest salary
awards to individuals do not reflect reality for most executives. The large
increases in the pay packets of many of the utility heads and some of the
leaving bonuses and profits on share option schemes reaped in those
industries have tended to dominate the headlines.
According to this year's edition of Remuneration in Europe, a salary report
covering 36,000 executive pay packages in 12 countries compiled by a
consortium of remuneration consultancies, UK executives still receive almost
the lowest pay rises in Europe. In 1993 they received 3.9 per cent on
average, virtually in line with inflation, while those in Portugal, for
example, received 9 per cent.
Looking across the figures supplied for UK executive posts, very few seem to
come close to those on offer in other parts of Europe. P-E International,
which publishes the report, suggests the picture might not be as gloomy for
UK executives as it appears, since the UK has far more large public
companies compared to Europe generally.
The base salaries in the larger companies, it says, were still ahead of
those of their European counterparts.
The accompanying table is culled from the full report. Priced at Pounds 525,
it is available from The Centre for Management Research, P-E International
Group at Park House, Wick Road, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW. Inquirers should
telephone Joanna Woodford, the project manager, on (0)784 476466, fax (0)784
476369.
Note that the salaries in the table, quoted in the currencies of the base
countries in the report, have been converted to sterling exchange rates at
the close of the UK foreign exchange market on Friday July 8. The table is
confined to seven countries. It does not quote Germany, for example, because
it is difficult to break down the pay figures into the two salary size
brackets.
Moving story
The proportion of companies offering relocation assistance to newly
recruited staff is continuing to decline, according to a survey of 500
companies across the UK. The survey, carried out by Robert Half and
Accountemps, the financial recruitment consultants, found that just over
half of those questioned were offering relocation expenses compared with 90
per cent five years ago.
This downward trend, says the report, is likely to have an impact on labour
mobility, already affected by a depressed housing market.
Four out of five of the companies providing assistance, offered block
allowances, varying, on average, somewhere between Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
3,000.
Most companies with a relocation policy restrict expenses to reimbursement
of estate agent, legal fees and removal costs. Other possible allowances
were for temporary housing, offered by 80 per cent of them, stamp duty (73
per cent), and bridging loans (35 per cent). Mortgage subsidies were offered
by 8.5 per cent.
Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half and Accountemps, said the trend
could impact on the quality of applicants. 'Candidates who feel they are not
going to get relocation expenses might restrict their job search to their
locality rather than the whole country,' he said.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (9): No guarantee of stability - Mr
Menem's chances of re-election look strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year President Carlos Menem's chances of fulfilling his over-arching
ambition of removing the constitution's ban on successive presidential terms
and standing for re-election to a second term looked remote.
Now, the constitution is being changed and already Mr Menem looks unbeatable
in the 1995 elections.
Mr Menem achieved this by enlisting the opposition Radical party - which had
used its blocking minority of 84 seats in the lower house of Congress to
prevent reform - as allies in amending the US-style 1853 constitution.
In a deal last December with his old rival Raul Alfonsin, the Radical leader
and former president, Mr Menem agreed to a constitutional reform formula
that strengthens the judiciary and legislature and introduces a
semi-parliamentary form of government in exchange for being allowed to stand
for a second term.
Most Argentines are treating the reform process with considerable cynicism.
Rosendo Fraga, a political commentator, says: 'None of these reforms are
essential. The only reason for reform is Menem's re-election. The other
clauses are only there to justify this.'
But optimists, especially those in the business world, say a second Menem
term will further extend the horizon of political stability, allowing his
free market reforms to consolidate themselves. Mr Menem has stated
repeatedly that he will reappoint Domingo Cavallo as his economy minister.
However, many foreign executives would have preferred a Chilean-style
transition in which the direction of economic policy has remained unchanged,
in spite of two changes of government.
The core of the new constitution is contained in a Congressional resolution
passed last December with a two-thirds majority with unanimous backing from
Mr Menem's Peronist party and the Radicals. The resolution's text was
drafted in secret by Radical and Peronist negotiators. The two sides agreed
that an assembly elected in April to rewrite the constitution must accept or
reject this reform package without any modification.
In addition to the reforms already agreed by the two parties, Congress has
allowed the assembly to introduce additional changes such as introducing
referenda or entrenching consumer rights in the constitution.
Pollsters say that although the public shows little interest in the
constitutional reform process, it seems content to allow a successful
government to continue in office for a second term.
However, a second term for Mr Menem creates as many doubts as it does
certainties. There are those who believe he will do little to strengthen
Argentina's weak democratic institutions: no other president in Argentina's
history has resorted to emergency decrees - 308 of them in four years - as
much as Mr Menem has. The draft constitution is vague on congressional
ratification of presidential decrees. It does not say whether Congress may
even overturn decrees.
Successful economic reforms are the foundations of Mr Menem's political
popularity. But Manuel Mora y Araujo, a pollster, warns that Mr Menem may be
making a serious mistake by believing that economic stability and growth are
sufficient to satisfy voters. He says: 'People want other things. People
have other priorities. The dominating themes today are unemployment,
corruption, education, health.'
However, few politicians are responding to these demands. The Radicals have
been discredited by Mr Alfonsin's disastrous 1983-89 government and his
alliance with Mr Menem. Mr Mora y Araujo also notes a deepening contempt for
conventional politics and politicians.
These factors, plus a strong anti-corruption message, account for the rise
of the Frente Grande, a loose coalition of left wing parties, dissident
Peronists and environmental groups. The Frente is led by Carlos Alvarez, a
charismatic Congressman. He says: 'Our view is that most officials are part
of a corrupt system and Menem allows and generates and approves of
corruption'.
The Frente carried the federal district of Buenos Aires during the April 10
elections for delegates to the constituent assembly and took 14 per cent of
the national vote, finishing third behind the Radicals.
Still, few analysts believe Mr Alvarez threatens Mr Menem's re-election. A
diplomat commented that the elections were more akin to a by-election in
which voters registered discontent. But in a presidential election they
would probably cast their vote for Mr Menem.
There are those who wonder how Mr Menem would react to an economic downturn.
Many fear his latent populist tendencies would come to the surface. A former
minister says he worries about Mr Menem's 'authoritarian tendencies'.
Mr Menem is given to lashing out at critics with incendiary statements. He
has compared the opposition press to terrorists and bomb throwers. He has
said human rights campaigners are 'attempting to undermine the foundation of
the institutions, including the armed forces. We will never again tolerate
subversion in our country'.
Neither is Mr Menem, in spite of his protestations, in the best of health.
Last October he underwent emergency surgery to remove a blockage in the
carotid artery which carries blood to the brain. Mr Menem came dangerously
close to an incapacitating stroke. It also emerged that he suffers from
diabetes.
His deteriorating health has made the once unattractive post of
vice-president a desirable political prize, with several Peronists
discreetly pressing their claims. However, Mr Menem has said his running
mate will be Eduardo Duhalde, his vice-president until his election as
governor of Buenos Aires.
If Mr Menem were to disappear from the scene, his successor could change
course abruptly. Mr Duhalde is a consummate machine politician with little
attachment to Mr Cavallo's economic policies. Mr Cavallo's tight control
over spending and unpredictable outbursts of fury have made him deeply
unpopular in the government. In May he stormed out of a cabinet meeting
shrieking that fellow ministers were conspiring against him.
Argentina's weak political institutions, further unsettled by the
constitutional reform process, and its history of violent, unpredictable
upheaval mean that Mr Menem's re-election does not guarantee that stability
will continue.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (10): Prosperity is dwindling - The
Provinces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few of Argentina's 23 provinces have benefitted from the past three years of
vigorous growth. The backward northern region, bordering Bolivia and
Paraguay is suffering as its traditional economies, based on sugar cane and
tobacco, decline.
To the south, vast but sparsely populated Patagonia is seeing its population
dwindle further as the oil industry sheds jobs, as it restructures and
central government subsidies are cut off.
Even on the Pampas, Argentina's agricultural heartland, times are hard.
Agronomists reckon that only one in five farms in the province of Buenos
Aires are economically viable. Santa Fe, once one of Argentina's most
vigorous industrial provinces, has become a rust bowl of obsolete industry
and rising unemployment where labour unrest is rising.
Only a few parts of the country are prospering. The industrial belt
surrounding Buenos Aires concentrates one-third of Argentina's population
and much of its industry. Cordoba is the cradle of the car industry. Mendoza
to the west has bucked the trend of weak regional economies. It has sound
government, a relatively vibrant local industry and has become a focus of
investment from neighbouring Chile.
However, none of the provinces has emulated economy minister Domingo
Cavallo's sweeping reforms of the federal public sector. Their aggregate
budget deficit may reach Dollars 2bn-3bn this year - about 1 per cent of GDP
and more than five times larger than expected at the beginning of the year.
Unreconstructed public sectors raise local industry's operating costs by
burdening it with high taxes and expensive but inefficient infrastructure
and utilities, making it hard to create jobs or raise investment.
The government is keenly aware of the dangers of allowing large regions of
the country to fall further behind the few prosperous provinces. Already,
the overcrowded slums surrounding Buenos Aires are swelling with migrants
from the interior.
Last December, rioters seized the northern city of Santiago del Estero for a
day, looting and burning as they went. It was Argentina's worst outbreak of
violence since hyperinflation four years earlier. Public employees demanding
unpaid wages led the rioting. Unrest continues to simmer, with public
employees protesting almost weekly in cities throughout the interior.
Comparisons with the new year's day guerrilla uprising in Mexico's state of
Chiapas are far-fetched, but Mr Menem's failure to deal adequately with the
provinces' troubles is emerging as one of his greatest shortcomings.
On the one hand Mr Menem needs the powerful provincial governors' backing
for his re-election campaign. Yet at the same time Mr Cavallo is demanding
deeply resented public sector reforms. Unsurprisingly, Mr Cavallo's reforms
are on hold.
The governors - led by members of Mr Menem's own Peronist party - are
demanding that the assembly which is rewriting the country's constitution
should insert a clause ordering the federal government to hand over half
national tax revenues to the provinces. The federal government has budgeted
tax revenues of Dollars 47.46bn for 1994, Dollars 16.09bn of which it must
transfer by law to the provinces.
Giving way would open the door to an avalanche of demands for more
concessions. In June, Mr Menem bluntly told the governors to 'be quiet and
try to contribute to reforming the constitution, and not introduce
destabilising elements'. He attacked them for 'demagogic, absurd populism'.
Meanwhile, Mr Cavallo and Juan Antonio Zapata, his secretary overseeing
provincial reform, are struggling on as they can. Even Mr Zapata admits he
is facing an uphill struggle. He says: 'We need a gradual policy. We are
pushing through some policies to reform the provincial public sector, but
until the private sector (shows) strong demand (for labour), it is difficult
to carry out. It will have to be done simultaneously. Each province reforms
as it can.'
In many provinces, notably the north-west, local governments are the largest
employers. No governor can afford to throw thousands of employees out of
work when unemployment is already high. Furthermore, distribution of
government jobs is a cornerstone of a clientelistic political system that
has kept some ruling families in power for generations.
Neither can the governors afford to reform their highly inefficient and
anti-business tax systems for fear of losing revenues. In the past, the
federal government showered subsidies and investment incentives on the
regions, even though corrupt businessmen and officials often stole these
resources. In one celebrated case, Koner SA, a now bankrupt conglomerate, is
accused of misappropriating Dollars 100m in government subsidies over a
five-year period in the 1980s.
Mr Cavallo has a different approach. He has cut federal taxes for companies
in the interior. He has given the provinces more money in exchange for
promised tax reform and privatisations. He has offered to take over
deficit-ridden provincial retirement funds. Mr Cavallo is also targeting
Dollars 300m of federal spending on infrastructure in the provinces this
year as part of a planned Dollars 2bn, five-year program.
Furthermore, privatised telephone, rail, port and highway operators are also
investing heavily in the interior. More efficient and cheaper infrastructure
is reducing companies' costs as well as pumping money into the regions.
However, the provinces have stubbornly resisted privatising their utilities
and banks.
Governors complain that Mr Cavallo's largesse hardly compensates for the
transfer to the provinces of responsibility for education and health that
used to be handled by the federal government. But most of the governors are
taking the extra money without keeping their side of the bargain and
beginning reform. Provincial governments' spending rose to Dollars 25.70bn
last year from Dollars 16.24bn in 1991, when Mr Cavallo took office.
Spending on wages hit a record Dollars 13.76bn in 1993 - two-thirds more
than in 1991. An exasperated Mr Menem said the governors were 'not
administering as they should. They are not lowering public spending. They
have not carried out public sector reform'.
Yet his home province of La Rioja - which Mr Menem governed from 1983-89 in
the time-honoured tradition of padding the public payroll - has done little
in the way of reform. Even the local finance minister admitted La Rioja
receives more than its fair share of federal transfers. Until the provinces'
backward political structures are reformed, it is hard to see how Argentina
can achieve balanced and sustainable growth.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (8): The new constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main item on the constituent assembly's agenda is the removal of the
1853 constitution's ban on successive presidential terms to allow President
Carlos Menem to stand for re-election next year.
If all goes according to plan, the new constitution will allow re-election
of the president to a second, four-year term. At present, the president
serves for a single six-year term. If Mr Menem wins the 1995 presidential
elections, he will govern Argentina up to the end of 1999, when he will be
69. He would not be allowed to run for a third term.
As well as this, a number of other items are up for debate.
The indirect electoral college election system will be abandoned and
replaced with a two-round direct election. If the winner gets more than 45
per cent of votes there need be no second round election.
Equally, if the winning candidate gets 40 per cent of the vote but leads the
second candidate by 10 percentage points, there need be no second round.
These elaborate rules were drafted bearing in mind the Peronist party's
traditional 40-45 per cent share of the vote.
A cabinet chief, a sort of prime minister, will become responsible for
'general administration of the country' exercising powers 'delegated by the
president'. The cabinet chief can be removed by both houses of Congress with
a simple majority vote. The opposition Radicals hope this will reduce the
president's powers, but Mr Menem has already said he will not cede full
presidential powers.
The 48-member Senate will be increased by half. The extra 24 seats will be
allocated to the opposition parties in each of the 23 provinces and the
federal district of Buenos Aires.
The executive's legislative powers, principally the right to issue emergency
decrees, will be restricted. The president will be forbidden from decreeing
on tax, criminal law or electoral issues. However, the role of Congress in
ratifying or rejecting presidential decrees is not clear.
A council of jurists will select judges and oversee management of the
judiciary. At present, judges are selected by the executive and approved by
the Senate. The Supreme Court is responsible for the management of the
judiciary.
This amendment is meant to strengthen the independence of the courts, since
judges are often appointed for political reasons. However, the rules
governing the council will be written by the Peronist-dominated Congress.
The head of the National Audit Bureau will be nominated by the opposition
and be subordinated to Congress. At present the toothless Audit Bureau is
part of the executive.
The mayor of Buenos Aires will be elected. At present the president appoints
the mayor. The federal district of Buenos Aires is a traditional Radical
stronghold, and this was intended to benefit the Radicals. However, they
have lost the last two elections in the city and would do so again if the
elections were held today.
The share of financial resources between the federal and provincial
governments is to be made more equitable. The tax shareout at present is
subject to a number of complex rules that gives the provinces 56 per cent of
certain federal taxes, such as value added tax, but not customs revenues.
The provincial governors demand that they be given half of all taxes raised
by the federal government.
In addition to these points, there are other clauses introducing referenda,
granting independence to federal prosecutors (currently controlled by the
government), protecting the environment and entrenching competition policy
and consumer rights in the constitution.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (6): The honeymoon is over - Privatised
companies are losing popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's far-reaching privatisation programme is not popular with
everybody. 'Public telephones are not working. You have a dual system so you
need two types of phone-cards. Phones are being provided faster but we are
paying outrageous rates that I think are the highest in the world,'
complains Atilio Boron, director of the Centre for European-Latin American
Research in Buenos Aires.
He thinks dissatisfaction with privatised companies is already rebounding on
to the government and its market-oriented economic reforms. 'My feeling is
that the honeymoon is over because the model is not delivering the goods.'
Given the state of the telephone system and other public services before
privatisation, some may think the inconvenience of buying two phone cards is
not too much to bear. Many feel the collapse of the public services before
privatisation took a lot of the heat out of the arguments over
privatisation.
Argentines suffered six months of daily power cuts in 1989. 'The electrical
crisis provided a dose of reality in the ideological debate,' says Gustavo
Petracchi, president of the electricity distribution company Edesur. And the
government, which was pouring more than Dollars 2bn a year in subsidies into
the nationalised companies during the 1980s, has so far no regrets.
According to a just-published study on Latin American productivity by the
management consultants, McKinsey, overall productivity in the Argentine
telecommunications industry had shown a great improvement after the 1990
privatisation, even by 1992.
But at 55 per cent of US levels, total factor productivity was the lowest of
the five Latin countries it surveyed. This, it says, is due to 'a chaotic
situation' which previously prevailed, but agrees that telephone charges in
Argentina are 'very high'.
Faustino Rivero, chairman of Telefonica de Argentina, one of the two
companies about which Mr Boron complains, says his company has put in
700,000 lines in 3 1/2 years, an increase of 40 per cent since it took over.
Not only that, the company - whose region cost the state Dollars 400m in
subsidies in 1990 - is paying taxes.
Efficiency increases have been significant elsewhere: deregulation in the
oil and gas sector and privatisation of the former oil monopoly YPF has
helped the country's oil production to rise from 420,000 barrels per day in
1991 to 650,000 bpd now.
Jose Estenssoro, president and chief executive, says YPF alone increased oil
output from 289,000 bpd in 1992 to 326,000 bpd last year. 'We are trying to
reach 450,000-500,000 bpd of oil by the end of next year and probably
another 200,000 in oil equivalent of gas.' He says the company's workforce -
52,000 strong in 1990 - will have been slimmed down to about 6,000 by the
end of this year.
But the transition to privatisation has not been easy, not least for many of
the foreign utilities that are operating the privatised companies.
Metrogas, the gas company covering metropolitan Buenos Aires in which
British Gas has an important stake, was plagued along with other gas
companies with problems of low pressure last year, the first year of
privatisation.
Transportation capacity was inadequate to cope with demand last winter. This
winter, says Rob Verrion, general manager of Metrogas, the company has
expanded capacity - and will expand it further - and the complaints about
low pressure have fallen.
This was not the only problem. The standard of local contractors left much
to be desired. As well as encouraging some local contractors to improve
working standards, new contractors are moving in from abroad, including a
subsidiary of the UK construction group Amec, an important contractor for
British Gas.
Dissatisfied with their invoicing contractor, Metrogas switched its entire
database from one system to another overnight 'in what can be best described
as a commando operation'.
Without a good database it was impossible to put together effective credit
controls - particularly important in a country with 'a history of not paying
invoices for public services', says Mr Verrion. 'It's not everybody and it's
not necessarily the poor people,' he adds.
Stealing gas is one issue faced by the gas companies, but for the
electricity companies, the problem of fraud was worse. Gustavo Petracchi,
president of the distribution company, Edesur in which Chilean investors
have an important stake, says that, when it took over, 26 per cent of the
company's electricity was being stolen.
'The losses of energy through fraud in greater Buenos Aires alone could
provide power for the city of Cordoba - which has 1m people,' he says.
Fraud from Edesur has now been cut back to below 20 per cent, and by the end
of the year should be 17 per cent. Mr Petracchi complains that the problem
could have been tackled earlier if it had not been for political
intervention by the province of Buenos Aires in early 1993.
Since May, an agreement has been in place to allow the issue to be
confronted. But at least Mr Petracchi avoided the difficulties of its
neighbouring distributor. In May last year, a judge ordered the arrest of
Angel Zapalorto, a manager at Edenor, after he cut off power to slums to
stop illegal tapping into the electricity network. Mr Zapalorto spent 72
hours in jail before being released.
The companies also suffered from internal fraud. Mr Petracchi said the
workforce was 'riddled with corruption both open and hidden, and not only in
the purchasing department'. Morale was low and still has not recovered,
while the number on the payroll has dropped from 7,600 to 4,500. Workers
laid off have received pay-offs averaging Dollars 30,000.
Both gas and electricity companies have also received fines from their
regulators. The companies have been unhappy about this, since they believe
that allowances should be made for the dilapidation of the systems before
they took over. 'We have a late 20th century regulatory model imposed on a
gas system built in the early to middle part of the century,' says Mr
Verrion at Metrogas.
As the World Bank notes in its 1994 World Development Report: 'Although
privatisation has occurred rapidly, the capacity for regulatory oversight
has lagged.' Yet now that the regulators are showing their teeth, there
remain concerns, even among impartial observers, that the regulatory bodies
are excessively politicised.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (7): Heavy spend ahead - Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's once all-embracing public sector has vanished, leaving in its
place newly-privatised companies to manage the country's energy supplies,
telecommunications systems and transport infrastructure.
These companies are now spending heavily to rebuild infrastructure
collapsing after decades of neglect. Telefonica de Argentina, which provides
telephone services in the south of the country, alone invested Dollars
925.3m last year. Signs of activity are everywhere: Buenos Aires has become
an obstacle course as the new gas, telephone and water companies dig up its
streets.
Like most utilities, Metrogas, the Buenos Aires gas company operated by
British Gas, is financing its investment programme from cashflow and debt.
It has prepared a Dollars 300-350m five-year debt programme.
The utilities are young companies, so their debt burden is still reasonably
light: Telefonica's long term liabilities may have risen by half to Dollars
348.2m last year but they still represented just under 10 per cent of its
balance sheet.
Most state companies were privatised with guaranteed dollar-linked prices
pitched high enough to generate ample revenues - as their clients now
realise only too well. But the day will come when companies and investment
banks must find private backing for new infrastructure projects, such as
roads and power stations, which provide low returns and long maturities.
Bankers are unclear how this can be done. Until February, when the US
Federal Reserve increased dollar interest rates, companies could raise
finance reasonably cheaply overseas. Now, the outlook is less certain. In
June, the government had to drop a planned Dollars 150m IPO of its remaining
25 per cent stake in TGN, a privatised gas pipeline company, because of
insufficient demand.
However, investment bankers in Buenos Aires are confident that capital
markets will still support infrastructure projects. For instance, just as
the government postponed its flotation of TGN, Paribas was able to organise
the flotation of 45 per cent of power generator Capex, raising Dollars
163.6m. Capex is not only a brand-new private gas-fired generator but it has
still only built one-third of its planned capacity. Paribas adds that it was
able to sell Capex stock at the upper end of the price range - shares were
oversubscribed three times - thanks to heavy demand from specialist
investment funds in the US and UK.
A few weeks later, a consortium of five Argentine energy companies and
Tenneco Gas of the US announced they would start building a Dollars 600m gas
pipeline to Chile next year. The US government's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation will lend Dollars 200m and provide Dollars 200m in insurance for
the project. Banks and equipment suppliers will provide additional backing.
British Gas and two Chilean utilities are to handle the distribution of
natural gas in Chile.
There is always the risk that companies will fail to meet investors'
expectations. Neither of Buenos Aires' two electricity distributors have
ever made money. They blame theft from widespread illegal connections.
Already at least two loss-making privatised companies, one of them the flag
carrier Aerolineas Argentinas, have had to go back to the government to
renegotiate their contract terms.
Spain's state-owned carrier now owns 85 per cent of Aerolineas, and is
trying to sell at least 25 per cent of the loss-making airline in a private
placement. Techint, an industrial conglomerate, has asked the government to
lower mandatory investment in its Trans-Pampa freight railway. The railway
has not performed as expected, due in part Techint says, to heavy flooding
in the Pampas.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (4): Nafta option shelved - Plans for
Mercosur are well advanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of President Carlos Menem has carefully cultivated its image
as a responsible member of the new world order, ostentatiously rejecting its
former radical non-aligned foreign policy.
However, Mr Menem cannot always be guaranteed not to put his foot in it. His
personal endorsement of Mexican president Carlos Salinas to head the nascent
World Trade Organisation at the Cartagena summit of Latin American leaders
in June had to be retracted by embarrassed Argentine diplomats. Argentina
had previously pledged support to a Brazilian candidate.
Neither was Mr Menem's suggestion that former British prime minister
Margaret Thatcher should be extradited for war crimes likely to speed the
visit he says he wants to London.
Mr Menem often repeats his prediction that the Falkland Islands - over which
the UK and Argentina fought a brief war in 1982 - will be Argentine by the
year 2000. And his foreign minister, Guido di Tella says: 'I think he may be
wrong; the islands will be Argentine in 1997.'
At present, both countries agree to disagree over the islands' sovereignty.
Meanwhile, talks move ahead over fishing - a longer-term agreement is being
discussed to replace the current one-year accord - and oil in the Falklands
waters. 'If they want to explore for oil, we think we can block them,' said
Mr di Tella.
He said the region should become a 'special area with a special (oil)
regime', a subject that would be discussed, he said, in talks on oil this
month.
Twelve years after the Falklands war, relations with London are on a
reasonable footing. More importantly, Argentina's new foreign policy -
reflected, for example, in its ratification of nuclear non-proliferation
treaties and its participation in United Nations forces in Cyprus, Bosnia
and the Gulf - has been enthusiastically welcomed in Washington.
Mr di Tella, gets annoyed with those who sneer at the country's close
relations with the US. He argues that foreign policy, with a 59 per cent
approval rating is - along with economic policy - among the highest approved
of government policies. Disapproval of the so-called 'carnal relationship'
with Washington is the preserve of a discredited intelligentsia, he says.
Good relations with the US have yielded benefits. They aided the government
in its negotiations over a bank debt restructuring and encouraged flows of
investment from the US.
Yet, there appears no longer to be an expectation of a rapid move towards
free trade with the US. The idea that Argentina could gain quick accession
to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) always seemed unlikely
given the US political calendar.
Now, says Jorge Campbell, secretary for international economic relations at
the foreign ministry, the emphasis is on cementing and deepening the
southern cone free trade zone with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, known as
Mercosur.
'We put out some feelers about Nafta - whether we would qualify, whether it
would be expanded or not - and after a few months concluded that we'd rather
stick to Mercosur with the semi-incorporation of Chile and Bolivia,' says Mr
di Tella.
'Our evaluation was that Nafta was like a seal of quality for investors to
invest in Argentina. Trade-wise it was never very important, even
detrimental.'
Furthermore, standards required for Argentina to qualify would not be easy,
and would to some extent conflict with Mercosur. 'Maybe we will try in
two-to-three years. 1997 would be a good date,' he said. Then Brazil's
economic trajectory would be clearer and the attitude of the new president
taking office in January towards economic reform would be known.
While Argentina would have had little trouble meeting labour standards
associated with Nafta, the US would require a patents law to a standard
higher than that envisaged by the Uruguay Round.
Argentina's 10 per cent statistics tax on imports and the protectionist car
industry regime would also be obstacles - though these are scheduled for
elimination in due course.
The threat of US sanctions over the country's archaic patents law appeared
to be averted earlier this month when the Buenos Aires government promised
special efforts to get a new law through Congress. US trade sanctions were
anyway not likely, given the Dollars 3bn US trade surplus with Argentina and
the estimated Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m in extra royalties implied by a new
patents law.
Argentine officials insist that the patents law is essential. 'Our patent
laws are 120 years old. They are obsolete and insufficient, (unless) you
adopt the view that we are geniuses and generate ideas all the time that are
being robbed by the imperialists. If you want to be innovative, you need a
patent law,' says Mr di Tella.
Mercosur is not without its political difficulties, and - given the
uncertainty about the next administration in Brazil - its future is unclear.
But the four governments have moved a long way towards forming a customs
union - a common external tariff has been agreed for 85 per cent of goods.
Bolivia and Chile are also possible associate members, suggesting the accord
could be a stepping stone to a broader South American common market. Still,
whatever governments do - unless they take a sharp return towards
protectionism - a de facto economic integration is moving ahead at a
corporate level.
Quinsa - the largest Argentine brewer - is one of hundreds of companies
pursuing a regional strategy. It has plants in Paraguay and Uruguay. Its new
brewery in Chile, it says, achieved an 18 per cent market share by the end
of last year. It is also looking at possible acquisitions in Brazil, as the
Brazilian beer giant, Brahma, starts to attack its own home market in
Argentina.
Carlos Sant'Anna of the Argentine subsidiary of the big Brazilian food
company Sadia says his company has embarked on a regional expansion strategy
that will lead at least, to its building a plant in Argentina. It aims, he
said, to develop the market that runs in an arc from Rio de Janeiro through
Sao Paulo, Montevideo, Buenos Aires and Santiago, which contains 65 per cent
of South American GDP.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (5): Growth shelters an inefficient
system - The financial sector is facing heavier borrowing costs and a rise
in non-performing loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<TEXT>
Bankers are not popular anywhere. In Argentina, as in most other countries,
they are accused of a multitude of sins - gouging, resisting change,
inefficiency and harbouring an anti-industry bias.
President Carlos Menem vented his frustration in a speech to bankers in
June, saying: 'Deregulation of the financial system was not done for banks
to make more money, but for money to cost less.' He warned that 'business
cannot survive without reasonable financial costs and its fall sooner or
later will drag the banks down'.
However, Argentina's financial system is maturing. Interest rates are
falling, deposits are growing, lending is expanding and maturities are
stretching out. The capital markets, too, are slowly developing in breadth
and sophistication. The question is whether the pace of change is sufficient
and whether the system can withstand the stresses of change.
For now, banks are making easy money from Argentina's rapid growth and
access to international financial circuits. Banco Galicia, Argentina's
largest quoted bank, earned an estimated net profit of Dollars 57.1m last
year on assets of Dollars 2.76bn. Banco Frances, the second-largest listed
bank, earned Dollars 53m in the same period, returning a strong 4 per cent
on assets.
Banks raise money on international financial markets and re-lend it in
Argentina at substantial spreads. Until recently banks could fund at 8 per
cent but charged retail customers and small companies 15-25 per cent
interest in dollar terms.
But borrowing costs increased sharply after the US Federal Reserve began
raising interest rates on February 4. Banco del Sud, a regional bank,
borrowed Dollars 50m early in February at 8.125 per cent. When it returned
for more in June, it had to pay two percentage points more for a similar
Dollars 50m bond issue.
Still, analysts reckon banks will go on making good profits for some time to
come.
There is a danger that banks' assets and liabilities are becoming
mismatched. They have borrowed in hard currency but onlent it mainly to
borrowers with peso revenues. The financial system has liabilities of
Dollars 68.8bn, of which Dollars 36.1bn is in foreign currency. And
liabilities are normally of 3-5 years but banks' peso assets are beginning
to stretch out for much longer.
Bad loans are increasing fast. Non-performing loans at Banco Frances have
risen to 6.0 per cent of total net loans this year from 3.6 per cent last
year.
But bankers are optimistic. Eduardo Escasany, president of Banco Galicia and
head of the national bank association ADEBA, says expansion is by no means
exhausted. He points out that although money supply has quadrupled since the
launch of the convertibility plan in April 1991, it is still equivalent to
only 22 per cent of GDP.
The financial system's deposits have grown impressively - to Dollars 41.04bn
in May from Dollars 8.44bn in April 1991. Spreads have also come down: Banco
Galicia's average margin dropped to 13 percentage points in 1993 from 17 in
1992 from 32 in 1991.
However, Mr Escasany says banks are stuck with high operating costs and hold
large amounts of cash at branches and cope with frequent armed robberies
because Argentines still insist on using cash - a habit born of inflation,
tax evasion and fear of bouncing cheques.
He also complains that banks must pay the bank workers union 2 per cent of
revenues to fund social and health services. Analysts would add that banks
are still burdened by bureaucracy, overstaffing and unimaginative, unskilled
managers.
Another distortion is the presence of even more inefficient public banks.
Half the country's banking industry is publicly-owned. Argentina lacks an
integrated national banking network. Provincially-owned banks or small
co-operative banks dominate lending in the interior. As a result, companies
outside major cities pay higher interest rates.
Strong growth has masked these inefficiencies and prevented a banking
crisis, a frequent by-product of past economic stabilisation programmes. But
what will happen when growth falters?
Although analysts say bank profits would naturally be damaged by a slowdown,
they doubt the system's solvency would be affected seriously because the
largest banks are strongly capitalised.
Change is also slow in coming to the narrowly-based and highly speculative
capital markets. Derivatives and securitisation are still in their infancy.
Still, the flood of foreign money into the stock market has brought greater
professionalism and a longer view on investment. By one estimate, foreign
investors now hold 60 per cent of the Buenos Aires Exchange's float, worth
about Dollars 6.5bn.
But the market is still held back by a lack of liquidity - turnover rarely
exceeds Dollars 30m a day - caused in part by a shortage of paper. Private
companies, invariably family-owned firms, are unwilling to sell equity for
fear of losing control.
Although the number of listed companies has declined to 161 from 171 in
1992, bankers are confident that companies will be driven to raise equity
capital as they exhaust traditional sources of finance - debt and retained
earnings.
Perhaps this year's greatest disappointment is the chaos surrounding the
introduction of a private pension fund system which economy minister Domingo
Cavallo hoped would channel Dollars 3bn a year into capital markets.
However, disorganisation, frequent rule changes and the suspicion of
contributors is turning an important reform into a fiasco.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (2): Investors still showing reluctance
 -John Barham finds that there has been no great burst of energy in the
private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the privatisation of state companies and abolition of nearly all the
government's interventionist mechanisms, Argentina's private sector has
become the engine for growth.
But it is far from clear whether private industry is in any shape to lead
the economy. Companies are still in a state of flux. Although it is five
years since President Carlos Menem began his free market reforms, there has
been no great burst of entrepreneurial energy, no investment boom, no
management revolution, no aggressive pursuit of exports.
Instead, companies are concentrating on less ambitious incremental
investments, often aimed at unstoping bottlenecks. 'Everyone is investing
something, but it is very selective. Everyone is making small, selective
investments,' says Bernardo Kosacoff of the UN's Economic Commission for
Latin America.
And there is still considerable room for turning round existing companies
without launching major new investments. Ted Truscott, principal of US fund
managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, notes that US, European and Latin
American companies are buying up local competitors in increasing numbers,
using their management, technology and marketing skills and capital strength
to revive badly-run Argentine companies.
Corimon, a Venezuelan paint company, for example, last year took over
Colorin, a smaller Argentine competitor. 'Two years ago Colorin had no
working capital and its sales were falling,' Mr Truscott says. Now, under
Corimon's management, 'Colorin is beginning to grow. It is going to take on
(market leader) Alba. I think there are going to be a lot of other companies
like this'.
Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, all of the US and Britain's
Cadbury Schweppes and Unilever have bought companies in Argentina recently.
Local groups are also on the prowl. Buenos Aires-based FiduCorp has built up
a portfolio of companies, rebuilding them with infusions of capital and
tough management. 'Companies are really forced to do their homework, control
costs and find places to cut. Companies (either) go bust or show muscle,'
Zsolt Argady, FiduCorp's president, says
Many industries - from cars to steel to food processing - have achieved
impressive productivity gains through improved management and strong sales
growth. Autolatina, the joint venture linking Ford and Volkswagen in
Argentina and Brazil, has tripled output per employee since 1991.
However, Agustin Castano, head of the Buenos Aires office of US management
consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says the process of increasing
productivity through tighter management is reaching its limits. 'Some
sectors have reached full capacity and will have to begin investing,' he
says.
Yet he sees few examples of new greenfield projects. Most investment is
going to sectors that are sheltered from import competition, such as
services, privatised utilities or construction. Investment in industrial
projects is also being angled to the few remaining protected sectors such as
cars or those focused on the domestic market, such as breweries.
However, Mr Castano says that more than big investments, Argentine companies
need a far-reaching change in management culture. 'It is one thing to change
structures and it is another thing to change behaviour. Some (managers) are
absolutely unadaptable. At the same time you have an emerging group of
managers reaching top management positions,' he says. Still, Mr Castano can
think of few companies that have embarked on management revolutions.
'Unfortunately you can find only pockets of best practice management.'
Neither are companies falling over themselves to raise new capital.
Argentine companies are undergeared by international standards. The economy
ministry estimated Argentine companies' liabilities at only Dollars 27bn in
1992, compared with assets of Dollars 473bn. Argentina has only 161 listed
companies. In theory, therefore, they have plenty of room to raise fresh
capital.
Although there are no data on the corporate sector's profitability, many
companies are foundering in the wake of liberalisation and elimination of
trade barriers. Miguel Angel Broda, a business consultant, says 17 out of 54
sectors have seen output fall over the past three years.
Mr Truscott says a long history of under-investment is compromising the
viability of many sectors, especially in manufacturing industry. Perhaps
most at risk is the capital goods industry, which is under severe pressure
from competing Brazilian intermediate technology products. Alpha, a Buenos
Aires consultancy, says capital goods imports are climbing every month,
while local production has almost halved since 1993. It reckons capital
goods imports should rise 39 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn this year.
In spite of the impressive gains of recent years, Argentina still ranks low
in the international productivity stakes. Wages are high - the average
Argentine industrial worker earns Dollars 883 but is less produc tive than a
Brazilian worker. As a result, few manufacturing companies are able to
export profitably let alone resist sustained attack by foreign competitors.
Argentina has few world-class companies. Most analysts mention Siderca, a
steel tube company owned by industrial conglomerate Techint, as an
outstanding company. However it is a chronic loss-maker, mainly because of
the depressed oil drilling market.
Perez Companc, another industrial conglomerate, is frequently praised for
its professional management and its decision to focus on energy and
privatised services. YPF, the privatised oil company, is widely admired for
its combination of sound management and aggressive expansion strategy.
Footwear and clothing company Alpargatas has also attracted attention for
its young and highly intelligent management team.
Most analysts say that companies with best future prospects are those in
small, technology-based niches where they are able to harness Argentina's
relatively skilled workforce. Argentine workers tend to be better educated
than others in the region and therefore can be quickly trained to use
sophisticated equipment.
Companies operating in the food, energy, and mining industries - where
Argentina has undisputed advantages - are also widely considered to have a
bright future.
The car industry, the only one to retain substantial import protection and
export incentives, is also likely to see considerable growth. Alpha says car
companies have a 24 per cent profit margin. However, their long-term
prospects are uncertain, since the government says it will abolish import
protection in 2000.
Argentina has never before built an internationally competitive industrial
base. Its long history of unpredictable upheavals and shifts in government
policy have made entrepreneurs wary of investing. Jorge Mostany, president
of Autolatina's Argentine arm, worries that Argentina cannot compete on cost
with China or India. But neither is it sufficiently sophisticated to
challenge Japan, Germany or the US.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (1): Politics stands in the way of
progress - The president's aim to change the constitution has meant
legislative developments have been halted, something many fear puts recent
impressive economic growth at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of economic reform in Argentina has slowed. President Carlos Menem,
apparently recovered from an operation to clear a serious arterial blockage
he suffered last October, is pursuing his ambition to win re-election. For
this he needs to change the country's constitution, and while he has set
about doing that, the government's legislative agenda has been put largely
on hold.
Most observers of the political scene agree there is a single motive behind
Mr Menem's wish to change the 1853 constitution. Rosendo Fraga, a political
commentator, argues: 'The only reason for the reform is Menem's
re-election.' Mr Menem was elected in 1989 as the Peronist party candidate
for a six-year term but the constitution forbids him standing for a
consecutive second term.
With the president pursuing apparently personal objectives, events outside
Argentina have made the country's economic position more delicate. The rise
in US interest rates which started in February has slowed inflows of capital
on which the country, because of a low savings rate, is dependent for
growth.
The current account deficit has continued to widen, raising further doubts
about the economy's ability to export at an exchange rate fixed against the
dollar in 1991 as part of a successful bid to bring down inflation.
Foreign investors are also worried about disturbances in outlying provinces,
many of which seem to have missed out on the rapid economic growth of the
past three years, in particular last December's riots in Santiago del
Estero. They see some risks in the constitutional reform process and in a
more combative trade union movement which led to last week's march on Buenos
Aires.
Despite this, Mr Menem's economic record and that of his economy minister,
Domingo Cavallo, remain impressive. Taking power for a six-year term in 1989
amid hyperinflation, the president supported a radical economic reform
programme which gathered pace after Mr Cavallo took office in 1991. A huge,
corrupt and loss-making state sector was privatised, tariff barriers fell
and the economy deregulated. Inflation dropped rapidly: 15 private
economists polled by Consensus Economics expect, on average, 1994 inflation
of 3.5 per cent.
Growth has been rapid too, helped by capital inflows in part spurred by a
privatisation programme now drawing to an end. In the three years to 1993,
the economy expanded by 25.5 per cent. The average forecast for this year is
4.6 per cent.
Although much has been done, some economists think there are risks in delays
to legislation. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, an economist from the
opposition Radical Party, complains that important laws, including those to
improve labour market flexibility and reform the social security system, are
'dead or slipping' because of Mr Menem's struggle for re-election.
'Our institutions are not strong enough to enjoy this leisure time in the
middle of a very tough adjustment programme . . . It will be society that
pays,' he says.
Miguel Angel Broda, who heads an eponymous economic consultancy in Buenos
Aires, agrees to some extent. 'I don't think that in the next year they can
advance the reform.' However, he believes the government should not be
criticised, having achieved 85 per cent of what it set out to do: slowing
the reforms has increased the risks to Mr Menem's economic programme, but
the odds still favour its survival.
Employers argue that the absence of labour reform makes them reluctant to
take on workers, because it is so costly to fire them. Current social
security laws also increase wage costs but - because most trade-union run
social welfare funds are bankrupted - provide little in benefits to workers.
Mr Zsolt Agardy, president of Fiduc, a group of financial, manufacturing and
service companies, says: 'If they passed a labour reform, we would hire more
people and be producing more efficiently.'
The cost of labour and its lack of flexibility are perceived as two factors
inhibiting the country's ability to compete internationally. Others include
a dilapidated infrastructure and high interest rates.
The reason for high interest rates is in part huge inefficiency in the
financial system. According to a report from the management consultancy,
McKinsey, Argentine bank workers cost an average annual Dollars 31,000,
compared with Dollars 36,000 in the US - but are only 19 per cent as
productive as their US counterparts.
With companies restructuring - often in preparation for Mercosur, the
southern cone common market expected to introduce a common external tariff
at the start of next year - productivity is increasing.
Mr Cavallo says he is confident: 'In the next three years, I've no doubt
that Argentina is going to see a big increase in exports because of an
increase in productivity.'
Furthermore, the benefits of the federal government's large-scale
deregulation - which he admits is yet to spread sufficiently to provincial
governments - are only now beginning to be felt.
In the meantime, however, social pressures in Argentina are growing.
Unemployment is rising - the government argues largely because of
substantial growth in the workforce.
Growth has bypassed many industries and a large number of provinces. 'There
are provinces in which GDP has fallen 25 per cent in three years,' says Mr
Broda.
These broader concerns are reflected in changes in voter opinions, says
pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo. Inflation, once the single dominant concern,
has been replaced by a variety of issues, in which unemployment looms large.
People are also worried about the quality of public services, such as health
and education, and increasingly about their local environment.
Another preoccupation is government corruption, which Mr Menem is widely
viewed as tolerating among those close to him. At the same time, there has
been a loss in confidence in the two main political parties - which was
reinforced when Mr Menem and Raul Alfonsin, the former president and leader
of the Radical Party, cooked up an agreement in December over the
constitutional revision.
These, says Mr Mora y Araujo, are the reasons why both Peronist and Radical
parties fared relatively badly in the April elections for the assembly now
debating the constitutional changes. By contrast, the Frente Grande, a loose
coalition of left-wing parties, dissident Peronists and environmental groups
led by a charismatic congressman Carlos Alvarez, did unexpectedly well,
particularly in Buenos Aires.
While the April elections undoubtedly weakened Mr Menem's position, some
observers reckon voters were merely registering a protest at aspects of the
Menem government, but would support Mr Menem in a presidential election.
The fact is there appear to be few serious challengers to Mr Menem on the
horizon. His popularity, while it has declined from its peak, still exceeds
by several times that of any other rival, though if opposition did coalesce
around one candidate the gap would be substantially narrowed.
In the presidential elections which he says will be held between April and
June next year, Mr Menem is still odds-on for a second presidential term.
On the face of it, this offers continuity. Mr Menem's critics charge,
however, that the costs of his pursuit of re-election show his readiness to
put personal objectives before national interest.
Either way, his country faces many fundamental challenges before the end of
the century. It must further improve its international competitiveness;
restructure a bureaucracy that is still mostly inefficient and corrupt;
improve the capacity of the state to deliver public goods - in particular
education and justice - and address the growing marginalisation of a
majority of provinces.
It is not clear that a vision on how to resolve these issues exists in Mr
Menem's mind or within the government - with the exception of a few people
mainly in the economy ministry.
Argentina's continued economic recovery remains, therefore, unhealthily
dependent on a few individuals.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Apprenticeship scheme sparks scepticism: Split over
education reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Widespread scepticism is expressed by Tec directors over the impact of the
government's 'modern apprenticeship' scheme on skills shortages.
Forty-eight per cent of directors questioned in the survey of the 82 Tecs in
England and Wales said that they did not believe employers would support the
scheme in sufficient numbers to make a significant impact on skills
shortages.
But 44 per cent disagreed, with the strongest support coming from voluntary
and private-sector employers.
The scheme - which is being piloted - aims to create a new generation of
skilled workers.
Directors' attitudes may be influenced by the fact that little information
is available yet on how much extra the government will pay employers to
train young people to National Vocational Qualification level three, the
vocational equivalent of two A-levels.
At present most of those who take part in Youth Training schemes attain NVQ
level two, the vocational equivalent of four GCSEs.
Directors were also divided over the educational reforms of Mr John Patten,
the education secretary, with 51 per cent saying that they rated the
government's educational reforms as 'satisfactory' or 'very satisfactory' at
better equipping young people for jobs while 47 per cent disagreed.
The idea of a 'universal credit', which would be offered to all young people
at the age of 16 going into part-time or full-time education and training,
received strong support. A total of 77 per cent of directors favoured such a
move. The government said in its recent white paper on competitiveness that
it was consulting widely on the feasibility of such a plan.
Many Tecs are forging partnerships with local authorities for the delivery
of the Careers Service. A large number of directors said their main priority
for the service was earlier careers advice for young people, which should be
more independent of teachers.
Tecs administer Youth Training, a scheme for young people, and Training for
Work, a programme for unemployed adults, funding for which has been cut this
year. Fifty-seven per cent of directors said that government spending on
training the unemployed adults was too low, a belief that was shared by 96
per cent of trade union members on Tecs.
Increasingly the government is paying Tecs for 'outputs' - getting an
unemployed person into a job or helping them acquire qualifications. The
National Council for Voluntary Organisations said yesterday that this was
encouraging discrimination against trainees with special needs.
Of directors, 55 per cent said the regime was forcing Tecs to discriminate
against trainees who needed a lot of help, a view held by 88 per cent of
board members drawn from trade unions and 81 per cent of those from the
voluntary sector. A total of 46 per cent of private-sector employers agreed.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Northern chambers report steady economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, JAMES BUXTON and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business climate is improving steadily across most of the north of
England and Scotland but export performance is patchy and mid-term
confidence has fallen in the north-east, a clutch of surveys showed
yesterday.
The surveys, by three chambers of commerce, suggest that Scottish companies
are the most optimistic in the northerly regions.
Economic recovery is strengthening in Scotland with business confidence
rising in all sectors except retailing, and demand increasing faster than in
the first quarter of the year, according to the Scottish chambers of
commerce.
Optimism rose in the Scottish construction industry on the back of a modest
rise in orders from the private sector, but orders in the public sector
remained a cause of concern. Business improved in the tourism and leisure
sectors.
There is a significant rise in confidence among Scottish manufacturers,
which reported a strong increase in sales and orders.
This picture was at odds with surveys in north and north-east England, which
both reported poorer export conditions.
A quarterly survey by the Northern Development Company in association with
the Teesside and Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce says companies in the
north-east and Cumbria found improvements in UK sales and orders as well as
export sales in the second quarter.
There has been a fall in export orders, however, and in investment in plant,
machinery and buildings. The survey shows business confidence in the medium
term falling.
A quarterly survey by Sheffield and Rotherham chamber of commerce and
industry was slightly more upbeat.
Companies said that demand and output were showing continuous, if uneven,
growth in domestic markets.
More than half of the manufacturers in the survey reported rising sales in
the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of the year, when 42 per
cent said sales were up. Order books are growing, although export markets
were disappointing.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Directors aim to practise as they preach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Tecs seek to practise what they preach when it comes to the
promotion of best training practices in their own companies, says the
survey.
Seventy-eight per cent of directors said their companies or employers were
committed to Investors in People, the government-inspired standard that
seeks to match a company's training more effectively to its business needs.
But penetration of the scheme into business and employment at large is much
lower. About 1,000 companies have achieved the standard while 8,700 are
committed to achieving it. This means the scheme covers only about 12 per
cent of the UK workforce.
Directors whose companies or employers are not committed to Investors in
People gave reasons including the scheme being too expensive and too
bureaucratic.
Tec directorships attract individuals from a wide spectrum of beliefs -
asked how they would tackle unemployment, respondents made a range of
suggestions, including banning overtime, a public works scheme and greater
control of immigration.
Enthusiasm for long periods on a Tec board seems to be flagging. The number
of directors who have been with their Tec for more than a year has fallen to
80 per cent from last year's 89 per cent, while the proportion expecting to
spend more than two years with their board has also fallen, from 91 per cent
to 78 per cent.
A total of 59 per cent of directors said they spent more than three hours a
week on Tec-related activity, compared with 56 per cent last year.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Construction orders hit four-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction contracts were worth almost Pounds 2.1bn in May, the highest
figure for four years, figures published yesterday by the Environment
Department show.
The surge follows a dip in orders in March and April which caused concern
that the pace of construction recovery might be faltering.
Industry leaders said yesterday that the latest increase was encouraging.
There was concern, however, that a rise in interest rates could halt
progress. Mr Christopher Vickers of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, said: 'Any rise now would be a blow to confidence.'
The recovery had been expected to slow following the bunching of large
contracts at the end of last year, when the government approved the Pounds
1.9bn Jubilee Underground line extension in London.
The value of construction orders in the three months to the end of May, at
constant 1990 prices, was 13 per cent lower than in the previous three
months but 12 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.
Most encouraging for the industry and the economy in general was a sharp
rise in April and May of private-sector orders for offices, shops, factories
and warehouses, indicating that the recovery is starting to prompt increased
investment by manufacturers and services industries.
Orders for private industrial construction were a third higher than in the
same period last year and 7 per cent higher than in the previous three
months. Private commercial orders were 29 per cent higher than a year ago
but 2 per cent lower than in the preceding three months.
The rise in private-sector investment will need to be sustained to offset
falls in public spending if construction output is to continue rising. Road
orders in April and May fell to Pounds 69m and Pounds 46m respectively,
compared with a monthly average of Pounds 140m in the preceding 15 months.
The value of all infrastructure contracts in the quarter fell 34 per cent
compared with the previous three months and 6 per cent compared with the
corresponding period last year.
Private housing orders were 18 per cent higher than a year ago, but 2 per
cent lower than in the previous three months.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Consumer survey reports little interest in saving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers believe this is the worst time for saving than at any period in
the past five years, a quarterly consumer survey by Gallup and BSL, the
business consultancy, shows.
The survey shows that a balance of nearly 50 per cent of people believe this
is a bad time to save - the highest figure since the survey started in 1989.
Savings intentions have also fallen to their lowest level recorded, with the
balance of consumers intending to save now less than 40 per cent.
Although this fall may reflect the low level of interest rates, the survey
suggests that the main factor is that 'households are to some extent
compensating for their weak finances by running down their savings'.
The results suggest that households have been surprisingly successful in
planning for the impact of April's tax increases, and continue spending at a
steady rate. Household finances were expected to deteriorate in the second
quarter, at the same rate as in the first quarter, before the tax rises.
The survey calculates that spending rose 0.5 per cent in the past quarter
compared with the previous quarter, and by 3.4 per cent compared with the
same period last year.
The confidence of consumers in their own spending intentions remained
unchanged between the first and second quarters.
Mr David Fell, director of BSL, said: 'It is perhaps surprising that the
actual tax rises should have had so little impact.' But, he added: 'It
remains to be seen how long consumers will be willing to run down their
savings to support spending.'
One factor that might scale back spending later this year is that consumers
have become more gloomy about economic prospects, he said.
Fear of unemployment has fallen in all regions apart from East Anglia and
the south-east and is at its lowest since the middle of 1990.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Tecs 'more keen' to merge with chambers: FT survey of
training chiefs finds frustration with Whitehall links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Training and Enterprise Councils have shown a sharp increase in
their willingness to merge with chambers of commerce, an annual survey by
the Financial Times shows.
The survey is the third to canvass the 1,220 board members of the 82 Tecs in
England and Wales, which are responsible for delivering the government's
main training programmes. The annual conference of Tec directors opened in
Birmingham last night and was addressed by Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary.
About 47 per cent of directors backed mergers between Tecs and chambers of
commerce, with 45 per cent against. In 1992 just 20 per cent supported such
a move.
The trend is indicative of a greater willingness by Tecs to work with
partners, and their growing involvement in providing business help. Several
Tecs now have a formal commitment to merging with chambers.
But most Tec directors expressed frustration over their lack of independence
from the government.
A total of 71 one per cent said that they did not believe that Tecs - an
experiment in partnership between the government and the private sector -
were sufficiently independent of the government.
The government is one of the main customers of Tecs and pays them more than
Pounds 2bn a year to administer publicly funded training programmes and to
foster enterprise.
The government has also fostered closer links between Tecs and chambers,
particularly through Business Links, the new umbrella bodies for business
advice in which Tecs work with agencies including chambers.
Tec directors, most of whom come from the private sector, this year
expressed even stronger support for the promotion of economic development as
their top priority. Support is also growing among trade union and
public-sector members.
Directors said strategies for economic development took up more time than
managing government programmes for the adult unemployed and young people.
However, in spite of reforms - such as the new integrated regional offices,
which co-ordinate policy at local level for several government departments -
66 per cent of directors said Whitehall was not properly co-ordinating its
work with Tecs.
The government is still attempting to strike a balance between making Tecs
publicly accountable and giving them the freedom they say they need to
operate effectively.
New three-year licensing agreements to be issued to Tecs meeting tough
criteria are to be rolled out over the next few years, and should assuage
some frustration.
The need for Tecs to be seen as accountable to their wider public is an
issue that has been taken up by a number of bodies, including the
Confederation of British Industry.
A total of 83 per cent said Tecs should be open to public scrutiny, with the
private-sector members recording the lowest support for such a policy, at 78
per cent.
Asked how this aim could be furthered, directors suggested open annual
general meetings, more open days and Tec membership schemes. A few advocated
a change in board composition, to include more local authority
representatives. One director suggested full public scrutiny of all grants
greater than Pounds 50,000.
A greater willingness to work with other bodies operating in the fields of
enterprise was expressed.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Electronics companies shun local suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronics companies based in Scotland are obtaining a sharply diminished
proportion of their manufacturing materials locally. A survey shows that the
share of Scottish made inputs fell from 12 per cent in 1992 to 5 per cent
early this year.
This is in spite of a 27 per cent rise in the value of the Scottish
electronics industry output in the same period, taking it to Pounds 9.3bn.
The survey, conducted by Speed (Scottish Partnership in Electronics for
Effective Distribution) - a pressure group for better Scottish transport
links - found that 37 per cent of inputs measured by value came from the Far
East, compared with 24 per cent in 1992.
The proportion of continental European supplies fell from 24 per cent to 20
per cent while products from the rest of the UK fell from 15 per cent to 10
per cent. US-made inputs rose to 27 per cent from 24 per cent.
The cost of imported materials was Pounds 5.34bn compared with Pounds 4.9bn
in 1992.
The sharp fall in the proportion of locally made supplies will dismay
electronics industry leaders, who last year launched a programme to increase
the indigenous content of Scotland's electronics output.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Scots business rates 'to soar'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish businesses are set to suffer badly compared with those in London
and the south of England when the results of the latest non-domestic rating
revaluation come into force next year, a property consultancy has warned.
Grimley JR Eve says businesses in Scotland will see their rates bills soar
50 per cent or more next year if the new valuations are applied in full.
While office rental values increased substantially in Edinburgh and Glasgow
between the last revaluation in April 1988 and the new one in April 1993,
rental values in London fell.
The valuations will also nullify much of the benefit Scotland has gained in
the past few years from the Scottish Office's policy of reducing the
Scottish business rate poundage through increased subsidies to councils.
This policy has been aimed at cutting the burden of non-domestic rates in
Scotland and bringing them down to the same levels as in England.
A uniform business rate is applied in England and Wales, amounting to 42.3p
in the pound this year, but a uniform rate has not been achieved in
Scotland.
Grimley JR Eve says that between April 1988 and April 1993 office rents in
Edinburgh rose by 70 per cent, and those in Glasgow by 62 per cent, the
highest increases in the UK. But rental values in the City of London dropped
by 60 per cent and those in the West End by 53 per cent.

The programme, which was made by Fulcrum Productions, analysed economic

FT  13 JUL 94 / Training budget cuts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budget cuts in government funded training programmes are leading to gaps in
skills training for young people and the long-term unemployed, the National
Council for Vocational Organisations said, Lisa Wood writes.
Training providers are being required to produce quicker and cheaper jobs or
qualifications to meet targets as they face cuts of 21 per cent in Training
and Enterprise Council budgets.
Tec training budgets for 1994-95 totalled Pounds 1.7bn as opposed to Pounds
1.8bn last year.
Mr Martin Ayton, policy and campaigns officer, said: 'Provision is now being
rationed according to financial rather than training needs.'
The survey also found that 16 per cent of training providers in the
voluntary sector had their total funding cut by more than half, and many
were in financial jeopardy.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Big electricity users 'suffering high price rises'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big industrial users of electricity in the UK have suffered
disproportionately from price increases since electricity privatisation,
says a report published yesterday by the Chemical Industries Association.
The report says that the only large European country where prices have risen
faster in the past six years is Italy. It adds that UK electricity prices
have increased by about 42 per cent since privatisation of the electricity
industry was mooted.
It says electricity prices are 13 per cent to 18 per cent higher than
average of prices in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Only German large users pay more for electricity than those in the UK.
The association said energy-intensive companies were being damaged by
uncompetitive electricity prices. Corrective action was needed toprevent
erosion in the sector.
The association said that the huge increases in prices could not be
justified by a corresponding increase in costs. In six years the price of
industrial fuels, accounting for half of the total cost of electricity, had
fallen by 10 per cent.
Claims by the UK electricity generators that Continental suppliers were
subsidised were dismissed by the study. It concluded that there was little
evidence of such subsidies.
The association said one of the reasons for the large increases was that
there had been little effective competition in generation.
It called for an 18 per cent reduction in prices for large users by:
A mechanism for trading outside the pool, the industry's wholesale trading
market. A 20 per cent reduction in distribution costs through the regional
electricity companies.
The creation of dedicated generation. This would mean customers who accepted
the risks of trading outside the pool with a fossil-fuel supplier would not
have to subsidise nuclear energy.
Meanwhile the pool's annual report yesterday said the average selling price
of electricity traded through the pool was Pounds 26.61 per MWh in the year
to April 1. This compared with an average price of Pounds 24.19 in the
previous year.
The report said that there had been a number of price jumps during the year
because of occasional shortages of plant available to meet demand.

FT  13 JUL 94 / More schools reported to be doing simplified tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government measures to simplify the compulsory testing of schoolchildren
appear to have been successful in raising the number of schools taking the
tests, according to figures released yesterday by the Department for
Education.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, has claimed that
fewer than 10 per cent of schools took part in the tests.
Early figures from the Schools Curriculum and Testing Authority, the quango
in charge of testing in England and Wales, show that about a third of
secondary schools took the science and maths tests for 14-year-olds. Just 23
per cent of schools set the English test, which has been at the centre of
controversy over its content and evaluation.
Last year 2 per cent of secondary schools took part following a boycott by
the three largest teaching unions over the workload.
More than half of primary schools took part in testing seven-year-olds this
year compared with 18 per cent last year.
And most ordered the prototype tests for 11-year-olds due to be introduced
next year. The department said that there had been 'a high level of
participation' in the pilot tests.
The NUT, which boycotted the tests for the second year running, said that
the figures did not show how many pupils had sat all three tests or what
proportion of the results had been reported to the government.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said: 'I stand by my claim that very few
schools - primary or secondary - will have reported test results to the
government in full.'
School organisation and career structures should be changed to allow
teachers more time to teach, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers has
told the teachers' pay and conditions review body.
The union said that education reforms had increased the administrative
burden on classroom teachers and suggested that schools should band together
and employ more administrative staff.

FT  13 JUL 94 / PM tells water chiefs to limit pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of privatised water companies should abide by the government's
strict limits on pay increases for public-sector workers, Mr John Major said
yesterday.
During rowdy Commons exchanges the prime minister defended water
privatisation against repeated attacks by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting
Labour leader.
But he said directors of privatised utilities 'should follow the lead which
the government has set for pay in the public sector and elsewhere'.
Guidelines announced last September by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
froze the public-sector pay bill, but allowed pay increases backed by
productivity improvements.
Mr Major's comments reflect growing sensitivity among ministers about water
bills and rising salaries, which were an important issue during the European
and local elections.
The question-time row followed publication by the National Consumer Council
of a report saying that domestic water bills had risen by 67 per cent since
privatisation.
Mrs Beckett said that privatisation had turned into 'a swindle, licensed
theft and legalised robbery' of British families. 'How can you defend the
fact that the chairman of North West Water got Pounds 47,000 a year before
privatisation and now he gets Pounds 338,000?'.

FT  13 JUL 94 / MacGregor denies involvement in 'details' of Railtrack
negotiation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said at a meeting of the Commons
employment committee yesterday that he had told members of the British Rail
board on June 9 that Railtrack's 5.7 per cent interim pay offer to the RMT
transport union conflicted with government guidelines.
However, Mr MacGregor denied he was involved in the 'details' of
negotiation. In a written memorandum to the committee, the Department of
Transport said that it had been made clear to Railtrack that any increases
in pay for signal workers had to be 'offset by improvements in efficiency
and productivity and the package must represent value for money'.
During his session with the committee Mr MacGregor said he hoped the two
sides would return to negotiations and there could be an early settlement of
the dispute.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Clarke pitches for 'hard centre'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday joined ideological battle with Mr Tony Blair,
front-runner for the Labour leadership, with a pledge that the Conservatives
would occupy the 'hard centre' of British politics.
In a speech staking out the territory on which the two main parties will
fight the next general election, the chancellor warned his rightwing Tory
colleagues that the party had to respond to the new insecurities of the
middle classes.
The increasing numbers facing temporary unemployment as the economy changed
wanted to know that there was a high-quality health and education system on
which their families could depend.
The middle manager from middle England also wanted to know that there was a
'modernised, affordable welfare system which will assist him with the means
to retrain and find new employment'.
But Mr Clarke was equally adamant that Britain could not escape the
realities of the intensified competition of global markets. 'Stop the world,
I want to get off' was simply not an option, he said.
He added that alongside the security of the welfare state both the least
well-off and the citizens of middle England wanted to keep 'more of every
extra pound they earn or save'. That meant a sustained squeeze on public
spending and further cuts in marginal tax rates.
In his lecture at the London School of Economics to the Social Market
Foundation, he dismissed the idea that markets and social stability were
inevitably in conflict and said Labour was engaged in a desperate struggle
to come to terms with market forces. For all Mr Blair's talk of a 'dynamic
market economy' the opposition still depended on the notion of 'collective
power' to assist the individual.
The lecture brought an immediate attack from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, who accused Mr Clarke of 'panicking in the face of renewed
confidence on the left'. Mr Brown said recognition by the government that
crude free market theory had had its day would be greeted by the electorate
with a mixture of 'amusement and incredulity'.
Mr Clarke flatly rejected the argument that belief in market forces led to
an atomisation of society and corroded the nation's institutions. Instead he
insisted that by harnessing market signals in areas such as health,
education and police, the government was strengthening the welfare state.
The chancellor said the task of the government was to explain that 'our
agenda will continue to reconcile free market principles with an enlightened
social policy. Free market principles underwrite institutions, they do not
undermine them'.
He added that market principles such as choice and accountability
strengthened the local institutions which bound together individuals.
Reforms in the health, education and police services reinforced the sense of
'ownership' on the part of local citizens. Such an approach combined the
best of the Conservatives' One Nation tradition with Thatcherite
determination.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Signal workers reach crucial turning point: Today's stoppage
will decide if the dispute is to turn into a war of attrition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success or failure of today's strike by railway signal workers could
decide whether their industrial conflict is going to turn into a war of
attrition.
For if British Rail is able to run 20 per cent of its normal services, as it
has promised, the RMT transport union will find itself on the defensive for
the first time since the weekly one-day stoppages began.
Its executive committee is expected to step up the action tomorrow to two
days a week from July 24. But this move could rebound on the union if
Railtrack's contingency plans prove to be successful today.
For the past few weeks the RMT has displayed considerable tactical skill in
wrongfooting an often disorganised and feeble Railtrack management.
As a result, the union has won widespread public sympathy, even from
long-suffering commuters in the south-east, who have blamed the disruption
on the government rather than the RMT or Railtrack. But RMT general
secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp and his executive are in real danger now of losing
the battle for public opinion.
Solidarity and morale among the signal workers are said to remain high,
fueled by a genuine sense of grievance about eroded pay differentials. But
RMT leaders are growing more sensitive to suggestions that resolve might
start to crumble as more trains are seen to be running on strike days.
Railtrack management believes some signal workers may decide to return now
that they stand to lose an average of Pounds 120 for each two-day stoppage.
It also thinks many will come to see that the current offer is more
attractive than they first realised.
After the failure of 13 hours of negotiations at the conciliatory service
Acas early yesterday morning, Mr Knapp said the 'real difference between the
two sides is not great' and that the dispute was 'only complex and
intractable because the government has made it so'.
He believes only last-minute intervention by the Department of Transport
prevented Railtrack reaching a deal with the signal workers around June 9
which would have given them a 5.7 per cent interim pay increase and led on
to a more wide-ranging productivity settlement.
Yesterday the RMT insisted that Railtrack was 'not being allowed to
negotiate with any flexibility at all' and offering the signal workers less
than it was doing five weeks ago.
The union negotiators repeated their call for an 'up-front' pay rise for
past productivity improvements before talks could start on restructuring.
The only apparent shift in Railtrack's three-stage productivity offer was to
improve its one-off payment for the introduction of cashless pay for
everybody by Pounds 50 to Pounds 250.
But Railtrack insists that its Pounds 4.38m package is still negotiable and
its value could go up if only the RMT negotiates seriously.
Railtrack says that in the latest talks union negotiators hardened their
position at around 2am after earlier appearing more conciliatory.
Blaming the government may no longer prove a sensible tactic for the RMT.
With a continuing internal financial crisis and dwindling membership because
of the ending of the check-off system under which union subscriptions are
deducted from pay packets, the union is in no condition to sustain a
protracted fight.
The conflict has reached a crucial turning point. If one in five of all
trains run today, it will be a warning to the RMT that it might be better to
settle now than to turn up the heat after July 24.

Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said at the Commons employment
committee yesterday that he had told members of the British Rail board on
June 9 that Railtrack's 5.7 per cent interim pay offer to the RMT transport
union conflicted with government guidelines.
However, Mr MacGregor denied he was involved in the 'details' of

and productivity and the package must represent value for money'.
During his session with the committee Mr MacGregor said he hoped the two
sides would return to negotiations and there could be an early settlement of
the dispute.
He pointed out that signalling staff had enjoyed a 47 per cent real
improvement in their earnings since 1980 and benefited from the introduction
of new technology and increased investment. This compared with a 37 per cent
increase in real earnings for all manual workers in the country.
Yesterday's talks at Acas brought only a Pounds 50 improvement in
Railtrack's offer of a one-off cash payment. The RMT said Railtrack had
refused to add that sum to basic pay rates, while the company replied that
its offer was only an opening one. The union wants the company to increase
the size of the pay package from an overall figure of Pounds 4.3m. 'The
costs appear to be set in concrete, mixed at Department of Transport
headquarters in Marsham Street,' said Mr Knapp.
There are no plans for further talks.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Maxwell pension plea rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Action brought by the Maxwell pensioners to claim up to Pounds 235m from the
administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation was dismissed yesterday
by the Court of Appeal.
Three judges rejected the argument of the liquidators of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the former manager of the Maxwell pension funds, that
it had a prior claim to the first Pounds 235m of the money raised from the
sale of MCC assets. Price Waterhouse, the administrators of the largest
quoted company run by Robert Maxwell, have so far raised about Pounds 680m
from such sales.
BIM had argued that it had a prior claim over pension money wrongly paid to
MCC and should be paid before unsecured creditors.
The court awarded costs against BIM and refused leave to appeal to the House
of Lords. Lawyers for the former pension managers said later that they
intended to apply to the Lords for a further hearing.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Outcry as regulator moves to company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the group of investors complaining about Knight Williams, the
independent financial adviser, have written to the Treasury and to City
regulatory bodies expressing concern that a senior regulator has joined the
company, Alison Smith writes.
Knight Williams has recently appointed Mr Colin Pinnell to oversee its legal
and compliance department. Mr Pinnell was formerly head of legal services at
Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has already
discussed with Fimbra a number of complaints against Knight Williams.
Disgruntled investors are seeking assurances that the government and
regulators are satisfied there is no 'leak' of information from Fimbra to
Knight Williams about cases raised by complainants.
Past complaints have centred on the company's high charges and on investment
performance.
Mr John Williams, Knight Williams managing director, said yesterday that
while he had previously dealt with compliance matters he was increasingly
spending his time on other issues, and so Mr Pinnell had been appointed.
Both parties had agreed that there must be 'utter confidentiality' about
matters with which Mr Pinnell had been involved during his time at Fimbra,
he said.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Crackdown ordered on derivative risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A special team is to monitor the ability of the largest securities houses to
assess the risks they take with complex derivative products.
The team is being organised by the the Securities and Futures Authority, the
regulator for securities and futures brokers in the UK.
After a series of inspection visits by the SFA some of the firms, which are
mainly subsidiaries of the world's largest commercial and investment banks,
have been told to alter their risk models and their management structures.
The SFA is insisting that firms whose senior directors do not have a
reasonable grasp of work done by those who design complex products should
appoint a team which does understand them and which should then report
directly to the board.
Derivatives are contracts, such as futures and options, which pledge to
receive or deliver underlying financial instruments.
In its annual report for the year ended March 31 the SFA said the switch in
strategy followed a review of the way its surveillance division carried out
its duties at firms 'whose operations cover a wide range of different
products and especially over-the-counter and derivative products'.
The special team will monitor the activities of 24 leading securities
houses, and an annual 'risk management review' will be conducted. So far
reviews have been conducted at 12 firms, the annual report said.
The change in strategy reflects growing concern among securities regulators
worldwide about whether firms which sell over-the-counter derivatives
understand the risks they take on.
In particular, the SFA is looking at the models which each firm uses for
fixing the pricing of complex customised derivative products for which there
are no screen-based prices. The prices of these products vary widely with
market movements and the amount of capital required to be held for each will
vary widely, depending on how the price is determined.
Regulators fear that inadequate pricing models will leave firms holding too
little capital to cover losses in highly volatile trading conditions such as
those earlier this year.
On other matters, the SFA expressed concern that the disciplinary process
and its appeals procedures were increasingly lengthy, with long periods
elapsing between the discovery of rule violations and public announcements
of disciplinary actions.
Mr Christopher Sharples, the chairman, said the SFA board was considering
ways of speeding the process.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Atomic authority reduces losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Atomic Energy Authority managed to reduce its losses in its latest
financial year as it prepared for privatisation.
The Harwell-based company lost Pounds 10.7m in the year ending March 31,
compared to a loss of Pounds 46.9m a year earlier. However, the results
included large restructuring and reorganisation costs, without which the AEA
made an operating profit of Pounds 22.1m, on a level with the previous
year's Pounds 22.8m.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, the chairman, said: 'In the past year we exceeded all
our financial targets while also making the changes to our organisation
which are essential for our future growth and development.' He said that the
restructuring would cost a further 400 to 500 jobs.
Sir Anthony stressed that the AEA had succeeded in developing new markets to
replace the business now being run down by the government. Turnover with the
private sector grew 35 per cent to Pounds 63.5m and overseas by almost 40
per cent to Pounds 66.5m. Recent contracts included deals with Smithkline
Beecham, the European Space Agency and the Chernobyl clean-up campaign.
The AEA was recently split into two main parts. AEA Technology, containing
the science and engineering business, will be privatised, probably next
year. It recently appointed a chief executive, and will soon select a
marketing director.
AEA Government Division will remain in public hands to oversee the
decommissioning of the authority's many nuclear sites.
Sir Anthony said that AEA Technology would be a Pounds 250m-a-year business
capable of generating profits of Pounds 10m next year, and Pounds 20m the
year after that. 'There's plenty of potential there. I think we could double
its turnover in five to six years,' he said.
He added that the company had a long way to go but was heading in the right
direction.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Mandarins angered by ministerial numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitehall's mandarins are up in arms. They have too many ministerial
masters.
On the eve of a white paper foreshadowing more cuts in civil-servant
numbers, the mandarins are complaining that ministers have exempted
themselves from the Conservative drive to reduce the size of the state.
A handful of optimists in Whitehall are suggesting that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, might use the forthcoming reshuffle to practise what the
government preaches and cut the number of jobs for the boys - and girls.
Realists predict the prime minister will be more concerned to maintain the
fragile peace on the Tory back benches, so patronage will again come before
principle.
The Treasury estimates that privatisation and contracting out has cut the
size of the government by about a quarter since the start of the Thatcher
revolution in 1979.
Civil-service numbers have fallen 24 per cent from 732,000 to 554,000.
Today's white paper will forecast another fall to below 500,000.
But ministers have made sure that they are insulated from the chill winds of
competition. Comparison of the official lists shows that there were 81
ministers and 21 paid government whips in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first
administration. Now there are 87 ministers and the same number of whips.
If these well-heeled ministers had suffered the same squeeze as their
mandarins, the number chauffeured to and from their plush offices at
taxpayer's expense would have fallen to a mere 62.
The cost is not borne only by the taxpayer. Superfluous ministers add to the
workload of their civil servants. Each demands a private office of
high-flying officials. Many more are deployed in keeping them out of
mischief or finding them something to do.
A random survey of top officials yesterday revealed that the problem is
spread right across the government. For all his managerial expertise Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, apparently needs six
ministers to help him spend one of the smallest budgets in Whitehall.
At the Treasury Sir Terence Burns, the permanent secretary, has slashed the
number of top officials. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has four
ministerial helpers.
The Department of Transport has separate ministers for roads and for public
transport in spite of its promise of an integrated transport policy. At
Environment Mr John Gummer has five middle-ranking and junior ministers to
help him contemplate the future of the planet.
Nor can these myriad parliamentary under-secretaries, ministers of state,
solicitors-general and economic secretaries claim their Westminster
workloads have increased. Responses to MPs questions more often than not
consist of referrals to the relevant agency or privatised business.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Football clubs to confer over tax probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Football Association's Premier League has called a meeting of leading
clubs to help co-ordinate their response to a tax investigation by the
Inland Revenue's Special Office - the arm of the Revenue that carries out
special probes.
The agenda for the meeting, to be held in London on August 9, includes
discussions of loans to players, payments to agents, testimonial matches for
players and relocation expenses.
In a letter to the clubs Mr Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief
executive, recommends that they do not grant the Revenue full access to
records and players' files.
He says: 'You should be aware that the working party advisers are unanimous
in the view that it is preferable to undertake your own review, rather than
allow Special Office unrestricted access.'
The FA recently fined Tottenham Hotspur, the London Premier League club,
Pounds 1.5m, deducted six league points for next season and banned it from
the season's FA Cup competition after deciding that it had contravened FA
rules by making interest-free loans to players between 1985 and 1989.
Tottenham says it has settled with the Revenue and will not be at the
meeting.
However, the Premier League's efforts on behalf of clubs being investigated
is said to have 'hardened the resolve' of Mr Alan Sugar, Tottenham chairman,
to fight the penalty, possibly with legal action.
One football insider said: 'It's amazing that the FA hands down such a stiff
fine for things that went on before Sugar took over at Spurs and then we see
the Premier League arranging a meeting to help other clubs facing a Revenue
investigation.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / National Forest to be created by new quango
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture secretary, and Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, are setting up a company to create the National
Forest, a wooded landscape over 194 sq miles of the Midlands.
The National Forest is designed to rehabilitate a landscape spoiled by
mining, to provide new rural business opportunities and to create
recreational facilities.
The company will have its spending controlled by the government with a
corporate plan approved by ministers each year. The quango's operations will
start formally on April 1 next year.
Mr Gummer said in a Commons written answer: 'A new independent body will be
able to co-ordinate and promote new partnerships and act as a catalyst for
local and national initiatives in the Forest area.'
Creation of the forest will need the participation of the Forestry
Commission, local authorities, landowners and the Countryside Commission,
which has sponsored the forest since conceiving it in 1987.
Mr Gummer said there would be public funding 'to provide financial support
for the company's administration and special project initiatives'. But he
did not specify the amount and this is unlikely to be clear until the
government has completed its review of forestry incentives.
Ms Susan Bell, leader of the Countryside Commission team which has done the
preliminary work on establishing the National Forest, estimated that
spending of Pounds 50m would be needed over the next 10 years.
Mr Gummer said that establishment of the new company 'marks a milestone
towards achieving our manifesto commitment to develop the National Forest'.
It takes the project out of the control of the Countryside Commission.
Ms Bell noted that the forest 'is so heavily dependent on government money
that the government wanted to maintain control over that money'.
The forest is expected to find funds from English Partnerships, the
government regeneration agency, the European Union, forestry grants to
landowners and the Countryside Commission, which has earmarked Pounds 2m a
year.
The National Forest straddles parts of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and
Staffordshire, surrounding the towns of Burton-upon-Trent, Swadlincote,
Ashby de la Zouch and Coalville.

FT  13 JUL 94 / SIB consolidates powers with Melton Medes ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court judgment dismissing an action to sue the Securities and
Investments Board for allegedly breaching provisions in the Financial
Services Act about passing on 'restricted' information is seen by the
regulator as a crucial consolidation of its powers.
It also has far-reaching implications for other regulators which have not
yet had to test their authority to disclose information in the courts.
Moreover, it establishes the right of SIB, the City's chief regulatory
watchdog, to enforce the law without fear that individuals adversely
affected by its activities can sue it for damages.
Yesterday's ruling, dismissing a challenge by Melton Medes, a trading
conglomerate accused by SIB of breaching rules governing the investment of
pension funds, has clarified the issue. The judge's ruling amounted to a
sweeping endorsement of the propriety of the regulator's operations.
By removing the possibility that it would be subject to civil claims for
damages in the future, the judgment strengthens SIB's enforcement
capability. The judge said the only remedy available to Melton Medes was to
seek a criminal prosecution of SIB or to seek judicial review.
At issue in the case was the decision of SIB to alert beneficiaries of the
Melton Medes pension scheme to the fact that the auditors to the scheme were
considering altering an unqualified audit opinion given in an earlier year.
Melton Medes and Mr Nathu Ram Puri, its chairman, alleged that this amounted
to a breach of section 179 of the Financial Services Act which prevents the
disclosure of restricted information.
The issue arose after Imro began an inquiry into Melton Medes Pension
Trustees Ltd in early 1992. This related to a loan of Pounds 5m from the
pension funds to the company itself. Although repayment was made, it came in
the form of shares of two companies of which one of the pension trustees was
a director.
At the same time, some beneficiaries of the pension fund began legal action,
seeking Pounds 7m compensation for losses allegedly arising from this loan.
Melton Medes argued that had the beneficiaries not been alerted to the
auditors' concerns by SIB, they would have agreed to settle all their claims
without asking the company to add anything to the pension scheme.
However, in ruling on whether restricted information had been disclosed, Mr
Justice Lightman said it clearly had not. Alerting beneficiaries to
information which may exist elsewhere is not the same as disclosing
information actually in its possession, he said.
'SIB had no duty to refrain from procuring or inducing others lawfully to
disclose information, merely because SIB could not itself lawfully make such
disclosure,' he said.
Moreover, the judge said, information about the auditors' concerns had
actually been available publicly as it had figured in an earlier court case.
Under the Financial Services Act, information that has been disclosed
publicly elsewhere cannot be deemed to be restricted.
Mr Justice Lightman emphasised that there were absolutely no restrictions on
disclosure by SIB of non-restricted information.
'I can see no basis for any suggestion that it was beyond the powers of SIB
to disclose non-restricted information to assist the beneficiaries in the
beneficiaries' action,' Mr Lightman said in his 22-page ruling.
'Indeed the provision of assistance in this form to the beneficiaries would
appear to me entirely to accord with the aim of the act and the role of SIB,
namely the protection of the interests of investors and the customer (as
against the provider) of financial services.'
SIB investigators obtained information from Kidsons Impey, the fund's
auditors, and disclosed other information to the accountants that SIB had
obtained during its investigations. The provision of this information was
covered by a gateway permitted in the act.
At a meeting in January 1993 between Kidsons and SIB, the auditors said that
had they previously been aware of the information passed to them by SIB,
they may well have qualified the fund's accounts, instead of signing
unqualified reports.
The SIB official concerned later asked the solicitor acting for the
beneficiaries whether he was happy to rely upon the auditor's earlier
certificate.
At the root of his concern was that this might lead the beneficiaries to
accept worse terms than they might otherwise be able to obtain.
The judge was asked to rule on three issues. First, whether anyone has a
private right to sue SIB if breaches of section 179 occur. Second, whether
SIB had acted in 'bad faith' in talking to the beneficiaries' lawyer. Third,
whether the information passed on amounted to a breach of section 179.
Mr Justice Lightman ruled in favour of SIB on all three points.
The only sanction provided by the act against a section 179 breach was
criminal prosecution so private actions could not be brought, he said.
He rejected the allegation that SIB had acted in bad faith, saying SIB had
specifically refused a request to support the claim of the scheme
beneficiaries. Awarding 'indemnity costs' to SIB, Mr Lightman said the case
for 'bad faith' had never been made and the case should never have been
allowed to proceed. He refused the plaintiff's request for leave to appeal.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Council shake-up plans defy Gummer view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission for England yesterday repeated its
recommendation that most of County Durham should keep a two-tier structure
of local government, in spite of the refusal from Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to accept this proposal when it was first made last
year.
Mr Gummer said he expected all-purpose unitary authorities, combining the
functions of both district and county councils, to emerge from the review.
The commission's refusal to alter its position is seen to signal its
independence from the government.
Its recommendation, following a second review of opinion in the area, is
that Darlington should have unitary status, with the rest of the county
covered by the county council and seven districts.
Lead commissioners Mrs Ann Levick and Mr David Ansbro denied that the
commission was challenging Mr Gummer and his enthusiasm for unitary
authorities. Mrs Levick said: 'We are required to find out what local people
want. It will be seen as an assertion of the commission carrying out its
remit, within the terms of the guidance.'
The commission, she added, was independent. 'I have broad shoulders. I have
no problem with flak.'
During the second review the commission received fewer than 100
representations, some of them questioning the need for the second review.
This compared with 27,900 after its first review, of which only 12 per cent
favoured a unitary district option.
Mr Allan Roberts, chief executive of Sedgefield district council, which
campaigned for unitary authorities, criticised the decision.
He said: 'If the review's just going to be tinkering around with those
authorities which are unpopular one has to question whether the whole
exercise has been a waste of money.'
The two-tier system is an option in both East and West Sussex under
proposals published yesterday. The commission's preferred option would see
unitary authorities in the east of the county, with two-tiers in the west.
Both Brighton and a new authority merging the coastal districts of Hove,
Adur and Worthing would become unitaries under all recommendations put
forward. The preferred option for the rest of West Sussex is the two-tier
system, while for East Sussex the commission suggests merging Eastbourne and
Lewes with south Wealden including Uckfield, and Hastings and Rother with
the rest of Wealden.
The commission believes the plan for West Sussex could save 'up to Pounds
2m' a year and would cost up to Pounds 6m to implement. The unitary plan for
East Sussex would be more expensive, costing between Pounds 22m and Pounds
25m to implement, with annual savings of between Pounds 2m and Pounds 7m.
As alternatives, the commission suggests East Sussex outside Brighton should
remain two-tier, cutting start-up costs to between Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m.
West Sussex outside the coastal strip could be split into two unitaries,
combining Arun - including Bognor Regis - with Chichester, and Crawley and
Horsham with Mid-Sussex. But this option would cost between Pounds 22m and
Pounds 24m to set up, with lower annual savings, potentially as little as
Pounds 1m.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Melton Medes legal actions scheduled for next April
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal actions over Melton Medes are scheduled to start in the High Court
next April.
The beneficiaries of the pension fund are claiming Pounds 7m compensation
for alleged losses over the loan from the pension fund to the company. They
claim the funds were improperly handled by Mr Puri and Mr James Philpott,
the company's chief executive.
In a separate action, SIB is claiming Pounds 4m damages for alleged breaches
of Imro rules in the handling of pension fund assets.
An application is before the courts for the two cases to be heard together.
It remains uncertain whether the beneficiaries will be able to fund their
action.
They are awaiting a decision on whether they can be awarded a pre-emptive
costs ruling to enable them to continue the case.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Japanese PM assailed on yen
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's two-week-old government was yesterday accused by the opposition of
lacking the economic policies needed to stem the yen's inexorable rise.
Komeito, the Clean Government party, a member of the previous government,
accused Mr Tomiichi Murayama's three-party coalition of lacking the 'will
and ability to pursue economic reforms'.
The yen hit another new high of Y97.07 to the dollar in Tokyo, rekindling
fears that its 16.7 per cent rise against the US currency since the
beginning of January could choke Japan's nascent economic recovery. At the
weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples, Tokyo failed to obtain even a
discussion of co-ordinated intervention to support the dollar, Mr Masayoshi
Takemura, finance minister, admitted yesterday.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, stepped up the campaign for
joint intervention by repeating alarm over the yen's renewed rise yesterday
at a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements.
According to a survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic daily, Japan's
top 200 companies believe taxable profits will fall by 10.2 per cent this
year, the fifth annual decline, if the dollar stabilises at Y95. Pre-tax
profits will fall by 3.4 per cent this year if the dollar sticks at Y100,
they told the survey.
The government, a coalition led by the conservative Liberal Democratic party
and Mr Murayama's left-wing Social Democratic party, also came under Komeito
criticism yesterday for lacking a 'clear-cut policy' on North Korea and the
change of leadership there. Komeito claimed that Mr Murayama's performance
at the G7 summit raised doubts over Japan's international credibility.
The exigencies of Japan's domestic politics have forced the government to
delay by a week, until July 22, a visit by Mr Murayama to South Korea, to
discuss bilateral relations and the nuclear threat.
Officials said Mr Murayama needed time to prepare for his first opportunity
to face his political foes in public when he delivers his first policy
speech to parliament next Monday, followed by two days of questions.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Role of 'Dear Leader' is still a puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The transfer of power to Mr Kim Jong-il as North Korea's new leader appears
to be proceeding smoothly, South Korea's intelligence chiefs said yesterday.
But other government officials and diplomats in Seoul readily admitted such
predictions were based mainly on guesswork.
'We don't know what is going on in North Korea. We rely heavily on the North
Korean media to tell us what's happening,' a western diplomat said,
commenting on the difficulty of penetrating one of the world's most closed
societies. Analysts were busy yesterday examining televised pictures from
Pyongyang of Mr Kim's first public appearance since his father, President
Kim Il-sung, died last week.
When he attended a lying-in-state ceremony on Monday evening, close
attention was paid to the ranking order of 100 senior officials who
accompanied Mr Kim, the 'Dear Leader', to determine if he had won the
support of the ruling Korean Workers' party, the military and the government
for his succession.
South Korean officials concluded Mr Kim's assumption of power seemed
complete, as he appeared flanked by the head of the military, Mr O Jin-u,
and Mr Kang Song-san, the prime minister.
But there is still speculation that Mr Kim may have difficulty retaining
power because he is believed to be opposed by the conservative military
leadership and other old guard elements who supported his father.
A more significant test of whether he still faces a potential power struggle
could come this week or next when the ruling party and the North Korean
parliament select a new general secretary and president.
If the 52-year-old Mr Kim is elected to both positions, it would indicate
his control over North Korea is secure. But if he must give up the nominal
position of president to another senior official, it would suggest he has
not completely established his authority.
South Korean officials cited other reasons for their belief that Mr Kim's
transition was secure. One intelligence chief said that China, North Korea's
closest ally, was making efforts to ensure that the political situation in
Pyongyang remained stable.
He indicated that Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, had earlier given
his approval for the younger Mr Kim to take over the leadership of North
Korea. This could persuade the North Korean old guard to support him as his
father's successor. Mr Kim has been criticised for lacking the credentials
of his father's revolutionary background.
South Korea's prime minister expressed confidence that Mr Kim would continue
the policies of his late father in resolving the dispute over the North's
nuclear programme by holding negotiations with the US and South Korea.

FT  13 JUL 94 / China 'may be third' in defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China spends twice as much on defence as it admits and may lag behind only
the US and Russia in total defence outlays, according to the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based defence think-tank.
It believed China's defence budget this year was worth about Yn100bn (Pounds
7.5bn), nearly twice the Yn52bn Beijing said it planned to spend. The extra
funding came from other parts of the state budget and the military's
commercial activities, the IISS added.
Depending on the method used to establish the 'purchasing power parity' of
China's defence spending, the country's current spending equalled between
Dollars 28.5bn and Dollars 45bn (Pounds 18.2bn-Pounds 28.7bn). This compared
with the Dollars 6bn Beijing says it spends based on market exchange rates.
The findings were presented at a conference on the People's Liberation Army
in Hong Kong.
Even at the lower dollar end of its estimate, expenditure this year
represented a sizeable military effort. In relative terms it is surpassed
only by the US, Russia, Britain, France, Japan and Germany. China possesses
a 'crude and lethal' nuclear war fighting capability together with 'a
potentially effective conventional capability under some conditions'.
The IISS reckoned Beijing would spend up to Dollars 6bn this year on
strategic nuclear forces, against Dollars 50bn in the US and Dollars 2.3bn
in Britain. But 'China is a nuclear power whose global reach seems only a
matter of time.'
It questioned if China got value for money from its defence spending, and if
the inheritance of a Soviet-style defence establishment would retard
development of a modern military capability.
Another threat to its fighting capability is the PLA's extensive involvement
in entrepreneurial activities. Prof Ellis Joffe, the leading PLA expert at
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that over the past two years the
military's involvement in business had got completely out of control.
'Traditionally the PLA has been involved in economic activity, but never on
this scale and never for profit,' he said. 'No army can function properly if
corruption in it is widespread.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Arco in Pounds 828m Algerian oil deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlantic Richfield of the US yesterday signed a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 828m)
production-sharing deal in an existing Algerian oilfield with Sonatrach, the
Algerian state oil and gas company.
The aim is to double the recovery rate in the Rhourde el Baguel oilfield in
eastern Algeria from 20 to 40 per cent of recoverable reserves. Of the total
investment, Dollars 1bn will be spent in exploration over the next five
years; the balance is the so-called 'entrance right'.
This is the first agreement of this type concluded since Algeria's oil and
gas exploration laws were liberalised in a new hydrocarbons law of December
1989. A string of oil exploration contracts have been signed over the past
two years which have led to pacts signed between Sonatrach and more than two
dozen international oil companies.
The Arco deal came in the face of increased nervousness among foreign
governments about the safety of their nationals in Algeria. On Monday,
gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a Romanian
working with Sonatrach. Suspected Moslem fundamentalists last week killed
seven Italian seamen, and four Algerians died yesterday in a shootout
outside Italy's Algiers embassy.
Mr Livio Caputo, Italian deputy foreign minister, said in Rome that Italy
had said it would reduce the number of Italians in Algeria and would boost
security for expatriate workers and its diplomatic missions.
Mr Antonio Martino, Italian foreign minister, discussed Algeria yesterday at
a meeting in Paris with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart.

The unexpected return of the Liberal Democratic party to power in Japan and
the rise of the Social Democratic party has been welcomed by many in the
country's farming lobby wanting to reinstate previous cosy ties with the
government.
Last week the ruling coalition decided to raise rice subsidies by 70 per
cent from the previous year to Y28.5bn (Pounds 187m) and to maintain the
state purchase price of rice at some Y273 per kilogram, several times the
world average.
The move has widely been regarded as a step backward in the push for a more
efficient farming sector and has triggered criticism from business leaders
and bureaucrats urging farming reform. 'That the reform effort seems to be
turning back is worrying,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren, a
leading business group.
For more than 40 years, Japanese farmers have been sheltered from market
forces and protected by government subsidies. The powerful rural vote, and
the cultural and emotional links among Japanese to agriculture, have helped
maintain the structure.
The smaller population of rural constituencies gave farmers a bigger voting
power, meaning they received subsidies as long as they pushed politicians
hard enough. The LDP and SDP have more rural seats than members of the
reforming multi-party coalition which they ousted in the past month.
The new government yesterday said the release of a report on farm policy
originally planned for this month would be delayed until mid-August because
of administrative reasons. Mr Taichiro Okawara, agriculture minister, called
for support of Japan's agriculture by ensuring that enough finances are
allocated to helping farmers cope with the impact of cheaper imports.
Such government policies in turn have helped maintain postage-stamp paddies
on the hillsides while forcing consumers to pay exorbitant prices for the
rice. However, younger politicians representing urban constituencies and
industrial leaders have criticised such policies.
The Keidanren, the business leaders' federation, has been calling for
deregulating rice distribution and cutting food prices by lowering direct
subsidies and the state purchase price.
Agriculture ministry officials are also trying to push farm reform before
the full-fledged liberalisation of the Japanese rice market due in 2000
under the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Partial opening of
the market to foreign imports under the trade agreement is scheduled to
start next year.
The ministry released a policy report in 1992 calling for consolidation of
rice paddies to create bigger and more efficient rice farms. It has also
been looking to increase the competitiveness of domestic rice by deflating
the artificially high rice prices.

The Hong Kong government, usually noted for being non-interventionist,
yesterday proposed an old-age pension scheme requiring compulsory
contributions from personal and corporate taxpayers, Reuter reports from
Hong Kong.
The territory, which has a comparatively low tax regime, has minimal welfare
services and no pension scheme for its aged residents. But it has recently
debated the establishment of a government-administered scheme similar to
Singapore's.
Under a consultation paper issued for comment, Hong Kong workers and
companies would have to contribute 1.5 per cent of earnings to a pension
fund that would be run by a non-government body. The government would also
have to contribute about HKDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 100.8m) in 1994 on behalf
of its civil servants.

FT  13 JUL 94 / The city that 'makes the money Beijing spends': Andrew
Gowers and Tony Walker on Shanghai, a laboratory of social and economic
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Xu Kuangdi has a neat way of summing up the relationship between his
sprawling port city and China's central government. 'In Shanghai we make
money: in Beijing they spend it,' he says.
Mr Xu, Shanghai's first vice mayor in charge of the economy and an exemplar
of the new breed of modernising official, might also trumpet his city's role
as something of a laboratory of economic and social change.
In China's latest growth phase, Shanghai, under an innovative municipal
leadership, has emerged as a place where the authorities have made greater
progress than other cities in formulating new housing and welfare policies.
With state industries undergoing painful rationalisation, and unemployment
rising in China's cities, there is scarcely a more pressing issue than the
provision of a rudimentary social security net.
Mr Xu, a 56-year-old former professor in metallurgy and a man tipped for
higher office, would be the first to admit there is still a long way to go;
but he believes that the municipal government is making progress in its
efforts to build a rudimentary social security system.
Shanghai's workers are now required to pay 5 per cent of their monthly
salaries - matched by a 7 per cent contribution from the enterprises
themselves - into an unemployment fund administered by the local Bureau of
Social Security.
Separate funds have been established for health, housing and pensions, with
their assets to be invested in infrastructure and utility projects both in
Shanghai and beyond - thus playing their part in the much-needed effort to
improve the city's power generation and transport facilities.
Many of those laid off are sent for retraining so they can transfer to
growing sectors of the local economy such as service industries. Older
workers - men over 50 and women over 45 - are pensioned off and transferred
to the care of their local communities, which provide a living allowance:
already 30,000 pensioners have been dealt with in this way.
Shanghai modelled its new social security arrangement on Singapore's
compulsory savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund, and from studying
social security systems in Japan, France, Germany, the UK and Canada.
But though proud of Shanghai's 'pioneering' efforts, Mr Xu is wary of the
suggestion that the experiment could readily be extended to other Chinese
provinces which are, in any case, developing their own schemes.
'China is so big and its development is so uneven. Also economic structures
and living standards are quite different. So making a national scheme would
be difficult,' he says. 'Finally, in 30 or 40 years when we've all
developed, we ought to be able to find a common system. But in the meantime
there are dangers in the poor provinces always looking to the rich provinces
for help. They have to work hard to improve themselves . . .'
In any case, Mr Xu insists that Shanghai - with one of the highest per
capita annual incomes in China - has long paid more than its dues to assist
the centre in evening out regional imbalances.
In the early 1980s, it was providing more than 89 per cent of locally
collected taxes to Beijing, a burden that contributed to Shanghai's stunted
development during those years. Now, under a new 'tax treaty' between the
centre and the provinces, the figure is down to a more tolerable 60 per
cent.
Mr Xu and his colleagues are also evolving a neat if unsentimental way of
dealing with their most troublesome state industries, namely those in the
textile sector which, starved of investment, have fallen on hard times.
Shanghai is restructuring the industry by moving labour-intensive tasks such
as primary cotton-processing to inland provinces such as Sichuan and
retaining the higher-value added business of manufacturing the final product
in Shanghai.
Does this not mean exploiting China's growing regional inequalities and
taking advantage of cheap labour? Mr Xu, whose father was a factory boss
before the 1949 revolution, grins and nods enthusiastically.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Peres sees religious solution to holy sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jerusalem's holy sites 'required a religious rather than a political
solution,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday, amid
reports the government was debating the ultimate form of authority over
Christian and Moslem holy sites in its Old City.
According to the Hebrew daily Ma'ariv yesterday, a proposal to establish an
international panel comprising Jordan, the Palestinians, Morocco, Saudi
Arabia and the Vatican to oversee the holy places has already been discussed
'in strictly general terms' during recent meetings between Israeli leaders
and Jordan's King Hussein and Morocco's King Hassan.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry immediately issued a denial that any
consultations had taken place, but Mr Peres appeared to indicate there was
some basis to the idea, saying Israeli and Vatican officials had already
held substantive talks on control of Christian sites in the city, and that
he welcomed King Hussein's recent calls for a Jerusalem 'religious
dialogue'.
The future of Jerusalem is arguably the most complex issue yet to be
resolved in the framework of the Middle East peace process. Israel annexed
the eastern half, including the Old City, after capturing it from Jordan in
the 1967 war, and leaders across the political spectrum have since declared
Jerusalem to be Israel's united and eternal capital.
But under the terms of its autonomy accord with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, Israel agreed to discuss the future status of the city in
negotiations due to begin in 1996. King Hussein, concerned that Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, would try to usurp the king's role as protector of the
Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site, has
recently been strenuously asserting his rights.
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, guardian of Mecca and Medina, along with Morocco's
King Hassan, who heads the Jerusalem Committee of the World Islamic
Conference Organisation, also have a deep interest in the issue.
Mr Peres stressed yesterday there could be no compromise over Israel's
sovereignty throughout Jerusalem, but then added he had no desire to see a
weakening of Jordan's influence at the Moslem holy sites, currently overseen
by the Waqf Islamic Trust, under King Hussein's control.
It may be that Mr Peres, who is among the most moderate and creative of
Israel's ministers, believes Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem might
gain international recognition if it allowed wider control of the city's
religious sites.
The issue of religious freedom in the city has been much-discussed in recent
weeks, in the light of Mr Arafat's frequently expressed desire to pray at
the Temple Mount, a request granted in principle by Mr Yitzhak Rabin's
government, but rejected in practice because of the security implications.
Mr Arafat returned to Gaza yesterday, with his wife Suha and her sister
Hala, to take up permanent residence.
In contrast to last week's triumphant homecoming visit, yesterday's
permanent return was a modest affair, with only a few dozen locals turning
out to welcome the PLO leader at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt. Mr
Arafat held an immediate meeting with Palestinian security officials, then
retired to Gaza City's Palestine Hotel to work on his agenda for the coming
weeks.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Nigerian oil strike strengthens as senior staff stop work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LAGOS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior staff in Nigeria's oil industry yesterday joined a week-long strike
by junior workers as international oil companies struggled to maintain crude
oil production, which averages about 2m barrels a day.
Many members of Pengassan, the 12,000-strong union for senior employees,
stayed away from work in the head offices of oil companies in Lagos and at
the oilfields in the Niger delta.
'It is just a matter of time before production is affected,' said an
official for one of the big oil producers yesterday. 'We cannot produce as
normal if both Pengassan and Nupeng (the blue collar workers' union) are on
strike,' he added.
'The longer the strike goes on the more our production will drop. Some of
the routine work and maintenance requires Pengassan.'
Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's oil, said: 'It certainly has had an
impact but it is too early to say how much. There is no immediate drop in
liftings of crude oil.'
Fears that the strike could seriously disrupt Nigerian exports caused world
oil prices to strengthen yesterday. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend
reached a 13-month high, with oil for September delivery quoted at just
under Dollars 18 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, up from Monday's
close of Dollars 17.45.
The markets are particularly sensitive to any loss of Nigerian production
because most of its exports are destined for the US, where oil demand is
high because of the strong economy.
Members of Pengassan occupy administrative positions in the oil joint
ventures which are majority-owned by the Nigerian government. Staff who have
walked out at the state's management company, Napims, and at the oil
ministry, provide export clearance for the operators.
Oil executives said the closure of one refinery, the Warri facility in the
south, would inevitably affect Kaduna refinery in the north as crude oil is
normally pumped from Warri to Kaduna for pro-cessing.
Nupeng's strike has already halted distribution of fuel to filling stations
in the main cities, which a military taskforce has done little to improve.
The strikers are demanding that General Sani Abacha's government 'resolve
urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of last year's
presidential election which was won by Mr Moshood Abiola, who is on trial
for treason.
Pengassan is also protesting against the loss of 3,000 members' jobs in the
first half of this year, which it blames on the government's failure to fund
its 60 per cent share of the oil joint ventures.
Oil exports account for more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange
income, which was about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) last year.

'You're kidding me,' said Morris, a T-shirt and video salesman with a street
stall in downtown Washington, on being told that the dollar has been falling
recently. 'I thought the dollar would have been rising against other
currencies.'
His reaction was not untypical. On the sunny streets of the US capital
yesterday, the plight of the greenback was way down - usually off - people's
list of concerns.
Morris had firm views on pretty much everything: 'This government is
pathetic; they wanna do something about the homeless problem. And crime.'
But the dollar? 'That doesn't really affect me day to day,' he said.
The folk of Tokyo see things differently. From breakfast table, to taxi, to
front-page headlines, the Japanese are relentlessly focused on the yen's
climb against the dollar. They are more likely to know the daily rate to two
decimal points than not at all.
Made dollar-weary by this national obsession, Mr Hiroshi Kume, a popular
Tokyo TV presenter, yesterday related the news of the yen's rise to another
record with a note of apology. 'We have relayed the news so many times
already, but the yen has again posted a record high,' he said.
'Yeah, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down,' said Mr Randy Briolat,
visiting Washington yesterday with his family from Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. 'It's really not a matter of serious concern - at least, I hope
not.'
Mr Briolat makes optical fibre and underwater cable, much of it for export.
He acknowledged that a weaker dollar could help the export side of his
business. Buttonholed just around the corner from the Treasury, Mr Briolat
did not have any idea of the yen/dollar rate, like most respondents
yesterday.
One man who did know the rate was Mr Jim Stinger, a technician with Xerox.
'The dollar has been going down fast - crashing,' he said. 'It's a good
thing. It's going to shake up people in this country and make us realise how
screwed up we are. People have gotten too lazy.'
'It's bad,' agreed Mr Cristopher Henry, a hotel receptionist. 'But it's
weird too, because the economy is doing better, especially compared with
Europe. European money should be way down. But the Japanese, they work
harder at selling their products.'
Elsewhere, it was largely blank looks, shrugs and stares - and this in one
of the most cosmopolitan US cities.
But a Metro supervisor at McPherson Square - 'can't give you my name: it's
against the rules' - shared the view that the dollar's weakness was bad for
America. 'It weakens our buying power and makes it harder for us to stand up
and say we are number one,' he said.
Alfred, a homeless man begging on 14th Street, agreed: 'The dollar ain't
like it used to be,' he said.

FT  13 JUL 94 / The Dollar in Decline: Mistrust of Clinton leads to new lows
 -Philip Gawith finds most analysts in agreement that the dollar will
probably fall further in the short term, but there is also a belief that a
change of sentiment on the US currency may be near
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If Bob Woodward's account, in his new book, of life in Mr Bill Clinton's
White House is to be believed, US financial markets have caused the
president more than a little heartache.
The latest fall in the dollar can have done little to help. Despite the best
efforts of the president and his economic team to highlight positive US
economic fundamentals, the US currency has continued to reach new lows.
But Mr Guy Whittaker, head of foreign exchange and money markets at Citibank
in London, dismisses the contention that news 'soundbites', flashed into
dealing rooms at speed, are pushing markets away from fundamentals.
'In the very, very short term, what a politician says can have an impact on
the price action, but the duration of the effect is a reflection of the
underlying market position and the behaviour of customers. The medium term
is more driven by policies and fundamental flows, rather than short-term
flows.'
The market can be driven by a herd instinct. For spot traders, the response
of the rest of the market to a given piece of data is more important than
the fundamental information it conveys. But traders argue that, while this
may sometimes lead the market in the wrong direction, it soon retraces to
reflect fundamentals.
Most analysts agree that the dollar will probably fall further in the short
term. Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets,
reports, for example, that the bulk of business being conducted on the
options side involves hedging for a further decline in the dollar, not a
recovery.
Traders argue that this is not because foreign exchange markets have become
divorced from fundamentals. Mr Whittaker says the dollar is currently
reflecting the fundamentals of a large trade deficit, reduced capital
inflows and ongoing capital outflows.
It has also suffered from the re-rating of the D-Mark, on improved growth
prospects, and of the yen, on lack of progress in opening domestic markets.
A factor in the fall of the dollar, has also been the markets' distrust of
Mr Clinton. There is also a sense that he and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury
secretary, and his team of do not always speak with the same tongue.
Lack of policy clarity has already contributed to the reluctance of the Goup
of Seven countries to endorse a dollar support package.
'Historically, central banks have found it difficult to agree on the correct
value for a currency. Clearly there are different views at the moment as to
what the appropriate value of the dollar is,' said Mr Loewy.
'We are only likely to see co-ordinated intervention when there is a much
stronger consensus on what the correct value is,' he said, adding that
European central banks see 'little value in squandering their reserves to
support the dollar when there is no clear policy from the US.'
Mr Whittaker says the dollar is now suffering from an 'investor strike'.
Although many customers believe the dollar is cheap at existing levels,
uncertainty is such that nobody is willing to buy it when there is a good
prospect it will be cheaper the next day.
'Clearly there are long-term investors still looking to sell the dollar,'
says Mr Whittaker. But until investors stop believing that dollar assets are
likely to depreciate - the currency or the underlying asset - 'any rally
will be taken as an opportunity by long-term investors to sell.'
He believes, however, that the dollar is 'not a million miles from a turning
point', with sentiment likely to change in the latter part of the year.

FT  13 JUL 94 / The Dollar in Decline: Strong US fundamentals overlooked -
Michael Prowse on the sharp divergence between America and the other big
industrial economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton did the dollar a disservice at the Naples economic
summit last weekend by signalling his apparent indifference to its
short-term fate on foreign exchange markets.
Yet the US administration's argument that traders are failing to pay
sufficient attention to strong US economic fundamentals is not without
merit.
The main point that seems to be overlooked in financial markets is the
extent of the cyclical divergence in the economic performance of the US, on
the one hand, and Europe and Japan, on the other. While most industrial
countries have languished in recession, the US is now in its fourth year of
a vigorous upswing in the business cycle.
Since the trough of the recession in early 1991, US gross domestic product
has increased by nearly 10 per cent. Gross private investment is up by one
third in real terms. Employment did not begin to recover until early 1992
but, since then, the US economy has generated about 5.3m new jobs - a
percentage increase of almost 5 per cent.
This powerful cyclical upturn, moreover, has been led by the private sector.
Overall non-farm business productivity grew by more than 4.5 per cent in
1992 and 1993.
Manufacturing productivity grew by an astounding 9.6 per cent, far faster
than in previous upturns.
Also, for the first time in recent history, the recovery was not
artificially induced by fiscal expansion. After more than a decade of large
deficits, the US Congress has co-operated with both the Bush and Clinton
administrations in reducing the deficit.
The deficit may fall below Dollars 190bn (Pounds 121bn) this fiscal year and
to as little as Dollars 150bn in fiscal 1995 - or about 2 per cent of GDP,
the lowest level since 1979.
The strong upturn has led to higher prices of some commodities, but it has
not yet put much upward pressure on broad indices of inflation. Yesterday,
the US labour department reported a zero increase in producer prices in
June, both relative to May and on an annual comparison. Excluding the
volatile food and energy components, the index fell 0.1 per cent last month
and rose only 0.6 per cent from June last year.
Consumer price figures are due today - the annual rate of increase has been
running at 2.5 per cent or less in recent months.
The Federal Reserve, moreover, has taken pre-emptive action to try to
prevent inflation rising next year, raising short-term rates 1 1/4
percentage points to 4 1/4 per cent since early February. Financial markets
tend to discount the good domestic economic news and focus instead on less
encouraging trends in the US balance of payments.
The US has run a current account deficit every year since 1982, thereby
converting itself from a creditor to a debtor nation. During the 1980s, the
current account deficit was readily financed by capital inflows - especially
Japanese purchases of securities and direct foreign investment.
The balance of payments strains have worsened recently for two reasons.
First, the current account deficit has grown rapidly in the past 18 months,
reflecting much faster growth in the US than elsewhere; it will reach about
2 per cent of GDP this year.
Capital flows have also been adverse. US investors have sought to diversify
their portfolios by increasing investment in Europe and 'emerging markets'
in developing countries. At the same time, foreigners - especially the
Japanese - have been less willing to invest in the US, following weakness of
the share and bond markets.
However, these pressures need to be seen in perspective. As the graphs show,
the dollar is not particularly weak, except against the yen. In
trade-weighted terms, the dollar has fallen by more than 5 per cent this
year but remains in its trading range of the past few years. Excluding the
yen, the dollar has strengthened in trade-weighted terms since last year.
This partly reflects the dollar's strength against currencies such as the
Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.
The strains on the US balance of payments may now be at their worst. In his
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress later this month, Mr Alan Greenspan,
Federal Reserve chairman, is likely to signal the need for further increases
in US short-term interest rates, following recent confirmation that growth
remains robust.
Some economists expect short-term rates to reach 6 per cent by early next
year. As US rates rise, capital inflows to the US are likely to recover.
The US current account deficit is also set to improve in 1995 and 1996, as
European and Japanese economies emerge from recession.
There is little reason to suppose that the deterioration of the US trade
account reflects a fundamental lack of competitiveness. US merchandise
exports to countries not in recession, including many developing countries
and much of Asia, have continued to grow vigorously, reflecting the quality
and attractive prices of US products.
Indeed, there are already signs of a recovery in overall US export growth:
export volumes for the year to date are running about 7 per cent above last
year's level, compared with about 2 per cent late last year.
The volatility of the dollar on the foreign exchanges is a source of concern
for the Clinton administration, but senior officials are justified in
accusing the financial markets of myopia. The cyclical strains on the
balance of payments are obscuring excellent underlying economic fundamentals
in the US.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Figueres bends to fiscal reality: Costa Rica's new president
is forced to be more pragmatic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fierce campaigning against economic liberalisation that won the Costa
Rican presidency for Mr Jose Mara Figueres has given way to a more pragmatic
approach since he took office in May.
Mr Figueres, a 39-year-old engineer with a master's degree in government
from Harvard University in the US, promised to renegotiate a structural
adjustment programme with the World Bank and pay greater attention to social
needs.
But the difficult fiscal position inherited by his government means Latin
America's youngest president will have to seek external financing to fulfil
social programmes.
That will oblige his government to remain in favour with the
Washington-based international financial institutions.
'His challenge is how to harmonise the relative satisfaction that there is
with the development of macro-economic policies with the level of
dissatisfaction that there is on social issues, fundamentally in health and
education,' says Mr Carlos Sojo, a political analyst.
The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have been receptive
to proposed changes to programmes suggested by a government delegation last
month, says a finance ministry adviser.
The government rejected a demand by the World Bank to reduce the public
sector by 25,000 job-holders, and has said it will implement a plan for
'state rationalisation' instead. The new government has said it would not
remove the state insurance company's monopoly in the short term and would
keep an open mind on the control by the state oil company Recope of refining
and distribution of petrol.
But Mr Leonardo Garnier, planning minister, says progress will continue on
opening the banking sector so as to let private banks offer cheque accounts,
now the preserve of state banks. The government also remains committed to
the sale of state cement and fertiliser companies.
The new economic team has been keen to stress that there will be no big
changes in a broad policy of economic liberalisation despite the campaign
rhetoric.
'We agree with the international banks' concern to liberalise the market and
make the state more efficient,' says Mr Garnier.
'But we want to find the best instruments to do so,' he added.
Costa Rica's heterodox liberalisation policies were initiated by two
governments from Mr Figueres's National Liberation party (PLN) from 1982-88,
and senior members of those administrations are now back in cabinet posts.
Since taking office on May 8, Mr Figueres has been sharply criticised by
former government ministers for reiterating campaign attacks on his
predecessors whom he accuses of leaving the state coffers empty.
Mr Rafael Angel Calderon, the previous president, has pointed to
single-digit inflation, healthy foreign exchange reserves, 6 per cent
growth, and low unemployment as the achievements of his administration. His
government also signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico, and oversaw sharp
growth in exports and tourism, reducing traditional dependency on coffee and
bananas.
But economists say that, in the run-up to the election, the previous
government, in keeping with traditional priorities at such times,
artificially held down prices and let the fiscal deficit run, leaving Mr
Figueres with a legacy of debt and repressed inflation. 'If I were the
finance minister I would sit down and weep,' says Mr Dennis Melendez, an
economic consultant.
A close examination from the International Monetary Fund, which is expected
to send a mission this month, is immnent for the government. It is keen to
re-establish a stand-by agreement with the fund as an indication to lenders
that it is following sound macro-economic policies.
Mr Carlos Manuel Castillo, who combines the role of central bank president
with that of economic supremo, went on national television recently to say
that the government hoped to reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.8 per cent of
gross domestic product by the end of 1995. This is unlikely to impress the
fund.
Mr Figueres took over the presidency 46 years after his father, Jose 'Pepe'
Figueres, overthrew Mr Calderon's father and set off a brief but bloody
civil war. A victorious Mr Figueres abolished the armed forces and
implemented extensive social reforms.
His son's efforts to emphasise social issues will be hampered by the split
in his party over his nomination, which followed accusations that his
alleged involvement in the murder of a small-time drug dealer in 1973 made
him an unfit candidate.
His government's slim margin of victory in the election in February also
means he does not enjoy a strong mandate, and acrimony with the opposition
party does not augur well for future negotiations with Congress, where he
will require opposition support.

FT  13 JUL 94 / UN condemns expulsion of Haiti mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council yesterday condemned the Haitian regime's expulsion
of an international human rights mission, calling it a 'serious escalation'
of the military-led government's defiance.
In a statement approved at a brief open meeting after private talks, the
council also condemned the authorities' move to avoid 'appropriate
international scrutiny' while indiscriminate violence against civilians was
increasing.
The Haitian government's provocative behaviour threatened regional peace and
security. The council would hold the regime individually and collectively
responsible for the safety of 'the international presence' in Haiti.
The action against the mission, sent by the UN and the Organisation of
American States, would further reinforce the council's determination to
bring about a rapid and definitive solution to the crisis.
However, there was no immediate indication that the council was considering
further concrete measures to enforce its will after it had imposed extensive
economic sanctions.
The council session took place after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, and Mr Christopher Thomas, acting head of the OAS, had
bowed to Haitian demands that some 100 international staff of the human
rights mission be evacuated. A UN spokesman said they would leave 'in the
next day or so'.
In Haiti, the government yesterday threatened to punish any of its citizens
supporting military intervention aimed at toppling the military regime of Lt
Gen Raoul Cedras.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Have skills, will travel, if the price is right - Jurek
Martin in New York casts an eye over some of the tournament's 'mercenaries'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The identity of the first sporting mercenary may be debated. One may have
been mentioned by Virgil but, sadly, handy copies of the Aeneid are not
normally available in New York hotel rooms.
Yet the sporting mercenary has certainly been a phenomenon this century. Jim
Thorpe, the great American-Indian athlete, would play for pay (he had hardly
any choice, given the discrimination against him).
English cricket saw the likes of Learie Constantine from the West Indies
before Brian Lara's father was born. The great Real Madrid soccer team of
the 1950s was made by Puskas of Hungary and di Stefano of Argentina.
There used to be powerful opposition to importing talent. Yorkshire County
Cricket Club only recently crumbled to allow those not born in the county to
perform, while limits on the number of foreign players are still commonplace
across sports, and only, perhaps, most prevalent in Japan.
Baseball even used to have a legal foundation for restricting the trade in
players. Until the reserve clause binding a player to a club was declared
illegal in the 1970s, transfers could only be effected by the club.
All that has now changed, and this World Cup has brought home that soccer
players are just actors on a world stage, free to find the best-paying
repertory company around.
Even the insular British have become accustomed to this, which says
something given the hostility barely 30 years ago to the idea that John
Charles and Denis Law would go off and play in Italy. (I bumped into Law on
a slow train to Manchester a few years back; he said it was the best thing
he ever did).
Now the English fan may enjoy vicarious pleasure, or the reverse, from the
performance here of Russian and Norwegian goalkeepers (Chelsea and Spurs), a
Bulgarian mid-fielder (Ipswich), just about every member of the 22-strong
Irish squad, and doubtless a few more besides.
In fact, the only teams here whose whole squad only performs at home were
Greece, for reasons which became apparent after watching the Greeks play;
South Korea, which is a long way away; and Saudi Arabia, which has only
recently started taking soccer seriously. But there are three or four Saudis
now with real market value.
African players have already begun to explore Europe and elsewhere - for the
Indomitable Lions of Cameroon it may have been the only way to get paid.
Rashidi Yekini, the Nigerian striker, is one who plies his wares overseas.
When Spain played Italy last weekend, 16 of the 22 on the pitch as the match
began had appeared in the AC Milan-Barcelona European Cup final earlier this
spring. And that could not include Stoichkov, the Bulgarian wizard, who
plays for the Spanish team.
If Ireland are the ultimate mercenary side, with none of their squad
currently playing in the Irish leagues, Bulgaria lead the semi-final pack,
with two-thirds of their 22-member squad, and almost all their starters,
having present or past experience in other European leagues.
Romario and Bebeto of Brazil play in Spain and Portugal, as do several
team-mates; there are Swedes all over the place; and if most of the Italians
stay at home they have the compensation of performing in the most
cosmopolitan league of the lot.
This familiarity may breed personal contempt, but it also generates
knowledge of the opposition, almost regardless of what national colours they
are playing under. The capacity now for any side to arrive at the World Cup
virtually unknown is much reduced.
This seems to have been Bulgaria's particular ace-in-the-hole. Lechkov,
whose goal dethroned Germany, may be the only Bulgarian at present playing
in the Bundesliga (for Hamburg), but the likes of Stoichkov (Barcelona),
Kostadinov (FC Porto) and Balakov (Sporting Lisbon) have been knocking the
ball around against Germans at the best club level for years. At the very
least, this made them unafraid. At most, it may have made them confident.
Letchkov owned up after the match that he had advised his coach beforehand
that Thomas Hassler was the German to watch. Hassler happens to play in
Rome, which either does or does not prove the point, but he did play well,
as the Bulgarian predicted.
Ironically, Lechkov out-jumped the smaller Hassler to score his winning goal
(and the FT apologises for fingering Kohler as the guilty party, but it was
at the other end of the stadium, and delerious Bulgarian journalists - Sid
and Doris Bonkov - were throwing their soft drinks, hats and programmes at
the TV replay screens).
It may not always work. No-one has yet figured out a way to stop Romario and
Bebeto, their European familiarity notwithstanding.
Nor has it proved possible entirely to neutralise the Baggios for a full
game, though both have disappeared from action for long stretches at a time.
Of course, mercenaries do not always win battles, and even the French
Foreign Legion's batting average is less than perfect. But it did not
qualify for this World Cup either.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Repeat of classic final may lie ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It could be a repeat of the classic World Cup final of 1970. Today, Brazil
and Italy, both three-time winners of the World Cup, have a chance of
producing a rematch of that final in Mexico City 24 years ago when a
Pele-led Brazil trounced the Italians 4-1 with breathtaking soccer.
To reach this year's final on Sunday, Brazil must beat Sweden and Italy best
Bulgaria in the semi-finals. Odds-makers expect them to do so.
If Brazil and Italy survive, it will set up a Romario vs Roberto Baggio
final, with several other intriguing rivalries on view, much like those in
1970. Then, Pele, Jairzinho, Gerson and Carlos Alberto scored the goals that
downed Italy and won the world's admiration.
Man for man, Italy probably had a stronger team in 1970 than it does now.
But at least one problem looms for Brazil: a fired-up Roberto Baggio.
In today's semi-finals, Bulgaria will face Baggio while the Italians must
handle another in-form striker, Hristo Stoichkov. With good support from
Emil Kostadinov and Yordan Letchkov, Stoichkov was a handful for Argentina
and defending holders Germany - the two 1990 finalists - and Bulgaria beat
both on the way to the semis.
Brazil had problems dealing with Sweden in the first round, Romario scoring
the equaliser in a 1-1 draw.
The Swedes have top-quality attackers in Martin Dahlin (fighting injury),
Tomas Brolin and Kennet Andersson but will be without influential
mid-fielder Stefan Schwarz, who is suspended.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Colombia 'misusing pesticides'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers in the rapidly expanding Colombian flower industry are routinely
exposed to pesticides banned in the west, says a report published yesterday
by Christian Aid, the UK aid agency.
A fifth of the pesticides are banned or not registered in the US or Europe
because of their toxicity, according to an analysis for Christian Aid by The
Pesticides Trust, an independent UK research organisation, said Ms Sarah
Stewart, author of the report.
Legal pesticides are misused, so that many of the 70,000 flower workers
suffer nausea, fainting and skin irritations.
Colombia produces over 3.5bn flowers a year, worth more than Dollars 350m
(Pounds 230.2m).
Urging importers to restrict purchases to companies obeying guidelines, Ms
Stewart said: 'Colombian law is very good regarding the import and
application of pesticides, and the rights of the workforce. The problem is
enforcement.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Video evidence leads to ban for Tassotti
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time at a World Cup, Fifa, soccer's governing body, has used
video replays to punish a player for an action the referee did not see
during the game.
Fifa's disciplinary committee has imposed an eight-game suspension - twice
the previous longest - on Italy's Mauro Tassotti for viciously elbowing
Spaniard Luis Enrique during last Saturday's 2-1 win by Italy in the
quarter-finals. Enrique's nose was broken.
Tassotti misses today's semi-final against Bulgaria. If Italy reach Sunday's
final he will sit that out as well, plus six preliminary games in the
European championship.
Tassotti had apologised for the blow. He was not penalised on the field and
said later the elbowing was accidental. After studying videotapes, Fifa
rejected his claim.
The disciplinary committee judged Tassotti's action as 'intentional serious
violent conduct.' The suspension and Dollars 16,000 fine can be appealed.
Fifa said referee Sandor Puhl of Hungary was blameless in not penalising
Tassotti on the spot because he did not have a clear view of the elbowing,
which occurred during a scrap for the ball late in the game.
The committee also denied an appeal against a four-game suspension of
Brazilian defender Leonardo for an elbowing that fractured the skull of
American Tab Ramos.
And it:
Fined the Dutch team Dollars 8,000 and cautioned coach Dick Advocaat for bad
behaviour on the bench during Saturday's 3-2 quarter-final loss to Brazil;
Fined Brazilian goalie Taffarel Dollars 8,000 for violating advertising
restrictions by wearing oversized logos on his gloves;
Suspended Sweden's Stefan Schwarz for today's semi-final against Brazil for
collecting two yellow cards in the quarter-final win over Romania, and fined
the Swede Dollars 2,400.
German coach Berti Vogts, under intense bombardment in Germany for their
defeat by Bulgaria, was not on the flight taking most of the team home.
Wisely, he is holidaying in Florida.
The loss to Bulgaria cost the Germans bonuses of Dollars 80,000 apiece for
defending their title.
For reaching the quarter-finals, they received a mere Dollars 22,000 per
man.
Romania's players are to be made Citizens of Honour of Bucharest for their
World Cup performance, said mayor Crin Halaicu. The team bowed out after
Sweden beat them on penalties in the quarter-finals.
The only exception is Ion Vladiou, who became 'a national shame,' said
Bucharest, when suspended for earning the team's only red card for a nasty
foul. Each Romanian player was given a Mercedes by a local businessman for
qualifying for the finals.
World Cup semi-finalists Brazil topped the Sprint Soccer Poll for the ninth
week running, poll organisers said yesterday.
Italy, Bulgaria and Sweden, the other three semi-finalists, held the next
three spots in the weekly ranking of top 10 national teams as viewed by an
international panel of soccer journalists.
Brazil received 474 points, followed by Italy (386). Surprising Bulgaria
were third (349), then Sweden (313) - the first time Bulgaria and Sweden had
reached the top five.
Romania, who lost their quarter-final to Sweden in a penalty shoot-out, were
fifth (310) followed by Holland (260), Germany (229), Argentina (146),
Mexico (97) and Spain (51) in tenth spot.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK unlikely to drop toy challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is set to reject a request by Sir Leon Brittan, the
European trade commissioner, that it drop a legal challenge to an EU quota
on toy imports from China.
Sir Leon said in Brussels yesterday that he hoped the UK would withdraw its
action following a Commission proposal to raise the value of the quota by
Ecu150m (Pounds 115.5m) to Ecu780m this year.
However, the Department of Trade and Industry said in London that the case,
before the European Court of Justice, was a 'distinct and separate issue of
principle.'
The department said it was questioning the ability of the EU council of
ministers, which approved the quota in February, to take 'unjustified and
disproportionate trade measures' which were opposed by the majority of the
EU toy industry. The quota, imposed as part of a package deal designed to
win EU countries' agreement to scrap about 6,500 national trade
restrictions, is intended chiefly to protect toy manufacturers in Spain.
However, other European toy companies said that, at its original level of
Ecu630m, it would halve expected imports from China and was causing problems
for importers who had paid for goods which had not yet been delivered. The
quota has also been criticised by China.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Geneva faces Bonn rivalry on WTO site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As this week's deadline nears for a decision on the headquarters site for
the new World Trade Organisation, the two European candidates - Bonn and
Geneva - are stretching every sinew to capture the glittering prize.
Trade diplomats in Geneva, headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, say the German government has put up an unexpectedly tough fight
for the WTO, backing a financially attractive offer with intense diplomatic
lobbying of Gatt's 120-plus members in Geneva and in national capitals.
While Geneva remains the favourite, Bonn has come from a rank outsider to a
serious challenger. This has forced the Swiss to upgrade their own offer.
Both cities now stand ready to spend millions of dollars for the privilege
of hosting the WTO, its 500 or so staff and associated diplomatic missions,
and the revenues they will generate.
The deadline for a decision was initially set for this Friday. While there
are still hopes that this deadline can be met, a large number of countries
had not off-icially made up their minds by yesterday and the choice could be
postponed until a meeting of the WTO prep-aratory committee on July 22.
'My bet is that the consensus will be to stay in Geneva,' says a senior
developing country ambassador. 'But Bonn's offer has had to be taken
seriously.'
In terms of free office space, conference facilities, car parking and
diplomatic privileges, the two cities are running neck and neck, trade
officials say.
Bonn initially claimed an edge in having a ready-made conference centre for
WTO use - but a group of Gatt ambassadors who visited Bonn last week judged
the centre inadequate. Like the Swiss, the German government has now offered
to build a new centre.
However, the 'inertia factor' looks like tipping the balance in Geneva's
favour. The costs of moving, in human and organisational terms, would be
enormous and would prevent the hoped-for smooth transition from Gatt to the
WTO. 'We would lose six months' work,' predicts one senior trade diplomat.
Many of Gatt's present staff are settled in Geneva and do not wish to move.
Geneva is home to a number of UN organisations with which the WTO will have
to work closely. In addition, countries that currently cover Gatt alongside
the other UN bodies in Geneva would have to open separate WTO missions in
Bonn.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Bangkok elevated railway given the green
light
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Victor Mallet in Bangkok
The Thai cabinet yesterday gave the green light to a Dollars 1.5bn elevated
railway for Bangkok, reversing a cabinet directive in May that all mass
transit systems in the centre of the capital should be underground.
'It's a relief,' said Mr Edward Chow, chief financial officer of Bangkok
Transit System Corp (BTSC). 'It means that we can get on with our work.'
BTSC, part of the Tanayong property group, signed a 30-year concession
agreement two years ago to build and operate the 24km elevated railway, but
all Bangkok's mass transit projects have been thrown into doubt by
successive governments lack of a coherent transport strategy.
The cabinet apparently decided to adhere to the original BTSC contract
following an embarrassing dispute over another contract for a Dollars 1bn
elevated motorway, which was built by a consortium under the leadership of
Kumagai Gumi of Japan.
Thai state agencies were accused of breaching the contract and Kumagai Gumi
and international lenders were eventually bought out by Thai investors.
BTSC, which opened negotiations for the elevated railway with the
Anglo-French engineering group GEC-Alsthom, says it has now dropped
GEC-Alsthom and signed a letter of intent with another consortium comprising
Siemens of Germany and Italian-Thai, the Thai construction company. They
would carry out the Dollars 1bn turnkey contract to build the concrete
structure and provide the train system.
Mr Chow said BTSC hoped to sign a detailed turnkey contract before September
and start operating the railway by the end of 1997.
Stockbrokers believe Tanayong will find it difficult to secure financing for
the deal. BTSC says debt financing is the responsibility of the turnkey
contractors and maintains that it will not be a problem. 'All the financing
has in fact been successfully negotiated,' Mr Chow said.
He said Hermes, the German export credit agency, along with KFW and Deutsche
Bank would participate in the financing. The International Finance
Corporation, the private sector financing arm of the World Bank, was also
prepared to arrange up to Dollars 350m in loans, he said.
BTSC is wholly-owned by Tanayong, but the property company hopes to sell
equity to other partners and list BTSC on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.

businessmen are in South Africa this week to try to recoup lost ground in
what was once a leading trade partnership.
Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions
during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are
weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in
South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan.
Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and
French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive
to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for
sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle.
'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says
Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British
companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990.
On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained
unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about
R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in
Britain.
Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993
slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw
materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly
pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment.
The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in
export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest
commitment.
In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew
by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent,
although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about
30 per cent for the year.
In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to
six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the
contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside.
At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack
helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds
2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked
out.
Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African
defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the
week. 'We're cautiously optimistic that something will be achieved,' said a
British defence official.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Lucas invests in Chinese car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the UK automotive components and aerospace group, is
making its first investment in China's rapidly expanding motor industry via
a Dollars 33m (Pounds 21.7m) joint venture to manufacture disc brakes.
If the project proceeds as envisaged, output of 600,000 discs a year will be
reached in 1997.
The three-way venture is with Langfang Braking Air Compressor Factory of
Hebei province and Mando Machinery, part of South Korea's Halla group and a
long-standing partner of Lucas in ventures outside China. Lucas will have a
20 per cent stake, with its partners each holding 40 per cent.
The two-phase project involves an initial investment of Dollars 14m at
Langfang's existing site, on the outskirts of Beijing, to produce up to
280,000 brake discs a year starting at the end of 1995. In phase two, a new
facility will be built in the Langfang economic and technology zone.
The venture follows the signing of Lucas' first technology transfer
agreement with China, under which it is providing technology for braking
systems to a joint venture company, Hwa Heng, set up between Lucas's
licensee in Taiwan and the Wuhu Auto Parts factory in Anhui province. Lucas
has no stake in that venture.

FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Eco-labelling tops agenda for new group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eco-labelling and the use of trade measures for environmental ends are among
the negotiating priorities set yesterday by the newly formed committee on
trade and environment which will become part of the World Trade Organisation
next year.
The committee has decided to tackle first some of the easier and less
controversial items on its seven-point work programme, which was endorsed by
ministers from 120-plus countries when they met in Marrakesh in April to
sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. It is due to report back to the first
WTO ministerial meeting in 1996.
Starting in September, the committee will discuss the compatibility with
fair trade rules of environmental charges and taxes, such as carbon taxes,
and environmental requirements for products including standards, packaging,
labelling and recycling. The proliferation of eco-labelling schemes could
become an important barrier to trade, particularly for developing countries.
The committee also plans this year to consider whether fair trade rules need
amending to accommodate trade provisions of international environmental
agreements such as those banning trade in endangered species or in chemicals
that harm the ozone layer. And it will look at the effect of environmental
measures on market access, especially for goods exported by developing
countries.
More controversial areas, such as the 'internalisation' of environmental
costs in prices, will be left to later, a move that will disappoint
environmental groups. The subjects for early discussion are designed to
maximise consensus between rich and poor nations, and have mostly been well
worked over in a now-disbanded Gatt environment committee.

FT  13 JUL 94 / EU and US look eastward together

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and the European Union agreed in Berlin yesterday to set up a new
working group to co-ordinate their approaches towards the integration of the
countries of central and eastern Europe into western security and economic
institutions.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said it would 'give a
more practical and operational content to relations between the US and the
EU, without creating a new bureaucracy'.
President Bill Clinton said the group would 'put some meat on the bones of
our declarations. . . We believe our best partner for the 21st century as we
look for prosperity and peace is a Europe united', Mr Clinton added. Another
working group will address co-operation on organised crime, drug trafficking
and money laundering.
European officials said that lines of communication between the US and the
European Union had often proved inadequate.
In addition, a European official said, the US-EU dialogue had tended to be
more direct when the European presidency was held by one of the larger
member countries.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose country currently holds the Union presidency,
said the new procedures would be set up by the next US-EU summit, when
France would have taken over the presidency.
President Clinton enjoyed some statesmanlike moments during his visit to
Berlin yesterday. Standing in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate, where the
Berlin Wall once divided East from West, he shuffled into the shoes of
President John F Kennedy. 'Nichts wird uns aufhalten. Alles ist moglich.
Berlin ist frei,' Mr Clinton proclaimed. 'Nothing can stop us. Everything is
possible. Berlin is free.'
In a gesture that self-consciously echoed Mr Kennedy's last-minute addition
of the famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' phrase to his speech 31 years ago, Mr
Clinton wrote the words into the text by hand on his way to the Brandenburg
Gate.
Mr Clinton's sally into German - his sixth foreign language in a week-long
trip - achieved a higher level of grammar than his boyhood hero, whose
addition of 'ein' changed him from a Berliner to a jelly doughnut.
But it failed to pierce Berlin's relative indifference to his visit.
'Er ist kein Kennedy,' retorted an unimpressed Berlin taxi driver. 'He is no
Kennedy.'
While Mr Kennedy and, later, President Ronald Reagan brought a promise of
support in difficult times, the only concrete promise that Mr Clinton could
bring was more modest: the construction of a new American embassy in Berlin.
This was scarcely a surprise. In fact, a plaque on Pariserplatz, just to Mr
Clinton's right, already marks the spot where the embassy is to be built,
close to the remains of the pre-war British embassy.
Perhaps of more significance, Mr Clinton promised that US backing for
Germany would not end with the demolition of the Wall.
'America stands on your side, now and for ever,' replied Mr Clinton,
venturing once again into German.

lending by EU banks had risen to 45.2 per cent at the end of 1993 from 34.8
per cent in 1985. The BIS report covers lending by BIS-area banks -
comprising the Group of 10 industrial countries plus Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain - to non-BIS countries over the past

The French government yesterday gave the go-ahead to a consortium of
European energy companies to restart the controversial Superphenix
fast-breeder nuclear reactor for research purposes. The reactor, near Lyons,
in eastern France, was shut in July 1990 because of technical faults in its
fuel cooling systems. The plant will be used to study how to get rid of
plutonium and other radioactive waste from France's 56 nuclear reactors.
Environmental groups have opposed the restart of the reactor, but the French
government has said the reactor could be restarted at limited power after
safety work. Superphenix is operated by the Nersa consortium, which includes
Electricite de France, Enel of Italy and SBK of Germany.

<TEXT>
The European Commission is today expected to give its final verdict on
allegations that European carton-board makers are operating an illegal
cartel. The three-year-old case could result in some of the biggest fines
ever to be levied against a group of companies following a Commission
investigation into alleged price-fixing. In April 1991, the Commission
raided 15 companies across the EU after the British Printing Industries
Federation complained that manufacturers had co-ordinated price rises across
Europe. All the main EU producers were involved in the original inquiry
including subsidiaries and sales agents for non-EU companies in Sweden,
Austria and Canada. Today, after considering responses from the 15
companies, the commission is expected to conclude whether a
cartel-arrangement between the companies hindered competition.

A group of leading European stockbrokers, venture capitalists, investment
bankers and stock exchange representatives have formed a new association to
create a pan-European stock exchange for fast-growing companies. The new
group, the European Association, has obtained funding from the European
Commission for research into the likely number of potential listees on the
new exchange. Participants are seeking to model the new exchange along the
lines of Nasdaq, the US-based stock market, which has grown to be the
world's second-largest in turnover by listing shares of small, fast-growing
companies. The European Venture Capital Association is the prime sponsor for
the project. Nasdaq has already said it supports the venture, but the London
Stock Exchange has ruled out participation in a UK-based specialist exchange
for small company shares and has dismissed suggestions that a pan-European
exchange would be effective. Several other European exchanges have embraced
the concept.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Single telecoms regulator call
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, will call tonight
for a single EU telecommunications regulator in a move set to intensify the
debate on the future role of Brussels in a liberalised telecoms industry.
Acknowledging 'ideological' objections to an increase in EU regulatory
powers, Sir Iain claims that it is nonetheless 'difficult to see' how any
other regime could ensure fair telecoms competition across the EU. The call
comes at a critical stage in the EU telecoms liberalisation process. The
Corfu heads of government summit last month agreed to an acceleration in the
pace of telecommunications liberalisation, in particular by opening
infrastructure to competition, instead of services alone as previously
agreed. In his speech to the European Policy Forum, Sir Iain says: 'a level
playing field requires a pan-European regulatory regime, properly enforced
by a well-balanced, pan-European regulator.'

Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the new president of Belarus, yesterday promised to
'do everything possible' to conclude an economic union, including a single
currency, with Russia and said that 'there is no way out of our economic
crisis without Russia.' He is to talk to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, this morning by phone and will ask for an early meeting. Russia
and Belarus have already agreed to work out proposals for an economic union
by the end of this month - though the Belarus central bank has strongly
objected to the loss of economic sovereignty entailed in giving away the
right to print its own currency. Mr Lukashenko said he regretted the
collapse of the Soviet Union and said he was 'catagorically against' the
withdrawal of the 40,000 Russian troops from Belarus. He also favoured a
'state regulated economy. I am ready to meet businessmen tomorrow and to say
to them - help me out of our crisis. If they help me, I'll help them. If
instead they just think of ways to make a bigger profit, then they'll find
it hard.' He said he would fulfil his pre-election promise to stop
privatisation 'because the people feel its all just a trick and only for
criminals. But if there is a privatisation that can be done in the interests
of the people, then we would look at it.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / German forces cleared for UN actions: Allies welcome court
decision enabling Bonn to play full peacekeeping role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's constitutional court yesterday gave the green light for the
country's troops to take part in future United Nations operations outside
the Nato area.
The historic judgment by the country's highest legal authority removes the
constitutional ambiguity that prevented Germany from participating directly
in the Gulf War and in nearly all UN blue helmet operations.
The decision of the Karlsruhe-based court means that German forces will be
able to take part in both peacekeeping and peacemaking exercises of the UN,
provided the German parliament has given its prior approval.
It says the Bundeswehr can take part in international missions as part of
Germany's international alliances, including Nato and the Western European
Union, in carrying out decisions of the UN Security Council, or directly
under the authority of the UN itself.
The judgment was instantly welcomed by the German government, for which it
is a political victory, by its Nato allies and by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general. The move is seen as enabling Germany to play its full
part in international peace operations.
US president Bill Clinton, who is on a visit to Berlin, said the decision
was correct 'because of the leadership of Germany, because of the conduct of
Germany, because of the role Germany has played in the creation of Europe'.
Although the decision is on the face of it a setback for the opposition
Social Democratic party (SPD), which brought the legal challenge, its
leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, welcomed the outcome as an essential measure to
clarify a longstanding grey area in the German constitution.
He said it also denied the government the 'free hand' it had sought in
sending troops outside the Nato area, by insisting on separate parliamentary
approval for every operation.
In two important ways, however, the court has given future German
governments greater room for manoeuvre than the SPD had hoped. It makes no
distinction between peacekeeping and peacemaking operations, and it requires
a simple majority vote in the Bundestag rather than the two-thirds majority
necessary to override the constitution.
The decision was announced as part of a 142-page judgment by the court on
the participation of German military personnel in three UN-sanctioned
operations outside the Nato area - the aerial surveillance by Awacs aircraft
of the 'no-fly zone' in Bosnia; the involvement of a German frigate in
enforcing the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia in the Adriatic; and the
attempt to enforce peace in Somalia, from which Germany has now withdrawn.
In each case, the court concluded the exercise did not contravene the German
constitution, but it called for the two exercises in former Yugoslavia to be
sanctioned retrospectively by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the judgment as confirmation of the
government's policy of stepping up its involvement in UN missions, but
hastened to say it would not necessarily lead to a rash of decisions to send
German soldiers abroad. 'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he said at
a press conference with Mr Clinton. 'We are not going to create a mood of
'Germans to the front'.'
Although allies have rejoiced at the judgment, within Germany there remains
great political caution about the circumstances in which the country's
troops can and will be used to support United Nations missions around the
world. Secondly, there are considerable doubts about just how ready the
Bundeswehr - the German armed forces - is to mount such operations.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats, and a leading campaigner for 'out-of-area' operations to be
approved, was adamant that it would not have dramatic consequences. 'We have
no intention of dreaming up as many missions as possible for the Bundeswehr
to take part in,' he said.
In the near future, the Bundeswehr is scarcely well-prepared for
comprehensive out-of-area operations, although it can certainly provide very
useful logistical support, according to Dr Holger May, head of the Institute
for Strategic Analysis in Bonn.
'On the one hand, the Bundeswehr has the third largest airlift capacity in
the world,' he said.
'We are one of only three Nato allies (the others are the US and
Netherlands) who can provide missile defence with Patriot missiles.'
On the other hand, there are clear disadvantages from having always planned
German operations on the assumption of operating close to home. The German
air force, for example, urgently needs to increase its logistical range,
because it has never expected to operate away from domestic servicing and
repair facilities.
'It is certainly not true, as some people at the defence ministry are
saying, that we cannot organise a mission out of area before the year 2000,'
Dr May said. 'That is nonsense. But it makes the case clearer than ever that
we could never go it alone.'

FT  13 JUL 94 / Brussels softens lineon film, TV quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior European Commission official yesterday signalled that Brussels
intended to take a more lenient approach to regulating the European film and
television industry, forecasting that quotas designed to protect the sector
could become a thing of the past because of rapid technological change.
Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the cabinet of Commissioner Martin
Bangemann, told a Financial Times multi- media conference in London that the
development of video-on-demand, pay-per-view services made quotas an old
battle which would be less and less important.
There have been furious rows between the US film and television industries
over quotas which have been designed to protect the European production
industries.
'Entertainment is becoming more and more an economic good that we should pay
for individually without any harm to culture or languages,' said Mr Buscher,
who said that his personal approach on quotas was shared by Mr Bangemann.
At the moment, European Union legislation means that broadcasters have to
have a majority of European programme content where practicable.
Although Commission officials concede privately that quotas are difficult to
enforce, the official line - at least until now - has been that they are
necessary to protect European culture and to nurture the audiovisual
industry.
Mr Buscher's comments add to gradual indications that the Commission is
willing to consider changes to the broadcasting directive. However, they are
likely to anger countries such as France, which are strongly in favour of
quotas.
He added, though, that free movement for US programmes would have to be
balanced by measures to support the European film and television industries.
The Brussels approach to creating an 'information society' was to stimulate
practical applications using existing funds rather than seeking a single
solution, said Mr Buscher.
The Commission is expected to announce an action plan next week which is
designed to implement main the recommendations of the Bangemann report on
the information society.
These range from teleworking and distance learning to creation of networks
for universities and research centres and health care to a trans-European
public administration network.
'Research projects and experimental applications must now be taken out of
the laboratories into real life so they become social and economic realities
in order to create new markets and new job opportunities,' Mr Buscher said.

Completion of the parliamentary inquiry should in theory allow the new
management team at Credit Lyonnais to close a troubled chapter of the bank's
history. Instead, they have found themselves struggling with more skeletons
tumbling out of the closets.
When Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who succeeded Mr Jean-Yves Haberer as chairman
last autumn, announced last spring that Credit Lyonnais had made a net loss
of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 834m) in 1993 and required the state's support for a
FFr44.9bn rescue package, it looked as though he had brought all the bank's
problems out into the open.
Mr Peyrelevade recently warned that he has since discovered some new
problems. His submission to the parliamentary inquiry also confirms that he
considers the original FFr44.9bn package inadequate.
The French financial community is now anxiously waiting to hear how bad
those problems are and how much more money is required.
'It's a bit of a black hole,' says Mr Sasha Serafimovski, European banking
analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'We now know that the initial clear-out wasn't
sufficient. What we don't know is where it's going to end.'
He, like other observers, had initially expected Credit Lyonnais to break
even in 1994 before returning to profit next year. The group is now expected
to stay in the red this year, with a deficit of between FFr1bn and FFr4bn
depending on what level of provisions the government agrees to.
Mr Peyrelevade is now understood to be wrangling with the authorities over
the scale of those provisions and over the amount of money the bank needs.
Credit Lyonnais originally planned to stage a FFr4.9bn capital increase this
autumn open to all investors, as opposed to this spring's FFr4.9bn increase
which was restricted to the government and its state-controlled
shareholders, the Caisse des Depots and Thomson electronics group.
However, the deterioration in expectations of the bank's performance,
coupled with the weakness of the French equity market, could complicate such
an exercise. Meanwhile Credit Lyonnais may need to raise more than FFr4.9bn,
given the gravity of its financial difficulties.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Fewer out of work in Spain

<TEXT>
Unemployment in Spain fell by 2.3 per cent over the first six months of this
year, compared to a 6.8 per cent rise in the same period of 1993, said the
employment ministry. The number out of work shrank 1.2 per cent in June from
May, with the service sector showing the biggest fall  - 1.5 per cent or
18,039. Industrial unemployment fell 1.9 per cent; construction by 3 per
cent. The number of those obtaining jobs in the first six months was up by
17 per cent on the same period last year, and up by 1.5 per cent in June
from May.
Pan-German retail sales rose at an annual, nominal rate of 4 per cent in
May, according to provisional figures yesterday from the federal statistics
office in Wiesbaden. The real annual rate of increase after inflation was 3
per cent. The figures were better than expected after a sharp 10 per cent
(nominal) fall in April, providing evidence of a steady but unspectacular
recovery in the economy. But economists warned that the rise reflected the
fact that there was one extra shopping day in May this year.
Portugal's consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in June from May, but the
year-on-year rate dropped to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent, the national
statistics institute said.

Miners working on Germany's first proposed disposal site for long-term
nuclear waste yesterday appealed for police protection, after demonstrators
blocked access roads with makeshift huts, and dug tunnels to prevent the
delivery of the first containers of highly-radioactive waste. Up to 1,000
anti-nuclear protesters have blocked the roads around Gorleben, in lower
Saxony, where an interim storage facility has been built near the planned
long-term disposal site. Police have been instructed by the state
authorities, who oppose the disposal scheme, not to intervene, but the
federal government says interim storage can go ahead, pending proper
investigation of the mining site.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Single telecoms regulator call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, will call tonight
for a single EU telecommunications regulator in a move set to intensify the
debate on the future role of Brussels in a liberalised telecoms industry.
Acknowledging 'ideological' objections to an increase in EU regulatory
powers, Sir Iain claims that it is nonetheless 'difficult to see' how any
other regime could ensure fair telecoms competition across the EU. The call
comes at a critical stage in the EU telecoms liberalisation process. The
Corfu heads of government summit last month agreed to an acceleration in the
pace of telecommunications liberalisation, in particular by opening
infrastructure to competition, instead of services alone as previously
agreed. In his speech to the European Policy Forum, Sir Iain says: 'a level
playing field requires a pan-European regulatory regime, properly enforced
by a well-balanced, pan-European regulator.' Sir Iain's remarks reflect BT's
ambitions to compete with established national operators - still mostly
monopolies - on the mainland. A year ago it forged a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds
3.39bn) alliance with MCI of the US to offer one-stop services to
multinationals, the first challenge to existing European operators in their
own markets.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Germans step warily into the front line: No dramatic action
expected despite constitutional court ruling on military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton was asked in Berlin yesterday about the prospect
of German soldiers taking part in military exercises outside the Nato area,
he could scarcely contain his glee.
'I am completely comfortable with this decision,' he declared, commenting on
the judgment of the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe. He could
certainly imagine German troops taking part in the Gulf War.
Why? 'Because of the leadership of Germany, because of the conduct of
Germany, because of the role Germany has played in the creation of Europe,'
he said. Germany did not merely have the largest population in Europe, it
had been 'the leader in pushing for the integration of Europe', he added.
His sheer enthusiasm left his host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, visibly
discomfited. It even caused him to produce a rare phrase in English.
'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he hastened to say. 'You must not
think this will create a mood of 'Germans to the front'.'
The irony of the decision is that it has been greeted with far more caution
within Germany - at both ends of the political spectrum - than among her
allies.
In the first place, there remains great political caution about the
circumstances in which German troops can and will be used in future to
support United Nations missions around the world. Secondly, there are
considerable doubts about just how ready the Bundeswehr - the German armed
forces - is to mount such operations.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats, and a leading campaigner for 'out-of-area' operations to be
approved, was delighted yesterday at the political victory for the German
government. He was also adamant that it would not have dramatic
consequences.
'We have no intention of dreaming up as many missions as possible for the
Bundeswehr to take part in,' he said. 'All our friends and partners in the
world can be sure that Germany will deal with this question very carefully -
for the next century, at least,' he added with a wry smile.
Asked if Germany might have participated in the Gulf war, if the
constitutional court ruling had been given then, he said it might have been
legally possible, but not necessarily politically feasible.
'That was only one month after unification,' he said. 'It would have been
too soon.' He argues that the importance of the move is that Germany can now
behave like a normal ally within the Nato alliance, and increasingly, within
the context of the European Union's common foreign and security policy. 'We
are ready to take up our responsibilities as well as our rights,' he said.
Although the court decision is on the face of it a setback for the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping,
was almost equally enthusiastic - because it has clarified the legal 'grey
area' in the constitution.
'The legal framework is now clear within which the politicians have to act,'
he said. That would reassure German soldiers, and give clear guidelines for
the debate on Germany's future foreign and security policy.
It also denied the government the 'free hand' it had sought in sending
troops outside the Nato area, by insisting on separate parliamentary
approval for every operation, he said.
In the near future, the Bundeswehr is scarcely well-prepared for
comprehensive out-of-area operations, although it can certainly provide very
useful logistical support, according to Dr Holger May, head of the Institute
for Strategic Analysis in Bonn.
'On the one hand, the Bundeswehr has the third largest air-lift capacity in
the world,' he said.
'We are one of only three Nato allies (the others are the US and
Netherlands) who can provide missile defence with Patriot missiles.'
On the other hand, there are clear disadvantages from having always planned
German operations on the assumption of operating close to home. The German
air force, for example, urgently needs to increase its logistical range,
because it has never expected to operate away from domestic servicing and
repair facilities.
In the early 1970s, the Bundeswehr scrapped its military field bakery, and
its capacity to provide drinking water for troops in the field: both would
have to be recreated. And the military medical corps would have to be
considerably expanded if one international exercise were not to deprive the
rest of the Bundeswehr of virtually all its doctors.
'It is certainly not true, as some people at the defence ministry are
saying, that we cannot organise a mission out of area before the year 2000,'
Dr May said. 'That is nonsense. But it makes the case clearer than ever that
we could never go it alone.
'We are going to have to make up our minds where our priorities lie. We will
have to make it clear to ourselves, and to our public opinion, that it is in
Germany's interest to get involved in something.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British police found more than two tonnes of explosives hidden on a lorry
which arrived at the northern English port of Heysham from Northern Ireland.
Police said the explosives, found during a routine check, were believed to
have been destined for a mainland bombing campaign. The discovery raised
fears of a new wave of violence by the Irish Republican Army as it considers
last December's Downing Street Declaration. It coincided with the annual
Orange Day march by Northern Ireland's Protestants and a missile attack in
Belfast on a British Army helicopter, which was forced to make an emergency
landing. Orangemen picture, Page 8

FT  13 JUL 94 / BR aims for 3,000 strike-breaking trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack will today make its most concerted effort yet to break the
signalling strike, with 3,000 trains running - about 50 per cent more than
during the last one-day strike a week ago.
The strike will be the fifth consecutive Wednesday stoppage in an
increasingly bitter dispute. RMT, the transport union, meets tomorrow to
consider stepping up action after talks called to settle the dispute failed
early on Tuesday.
Railtrack is confident it can position its small number of working signalmen
where they will have the greatest impact. It believes that in some areas it
will in effect break the strike. The company, responsible for track, signals
and stations, has tried to press every supervisor and manager into operating
signal boxes. That may enable British Rail to run a fifth of its normal
weekday services.
Trains expected to run today which did not run last Wednesday include the
InterCity express services between Euston and Birmingham International and
suburban services from Woking and Hampton Court to Waterloo.
Other strike-breaking services will include commuter trains on north
Merseyside, between Liverpool and Southport; between Bristol and Salisbury;
and in north Wales from Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog.
A Railtrack executive said: 'The strike is pretty well broken in some parts
of the country, though it is rock solid in others.'
BR believes there is little scope for further services if the stoppage
continues.
RMT blamed government interference for the collapse of negotiations. Mr
Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, suggested that Railtrack, wholly
owned by the government, was still not free to negotiate with the RMT on
past productivity.
Mr Knapp said: 'The real difference between the two sides is not great. But
the government has to take the arm-lock off Railtrack's negotiators and let
them conclude a deal which they think is in the best interests of the
industry - not the political interests of the government.
'This dispute is only complex and intractable because the government has
made it so,' he added.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, confirmed yesterday to the House
of Commons employment committee that he had made clear to Railtrack that it
must negotiate with the signalling staff inside the guidelines of the
government's public sector pay freeze policy.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Dollar hits new lows as hopes of Fed rates move fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pessimism about the prospects of the Federal Reserve lifting US interest
rates yesterday drove the dollar to fresh lows in Europe.
A benign set of US inflation data reduced pressure on the Fed to raise
interest rates, while US and European leaders continued to stress that the
level of the dollar was best left to the market to determine.
The dollar steadied during US trading after the White House released figures
revising down the budget deficit for fiscal 1994.
Earlier, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had told reporters
that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries was right not to
overreact to the dollar's decline.
'The economic fundamentals are in order in the US. The agreement by the
finance ministers was the correct way. The US has inflation under control
and good growth. These are convincing signs for a stable dollar,' said Mr
Waigel after a meeting with President Bill Clinton.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5235 from DM1.54. Against the yen it
finished at Y96.80 from Y97.36 on Monday. In New York it closed at DM1.528
and Y97.325 and early today in Tokyo it opened at Y97.44.
Dollar weakness spilled over into sterling, which closed at its lowest level
against the D-Mark since soon after the UK currency left the European
exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. The UK currency closed in London
at DM2.3958 from DM2.4081 on Monday. These losses were partially offset by
gains against the dollar.
One side-effect of the dollar's fall was the continued recovery yesterday of
European government bonds, as more investors shifted out of US bonds into
Europe to escape currency weakness.
One of the strongest performers was Italy, where 10-year bonds rose by about
1 1/2 points. UK gilts also rose sharply before easing in late trading. The
dollar weakened after comments from Mr Ron Brown, the US trade secretary.
Speaking after congressional testimony in Washington, he said the US would
continue to use 'aggressive, pro-active' methods to open Japan to foreign
goods.
Mr Brown added that he saw no inflation pressures which would warrant higher
interest rates: 'If inflation is not a problem, then I think you would have
to make a reasonable argument that changes in interest rates are not
appropriate.'
Mr Brown said interest rate policy was the province of the Federal Reserve.
He received support for his views from the re-lease of the June producer
price index data. The PPI, excluding volatile food and energy components,
fell by 0.1 per cent in June - well below market expectations. A further
fillip for the US economy came with a downward revision of the deficit for
fiscal 1994 ending September 30.
Mr Leon Panetta, White House budget director, said the deficit would be
Dollars 220.1bn compared with February estimates of Dollars 234.8m. He said
the figures showed the Clinton economic programme to be a 'remarkable
success', reducing the deficit for two years in a row for the first time in
two decades.

FT  13 JUL 94 / US telecoms group launches bid worth Dollars 2.2bn for QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comcast, the US telecoms group, last night launched a Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds
1.4bn) bid for QVC, the US television shopping group which last week agreed
to a similarly valued merger with CBS, the broadcast television network.
The Comcast bid, made in a letter to QVC chairman Mr Barry Diller, involves
an offer of Dollars 37 a share cash and Dollars 7 a share in Comcast
convertible preferred stock for all of QVC's outstanding shares. Under the
terms of the bid, Comcast is willing to pay a 22.2 per cent premium on the
current value of QVC shares, which closed last night at Dollars 36.
Comcast's offer came after the close of trading in New York.
Comcast, which is a founding shareholder in QVC, said it was making a rival
bid because it believed the proposed merger between QVC and CBS was not in
the best interests of Comcast shareholders. Comcast currently owns 15.4 per
cent of QVC on a fully diluted basis.
The funding for Comcast's offer will come from the Bank of New York, which
has told the company it can obtain commitments for a Dollars 1bn senior
credit facility, and from other sources to be arranged.
QVC officials were not available for comment last night, but it is likely
that Mr Diller will initially reject the Comcast offer.
Although the value of Comcast's bid is essentially the same as that of the
QVC-CBS deal, Comcast said last night the difference between the two
transactions was that it would not require QVC to pay any break-up fees if
the Comcast merger failed.
In the letter to Mr Diller, Comcast said QVC's board, which was scheduled to
meet today to discuss the CBS merger, should lay both bids on the table, and
submit the competing offers for consideration by a committee of independent
directors.
The rival offer from Comcast is unlikely to come as as surprise to Wall
Street. When CBS and QVC announced their merger plans last week, analysts
said that the proposed deal had in effect put both companies in play,
although industry experts had expected any new bids to have been made for
CBS, not QVC.
The battle over the CBS-QVC merger comes against a background of major
consolidation in the US cable and broadcast television industry, which is
becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Landmark ruling on SIB to buttress all regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
cannot be sued for damages for disclosing restricted information obtained
from private individuals, a High Court judge ruled yesterday in a sweeping
judgment which will affect regulators all over Britain.
The UK courts have never been asked to rule on a point of law about the
remedies available to those who feel aggrieved by the way regulators carry
out their duties.
Mr David Mayhew, solicitor for Clifford Chance, the SIB's counsel, said the
ruling will also buttress the Bank of England, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, among others.
Afterwards, SIB officials expressed considerable satisfaction at the result.
One said: 'This was about the propriety of the exercise of our powers. We
have very strong powers to do things and this case was a test of whether we
use them properly.'
Mr Justice Lightman threw out the action seeking Pounds 7m in damages from
the SIB in a case brought by Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate accused of
breaching pension fund investment rules.
The plaintiffs had argued that the SIB had disclosed 'restricted
information' in violation of section 179 of the Financial Services Act to
the pension scheme beneficiaries who are asking the company to restore a
similar amount to the scheme.
Had the scheme beneficiaries not obtained the information, they would not
have pursued their case against Melton Medes for restitution to the scheme,
they argued.
In his ruling, Mr Lightman said the law clearly stated that individuals had
no private right of action if they felt aggrieved. The intent of section 179
was to protect the special interests of informants and 'to control in the
public interest the use of information acquired rather than to subject SIB
in this respect to private law actions'.
The only remedy open to Melton Medes is to seek a criminal prosecution of
the SIB or a judicial review of its conduct.
The judge denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to appeal his ruling and
awarded indemnity costs to the SIB.
Mr Lightman, in his ruling, also said Melton Medes had failed to prove its
allegation that the SIB had disclosed restricted information. It had alerted
pension scheme beneficiaries to the existence of information which could aid
their case that existed elsewhere, but this did not constitute restricted
information.
He said that, if the SIB were unable to disclose non-restricted information,
it could not carry out the purpose for which it had been created.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Rosyth naval base wins reprieve as MoD saves Pounds 1.2bn:
Cuts in R&amp;D secure majority of 1,300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rosyth naval base in Fife has been saved and the majority of its 1,300
civilian workers will keep their jobs, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, will announce tomorrow.
Mr Rifkind will disclose that he has met the Treasury's demands for
substantial expenditure cuts by finding savings in other areas of the
defence budget, particularly research and development.
The number of redundancies at Rosyth is yet to be finalised. But MPs have
been told that most of the civilian personnel will keep their jobs, and the
number of redundances could be as low as 300.
The base has been saved in large part because the Ministry of Defence has
found it is spending about Pounds 500m more on research and development than
it had originally thought. Defence chiefs are thought to have blamed
accounting errors for the over-estimate of R&amp;D spending, which government
accountants had initially put at Pounds 800m a year. Much of the extra
Pounds 500m of spending has been judged to be unnecessary.
Mr Rifkind will also announce substantial savings have been reaped through
changes in the procurement of spare parts and ammunition. Instead of
stockpiling weapons and ammunition the armed forces will purchase more on a
'just-in-time' basis as they are required.
Taken together the savings over the next three years will help the MoD to
cut its Pounds 23.49bn a year budget by at least Pounds 1.2bn, the figure
set by the Treasury in the last budget.
There had been strong expectations that the expenditure cuts would lead to
job losses in the armed forces of between 20,000 and 25,000 - but MPs have
been told this week that the redundancies will be 'at the low end of
expectations'.
According to Downing Street, the MoD's plans for defence expenditure - set
out in a defence spending white paper dubbed 'Front Line First' - are
certain to be approved by the cabinet at its weekly meeting tomorrow.
However, MPs have been told that the white paper's plans will not be set in
concrete and will leave open the opportunity for further refinement over the
next three months.
The proposal that Rosyth should be saved follows intense last-minute
lobbying by Scottish Tory MPs, the Labour leadership and workers at the
yard.
However, Mr Rifkind is expected to announce that Rosyth will have a
different role from the one it has had in the past. According to one MoD
source, the base will concentrate on its role in minesweeping support and
fisheries protection. The base will also remain available for military
emergencies.
On Monday, Mr Rifkind appeared to give slight hope to Rosyth when he
attacked Labour's 'hysterical outpourings' about the future of the Fife
base. He said the decision on Rosyth would be made 'in a sensitive,
thoughtful fashion'.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, has kept up a campaign to
maintain the base, which is in his constituency.
Earlier this week, he revealed that he had received a confidential Royal
Navy study which described Rosyth as 'ideal' with 'excellent facilities' and
'the only area that can fully meet the the requirements and demands' of
minesweepers.

FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Prudential Securities adds
Dollars 305m to reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Securities, the Wall Street securities firm, yesterday announced
the addition of Dollars 305m to reserves, set aside to settle lawsuits
brought by thousands of customers who claim they were defrauded when the
firm sold them high-risk limited partnerships in the 1980s.
The addition means Prudential Securities will take a loss of Dollars 215m in
the second quarter. The firm's parent, Prudential Insurance, has agreed to
add Dollars 180m to Prudential Securities' capital.
Even without the cost of adding to its reserves, the firm said it would have
reported a loss of Dollars 35m in the quarter, because of the slump in US
stock and bond markets and the slowdown in the domestic brokerage business.
In the same quarter a year ago, it made a profit of Dollars 35m.
Prudential Securities said it was almost doubling the size of its reserve
fund, to Dollars 635m, because its settlements with customers were proving
larger than anticipated, due primarily to unexpectedly high interest
payments.
The securities house has been making reparations to customers since last
October. Then, it agreed to pay Dollars 371m in fines and restitutions to
settle state charges that it defrauded thousands of investors by persuading
them to buy more than Dollars 8bn of limited partnerships in the 1980s. Many
of those high-risk limited partnerships subsequently soured, and investors
claimed that they were never told the investments were highly-speculative.
Its underestimation of the cost of the legal settlements, and the need for a
capital injection from its parent, is a blow for Prudential Securities. When
the firm agreed to the multi-million dollar settlement last year, its chief
executive, Mr Hardwick Simmons, said he hoped the deal represented 'one last
punch'.
Since then, however, the firm has continued to take a beating because of the
long-running limited partnerships scandal. It has lost numerous brokers to
rival securities firms and its number two executive resigned in May.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Credit Lyonnais probe pours scorn on state's effectiveness
as 'close to nil': David Buchan on the message of the parliamentary inquiry
into troubled French bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's parliamentary inquiry, published yesterday, into how the country's
largest bank, the state-owned Credit Lyonnais, came to pile up record losses
and bad debts is most striking for its indictment of the ineffectiveness,
even pointlessness, of state ownership.
The report says Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, president of Credit Lyonnais from 1988
until his dismissal last November 'carries the chief responsibility' for the
bank's disastrous lending spree cul-minating in a FFr6.9bn (Pounds 810m)
loss last year. But it also criticises the state and the regulatory
authorities - including Mr Jean-Claude Trichet who directed the Treasury
before becoming governor of the Bank of France last year with a seat on the
Banking Commission - for their laxness as well as the bank's outside
directors.
The report does not propose any new sanctions or radical reform. In its
nine-week inquiry, the parliamentary committee says it came across 'no case
of corruption uncovered or approved by Credit Lyonnais'. However, it added
that Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new president, promised it that he
would prosecute any 'rare collaborators who might have been indelicate or
frankly dishonest' if and when solid evidence came to light. As to reform,
the report just urges the state and the Banking Commission to exercise more
control in the future.
From a political point of view, it is likely to undermine any remaining case
for state ownership, except among the Socialist and Communist parties whose
minority representatives on the inquiry dissented from the report.
Credit Lyonnais is already on the government's list of companies for
privatisation, which the assembly's finance committee chairman said
yesterday was 'the best road' for the bank. Even, Mr Philippe Seguin, the
assembly's president who chaired the inquiry, says in his introduction to
the report that the state's effectiveness as Credit Lyonnais' shareholder
was 'close to nil'; as a staunch Gaullist, Mr Seguin cannot be said to be
predisposed against government interference in the economy.
The report itself is tougher than the Seguin introduction. It was largely
written by Mr Francois d'Aubert, a UDF deputy and relative free-marketeer
who was sued for libel by Credit Lyonnais for a book he wrote about the bank
called Argent Sale (Dirty Money) and who said yesterday the inquiry turned
up nothing to lead him to retract his allegations.
The report acknowledges that Credit Lyonnais had already acquired some
doubtful clients, such as the late Mr Robert Maxwell and Mr Bernard Tapie,
before 1988. But it says the real surge in its expansion began with Mr
Haberer's desire to turn the bank into a German-style 'industrial' bank, his
gamble on rising property prices and his bid to use European deregulation to
give Credit Lyonnais a continental network, often paying too much for
inadequately audited acquisitions. By last year Credit Lyonnais had taken
equity in 1,500 companies at home and controlling or minority stakes in 107
banks and companies abroad.
The report singles out two categories of investment. Like many other banks,
Credit Lyonnais lent far too much in property, amassing some FFr50bn of
doubtful loans, of which FFr42bn have been hived off into a separate
state-backed company to improve the bank's solvency ratio. The report claims
the finance ministry and the Bank of France, via the Banking Commission, not
only allowed but actively encouraged the bank to limit its provisions
against bad property debts.
The second category - the degree to which the bank was ordered to help prop
up loss-making state industries - is disputed. Mr Seguin, who parliamentary
officials say consistently tried to 'smooth the report's rough edges', says,
for instance, that there is no evidence to show that Credit Lyonnais'
decision to take a stake in the Usinor-Sacilor steel company or in
Aerospatiale 'owed more to the wish of the public authorities than a
deliberate choice of the bank'.
But the report claims 'increasing bankruptcies led the state, in order to
save jobs, to interfere with the bank's autonomy', just as, it adds, prime
minister Edouard Balladur did last autumn in forbidding state companies to
lay off workers. Whatever the motive, the result was to enable Credit
Lyonnais to count dud shareholdings as 'own funds' on which still more loans
could be extended.
Much of the bank's problems lay with four out-of-control financial
subsidiaries - Althus, SDBO (Mr Tapie's main bank), IBSA, and CLBN, its
Dutch subsidiary which financed the bid by two Italians, Mr Giancarlo
Paretti and Mr Florio Fiorini, for the MGM film studio. The report
highlights the problem of cross-border banking supervision - an issue,
incidentally, largely ignored in the Maastricht negotiations for European
monetary union - of a 95 per cent French-owned bank incorporated in the
Netherlands. Warnings by the Dutch central bank about possible money
laundering by CLBN clients went ignored by Mr Haberer, the report says.
Of Credit Lyonnais' directors, the report finds most fault with its former
six 'independent directors' who when they bothered to turn up to board
meetings relied on the state's six representatives to do their job for them.
It praises the six directors representing the bank's own personnel for
asking the most pointed questions of the Haberer management, but says
inevitably these often concerned internal housekeeping rather than strategy.
There was a clean sweep of the bank's independent directors last month. The
new team includes Mr Bernard Arnault of LVMH, Mr Alain Gomez of the
state-owned Thomson group (which has 21 per cent of Credit Lyonnais), Mr
Jean-Luc Lagardere and Mr Francois Pinault, heads of groups bearing their
name. In response to press criticism that these men are all substantial
customers of his bank, Mr Peyrelevade said: 'Better they are Credit
Lyonnais' clients than some other bank's'.

Mr Roy Shipes, a US-based consultant, has flown to Papua New Guinea's Lihir
Island to begin a two-week review of a planned goldmine project there, at
the request of the country's mining and pet-roleum minister Mr John Kaputin,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Development of the mine, which would be one of the largest outside South
Africa, has been held up for months by wrangling within the PNG government
over how the project should be structured and financed.
Originally, there were hopes that the necessary special mining lease for the
project - a joint venture between RTZ of the UK and Niugini Mining, which is
controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain - would be granted at the beginning
of 1994.
However, the matter became bogged down in the PNG cabinet, with the dispute
apparently centring on whether the state-owned Malaysia Mining Corporation
should be brought in at an early stage, and what share of the equity should
be given to local landowners.

Third-quarter revenues were up 24 per cent at CDollars 305m (USDollars
219.4m).
Net profit more than doubled to CDollars 5.9m, or 9 cents a share, from
CDollars 2.3m, or 5 cents, a year earlier.
The result brings net profit for nine months to CDollars 16m, or 27 cents a
share, up from CDollars 3.9m, or 9 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of
CDollars 864m, up 26 per cent.
Mr John Oltman, SHL chairman, said that the company was focusing on
improving operating margins further in the short term, while continuing to
develop markets in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Mattel lifts bid to win battle for JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mattel yesterday snatched victory from rival US toy group Hasbro in the
battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns the rights to the
Scrabble board game outside North America.
Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, raised its offer for shares in Spear from
Pounds 10 to Pounds 11.50, valuing the company at Pounds 62m. Last Friday,
Hasbro increased its offer from Pounds 9 to Pounds 11.
Spear's directors and family trustees have irrevocably pledged 2,695,000
shares, or 51.2 per cent of the company, to Mattel. Last night, Mr Francis
Spear, chairman said: 'We at Spear are happy with the revised offer. We
believe it reflects a fair and reasonable value for the company.'
Mattel entered the battle for Spear as a white knight after Hasbro launched
a surprise bid in late May. It wanted a more secure foothold in the market
for board games.
Hasbro already owns the North American rights for Scrabble, as well as a
26.7 per cent stake in Spear. The company said last night that it was
considering its position and would be making a statement today. However, it
said it considered Pounds 11 a 'a very full offer'. It appears likely that
Hasbro will now sell its stake.
Hasbro's original offer was made after it received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
Mattel launched its counter attack at five minutes to midnight on the last
day. Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming Mattel's offer had not been
properly announced. But the judge released the trustees from any obligation
to sell their shares.
The Spear board, which was split by the original offer, was not recommending
either bidder. Hasbro raised the stakes last Friday after Spear allowed it
to take a closer look at the company and its forecasts.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents an exit multiple of 21.1 times the company's earnings last
year.
Richard Tomkins in New York adds: Mr John Amerman, Mattel chairman and chief
executive, said he was 'delighted' at the victory. 'This is an excellent
outcome not only for the shareholders but also for Spear's employees and
customers,' he said.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Optimism meets caution at rail talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intensive negotiations to try to resolve the intractable railway signal
workers' dispute continued in the early hours of this morning at the
conciliation service Acas in an attempt to avert a fifth one-day strike
planned for tomorrow.
At the resumption of the talks, which were broken off 10 days ago,
Railtrack's chief negotiator Mr David Armstrong was optimistic over
prospects for a settlement. In recent days the government-owned company has
refined its productivity package for the signal workers in response to their
particular grievances.
But Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT transport union's chief negotiator, was much
more cautious when he arrived for talks yesterday afternoon, insisting that
the union had not yet entered serious negotiations with Railtrack.
The union continues to insist that signal workers must receive an interim
pay award for past productivity achievements before talks can begin on the
restructuring of wages and work practices.
Railtrack has proposed a three-part package involving an immediate 6 per
cent unconsolidated rise in basic pay rates, a Pounds 200 lump sum for every
worker, and a restructuring to be negotiated by the end of September with
pay rises for the entire deal of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent.
A further one-day strike has been called for a week tomorrow, and the RMT
has threatened two days of action in the week beginning July 24.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Call for action over Haiti observers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>

   KINGSTON, NEW YORK AND AGENCIES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of countries led by the US last night called for 'quick and decisive
action' following the latest act of defiance by Haiti's military-backed
government.
Haiti has given a team of more than 100 human rights observers, representing
the United Nations and the Organisation of American States, 48 hours to
leave the country, claiming they are a threat to national security.
After a flurry of diplomatic activity at the UN, US ambassador Madeleine
Albright said the regime's move 'intensifies the resolve of the
international community to find a definitive solution to this crisis'. She
was speaking on behalf of the 'friends of Haiti' - the US, France,
Venezuela, Canada and Argentina - which have been working to restore
democracy in Haiti following the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
Asked if quick and decisive action meant an invasion, she said the White
House had 'a full range of options'. She added: 'What we need to do here is
to get an international presence into Haiti.'
Mr Dante Caputo, the UN's envoy to Haiti, said that neither Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, nor the head of the OAS had yet
determined how to handle the situation. But the UN was not going to be
pushed around.
A UN official said there were 40 UN staff and 64 representatives of the OAS,
all in Port au Prince. They had concentrated in the capital after
withdrawing from other locations in the country. The regime had an
obligation to guarantee their protection but was not doing so, the official
said.
The ultimatum to remove the mission was delivered without warning and the UN
knew of no instance that might have provoked it.
Haiti is under an international economic embargo, but the military has
refused to leave office. The expulsion order stated that the observer
mission should leave the country 'in order to avoid an incident or
provocation'. The government ordered the mission to stop its work a week
ago, but the UN General Assembly subsequently renewed the mission's mandate
on Friday.
Mr Caputo said yesterday that the expulsion was an outrageous provocation.
'The reasons are quite obvious. They kill people. They torture people. They
rape people. And they don't want any witnesses in their country.'
The government of the Caribbean island of Grenada has denied that it has
reached an agreement with the US to provide a 'safe haven' to Haitians
fleeing their country. The government said it had received the US request,
but had not yet agreed to it. The US government said last week that Grenada,
Dominica and Antigua had agreed to grant temporary asylum to Haitians until
the crisis has been resolved.

FT  12 JUL 94 / RAI board named after coalition row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heads of Italy's two houses of parliament last night named a new
five-member board of directors for Italy's state broadcasting organisation,
the RAI, following a row over the appointments between the coalition
partners in the right-wing government.
The announcement was made by Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, the Senate speaker, and
Ms Irene Pivetti, his counterpart in the lower house, the Chamber of
Deputies. Ms Pivetti, a member of the populist Northern League - one of the
coalition members - was instrumental in blocking the first board list
presented.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, through last night's announcement, appears
to have acted quickly to limit the damage from a dispute that had threatened
his own authority. He had not wished to be seen making too many concessions
to the individual interests of the coalition partners and, at Naples at the
weekend, where he attended the Group of Seven summit, he refused the call
for a special coalition meeting to discuss the RAI board.
The new board members have apparently been chosen for their management flair
and are representative of both the League and Forza Italia, another
coalition member and the party of Mr Berlusconi.
The five include Mr Ennio Presutti, head of the Assolombarda industrialists'
association in Lombardy, academic Mr Franco Cardini, and Mr Mauro Miccio,
head of Asca news agency. The list is completed by businessman Mr Alfio
Marchini and Ms Letizia Brichetti Moratti, head of the insurance brokers'
association.
The dispute had centred on moves by Forza Italia, the League and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the third coalition partner, to ensure
they all had their own nominees represented on the board of what continues
to be Italy's most influential media network. This is a classic example of
the fights to carve up influence in a state body which so discredited
successive post-war governments and which Mr Berlusconi himself has sought
to avoid.
The one-year-old RAI board was forced to step down on June 30 following the
government's threat to refuse to accept its financial reorganisation plan
and emergency funding. The members, though installed as technicians, were
considered too close to the previous governing parties. But the government
had previously been critical of the RAI's bias against Mr Berlusconi.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Motorola surges 64% but warns of
growth slowdown
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, yesterday reported a
64 per cent surge in net profits from Dollars 224m to Dollars 367m for the
second quarter, but said higher interest rates could slow the pace of growth
in the US market.
In April Motorola's shares lost about 10 per cent of their value when Wall
Street took fright at earnings growth that fell short of its expectations.
Analysts had ratcheted up their forecasts after being surprised by
higher-than-expected earnings in earlier quarters.
Yesterday's figures came after the market closed. Earlier, Motorola's shares
had slipped by Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 .
Turnover in the second quarter rose from Dollars 3.94bn to Dollars 5.44bn.
Net margin on sales was 6.7 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent a year
earlier and 6.6 per cent in the first quarter. Fully diluted earnings per
share, restated for a two-for-one share split in April, rose from 40 cents a
year earlier to 63 cents. Half-year earnings rose from Dollars 428m to
Dollars 665m.
In the general systems sector, sales rose by 75 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn
and orders rose 46 per cent. Semiconductor sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars
1.7bn and orders were up 17 per cent, Motorola said. Communications sales
rose 26 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn and orders rose 28 per cent.
Mr Gary Tooker, vice-chairman and chief executive, said US markets had been
doing very well, although interest rates could moderate the rate of growth.
European and Japanese markets were strengthening, and the company was
experiencing high rates of growth in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America
and emerging markets.

Two competing electronics industry partnerships, both aimed at the emerging
market for equipment used to provide interactive multimedia services, were
announced yesterday.
Sun Microsystems, the US computer company, has paired with Thomson Consumer
Electronics of France, while Digital Equipment, one of the largest US
computer manufacturers, will collaborate with General Instrument, a leading
US manufacturer of television set-top decoder boxes for the cable-TV
industry.
Sun and TCE said they would form a jointly-funded business unit that would
develop and market 'end-to-end solutions' for interactive television, home
shopping, distance learning and other on-line business and personal
services.
Products will range from video servers to digital set-top devices. Sun will
contribute networking technologies and system management software. TCE will
draw upon its consumer products, compression and decoder technologies.
The Sun-TCE venture will compete directly with the marketing alliance
announced by Digital Equipment and General Instrument, which is similarly
aimed at providing 'end-to-end interactive video system solutions'.
The jointly marketed systems will include Digital's video interactive
information technology and GI's encryption and decoder technologies.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (14): Strategic vision needs to be restored
 -David Buchan notes some handicaps to innovation and efficiency in an
impressive R &amp; D establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French like to think of themselves as thoroughly modern.
They have an impressive array of technical and scientific achievements to
their credit - among these, the French-inspired Airbus and Ariane rocket
projects, one of the world's biggest military and civil nuclear programmes,
the high-speed TGV (train a grand vitesse), and Nobel physics prizes for
1991 and 1992.
But can they keep it up? Mr Francois Fillon, the research minister, has
voiced doubts in public. He not only complained of rigidities in France's R
&amp; D (research and development) establishment which stifle innovation,
efficiency and mobility, public laboratories out of touch with industry,
insufficient research by the private sector itself, but also declared that
'the state no longer has a strategic vision' about the future of research.
This was quite an admission in a country where invention and innovation have
been state-led since the 17th century. It could be dismissed as
over-dramatisation from a young new minister, seeking to exaggerate a
problem to make a name for himself - were it not for two sets of facts.
One is the quantity of effort and money that the French government puts into
R &amp; D. France rates consistently second among the big industrialised
countries: second only to the US in terms of total public funding of all
kinds of research (as a share of gross domestic product); second again to
the US in public funding of defence research; and second only to Germany in
public funding of civil research.
But the output, at least in industrial terms, is still disappointing. Of all
patents registered in Europe in 1991, 9 per cent were of French origin, 20.4
per cent were German, 24.7 per cent American and 24.4 per cent Japanese.
The French state spends about FFrs 80bn a year on R &amp; D, of which FFr 30bn
is military and the rest civil, divided about equally between basic research
and sectoral programmes. Among the latter, the largest programme is FFr 9bn
a year for space (Ariane). Computing/electronics/telecommunications,
health/medicine, and agriculture get about FFr 4bn each. Lesser amounts are
for research into energy, aeronautics, the environment and manufacturing
processes.
France has always been a main proponent of European Union R &amp; D programmes,
but it does not reap any great financial savings as a result. For instance,
France continues to fund R &amp; D into electronic components which are not of
sufficiently wide interest to the 12 member states of the EU; only Siemens
of Germany and the Franco-Italian company of SGS-Thomson still make mass
market semi-conductors in Europe.
Mr Fillon sees it as his main job to give clearer direction to the 100,000
researchers who work in public R &amp; D institutes, universities and
engineering schools. So he is establishing a 'strategic orientation'
committee in his ministry, setting France the goal of matching the research
effort of the US, Japan and Germany by the year 2005.
But the real problem lies with French industry itself, which spends
relatively little on research - with the honourable exceptions of big
companies in the aerospace, pharmaceutical, electronic and telecommunication
sectors.
The upshot is that the state funds 51 per cent of all R &amp; D in France, 49
per cent in the US (because of defence), 35 per cent in Germany and 22 per
cent in Japan. Too little R &amp; D is carried out in smaller, middle (as
distinct from high) tech companies. Very few researchers in the public
laboratories - half of whom are over 45 years old - dream of taking the risk
of starting up their own businesses to translate their scientific invention
into technical innovation. Changing this bureaucratic culture in research is
not something that Mr Fillon will be able to do speedily.
But he probably could have done without the recent language law of his
fellow minister, Mr Jacques Toubon, responsible for culture. Most of
France's scientific community has strongly opposed the Loi Toubon which
requires the use of the French language in scientific congresses in France
and the publication in French of any work funded by the French state.
Most French scientists claim that this ignores the fact that English has
become the lingua franca of international science, and that only in English
can they let the world know what they have achieved.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (15): Une petite crise de confiance - The
arts have veered towards cultural conservatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a possibly apocryphal story that when Mr Jack Lang, the popular
socialist politician, and his wife, Monique, arrived at the gala dinner for
this year's Cannes Film Festival they headed straight for their usual seats
 -at the table of honour.
The hitch was that those seats are reserved for the French arts minister;
Jack Lang had been ousted from that post when the socialists lost power in
the spring 1992 elections. The best seats at the Cannes gala now belong to
his conservative successor, Jacques Toubon, and his wife, Lise. The Toubons
 -so runs the story - stood hovering on the sidelines while the festival
organisers pleaded with the Langs to move.
Apocryphal or not, the story acts as a neat illustration both of Mr Toubon's
difficulties in settling into his new job and of the unstable state of the
French arts which, like so many other areas of contemporary France, have hit
a crisis of confidence.
Mr Toubon is in an unenviable position. He has a difficult act to follow in
the charismatic Jack Lang who dominated the arts for almost a decade;
Francois Mitterrand's longest-serving minister. Mr Lang not only benefited
from the president's support but also from good timing. He was in power for
much of the prosperous 1980s and secured healthy increases in the culture
budget to finance ambitious initiatives such as the grands projets, his
modern architectural schemes.
His successor has taken over at a more difficult time: the French economy
has been in recession and most ministers have been forced to make cuts. To
his credit, Mr Toubon has defended the arts budget, which was frozen at
FFr13.45bn for 1994. But his tenure has coincided with a turbulent period
for France when the country's economic problems have been aggravated by
social anxieties such as the rising incidence of Aids and an increase in
racial tension.
These pressures have taken a toll on the cultural community. Rarely a week
goes by without an academic or journalist bemoaning the arid state of the
French arts in the media. The cultural life of every country enters a fallow
period from time to time, but the issue has a particular poignancy for
France, which has prided itself on its artistic and intellectual prowess
ever since the 1789 Revolution.
Optimists among the French intelligentsia dismiss concerns about the current
lull in artistic activity as typical of the Gallic love of self-criticism.
But the realists accept that, just as Paris lost its laurels to New York as
the international art centre, with the flowering of abstract expressionism
in the 1950s, it is now losing its intellectual edge. No new names have
surfaced to take the place of the great French thinkers of the 1960s, 1970s
and 1980s: Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes and Louis Althusser.
These problems were already apparent in the 1980s. However, they were
disguised by the triumphalist spirit of Jack Lang's policies. The grands
projets produced only one world-class French architect: Jean Nouvel, the man
behind the Arabic Cultural Centre in Paris. But the excitement of the new
buildings created the impression of France as a dynamic architectural centre
and fostered the emergence of figures in related fields - such as Philippe
Starck, now one of the world's most famous designers.
Jack Lang's munificence also stimulated other areas, notably cinema, with
the arrival of exciting young film-makers such as Jean-Jacques Beneix with
Diva and Luc Besson with Subway.
Some of these new talents are now struggling. Jean-Jacques Beneix and Luc
Besson have yet to replicate the commercial and critical success of their
early work. Jean Nouvel is still creating extraordinary buildings  - notably
the Fondation Cartier arts centre which opened in Paris this spring - but
his architectural practice has suffered in the recession.
The recession has also made it difficult for new names to emerge, not only
because budgets are tighter but because the climate is less confident and
thus more conservative.
Moreover, the French arts have historically fared badly during difficult
economic periods, arguably because France, unlike Britain, has no tradition
of social-realism. French film critics lionise the work of the British
realists, Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, but almost all the important French
movies of the 1990s have been historical epics. France's writers and
film-makers seem to have little interest in reflecting the harsh reality of
contemporary life.
Jacques Toubon seems unperturbed by this. His aim is to make the arts more
populist by changing the emphasis of his ministry's work away from Jack
Lang's multi-cultural modernism, back to a conservative ethos of
conservation and patriotism.
His main initiatives have been unashamedly nostalgic - notably his ambitious
programme to renovate delapidated historic monuments such as the Garnier
Opera and Pompidou Centre in Paris. The conservation theme is also apparent
in more blatantly nationalistic schemes such as his battle last autumn to
defend French cinema against the 'cultural imperialism' of Hollywood during
the Gatt negotiations and his new law against the use of English, or
franglais, in advertising.
Mr Toubon's attacks on Hollywood and franglais have been greeted with
derision outside France. But his cultural conservatism has struck a chord
with the government's centre-right supporters at a time when they seem to
want to escape from the uncertainties of contemporary life by wallowing in
the past through the anniversaries of the D-Day landings, the Georges
Pompidou presidency and even in the recent trial of Paul Touvier, the Nazi
collaborator.
However, as Mr Toubon's critics have pointed out, his nostalgia drive is not
simply a harmless diversion. It could have the adverse effect of encouraging
the French to avoid getting to grips with the problems of the present,
thereby prolonging, rather than resolving, the cultural crisis in France.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (13): Kicking the support habit - David
Buchan finds that agriculture is learning to live with the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What Mikhail Gorbachev used to call 'new thinking' is gaining ground in
France's farming establishment - or at least in its agriculture ministry and
parts of its food industry and farming community.
France is learning to live with the Gatt accords which, only a year ago,
many French were denouncing as instruments of American 'agri-imperialism'
aimed at turning the French countryside into a desert. Paris is developing
proposals to enable French and European farmers to sell more of their
produce on the world market without subsidy - and thereby to sidestep
legally the Gatt requirement for a 21 per cent cut in subsidised exports
over six years.
Despite their past tirades against Gatt, the French are better placed than
other Europeans to kick the habit of high support prices and high export
subsidies.
In the Paris basin, France's prime wheat growing belt within a radius of
some 200 kilometres from the French capital, production costs are roughly
the same as in the American middle west; for French farmers, the cost of
using fertiliser more lavishly than their American counterparts is offset by
higher French yields (6 tonnes per hectare on average, compared to 2.5 tonne
in the US).
But price is not everything when it comes to food, where France has always
traded on its 'marques' and 'appellations controlees'. Only about a third of
French farm produce is exported in unprocessed form, and an increasing share
of exports, such as almost all wines, cognacs and most cheeses (except for
the more basic types such as Emmenthal), need no subsidy from Brussels. Of
the FFr50bn worth of farm products that France exports outside Europe, FFr
17bn worth was sold without subsidy.
'Can this practice (of subsdidy-free export) be extended to other sectors,
such as poultry, certain milk products and even large scale production of
cereals?' asks Mr Jean Puech, the agriculture minister, answering himself in
the affirmative. In pursuit of this goal, the minister is proposing:
Various national measures to cuts costs and increase efficiency in French
agriculture. Last month Mr Puech announced cuts in special levies cereal
farmers have had to pay (because they are considered richer than other
farmers). He would also like to abolish the discriminatory system which
levies social charges on a farmer's entire income (including capital
savings), not just on earned income - as in the case of everyone outside
farming.
Another possible legislative change would encourage the incorporation of
more farms as companies, to deal better with the Napoleonic code's
requirement that estates be equally parcelled out to heirs.
To maximise the possibilities offered by the Gatt, both in terms of market
opening and of product protection. France is now seriously prospecting new
markets in Asia, and its Breton pig farmers have now joined their Danish
counterparts in acquiring the right to sell pork into Japan. France also
hopes that Gatt will help it crack down on counterfeiting, particularly of
cognacs.
To extend to other products the system already existing for sugar which,
beyond a certain quantity, is exported without subsidy. In general terms,
the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU is making European
farm products more competitive, chiefly through the 20-25 per cent cut in
the prices of cereals, an important agricultural input. For instance, this
is making France much more competitive in poultry because, as an aide to Mr
Puech comments: 'chickens are basically cereals with feet'.
But Paris is also examining the idea of 'split internal pricing' whereby
producers would get the guaranteed Brussels minimum price for a certain
quota of their production, and beyond that they would be free to produce as
much as they liked for whatever return they could get on the world market.
The French agriculture ministry notes that it would not be easy to control
these two different production and price systems so as to avoid fraud and
market disruption. Eridania Beghin Say, France's biggest sugar producer,
says it would welcome an extension of the European sugar regime (which has
the added advantage to the European taxpayer that producers pay for their
own export subsidies). But it recognises that it might be difficult for
products less industrial than sugar, which has to pass through refineries.
However, Mr Puech says he believes it should be possible to let farmers
'develop extra production which could be sold at lower prices, given its
marginal cost of production. With all the necessary prudence, we ought to be
able to find solutions based on differentiated pricing.' The minister
intends to encapsulate his ideas in a memo sent to the European Commission
in time to be debated under the French presidency of the EU in the first
half of next year.
In the meantime, the French agro-industry is proving its durability and
adaptability. Last year's recession hit some companies such as its leader,
the Danone group - the renamed BSN - which saw retail sales drop slightly,
but left unaffected others such as Eridania Beghin Say.
Overall, the French agro-industry held its turnover steady last year at FFr
695.5bn, the only industrial sector to do so during the 1993 recession.
'We are happy to have been proved wrong,' says an official in the French
agriculture ministry. Paris had criticised the European Commission for
over-estimating the degree to which European farmers would reconquer their
home market in the wake of CAP reform.
'But perhaps this shows that the set-aside arrangements should be made more
flexible,' adds the official. The CAP reform's requirement that French
farmers have to take 15 per cent of their arable land out of production
still grates. And it was only after being promised that the Gatt agreement
would not increase this set-aside ratio that France put its signature to the
world trade deal. Now, Paris sees the glimmer of a hope, or at least an
argument, for reducing it.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (13): China gears up
for the future - Arthur Way checks progress in promoting manufacture of
parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR WAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vehicle and component manufacturers with the necessary financial, managerial
and technological resources are shaping up to participate in the development
of China's motor industry. The experience promises to be exciting,
occasionally bumpy, but ultimately highly rewarding.
In 1993, the country's vehicle output amounted to a reported 1.28m units
with the emphasis on commercial vehicles. Government forecasts indicate that
production will rise markedly by the end of the 1990s to 3m a year with cars
and multi-purpose vehicles (people carriers) accounting for much of the
increase.
Further substantial growth is virtually guaranteed as the country fulfils
its promise to become one of the world's leading economies.
Recent years have witnessed a hectic pace in motor industry development.
Component industry investment, though, has tended to lag.
To allow the components sector to catch up, the government recently
announced plans to withhold approval for new vehicle manufacturing projects
until 1996. The only venture expected to escape this freeze is the proposed
minivan project, for which Chrysler is the main contender.
Moreover, approval for any future vehicle assembly operation is expected to
be conditional on achieving an initial local content of at least 40 per
cent, rising to 60 per cent within three years.
Official policy favours an expansion in the components sector. This is being
promoted in two main ways. First, vehicle manufacturers who already have an
assembly presence are being encouraged to increase local content. And
second, those who hope to participate in the next phase of motor industry
development are required to show their commitment by setting up component
manufacturing operations as a first step.
Citroen's newly established venture to produce a version of its ZX model -
at an annual rate of 35,000 within two years, and with an eventual target of
150,000 - will feature an increasing proportion of Chinese-built parts. The
aim is to reach a local content of 90 per cent as quickly as possible, which
has led the company to encourage some of its European suppliers to the
Spanish-built ZX to set up in China. Tudor, the Spanish battery
manufacturer, has already declared its intention to establish a Chinese
plant.
There are signs that Toyota is preparing for a bigger role. So far the
Japanese company's main involvement has been providing technical help
together with a licence to a local producer for the manufacture of light
commercial vehicles. The majority of components are imported from Japan, but
the strength of the yen has added to the urgency of building up local
content which stands at around 20 per cent. Now Toyota is assisting in the
establishment of facilities to produce steering and transmission components,
with the aim of boosting the figure to 40 per cent in 1994 and to 70 per
cent during the second half of the 1990s.
In June, Ford announced plans to invest Dollars 50m in setting up its first
Chinese manufacturing facilities. These are to be in the components sector
and involve joint ventures with two local suppliers - Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corporation and Shanghai Yao Hua Glass Works. Ford is to hold a 51
per cent stake in the ventures, both of which are conditional on receiving
official approval.
The joint venture with Yan Feng - China's largest supplier of automotive
trim components - will produce plastic components such as instrument panels,
interior trim and seats. Operations will take place at one of the Chinese
partner's existing facilities and at a new factory which is due to start
output in autumn 1994. The joint venture with Yao Hua will be named Shanghai
Fu Hua Glass Company, and will produce automotive safety glass and
architectural glass.
A wide range of European groups are establishing component manufacturing
facilities in China. SKF is setting up an operation to manufacture ball
bearings, while Valeo has established a joint venture with local partners
for the manufacture of windscreen wiper equipment.
UK component suppliers have not played a particularly prominent role in
China's components sector. Part of the reason probably stems from the
absence of a British-based vehicle manufacturer in the country. But some
component groups have established a presence and there is the likelihood of
more to come as others examine opportunities.
Lucas is actively pursuing opportunities in China and already has a
licensing arrangement for brake actuation equipment. The company recently
concluded a joint venture agreement with Mando (of Korea) to supply brake
calipers, in which Lucas will have a 20 per cent holding.
Automotive Products (AP), a subsidiary of BBA, has agreements with local
interests with the result that all modern generation Chinese trucks are
equipped with clutches produced under licence from AP.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (12): Recession forces
urgent rethink - The Japanese industry faces challenges of epic dimensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR WAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese component suppliers may be excused a hollow laugh at the crisis
alleged to be facing their counterparts in Europe, as set out in the
European Commission's study into the sector. But feeling sympathy for the
Europeans is altogether another matter, since the Japanese components
industry itself faces commercial, economic, financial and political
pressures which pose challenges of epic dimensions.
The problems start at home where component suppliers are still smarting from
the length and depth of the motor industry's recession. Poor domestic demand
coupled with slumping exports in the context of worldwide recession and the
strength of the yen have led to a marked cut in orders.
In 1993, Japanese car production fell by 9 per cent, while commercial
vehicle output declined by 13 per cent. Moreover, the rot has continued into
1994 with vehicle output falling by around 12 per cent during the first
quarter - although more recently there have been signs that Japanese car
buyers are coming out of hibernation. However, the strength of the yen
remains a serious barrier to the motor industry's export effort.
It is hardly surprising that latest financial results have made dismal
reading. In the tyre sector, for example, Bridgestone - the number one
manufacturer - saw its turnover fall by 8 per cent in 1993 and suffered a 53
per cent decline in pre-tax profits. The company cited a sharp reduction in
orders from domestic car manufacturers, a sector where it holds a 50 per
cent market share, as the principal cause.
In addition, the Japanese replacement market was depressed with consumers
trading down to cheaper brands and, adding a further twist, prices came
under severe pressure. The same circumstances led Sumitomo Rubber to
experience a 13 per cent drop in turnover and a 69 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits.
In another product category, the ball-bearing producer NSK recorded an 8 per
cent fall in turnover and a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits during
the year to end-March 1994. The underlying trend was even worse, since a
profit was achieved only by realising a capital gain through the sale of
investments. Sales to motor industry customers fell by an above average 9
per cent.
Vehicle manufacturers' profits have been sliding, too, with consequent
wide-ranging cost-cutting measures. These seem likely to have an adverse
impact on the components sector. Reports indicate that vehicle producers are
taking a robust approach during supply contract negotiations and are seeking
substantial price reductions in an attempt to restore profitability and
compensate for the yen's strength.
Toyota, for example, is understood to be looking for price reductions of
around 15 per cent during the three years to 1997, while Mazda - which
incurred a pre-tax loss of Y48bn in the year to end-March 1994 - is looking
for quicker results with price cuts of around 10 per cent during the 1994/95
financial year. Even the smaller producers are in the hunt for big
reductions. Daihatsu is believed to be seeking an across-the-board reduction
in unit component prices of 20 per cent over the next three years.
Failure to meet these 'requests' could result in an increasing volume of
component imports from other nations in south-east Asia such as Korea, the
Philippines and Thailand where unit costs are lower. Longer term, the region
will provide Japanese vehicle makers with an increasing range of component
sourcing options, many of which will be exercised in the interests of
maintaining international competitiveness.
Some of these new vehicle manufacturing ventures are being established with
help from Japanese manufacturers, and it is logical to expect growing ties
which will involve, among other things, an increasing flow of components
into Japan from cost-effective sources. Honda is well advanced in
establishing a components supply network in south-east Asia, while
Mitsubishi is importing parts from Korean-based Hyundai.
Another threat arises over the likelihood of rising component shipments from
America, as Japan comes under mounting pressure to narrow the trade gap. The
five largest Japanese vehicle producers - Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi
and Mazda - have all announced plans to boost purchases from American
component producers. This will involve a higher level of imports into Japan
for domestic vehicle assembly as well as greater use of local suppliers in
overseas assembly operations.
Toyota envisages that its purchases from American component producers will
rise by Dollars 630m in 1994 from the Dollars 4.7bn level in 1993,
increasing still further to Dollars 6.5bn in 1996. Nissan's purchases are
due to rise from Dollars 2.4bn in 1992 to Dollars 4.3bn in 1997,
Mitsubishi's from Dollars 900m in 1993 to Dollars 2.1bn in 1996, Honda's
from Dollars 3.7bn in 1992 to Dollars 5.2bn in 1995, and Mazda's from
Dollars 1.8bn in 1993 to Dollars 2.3bn in 1997.
Even without this political pressure, the currency factor has resulted in
overseas assembly plants of Japanese vehicle producers stepping up their
purchases from local sources rather than using high cost supplies from
Japan.
All the factors mentioned are combining to force an urgent rethink among
Japanese component suppliers concerning the most appropriate strategy for
future survival. First-tier producers of systems are likely to expand
purchases of materials and components from foreign sources.
Another trend widely expected is an increase in partnerships with American
and European companies to share research and development costs and
facilitate entry into a wider international marketplace.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (14): Inflated ideas
on safety - John Griffiths assesses the proliferation of airbags and
air-conditioning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cars are becoming ever more complex and sophisticated as a result of
stricter safety and environmental laws and consumers becoming more
demanding.
The trend is summed up in the motor industry buzz phrase 'more car per car'.
As more high-tech component systems are added, so their suppliers can earn
significantly more per vehicle produced.
It is not often that two high-value components systems emerge together to
provide suppliers with the potential for a leap in earnings. But such is the
case with airbags - being adopted at a rate much faster than expected two
years ago - and with air-conditioning.
Airbags, which inflate by explosive charge from the dashboard to prevent
injury in a frontal collision, are a relatively new technology.
Air-conditioning is far older but traditionally has been very expensive in
Europe - typically at least Pounds 1,000 per car as an option. However, new
capacity to produce air-conditioning is coming on stream in several European
centres. Air-conditioning now appears poised to spread through a far larger
section of the European car market as manufacturers perceive that it could
prove a valuable volume car market sales tool. Peugeot, for example, has
disconcerted fleet market rivals in the UK by deciding to fit 'a/c' as
standard in all 405s sold in in the UK.
Its potential growth in Europe was underlined last month when Australia's
Air International Group and the UK's Unipart components group launched a new
50-50 joint venture, Automotive Climate Systems, to design, develop and
manufacture air-conditioning, heating and ventilation systems for the
European vehicle industry.
The venture is being set up on the basis of forecasts that European demand
for a/c systems will triple to 6m units a year by 2000 - business worth
about Pounds 5bn annually.
In 1990, European sales of a/c systems totalled 940,000 units, although
production was higher at 1.6m because of the high level of exports by
European car makers to countries such as the US, where air-conditioning is
virtually standard.
The largest new venture into a/c, however, has been made by Nippondenso,
Japan's largest vehicle components maker, which has invested Pounds 65m with
Fiat components subsidiary Magneti Marelli in a plant at Telford in the UK
with a capacity of 500,000 units a year.
TRW, the US components multinational which, like rival AlliedSignal, is
establishing airbag production capacity in Europe, forecasts that the world
demand for airbags will grow from about 17m this year to some 60m in 1998.
TRW is investing Pounds 8m in a facility at Houghton-le-Spring, Wearside, to
produce electronic trigger mechanisms for the bags. AlliedSignal has signed
a three-way venture with two Italian groups, Gilardini and Sequa, to supply
advanced airbag inflators to European manufacturers. The venture will be
based in Colleferro, Italy.
One of the most intractable car safety problems arises from side collisions,
where only the thickness of the car door protects against injury.
With question marks increasingly being raised over the efficacy of
anti-intrusion bars within the doors an increasing amount of research is
going on into side airbags.
Mercedes-Benz, which invented the original steering wheel airbag and is now
developing side airbags, stresses the technological difficulties involved.
At 30mph, say its engineers, it can take just 15 milliseconds for an
occupant to come into contact with the inside of the door. So, to offer
maximum protection the airbag may have to inflate even before impact - thus
requiring proximity sensors. Quite how they are to differentiate between a
harmlessly passing bicycle and a potential car-to-car impact has yet to be
fully worked out.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (11): Goliath gives way - David Buchan
looks at monopoly deregulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euroteleport is smaller and less grandiose than its name. With just 10 full
time staff, it sees itself as David to the Goliath that is France Telecom,
with 156,000 employees. But from its base of Roubaix, Euroteleport is
prising loose France Telecom's lock-hold on telecommunications in the
country.
It set itself up last year as a kind of airport (hence its name) to direct
communications traffic for companies which, since 1990, have been allowed to
go outside France Telecom in creating internal networks between their own
factories, subsidiaries or industrial partners.
Since 1990 France's PTT has granted some 200 licences for such independent
networks. Some have gone to organisations with obvious means as well as
needs, such as the SNCF railway system and Electricite de France (EdF), the
electricity utility, whose tracks and cables can accommodate parallel
telephone lines. But several private companies without these terrestrial
advantages have gone for help to Euroteleport.
Mr Jean-Pierre Machart, Euroteleport's managing director, claims that
dissatisfaction with France Telecom prices turned two other customers
towards Euroteleport. The local textile group of de Wavrin decided that
France Telecom was providing too expensive a link between its Scottish,
Italian and Dutch branches, and is now following Euroteleport's advice in
using US Sprint, although the fact that the latter has just linked up with
France Telecom may jeopardise Euroteleport's relationship with Sprint in the
long term.
Auchan, the supermarket chain, was paying France Telecom FFr14.5m a year to
link its 52 supermarkets in France for a service that Mr Machart claims to
be able to provide for FFr4.5m a year.
In fact, France Telecom has entered far more into the spirit of competition
than other French utilities, pushed partly by the European Commission and
partly by new technology which is steadily reducing the barriers to entry
into its market. 'We are no longer a monopoly,' says Mr Gerard Moine of
France Telecom.
The red letter date in the European telecoms calendar is January 1 1998,
when ordinary voice telephony is to be opened to competition. It is hard to
see France Telecom losing its national hold over this.
Even Euroteleport's ambition is purely regional. 'We would like to be the
telecom operator for everyone in the Nord-Pas de Calais region,' says Mr
Machart. 'But we are too small to try to link up the whole of France. We
could have satellite clients across the country, charging for instance
FFr1.50 a minute to call the US compared to today's cost of FFr6. But France
Telecom could always react by lowering international call costs, because it
has such a large domestic business on which tariffs could be commensurately
raised.'
Indeed, further reductions in its international tariffs are an important
part of France Telecom's preparation for 1998. But Mr Moine admits that it
may not be easy, given that it has already cut trans-Atlantic charges by 60
per cent over the past five years, and the French utility's debt servicing,
at 8 per cent of turnover, is much heavier than, say, British Telecom's at 3
per cent.
France's two other Goliaths, EdF and Gaz de France, are showing far more
determination to keep potential Davids at bay. In contrast to telecoms,
where it has accepted European liberalisation with a more or less good
grace, France is still stoutly contesting the European Commission's attempts
to end its energy monopolies.
It believes that Brussels is behaving like a lawyer rather than an economist
in refusing to acknowledge both the huge energy investments that only
monopolies or near-monopolies can make, and the huge advantages that these
investments can produce. With assets of FFr 600bn, a debt of FFr170bn and a
cash flow of FFr60bn a year, EdF has become the world's largest producer of
electricity (generated 75 per cent by its 54 nuclear power plants). With the
exception of some Dutch and UK rates, it is the cheapest in Europe.
The Commission has said it will take France and several other EU states to
court for refusing to end monopolies on importing (as well as the slightly
less sensitive matter of exporting) energy, but it has not yet done so. The
stakes are less high for EdF (which exports some 12 per cent of its output
now) than for GdF, which already imports 90 per cent of its gas.
'The government is worried that breaking up GdF's import monopoly would
fragment and weaken France's bargaining power when it comes to buying as gas
from supplier monopolies in Russia, Norway or Algeria,' says a senior
industry ministry official.
But the government seems ready to accept its recent Mandil committee report
that certain industrial users of gas could contract to import gas directly,
but only 'in co-operation with the network' - in other words, GdF.
In addition, without privatising the utility, the government is ready to
open GdF's capital to oil or gas producers - a possibility enhanced by the
fact that GdF's new president, Mr Loik Le Floch Prigent, used to head
Elf-Aquitaine.
The Commission has made further liberalisation proposals, to win approval
from other EU institutions. They have drawn a mixed reaction from France:
France is ready to allow outsiders to bid competitively to supply additional
electricity generation to EdF which, however, would remain the sole
distributor of power in the country. This would end EdF's production
monopoly, as the Commission desires.
France is flatly opposed to allowing 'third party access' requiring EdF/GdF
to carry other people's electricity or gas to any French consumer who wants
it.
Paris objects on grounds of equity and efficiency. It would undermine
uniformity of price - considered an overriding social objective in France -
because French companies would be bypassing EdF/GdF to get a cheaper price.
It would also undermine the certainty needed for investment. 'No one would
build nuclear plants any more,' says Mr Pierre Lederer, chief EdF economist.
'It would have an accordion-like effect on the market,' comments Mr
Dominique Maillard of the industry ministry, because falls in investment
would lead to eventual shortages and price rises themselves stimulating
over-investment and over-capacity.
France is against a free energy market for itself, but sees some
self-interest in others making the experiment. EdF has become the world's
biggest electricity exporter, partly because the break-up of monopolies in,
for example, the UK, have given it a market.
Monopoly at home, free market abroad? Who could ask for more?

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (12): Media alliances forge ahead - The
communications industry is now largely free of state controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a furious Andre Rousselet last stormed out of a February board meeting
at Havas, the powerful media and leisure group of which he was once
chairman, it marked the end of one era for the French communications
industry and the beginning of another.
Mr Rousselet was protesting against the surprise announcement that, without
his knowledge, Havas had finalised negotiations to form a group of
shareholders in Canal-Plus, the pay-TV station he had founded in 1984. His
walk-out was shortly followed by his resignation as a director of Havas and
then as chairman of Canal-Plus.
His departure cleared the way for Havas and its partners - France Telecom,
the telecommunications group behind the Telecom 2 French satellite
television service which had just agreed to become one of Havas's minority
shareholders, and Generale des Eaux, the industrial concern with extensive
interests in cable television - to take control of Canal-Plus. It should
also - or so the Havas faction hopes - enable them to dominate the
development of the communications industry into the next century.
France has always prided itself on its technocratic prowess. Successive
governments have invested heavily in ambitious technology and engineering
projects: from the construction of the train a grande vitesse high speed
rail network, to the installation of France Telecom's Minitel interactive
computer system. They have also been willing to support ailing areas of
technology-linked industries such as some parts of the Thomson electronics
empire and the heavily loss-making Bull computer group.
The excitement generated by the emergence of the new multimedia industry in
the US has triggered a similar surge of enthusiasm in France among the
companies that participated in the liberalisation of the old
state-controlled broadcasting system during the 1980s. These companies -
which include Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utility group, the Bouygues
construction concern, the Luxembourg-based CLT media company, the Chargeurs
industrial group and Matra-Hachette, the electronics and media conglomerate,
as well as Havas, Generale des Eaux and France Telecom - are now wrestling
for pole positions in the French multimedia arena.
The central theme of developments in the communications industry during the
1980s was the dismantling of the old state controls.
This process was begun by the socialist administrations of the early 1980s
and continued by the centre-right coalition government in the middle of the
decade. It involved the creation of new media entities, such as Canal-Plus
and the French cable television system. It also included the privatisation
of a number of important media companies including Havas and TF1, the
country's largest television channel.
Some of these initiatives have been resounding successes. Canal-Plus is only
10 years old, but has been so successful that it is regarded as a worldwide
role model in pay-TV. It has also expanded into other countries and into new
areas of the media, notably into film production and satellite channels.
TF1 has been similarly successful, having flourished in the private sector
to increase its share of the viewing and advertising revenue largely at the
expense of France 2 and France 3, its state-controlled competitors. M6, one
of the new private sector television channels launched in the 1980s, is
finalising plans to go public.
Yet other ventures have been expensive failures. La Cinq, another new 1980s
channel, collapsed two years ago leaving heavy losses for its main
shareholders (including Matra-Hachette and Silvio Berlusconi, now prime
minister of Italy). Meanwhile the French cable television system is still
struggling after years in the red.
In short, the progress of the French communications initiatives of the 1980s
has at best been erratic. However, liberalisation of the old
state-controlled broadcasting system, coupled with the development of new
areas such as cable, did flush out the main participants in the development
of the new multimedia industry. The protagonists have been hastily forging
alliances over the past few months, from which they will fight for market
dominance.
The Canal-Plus crisis was a critical event in the creation of these camps.
It now seems fated, as Mr Rousselet feared, to become a pawn in France
Telecom's multimedia strategy.
It has also become the focus for one of France's multimedia factions:
composed of Havas and Generale des Eaux as well as France Telecom. This
group is now pitted against the combination of TF1 and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Hovering on the sidelines are CLT and Matra-Hachette, together with
Chargeurs, one of France's leading film producers and a long term investor
in Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB channels which are relayed by Telecom 2's
arch-rival, the pan-European Astra satellite service.
They wait anxiously for France's multimedia battle to begin in earnest. Yet
the most anxious observer of all is the French government which, despite the
1980s liberalisations, has kept a tight rein over the media, to the extent
of infuriating its EU partners with protectionist policies.
French protectionism is now under attack both from the rising tide of EU
regulations and the ineluctable internationalisation of European media. The
French might have drawn up their multimedia battle lines, but they are
unlikely to be allowed to wage the war entirely on their own terms.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (10): Tide begins to
turn - Ian Robertson looks at Japanese trade with the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN ROBERTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What political pressure has so far failed to achieve, in reducing Japan's
annual Dollars 10bn surplus in auto parts trade with the US, may yet be
resolved by market pressures.
Confronted by the twin problems of a relentlessly high yen and the
consequent drop in domestic production of more than 2m vehicles since 1991,
Japan's component producers reported a decline in profits of around 25 per
cent a year. The profit/sales ratio for the country's 20,000 suppliers
slipped to 0.6 per cent for 1993/4 and a significant rationalisation of the
sector is forecast over the next five to 10 years with an increasing number
of mergers, acquisitions and alliances.
A wave of cost-reduction programmes by suppliers began in 1993. Their
effects will be seen on new models produced from 1997 when the supply sector
anticipates the beginnings of a recovery for the country's components
producers. Parts sharing is on the rise by the vehicle manufacturers,
breaking down the old keiretsu system of exclusive supplier networks.
Product life cycles are being extended and the number of model variants is
being reduced, all of which will assist economies of scale by component
suppliers.
Despite US pressures, however, imported components accounted for only 3 per
cent of completed vehicles in Japan in 1993. The latest round of June trade
negotiations in Tokyo failed to achieve any formal breakthrough in the US
campaign to raise this imported percentage.
The industry, however, is already moving towards an informal resolution by
stepping up its plans for overseas procurement. In an interview with The
Economist Intelligence Unit last month, the chairman of the Japan Auto Part
Industries Association (JAPIA) declared that 'regardless of the outcome of
the talks between the two governments, Japanese auto parts companies are
going to transfer more of their production capacity to the US, and
increasingly vehicle manufacturers are seeking to source more of their
components from the US.
As for Japanese auto transplants in the US, in the future they will buy
almost all their components from North American suppliers rather than
importing them from Japan.' The driver is the need to cut costs and remain
competitive - with the added threat of low-cost emergent producers in the
neighbouring Pacific Rim. Already this has triggered some US/Japanese
agreements to co-operate in their approaches to third countries, such as
China.
Overall, Japan is committed to the purchase of Dollars 19bn of US auto parts
by fiscal 1994 (ending March 1995). The Clinton administration, taking a
'results-oriented' approach, wants Japan to guarantee numerical targets
comprising Dollars 1.5bn for US purchases and Dollars 4bn for imports - as
was agreed during President Bush's January 1992 visit to Tokyo. It also
wants a more detailed breakdown of planned purchases charging that, last
year, one-sixth of US components sold in Japan were tyres, many of these
sourced from the US subsidiaries of Japan's largest tyre producers,
Bridgestone, Sumitomo Rubber and Yokohama Rubber.
Japan, however, insists the agreement related to enhanced opportunities to
sell US parts, with no guarantees on net sales levels. Moreover, with the
interim slump in vehicle output, the Dollars 4bn import target is
considered, by the industry, to be out of reach. Although the US trade
deficit in auto parts has climbed from Dollars 1bn in 1981 to more than
Dollars 10bn, it is argued that in yen terms, the increase was less than
half the dollar amount and since 1990 there has actually been a decrease.
With the dollar holding at near record highs, US components producers are
stepping up their efforts. GM's Automotive Components Group (ACG) Asia is to
increase its staff of engineers by 30 per cent to 130 before the end of the
year. It plans to raise fiscal 1994 sales in Japan to Y13 billion - an
increase of 20 per cent over fiscal 1993. The increase in the number of
engineers will allow ACG to work together with Japanese auto makers from the
design stage.
TRW sold an estimated Dollars 700m of components to the Japanese last year -
up from Dollars 60m in 1985 - and it has set a target of Dollars 1.5bn by
1997. Ford opened a Dollars 4.5m technical centre in East Hiroshima last
October and hopes to double its sales in Japan in three years' time.
Other companies in the process of upgrading their Japanese operations
include Rockwell International, Garrett Turbo, Intel and Motorola. Compared
with fewer than 10 a decade ago, there are now an estimated 80 US component
manufacturers with representation in Japan aimed at accessing Japan's
Dollars 140bn auto parts market.
Among the transplants in North America, the US content of Accords built by
Honda of America Manufacturing now stands at 82 per cent; Honda of America
produces all its engines in-house, one of the reasons for the high local
content rate. (Chrysler Corporation, which imports Mitsubishi V6 engines for
several models including the Dodge Acclaim, is believed to have a domestic
content of about 70 per cent).
Companies participating in Honda of America's continuous improvement
programme have seen an average 48 per cent jump in productivity, Toyota also
claims that, through quality control systems introduced at its US suppliers,
defect rates have been lowered to a negligible 0.2 per cent compared with
2.5 per cent for the same suppliers in their dealings with the US Big Three.
Sales to the US transplants are viewed as the first step in selling directly
to the factories in Japan.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturing Association (JAMA) insists that the
purchase of US auto parts is increasing. Over the past five years the number
of contracts has more than doubled and the number of suppliers tripled.
Nissan claims that the Dollars 3bn of local parts it procured in the US last
year already exceeded its voluntary plan of Dollars 2.9bn for 1994. It plans
to increase local procurement of US-made parts by 75 per cent to Dollars
3.4bn in fiscal 1997 and to increase parts imports by 7 per cent to Dollars
1.7bn in fiscal 1988, up from an estimated Dollars 980m.
Toyota reports that it raised its purchases of US-made car parts by 5 per
cent last year to Dollars 4.7bn or more than four times the Dollars 1.1bn it
spent five years ago. Toyota expects to lift its procurement of US-made car
parts to Dollars 5.3bn in the year to March 1995.
The company holds annual meetings with US component suppliers with the aim
of fostering long-term business relations and promoting purchases of North
American products. It now imports into Japan parts from 131 North American
suppliers and purchases auto parts from 301 suppliers in North America for
its transplant operations - up from 70 and 130 firms respectively in 1990 -
and its Camry model is to go to 80 per cent local content in 1995.
Mitsubishi Motors, which has also been looking at buying in lower-cost steel
from South Korea, is investigating opportunities to source components from
US suppliers to its Diamond-Star transplant operation for its Japanese-made
cars. Local procurement in the US is expected to rise to between Dollars
1.4bn and Dollars 1.6bn in fiscal 1996 from Dollars 650m in fiscal 1993.
Exports of components and materials to Japan will rise from Dollars 260m in
fiscal 1993 to Dollars 350-Dollars 440m in fiscal 1994.
Mazda has announced a new international co-operation programme in which it
forecasts that by fiscal 1997 its parts imports will rise 55 per cent from
the Dollars 870m recorded in fiscal 1993.
As well as encouraging foreign suppliers to participate in its design
activities the programme also calls for the provision of support to
second-tier suppliers in the US.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (11): Parts giant
expands - Profile of Automotive Components Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors last month announced a restructuring of its top management
which, in the process, gave greater autonomy to its components operations,
ACG (Automotive Components Group), to seek business with virtually any car
or truck maker anywhere in the world.
The intention is that by 2003 more than 50 per cent of ACG's sales will be
to customers outside the GM group in North America, compared with only 15
per cent at the start of the 1990s. It will be spanning the world with a
matrix of manufacturing plants and joint ventures capable of supplying any
manufacturer with complex components systems wherever they might choose to
set up assembly plants.
With a Dollars 25.1bn turnover last year, ACG is already at least twice as
big as its nearest rivals, as well as having a broader product spread within
its six divisions.
And it has already made progress towards its long-term goal. Around 27 per
cent of last year's turnover, or nearly Dollars 7bn, was earned from
customers outside GM's North American Operations (NAO) and the figure is
expected to rise to more than 30 per cent by 1996.
It employs 178,000 people world-wide, operates 180 manufacturing plants in
23 countries and has 13 technical centres and proving grounds spread around
the world. In 1987, it had 109 plants located within North America and 51
outside. By last year there were only 86 plants in North America, with 95
overseas.
The non-NAO business is not wholly non-GM. It includes unquantified sales to
Opel, GM's German cars division, and other GM subsidiaries, although Mr JT
Battenberg 111, its president, maintains that ACG is having to fight for the
business like anyone else.
Already ACG is present in all 20 of the world's principal vehicle markets
and can supply most systems to any outside company. Among recent contracts
is supply of the dashboard module, wiring harness and other components for
the leisure four-wheel-drive vehicle Mercedes is to start producing in
Alabama in 1998.
Ned McLurg, a GM vice-president and general manager of the newly-formed AC
Delco Systems division, also stresses the substantial business his division
has won with Toyota as well as the Japanese car maker's highest quality
award.
'Other manufacturers are saying to us, sell us what you've done for Toyota,'
says Mr McLurg - despite Toyota recently issuing a warning to some of its
North American suppliers that quality needed further upgrading.
Mr McLurg readily acknowledges that rivals, in particular those based in
Europe, are not going to yield sales meekly and says there is 'no question
that going head to head with rivals like Siemens and Bosch would be
difficult'. Instead, he says, 'there are still component areas where they
don't have a presence and there are also big opportunities in new products
as emissions legislation tightens further, such as exhaust gas recirculation
equipment'.
ACG comprises Delco Chassis, Saginaw (steering systems), Harrison (thermal
management systems), Packard Electric, Inland Fisher Guide and AC Delco
Systems, newly created by combining AC Rochester (engine management) and
Delco Remy (electrical energy storage and conversion). Additionally, two
other entities, ACG Europe and ACG Asia Pacific, are charged with finding
non-NAO business.
ACG was set up in 1988, at a time when there were 13 components divisions
with 300 product lines.
As the long 1980s global motor industry boom ended, profits - based heavily
on unrealistic internal GM transfer prices - evaporated. Between 1992 and
this year there were a number of strategic initiatives based on a sombre
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses.
ACG felt that within its core businesses it had recognised good technology
and quality, and in places competitive cost structures and margins as well
as good relations with most other large vehicle makers. But there was also
an uncomfortable number of uncompetitive operations with too many high-cost
manufacturing sites, too many product lines and too great a dependence on
'captive' GM business.
'We had arrived,' recalls Mr Battenberg, 'at a strategic crossroads.'
Systematic benchmarking against world-class suppliers was introduced and a
target 10 per cent average growth rate set for non-NAO business. Product
lines were cut to 155 from 300. In 1993, non-NAO sales hit Dollars 6.6bn,
representing 27 per cent of total turnover.
The target set at the start of the overhaul of reaching 30 per cent non-GM
North America business by 1996 is now certain to be exceeded.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (9): Technological
brakethrough - Profile of AlliedSignal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AlliedSignal, the US engineering group, has established a leading position
in three key areas of the automotive components industry - braking, safety
systems and engine components.
It's automotive components operations had a turnover of Dollars 4.5bn last
year and accounted for around 38 per cent of total group turnover of Dollars
11.8bn. With 33,000 employees the automotive division accounts for a similar
share of the total group workforce of 86,000.
AlliedSignal claims to be the world's largest independent producer of car
and truck brakes under the brand names of Bendix and Jurid, and the group is
achieving rapid growth from a modest base in anti-lock braking systems (ABS)
for cars and trucks. It has won contracts to supply the ABS systems, for
example, on important new products such as the Ford Mondeo large family car
and the Chrysler Neon small car.
Its market share in ABS systems in Europe and the US remains less than 10
per cent, but the group claims that it is developing more advanced
technology, which should strengthen its competitive position by 1996.
Under the Garret brand name it is the world's largest producer of turbo
chargers and is expanding this business in particular in Europe with the
growth of the turbo-diesel market for cars.
Its biggest growth business is the production of safety restraint systems,
where the group is an important supplier of seat belts and driver and
passenger side airbags.
The share of the group's main markets in its overall automotive turnover has
changed significantly during the past two years as a result of the rapid
growth in the North American market and the decline in European car and
truck sales.
Sales in North America accounted for 60 per cent of automotive turnover last
year compared with 34 per cent in Europe and 6 per cent in the rest of the
world, while a year earlier Europe accounted for 49 per cent compared with
45 per cent in North America.
Its top 10 automotive customers include the big three US vehicle makers, the
four European-owned volume car makers, as well as Navistar, the US truck
maker, Nissan, the Japanese car maker and Mercedes-Benz, the German car and
commercial vehicle producer. Its biggest gains have come from new contracts
won from Chrysler, however, to which its sales jumped by 34 per cent last
year due to growing orders for ABS braking and safety restraints systems.
While AlliedSignal's total automotive turnover was virtually unchanged last
year, it increased its net profits by 30 per cent to Dollars 184m from
Dollars 142m a year earlier and Dollars 54m in 1991 (excluding special
charges) as a result of improved productivity and a reduction in materials
costs.
To improve its operating efficiencies the group began two years ago to
rationalise the number of its locations worldwide and by the end of 1993 it
had closed 20 operating plants. In 1992 alone it reduced the automotive
workforce by 7 per cent including a 50 per cent reduction in Brazil, where
it has suffered continuing losses.
At the same time the group is expanding its presence worldwide, however,
through a combination of acquisitions and alliances. It has entered into a
worldwide truck brake joint venture with Knorr-Bremse of Germany. The
combined operation has annual sales of Dollars 650m and a workforce of
4,600. AlliedSignal owns 65 per cent and has management control of the North
American operations including Mexico, while the German group owns 65 per
cent and has taken management control of the joint venture operations in
Europe and South America.
In other moves AlliedSignal has formed an airbag joint venture in Europe,
initially to supply Opel and Fiat with a new form of hybrid airbag inflator,
it has acquired an aftermarket distribution network in Mexico, has opened a
seatbelt plant in Spain and has established an airbag marketing and
engineering staff in Japan. Earlier this year it acquired the seat belt
business of Gilardini, the Italian components group.
The group is also restructuring to meet the growing demand from auto makers
to provide complete systems rather than simply components. 'This is a trend
that has been talked about for years, but which is only now really taking
shape,' says Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive.
'In the past we saw our role as merely the component supplier, with the
customer responsible for how things fit together. Now we are responsible for
the total system.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (8): Bond with
America's Big Three tightens - The parts business in the US is undergoing a
transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
With the uncompromising courtesy that one might expect from a Japanese
business executive, the head of international purchasing at Toyota came very
close to reading the riot act to the company's US suppliers a few weeks ago.
The official, Koichiro Noguchi, warned representatives of 124 component
makers that Toyota had no plans to extend a commitment to increase purchases
of US-made parts beyond 1996, when the voluntary agreement expires. The main
problem, he said, was the sub-standard quality of their products. Despite
intense political pressures, 'further growth in our US purchasing will
depend on further gains by American suppliers in raising quality', Mr
Noguchi warned.
To a casual observer, such criticism would suggest that little has changed
in the US component industry over the past five years. During a period when
many sectors have made great strides in improving their international
competitiveness, it would appear that the parts business stood still or even
regressed.
Poppycock, say analysts. In fact, the industry is in the throes of a radical
transformation which has already paid off in handsome productivity gains,
drastic price reductions and more reliable products across the board. The
misleading impression given by Toyota only underlines the arm's length
relationship it maintains with the US suppliers, analysts argue.
'If the Japanese car maker let the parts supplier be a full partner,' says
Scott Merlis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, 'the quality would
be fully built into the design. Any subsequent manufacturing problem could
be quickly debugged with the help of the car maker.'
Mr Merlis's observation cuts to the heart of the forces shaping the
component industry. Analysts say a much tighter bond has developed between
the Big Three US car makers and those suppliers that have survived a painful
consolidation. In fact, the closer relationship between the two sides is the
defining feature of the industry's evolution in the 1990s.
As the decade began, Ford and Chrysler were determined to streamline their
supply systems and slash the cost of components. The drive was part of a
strategy to recapture market share from the Japanese.
General Motors got off to a late start in 1992, when Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, then head of worldwide parts purchasing, moved to shake up GM's
supply network with controversial - some might say heavy-handed - tactics.
The most apparent result of these efforts is a drastic shrinkage of the
supplier base. Over the past five years, the number of parts makers under
contract has dropped by about a third to 2,000. By 2000, 20 per cent fewer
suppliers are expected to be under contract with the Big Three.
The main beneficiaries have been big, publicly-traded companies such as
Eaton, Magna International and Hayes Wheels. In a highly fragmented business
still dominated by small, privately held manufacturers, those
well-capitalised suppliers with full research and development capabilities
are expected to command 75 per cent of sales by 2,000, up from 50 per cent
now. 'In most component areas, the industry is going to wind up with two or
three big players, rather than 15,' says James Alexandre, the Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst.
The reason is simple. The Big Three have decided to use fewer suppliers,
often contracting with just one or two companies for any one part or system,
such as suspensions or wheels. With more orders going to a handful of
manufacturers, the lucky few have been able to achieve greater efficiencies
and meet Detroit's demands for price reductions.
Productivity gains have ranged from 2 to 6 per cent a year, while prices
paid by the Big Three are falling 3 to 5 per cent. Detroit has rewarded
suppliers which are able to deliver the goods cheaply with longer-term
contracts. Five-year deals are now common in an industry which once worked
on a year-to-year basis.
The extended time frame has encouraged suppliers to take more risks in
investing in new technology, which in turn has triggered a second shift  -
towards more 'outsourcing'. The Big Three are using fewer parts made
in-house because they lack capital to keep up with the latest innovations.
To cut costs and improve quality, 'the car makers are going to the people
who are the experts', says Mr Alexandre.
Lear Seating, a Michigan-based company with Dollars 2bn in annual sales,
highlights the trend. Its business has snowballed, as it became the sole
source of Ford's seats, winning big supply deals with Chrysler, GM, BMW and
other European producers along the way. In the case of Ford, the car maker
in effect spurred consolidation while outsourcing its needs by agreeing last
November to sell its own seat-manufacturing operation to Lear for Dollars
170m.
The confluence of these forces should result in robust growth for the
so-called Tier 1 suppliers in the coming years, even if car sales tamper off
from their recent acceleration. Kemper Securities expects US vehicle sales
to jump 9 per cent this year and a solid 6 per cent in 1995. However,
revenues and earnings for the principal component makers are expected to
outstrip those levels.
Mr Merlis forecasts Lear's top-line growth at 40 per cent. For Eaton, a big,
diversified group specialising in vehicle power-trains, a 25 per cent jump
in 1994 revenues to Dollars 5.5bn is projected by the Value Line investment
survey, following a 12 per cent advance the previous year.
Meanwhile, Kemper Securities picks Automotive Industries, Dana, Simpson and
Superior Industries as this year's high-flyers. Those companies are expected
to realise strong gains in market share by acquiring rivals and winning more
contracts.
By turning more frequently to such companies, the Big Three have in effect
allowed themselves to grow more dependent on their suppliers. The component
makers are increasingly called on to deliver whole systems ready to be
snapped into the car during assembly, which helps lower costs. The
requirement, however, has forced the supplier to assume a role in the design
process, rather than just bidding on a blueprint. Later, it must take a more
active role in the assembly process, rather than simply delivering
consignments to the factory gate.
'Improved quality is a by-product of this alliance, as parts can be more
accurately designed on a product-specific basis with manufacturing
requirements in mind,' writes Kemper in a recent investment advisory. That
is not to say that US suppliers have achieved parity with their Japanese
counterparts, though there are exceptions. Magna International, Canada's
biggest parts company, is singled out by analysts as a producer of
first-rate parts.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (9): 'De luxe' looks east - The luxury
goods market is recovering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Louis Vuitton luggage shop on Avenue Montaigne is almost always crammed
with Japanese tourists gleefully snapping up the brown bags bearing its
famous LV initials that are so sought after - and so much more expensive
back in Tokyo or Osaka.
Yet some Vuitton souvenir shoppers have been disappointed this spring and
summer. Customers hoping to buy three or four bags to take home have been
told that they could buy two at the most.
The 'rationing' at Louis Vuitton harks back to the frenetic era of the
mid-1980s when Chanel, another famous name in French luxury, was forced to
restrict the tourists flocking into its flagship store on rue Cambon to no
more than one of its classic quilted leather bags. (Some of Chanel's more
determined Japanese customers were later caught hovering outside the shop,
trying to bribe passing Parisians into buying more bags for them.)
The luxury market is still not as buoyant as it was in the mid-1980s, but it
does seem to have recovered from its doldrums in the early 1990s.
Louis Vuitton is not the only company to have experienced a sudden surge of
demand. LVMH, which owns Christian Dior cosmetics and Christian Lacroix
couture as well as Vuitton, recently forecast profits growth of at least 20
per cent for 1994. Hermes, another famous French leather house, and Chanel
have both experienced double digit sales growth so far this year.
These positive reports augur well not only for the companies themselves but
for the rest of the French economy. The luxury business, which encompasses
everything from expensive scents to designer clothes and fine cognac, is one
of the country's largest industries and an important source of exports.
France is not only the dominant force in the global luxury trade, but the
cachet of Cartier jewellery and Hermes handbags has a positive effect on
perceptions of almost every other area of French industry.
Some French firms have astutely exploited this. L'Oreal has established
itself as the world's leading cosmetics company by emphasising its 'Made in
France' appeal. Even Thomson, the giant electronics group, sees the
reflected glory of French style as a key tactical advantage in its plans to
relaunch its consumer electronics range across Europe.
Just as the downturn in the luxury market was one of the catalysts for
France's descent into recession, the upturn has come at a critical time when
the economy is teetering towards recovery. Yet the luxury industry is not
yet out of the doldrums. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, says that some
markets, notably the US and UK, have are already out of recession, but that
others, such as Germany and Japan, are still fragile.
The erratic picture in these established markets is countered by the
emergence of dynamic new sources of sales. Eastern Europe is one area of
growth, although still in a fledgling state. But the most promising future
markets are the emerging Asian economies of Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong
and even China.
The French luxury houses are now busily extending their operations into
these countries. Cartier has opened a shop in Shanghai. LVMH has already set
up a Christian Dior boutique in Moscow and is now planning to open a Vuitton
shop in the city. So far these ventures are at an experimental stage, but
the industry sees them as a vital investment if its new markets are to
provide the same stimulus for luxury goods sales in the late 1990s as Japan
did for much of the 1980s.
Yet the current crop of luxury consumers are different from their
predecessors. The industry's new Asian customers are showing signs of being
more price conscious than the self-indulgent Japanese. At the same time its
established consumers in the West have become more discerning about quality
and craftsmanship than their status-obsessed predecessors in the 1980s.
This means that the industry has had to become even more rigorous about
quality control and has had to invest heavily in improving standards of
service - particularly after-sales. 'It is impossible to under-emphasise how
important after-sales service has has become,' says Alain-Dominique Perrin,
chairman of Cartier. 'It's as important for the brand's reputation as
advertising.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (10): Latecomer to the party - John Ridding
notes that trade with Asia has become important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<TEXT>
Free trade and France are not always mentioned in the same breath. But while
successive French governments have often betrayed protectionist instincts,
the corporate sector has been busily extending its tentacles into foreign
markets.
Last year, the growth in overseas trade and investment was slowed by the
impact of recession, the financial burden facing French industry and the
effects of currency depreciations in Italy, Spain and Britain. But the
competitive edge of French industry in international markets remained sharp.
Exports declined by just 5 per cent to FFr1,180bn, contributing (along with
depressed imports) to a record trade surplus of FFr87.3bn.
Such a performance will be hard to match, particularly as imports revive
along with the French economy. But Insee, the national statistics office,
claims a strong increase in foreign orders for French industrial goods in
the first six months of 1994, and predicts another substantial surplus for
the full year.
The pattern of trade has remained relatively stable. Germany, France's
principal economic partner, continues to account for about 17 per cent of
total French exports. Italy, the UK, Belgium each account for between 9 per
cent and 11 per cent of shipments from France. In search of more rapid
growth, however, and in an attempt to increase an historic weakness, the
French government and much of the corporate sector are setting their sights
to the east.
'More than at any time in our history, Asia represents a vital part of our
future,' says Mr Gerard Longuet, minister for trade and industry. Citing
demographic projections, which suggest that by the year 2010 the Asia
Pacific region will have a population more than 11 times greater than the 12
current members of the European Union, and pointing to the rapid economic
growth rates of east Asian economies, the French industry ministry has
launched a policy of encouraging trade and investment with the region.
There is much work to do. 'The role of France in the Asia-Pacific region
remains too small,' admits Mr Longuet. With the exception of Vietnam, a
former French colony, exports from France account for between 1 per cent and
4 per cent of the total shipments to Asian economies - much less than the US
and Japan, and, in most cases, behind Germany, Italy and the UK.
The objective, says Mr Longuet, to be supported by increased trade credits,
funding for commercial fairs and other measures, is to raise the proportion
of French exports to Asian economies to 10 per cent within the next five
years.
In urging a greater emphasis on the Asian region, Mr Longuet is often
preaching to the converted. Many French industrial groups are already
targetting Asia for both increased trade and investment projects. The award
of a Dollars 2.2bn high speed railway contract in South Korea to
GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, Lafarge Coppee's joint venture
project in China for the production of cement, and BSN's acquisition of a
New Zealand food group, are just some of the most recent examples.
Peugeot-Citroen, the vehicle group, was one of the earliest investors in the
sector in China, while France's powerful utility groups, Generale des Eaux
and Lyonnaise des Eaux, have been busily responding to demand for
infrastructural projects, from water treatment to highways.
Mr Franck Riboud, director for corporate development at Danone, formerly
BSN, expresses a common sentiment in describing the company's expansion
plans for the region. 'There is much greater potential for growth in Asia
than there is in Europe,' he says. 'In Indonesia, for example, there is a
population of almost 200m people and a birth rate of about 4 per cent per
year. That means an increase equivalent to the population of some European
countries.'
Financial companies are also at the forefront of the Asian assault. AXA, the
insurance group, last month became the first French company to receive a
green light to set up a life assurance business in Japan and promptly
announced plans to invest Dollars 200m over the next seven years to develop
its business there. The recently privatised Union des Assurances de Paris
has also set its sights on the Japanese market.
In most cases, however, the push towards Asia remains at an early stage. 'We
are late-comers to the party and it is a long and difficult process to
establish a presence in these markets,' says the finance director of one
manufacturing company. 'It is not like doing deals in our traditional
markets. Acquisitions are often impossible, and there are often restrictive
regulations with which you have to contend.'
For him, as for many industrialists, the largest industrial investments will
continue to be made in Europe and the US. Elf Aquitaine's participation in
the Leuna oil refinery in eastern Germany, the largest foreign investment in
the region, is one example. Another is provided by its pharmaceuticals
subsidiary, Sanofi, which last month bought the prescription drugs business
of Kodak of the US.
'No one questions that Asia is an area of rapid trade and investment growth
for French industry,' says one French merchant banker involved in mergers
and acquisitions. 'But the growth will come from a very low base. In my
view, the lion's share of corporate activity and of most trade will be done
with traditional partners for the foreseeable future.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (8): Scope for plenty more - Foreign
investment has held up well in a difficult EU climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a home for foreign investment, France has remained relatively attractive
in a European business climate that has depressed the 'animal spirits' of
most investors.
According to Mr Jean-Daniel Tordjman, the economy ministry's roving
ambassador whose job is to woo inward investment, direct foreign investment
flowing into France fell from FFr86bn in 1992 to FFr61bn last year. Using
adjusted US Commerce Department figures, Mr Tordjman puts the actual stock
of foreign investment in France at just over Dollars 130bn.
Two years ago, France and Britain were the two countries which attracted the
highest level of new direct investment and reinvested profits. This pecking
order changed in 1993 as investment in China surged ahead and interest in
the US recovered.
But France is now at least matching Britain, in outward as well as inward
investment. According to the economy ministry, French companies invested
FFr65bn abroad last year. This is well down from the FFr100bn invested
abroad in 1992 and only half the FFr126bn annual average in 1989-91. But the
ministry estimates that this will still put France in second place behind
the US and equal to Britain.
The Balladur government's privatisation programme has provided new
opportunities for portfolio investors in French equities. Mr Tordjman's main
target has been the US pension funds. In theory, non-European investors can
only collectively buy up to 20 per cent of the privatised stock; but as Mr
Tordjman points out, this rule only applies to the primary issue, and
non-Europeans can buy what they like in secondary trading.
A bigger problem, Mr Tordjman says, is that 'many French companies are not
used to working with pension funds, especially American ones which are
extremely demanding for information.'
France can offer a mix of human and physical advantages to the would-be
investor. It remains a relatively low-cost economy - and not only because
nuclear power gives it Europe's cheapest electricity and France Telecom is
at last bringing down the cost of international phone calls. Its strong
currency policy has pushed inflation to well below the European average,
while the very fact of high unemployment - the big black spot on the French
economy - has deterred strikes in the private (though not the public)
sector.
It is probably the combination of lower labour costs than northern
continental European countries, and a workforce and physical infrastructure
technically superior to most of its neighbours, which most attracts
companies to France.
Admittedly, one company, Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, did not have
far to come when it recently decided to establish its FFr1bn bio-technology
research centre at Huningue, near Mulhouse and just over the border from its
Basle headquarters. In Basle, Ciba was faced with strong objections by Swiss
environmentalists to bio-technology research being carried out there. It has
sidestepped them by moving the project into France, where it believes it can
employ equally good scientists cheaper.
Further north is the example of US Robotics, the Illinois-based maker of
data communications equipment. 'We entered France in 1991 by accident,' says
Mr John McCartney, its executive vice president in Paris, 'when we bought a
company in the US which happened to have four salesmen in Lille. But we have
stayed and expanded our operation there to 36 people, because of the
excellent logistics in the north, the new links with the TGV and proximity
to major highways.'
Last year US Robotics expanded its French operation by buying PNB, a
suburban Paris assembler of modem, software and network systems. 'France is
attractive to us because of its high-quality engineering work force, and
because its relatively sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure makes
it a market where we can test and develop products for it on the spot,' says
Mr McCartney. Differing trans-Atlantic standards make it impractical to do
this testing and development work back in the US, he says. 'Some companies
are going to the ex-Soviet Union to find good engineers cheap, but the
telephone system is so bad there that the products can't be tested.'
In some of France's science parks, such as Sophia-Antipolis to the north
west of Nice, telecommunications has become the leading speciality. Indeed,
several companies and institutes based there - AT&amp;T, Aerospatiale, Ascom of
Switzerland, British Telecom, Digital Equipment, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute, France Telecom, IBM and Texas
Instruments - have formed the 'Telecom Valley' association to promote
telecommunications expertise in the Nice-Cannes region.
Sophia-Antipolis, one of the oldest and most successful of French science
parks, is reaching saturation point on its present 2,300 hectare site, says
Mr Gerard Passera, its manager, and plans to start extending on to to
another site of similar size in the late 1990s. At present it is home to
about 1,000 companies - a tenth of them foreign-owned - providing some
16,000 jobs.
There is constant turnover, says Mr Passera, but the balance is positive,
with some 150 companies arriving or being created each year and about 100
companies leaving or being liquidated. 'The ones who survive tend to have
established a solid high-tech research niche for themselves, with some
limited production in, for instance, the pharmaceutical field,' he says,
adding that attempts to provide services from Sophia-Antipolis have proved
less successful.
Sophia-Antipolis is even more closely integrated with its local university
than other science parks or technopoles because it was set up at the same
time as the relatively new university of Nice. As a result, many Nice
university science students do their final year of study at
Sophia-Antipolis, while the CERAM management centre also relies heavily on
the technopole's facilities and expertise. Many of Sophia-Antipolis'
training institutes now have a strong international flavour, and use English
as their main working language.
Foreign investment is perhaps more surprising in food and tourism, areas
which, in contrast to computing and biotechnology, are areas of traditional
French strength. But Mr Tordjman believes there is scope for further
culinary and leisure investments.
Ice cream, for example, a classic industrial food product, is still rather
expensive in France - a fact which Mr Tordjman believes might incite other
companies to follow Grand Metropolitan into the market; the UK group
recently bought Haagen-Dazs and is building a new factory near Arras.
Another classic industrial food product is frites, which McCain of Canada is
now making in great quantities in France out of 200,000 tonnes of French
potatoes a year.
'People have been obsessed by Euro Disney's problems,' says Mr Tordjman.
'But there are still, quite rightly, many plans for other attraction or
theme parks in France, because we have 60m tourists and a total of FFr130bn
in tourist revenue a year.' He sees the potential for more theme parks in
France, as well as more three star hotels.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (7): Re-emerging
market force - Profile of Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the next few weeks Lucas Industries, the automotive components and
aerospace group which with nearly 40,000 employees world-wide is one of the
UK's largest companies, will start coming out of its self-imposed purdah.
George Simpson, former chairman of the Rover vehicles group, took over as
Lucas's chief executive in April. He is already putting the final touches to
a management restructuring and by autumn will have undertaken a complete
review of Lucas's activities and strategies.
It will largely determine Lucas's prospects of remaining a substantial
long-term participant in a world motor components sector becoming ever more
viciously competitive. It is also one in which many western manufacturers
have shown considerable capacity for self-delusion in terms of their
productivity and quality achievements compared with rivals from Japan.
As John Neill, chief executive of the Unipart components group, pointed out
at last month's launch of Cardiff Business School's 'lean' enterprise
research centre, the UK government's recent white paper on UK industrial
competitiveness highlighted an average performance deficiency compared even
with other western competition.
What was particularly worrying, said Mr Neill, was that 'only 2 per cent of
UK companies were found to be world class - but 73 per cent thought they
were'.
Relatively few in the UK motor industry have been better placed than Mr
Simpson to see a 'world class' Japanese company in action, as a result of
his long involvement with the 14-year partnership between Rover and Honda.
Mr Simpson is widely credited with the transformation of Rover from a minor
lame duck car maker to a still minor producer, but one with enough restored
prestige for BMW to have been willing to pay Pounds 800m plus debt
assumptions for it.
So, much as Lucas has improved its own motor components productivity and
quality over recent years, it is only to be expected that institutional and
other backers are looking to Mr Simpson to give substantial new impetus to
Lucas.
Mr Simpson's own appointment at Lucas marks a sharp break with the past. For
nearly a decade Sir Anthony Gill had combined the posts of chairman and
chief executive. When Sir Anthony goes in November, Mr Simpson will be
working with a non-executive chairman, Sir Brian Pearse, who recently
retired as chief executive of Midland Bank.
By any measure, Lucas is one of the leading companies on the world
components scene. It supplies virtually every principal vehicle maker
throughout the world with a wide variety of key components and systems.
It is a leading source of engine management and injector systems for petrol
and diesel engines. It is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of
braking systems. It produces many electrical and electronic systems, ranging
from wiring harnesses to electronic control units (ECUs).
The automotive activities, including supplies to the aftermarket, are the
group's most important, accounting for more than 60 per cent of total sales.
There is no lack of apparent confidence at the company, even if it is not
yet Mr Simpson who is expressing it.
Earlier this year senior managers were declaring the view that higher
productivity and rationalisation benefits, coupled with substantial
cost-cutting under a restructuring programme begun in 1992, are opening the
way towards sustainable 10 per cent margins - higher even than at the peak
of the eight-year motor industry boom of the 1980s.
It is a confidence yet to be reflected in Lucas's overall profitability.
Lucas Industries made a pre-tax profit of only Pounds 20.1m on sales of
Pounds 1.19bn in the first half of its financial year to the end of January.
Within this total, however, the automotive business's operating profit
increased from Pounds 13m to Pounds 27m on sales of Pounds 830m and Sir
Anthony insists that this will continue to rise sharply when firm recovery
sets into continental Europe's vehicle markets.
Restructuring and cost-cutting activities have been substantial. More than
Pounds 75m has been raised from divesting non-core businesses and further
disposals are in prospect. Some Pounds 60m costs were reduced last year,
with 4,860 jobs lost.
At the same time, Lucas has not been reluctant to make investments in areas
which it believes will provide substantial long-term growth opportunities,
particularly Asia and Eastern Europe.
A venture to manufacture brakes in China is in prospect, for example, while
in the Czech Republic it has formed a joint venture with Autobrzdy to supply
Volkswagen-controlled car maker Skoda with rear axle assemblies.
Lucas is also active in India, which is starting to attract serious
attention from the world's car and components makers as it grows under the
Indian government's industrial liberalisation plans.
It has a long-standing venture with TVS, one of India's 20 biggest
industrial conglomerates, originally to produce generators for Hindustan
Motors' Ambassador cars but now also embracing production for Maruti
Suzuki-based small cars.
Nor has the UK and elsewhere in western Europe been neglected.
Some 650 jobs are to be created over the next 18 months in England's Tyne
and Wear region by Lucas SEI Wiring Systems, a joint venture with Sumitomo
Electric Industries of Japan, which is constructing a plant to make wiring
harnesses for Honda, Rover, Toyota and Jaguar. Production is expected to
start early next year after an investment of Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m.
At Bouzonville in northern France, nearly Pounds 30m is being invested in
completely overhauling the plant and processes for brake caliper
manufacture, creating an integrated manufacturing system claimed to be
'world class' measured by Lucas's benchmarking programmes.
Earlier investments in North America and in the rapidly-growing diesel
vehicle sector have also begun to pay off. Some Pounds 150m spent on
expanding capacity to produce diesel injectors and management systems for
trucks as well as cars has allowed Lucas to increase its European market
share in the sector.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (6): Global purchasing
takes off - Kevin Done discusses Ford's drive to reform relations with
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bold move by Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker,
to merge its North American and European automotive operations into a single
operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations, will give fresh impetus to its
drive to reform relations with its components suppliers.
Ford has embarked on the most drastic restructuring of its organisation in
its 91-year history in a radical attempt to break down the traditional
national and regional barriers inside the group in order to regain a
competitive edge over its closest rivals.
From January 1 next year it is setting up five so-called vehicle centres,
one in Europe and four in the US. Each centre will have worldwide
responsibility for the design, development and engineering of particular
vehicle ranges - in the case of Europe for small and medium-sized cars.
This radical shake-up of the Ford organisation will have a crucial impact on
the purchasing of components and systems from outside suppliers, which
typically in the world auto industry account for more than half of a car's
ex-factory value.
Ford maintains that the development of a global components supply activity
will provide 'economies of scale, world-class supplier productivity and cost
levels, improved quality, faster time to market, better product innovation
and enhanced supplier design involvement and support'. It will also mean
that it will be able to choose the best products to be offered worldwide in
any particular category. Under the new structure purchasing will be one of
the functions subordinated to each vehicle centre, and it will operate
globally.
Crucially it has been the CDW-27 project, Ford's first successful so-called
world car programme, that has broken much new ground in preparing the way
for the global reorganisation, and which in the process has brought Ford for
the first time fully into the era of global purchasing of components and
systems.
The Dollars 6bn project spawned first the Ford Mondeo large family car in
Europe in spring last year, while its sister cars, the Ford Contour and the
Mercury Mystique, will go on sale in Ford's showrooms across North America
in the autumn. Assembly will take place at Ford plants at Genk, Belgium, at
Kansas City in the US and at Cuautitlan, Mexico.
After a global search, common component producers have been chosen in many
cases to supply the European and the US and Mexican assembly plants.
Albert Caspers, the new chairman of Ford of Europe, says that the share
taken by north American suppliers of the European-built Mondeo has jumped to
15 per cent from only 1 per cent to 2 per cent in Ford of Europe's
traditional programmes. 'We have also brought many European suppliers to
North America and some have made joint ventures in the US,' he says. 'The
philosophy was to develop a part only once from one supplier for the world.
This is the first project where we have done this.'
As a result of the effort to develop an integrated, global supply base there
has been a drastic reduction in the total number of suppliers. The
soon-to-be-replaced US-built Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz range has more than
700 suppliers - all in North America - whereas the successor Ford
Contour/Mercury Mystique models will have only 227 suppliers, drawn from
around the world.
According to Kerry Caliman, the CDW-27 project manager for purchasing for
Ford's North American automotive operations, 'the more business you can
source globally, using the same supplier for the same part for both North
America and Europe, the more you'll benefit from economies of scale and
focused quality control efforts.' Ford is planning sales volumes for the
CDW-27 product range of around 300,000 a year in North America, 400,000 a
year in Europe and a total of around 800,000 a year worldwide.
Mr Caliman says that another cost advantage lies in placing long-term
contracts with suppliers and in single sourcing. 'That gives us the
opportunity for quality advantages and productivity cost reductions from
these suppliers - and that has bottom-line impact.'
Around 65 per cent of the total CDW-27 vehicle costs are covered by parts
that are either:
Single-sourced from one supplier shipping from one location in the world to
all three assembly plants;
Single-sourced from a single company, but the company has manufacturing or
shipping locations in both North America and Europe; or are
Dual-sourced, so that Europe and North America each has its supplier, but
the part can be common and there are two sets of tools.
As part of the reforms Eckhard Jokisch, vice-president of supply at Ford of
Europe, says that Ford 'must sweep away the old adversarial relationships
between supplier and manufacturer replacing them with one based on trust and
equal partnership.' He claims that Ford 'is now working with rather than
against suppliers,' which have proved 'a very useful weapon in our fight
against unnecessary waste'.
During the past 18 months Ford of Europe and its suppliers have set up more
than 200 teams, made up equally of Ford and supplier personnel, aimed at
cutting costs and waste at Ford itself and at the suppliers.
The teams select components for analysis and are empowered to take cost
reduction actions bypassing Ford's 'traditionally slow systems,' says Mr
Jokisch. The teams analyse the complete supply chain from design and
development through testing and manufacture right up to assembly into the
finished vehicle.
'We believe that if we apply this analysis to all commodities, we can cut
material costs by 25 per cent,' says Mr Jokisch. The cost savings can be
achieved not by cutting supplier profit margins, he insists, but 'by
eliminating the waste that exists in the supply chain'.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (5): A mark of respect
for German supplier - Profile of Robert Bosch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR WAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German-based Robert Bosch topped the list of automotive component suppliers
in the recent Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey on Europe's most
respected companies. It was second overall in the Automobiles/Auto Trucks
and Parts category, headed only by its compatriot BMW.
Perhaps this recognition for excellence among its competitors provides some
consolation for recent trading conditions which, by any standards, have been
exceedingly tough. They could hardly have been otherwise in the context of
sharp declines in European vehicle production.
In the company's all-important German market, for example, car production
fell by 23 per cent in 1993 and commercial vehicle output by 28 per cent.
Latest financial results highlight the damage caused, with total group
turnover in 1993 falling by 5.7 per cent to DM32.5bn. Net income was down
for the fourth consecutive year and, at DM426m, showed a decline of 16.8 per
cent compared with the previous year and stood at its lowest level since
1985.
Capping the gloom, the company incurred an operating loss for the year,
although the figure has not been revealed.
Although Bosch manufactures a wide range of consumer and industrial
products, automotive equipment is easily the largest business sector,
accounting for 49.7 per cent (DM16.2bn) of group sales in 1993.
This makes the company the world's largest independent supplier of
automotive components and systems, and Bosch technology can be found on the
products of every leading vehicle producer.
There are nine main automotive divisions producing a wide range of
components and systems. Many fall into the category of traditional items
such as starters, alternators, sparking plugs, head lamps and windscreen
washers. But Bosch has also established a reputation for producing
technically advanced products for vehicle safety, security, performance,
comfort and fuel efficiency. With regard to safety, the company was the
first to produce ABS (anti-lock braking systems), traction control and
triggering devices for occupant restraint systems for the motor industry.
On the security front, Bosch is supplying factory-fitted electronic
immobilisers to prevent unauthorised starting - a feature which is expected
to become standard equipment on cars in the near future.
Meanwhile, the unique Blaupunkt 'KeyCard' solution to car theft from Bosch's
audio division has produced impressive results. KeyCard-equipped radios
account for 5 per cent of the German market, but for just 0.4 per cent of
the units stolen.
Improvements to vehicle economy and performance are achieved through diesel
and petrol fuel injection, transistorised ignition, engine management
systems and electronic gearbox controls.
The company is also in the forefront of developing systems to promote
cleaner emissions.
Although the company has an extensive international presence with
subsidiaries, affiliates or agencies in 125 countries and more than 70
foreign-based production facilities, 51 per cent of sales are made in
Germany and around 85 per cent in Europe. Of the remainder, the Americas
account for 12 per cent, which means that exposure to the fast developing
south-east Asia motor industry is as yet limited.
One of the most successful foreign ventures is the UK manufacturing
facility, located near Cardiff, where compact alternators are manufactured.
The plant was opened in 1991 and at the time represented Bosch's largest
single foreign investment.
Cumulative output recently passed the 5m level. As well as supplying UK
vehicle assembly operations there is a sizable export trade to continental
Europe, America and Japan - sufficient to propel Bosch into the Top 100 list
of UK exporters.
There is a high priority on research and development. Of the group's 156,000
employees worldwide, about 12,000 are scientists, engineers and technicians
involved in improving the functionality and reliability of existing products
and developing new ones.
In 1993, Bosch allocated more than DM2.2bn to R &amp; D, the same level as in
the previous year and equal to 6.8 per cent of sales. In the face of falling
turnover, therefore, Bosch has maintained its R &amp; D momentum. Several
examples indicate the type of products which Bosch will supply for
tomorrow's vehicles.
In headlights, the company has developed a system which uses cherry
stone-sized gas discharge lamps to produce twice the amount of light of
conventional units together with improved range and width of illumination.
An electrical fuel pump has been developed which is 45 per cent lighter and
30 per cent smaller than previous designs.
And an electronic wiper system is under development which will eliminate the
need for the driver to operate windscreen wipers manually.
Early in 1994, Bosch announced details of its latest ABS which contains both
the hydraulic and electronic components in a single assembly. As well as
being more compact and weighing less - crucial characteristics as vehicle
makers attempt to make their products more fuel efficient - the new system
also offers significant cost savings and will hasten the day when ABS is a
standard fixture.
The company differs from global competitors insofar as about 92 per cent of
its equity is owned by the Robert Bosch Foundation, which is charged with
ensuring that the company's assets are administered for public benefit
purposes. This means that the dividends received are donated to charitable
causes.
While this status does not mean, of course, that there is no pressure to
secure satisfactory financial returns, the company undoubtedly enjoys the
luxury of not having to satisfy an outside group of hungry investors on a
quarterly or half yearly basis, as is the case with the principal American
and British component groups.
This has provided the necessary conditions to focus on long-term targets -
notably in R &amp; D - an especially valuable characteristic during the recent
downturn.
Perhaps this freedom is Bosch's greatest asset.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (5): Not everyone can be a star - The next
round of privatisations may be trickier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's privatisation programme is nothing if not ambitious.
The four public sector groups already dispatched to the private sector and
the 17 slated for sale over the next few years should bring more than
FFr250bn to the state coffers - far beyond the anticipated receipts from
other European privatisation plans.
More significantly, the transfer of some of the country's most powerful
financial and industrial groups, such as Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and
UAP, France's largest insurer, should prompt a profound shift in the
traditionally tight relationship between business and government.
This is part of the government's incentive. 'We should not be in the
business of making cars,' says Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister,
referring to his determination to privatise Renault. At least as important,
however, are budgetary considerations. With the government's budget deficit
targetted at FFr300bn this year, receipts from privatisation are necessary
to curb pressures on the public purse.
So far, the auction of the state's assets and the harvesting of receipts has
progressed relatively smoothly. Elf, UAP, and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals
and pharmaceuticals group, have been sold since the hammer fell on Banque
Nationale de Paris, the administration's first privatisation, in the autumn
of last year. Demand from the French public and international investors,
combined with a strategic pricing, has seen over-subsription rates of
between two and four times for the various issues.
But the easy part may now be drawing to an end. The sale of the state's
silverware always looked likely to become trickier as the auction
progressed. One-quarter of the way down the privatisation list, it is
proving to be so.
Part of the problem lies in the stock market conditions. The Paris bourse
has lost more than 15 per cent of its value since its peak in February, as
bond yields have surged higher. Most analysts expect some recovery in the
second half of the year, but with most privatisation issues trading at or
below their issue price, investors are adopting a more sanguine approach.
'There is still interest, particularly in the better-known companies,' says
one analyst at a Paris brokerage. 'But there is also an awareness that there
is little prospect of a quick profit.'
But the increasing complexity of the privatisation programme also reflects
the candidates themselves. The first four companies to be sold were, by and
large, stars of the public sector. All were profitable, with dominant
positions in their respective markets and reasonable expansion prospects.
The same cannot be said for many of the companies lower down the list.
Groupe Bull, for example, the computer group which is currently in the
process of privatisation, has suffered losses of more than FFr15bn over the
past three years. Pechiney, a victim of the depressed international
aluminium market, reported a loss of FFr980m for last year.
Air France, towards the bottom of the list, is fighting for survival after a
deficit of FFr8.48bn in 1993, while Credit Lyonnais, one of the country's
largest banking groups, will need to reverse a comparable loss before it can
be sold to private investors.
The complications are not just financial. Renault, one of Europe's most
profitable car manufacturers, is faced with political obstacles to
privatisation. The sensitivity of its sale, which springs from its historic
role as a stronghold of trade unions and a spearhead of public sector
industry, has combined with the collapse of its planned merger with Volvo of
Sweden, to cloud its privatisation timetable with uncertainty. The
government is considering a partial privatisation by the end of this year.
In many cases, privatisation also depends on the implementation of
restructuring measures. At Pechiney, the industry ministry has sought to
merge the aluminium group with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, a low-cost
hydro-electricity producer, to render the company more attractive for sale.
At Groupe Bull, industry partners, such as NEC of Japan or IBM of the US,
need to be enticed to take or increase existing shareholdings to facilitate
the computer group's shift to the private sector.
Despite these various obstacles, the government of Mr Edouard Balladur has
little cause to be alarmed. The successful sale of Elf and UAP this year
means that the target of FFr55bn in receipts for this year has already been
met - even without the estimated FFr15bn predicted from the sale of
Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group which is next on the
sell-off list. As a result, the government can afford to take its time in
pushing the rest of its assets to market.
Mr Balladur's economic officials can also take comfort from the level of
international interest in the issues so far. Each issue has drawn strong
demand from foreign institutional investors, seeking to take a share of
French blue chip companies. 'We have seen a healthy appetite for French
issues,' says one US fund manager. 'Many of our clients want to increase the
weighting of European and French stocks in their portfolios and the
privatisation is a good opportunity.' He notes, however, that the scaling
down of share allocations to foreign institutions, resulting from clawback
options for French individual investors, had caused some irritation.
Industrial investors have also sought to acquire stakes, often as part of
the so-called noyau dur of long-term stable investors. BAT Industries of the
UK, for example, took a 0.5 per cent stake in BNP, in a move which most
analysts see as a precursor to a more significant role by the British group
in the privatisation of Seita, the French tobacco monopoly.
The creation of a noyau dur for BNP, as for the rest of the privatisation
issues, reflects the French government's strategy of easing its industrial
assets into the private sector. The group of hard-core investors provide a
measure of protection from predators and a degree of stability during the
departure from state control.
'They are designed to create the minimum of security that is necessary,'
says one economic official. 'The state cannot just abandon its companies to
the private sector.'
Maybe not. But if Mr Balladur can complete his privatisation targets, then
the French state will be left with a much smaller public sector to feel
protective about.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (7): Musical chairs - Privatisation's mixed
blessings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the captains of French public sector industry, privatisation can be a
mixed blessing. While most are anxious to see their businesses transferred
to the private sector, many run the risk of losing their jobs in the
process.
Mr Edouard Balladur ruled out a wholesale reshuffle in public sector
boardrooms when he became prime minister in March 1993, pledging to avoid
the witch hunt which has often accompanied changes of administration. But in
practice his case by case approach has wrought some significant changes.
Of the four companies privatised so far - Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group and
France's largest industrial concern, Banque Nationale de Paris, one of
France's biggest banks, Union des Assurances de Paris, the biggest insurer
and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group - it is only the
latter which has kept its chairman through the privatisation process.
Significant changes have also taken place at the next two groups preparing
for auction. Assurances Generales de France and Groupe Bull, the computer
manufacturer, have both been given new bosses to prepare them for sale. GAN,
the insurance group, and Credit Lyonnais, the bank, are among the companies
further down the schedule who have seen their chairmen replaced.
Motives for the musical chairs in the private sector vary. Critics point to
political motivations, designed to place allies of the centre-right
government into positions of enduring financial or industrial authority.
Hence the decision to give the top job at UAP to Mr Jacques Friedmann, a
confidante of both prime minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac,
head of the gaullist RPR party. The appointment of Mr Philippe Jaffre to
head Elf, in place of Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, also partly reflects the
latter's connections to the previous Socialist government.
The significance of the appointments is increased by the extensive network
of shareholdings between French industrial and financial groups. Thus UAP,
one of France's largest institutional investors holds stakes in leading
French companies, including Elf and BNP.
But political incentives should not be exaggerated. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who
has taken the reins at Credit Lyonnais, earned Socialist credentials while
adviser to the government of Mr Pierre Mauroy in the early 1980s. Mr
Christian Blanc, appointed last year as chairman of Air France, is close to
Mr Michel Rocard, the former leader of France's Socialist Party. Mr Alain
Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the electronics group, has kept his seat through
a succession of conservative and Socialist administrations.
For foreign investors assessing privatisations the reshuffles may seem
surprising; many appointees have no previous experience in the industries
into which they are parachuted.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (6): Intense pressure - The financial
sector faces up to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone flicking through the business sections of the French press over the
past few months could be forgiven for thinking that there was only one
subject on the financial agenda: Credit Lyonnais.
The traumas of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and once the
star of the French public sector, have been nothing if not dramatic,
culminating in its clash with Bernard Tapie, the embattled politician who is
one of its largest personal borrowers. Jean Peyrelevade, who was parachuted
in last autumn as Credit Lyonnais's new chairman, has secured the
government's agreement for a FFr44.9bn rescue package to salvage the bank.
He is now struggling to stabilise its finances in time for its eventual
privatisation.
Yet the Credit Lyonnais crisis is only of a number of important issues now
facing the French financial sector.
The economic recession has imposed intense pressure on all France's banks
and insurers. They now face the challenge of repairing their balance sheets
and returning to recovery as the economic environment improves.
They are also in the throes of change as a result of the government's
privatisation programme. The Balladur administration has already sold off
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP). The
sale later this year of Assurances Generales de France (AGF) means that yet
another force in the financial sector will have been freed from the shackles
of state ownership, thereby heralding significant long term changes in its
structure and culture.
These changes come at a difficult time for the banks and insurers.
The recession has not only posed problems at an operational level -
depressing the demand for banking credit for the first time since the 1940s
and trapping the insurers in a vicious cycle of reduced premium income and
rising claims - but has also burdened them with a steep increase in
provisions.
Both banks and insurers (many of whom have sizable banking subsidiaries)
have been forced to make hefty write-downs on declining property prices and
on the rising number of business failures. Some companies, notably Suez and
Paribas, have also faced falls in the value of their industrial holdings.
The economic outlook is now brighter. There is usually a timelag before such
an uplift affects credit demand, but conditions in the banking market are
already easier. And the insurers are faring better, particularly as they
have been protecting profitability for the past year by raising premiums.
The prospects for provisioning have also improved. Corporate profits have
returned to growth, thereby lessening the pressure on industrial portfolios.
The residential property market is already strengthening and the commercial
sector has at least stopped deteriorating, thereby promising a reduction in
the level of future property provisions.
France's financial groups are now turning their attention to strategic
issues, notably the trend towards alliances between banks and insurers.
These are epitomised by the growing links between BNP and UAP, together with
AGF's recent choice of Societe Generale as its banking partner.
Another concern is the development of the international interests they
assembled in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The banks are concentrating on
Europe, where Mr Peyrelevade is keen to develop Credit Lyonnais's recently
acquired retail banking network. BNP hopes to build on its
cross-shareholding agreement with Germany's Dresdner Bank. The insurers plan
to develop their European activities, but also to follow Axa's lead by
expanding into Asia. Yet the overweening issue for the French financial
sector is the impact of the Balladur government's ambitious privatisations.
The share sales orchestrated by the last centre-right administration in the
mid-1980s had a dramatic effect on banking (by privatising Societe Generale
and Credit Commercial de France) but left insurance almost intact.
That has now changed. By the end of this year only one large bank, Credit
Lyonnais, and one big insurer, Groupe GAN, will remain under state control.
This should end the old ritual whereby the government (directly or
indirectly) influenced the financial sector's investment policy or the
banks' stance on interest rates.
Privatisation also heralds cultural changes for the financial sector. The
banks and insurers argue that, as a result of international regulations and
competitive pressures, they have effectively operated as private sector
companies for some time. But their ability to do so has been inhibited by
historic anomalies such as the government's power to hire and fire their
chairmen.
Those anomalies will be eradicated by their entry into the private sector.
At present France's big banks and insurers are still run by the civil
servants appointed before privatisation. These appointees will eventually be
replaced by professional financiers who will then face the new challenge of
steering French finance into a new era - free, with luck, from
politically-charged crises such as the turmoil at Credit Lyonnais.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (4): Call for drastic
restructure - Kevin Done discusses a report prepared for the European
Commission
</HEADLINE>

The automotive components industry is 'the weak link in the European motor
industry's competitiveness today', according to a controversial report
prepared for the European Commission.
The study claims that the industry must restructure in the 1990s to close an
'alarming' competitive gap with Japan and warns that more than 400,000 jobs
are likely to be shed in the sector by the end of the decade.
The report, which was produced by the Boston Consulting Group*, claims that
'unless drastic action is taken soon, the competitive gap in components
risks widening even further'.
The European Commission has contested the report's drastic conclusions about
prospective job losses, but accepts that the 'restructuring needs in the
supply sector are particularly important'.
In its paper earlier this year to the European Council of Ministers and the
the European Parliament on the European auto industry, the Commission says
that, 'the international pressure on car manufacturers is being transferred
to the EU component manufacturers, triggering substantial structural
change'.
According to the Boston Consulting Group report the EU components industry,
which employed about 940,000 in 1992, and had an annual output worth
Ecu92.7bn (Pounds 72bn), 'will be under even greater pressure in the
future'. It claims the productivity of Japanese vehicle makers is around 30
per cent higher than that of European rivals, but in the components sector
productivity is 2.5 times greater.
Employment in the industry is likely to fall to around 500,000 by 1999 from
just under 1m. More job losses will follow those already announced in the
past two years with several leading European vehicle makers demanding cost
and price reductions of more than 10 per cent a year from suppliers.
If productivity continues to grow by 4 per cent a year as in recent years,
employment in the industry would be reduced by 11 per cent by the end of the
decade. 'However, this level of productivity growth would leave the industry
hopelessly unviable at the end of the period and in danger of collapse,'
maintains the Boston Consulting Group.
'If the European components industry were to reach, in 1999, the level of
productivity of the Japanese industry in 1992, then employment would be
reduced by 54 per cent, implying a 14 per cent per annum improvement.' Even
such a drastic cut in jobs, however, would not guarantee the EC reaching
parity with the Japanese industry, which has lifted productivity by 5-6 per
cent a year in the last decade. The report says the productivity gap must be
at least halved as 'the absolute minimum necessary for the industry to be in
a position to survive after 1999'.
The structure of the European components industry 'is likely to change
radically' with a clear movement to a tiered structure similar to that in
Japan. The present fragmented European industry will be forced to
restructure and concentrate. Vehicle makers are expected to reduce the
number of direct suppliers by around two thirds between 1988 and 1997.
'A concentration of first-tier suppliers to around 500 principal ones in
Europe is probable, with only 2-6 main competitors in the EC for most key
sub-systems.' The number of companies operating as second or third-tier
suppliers may fall by up to a third, warns the study.
The greatest challenge to improve productivity in the industry lies among
the second tier suppliers, which are often small and medium-sized companies,
'where awareness of means to improve competitiveness is least advanced'.
Individual car makers have already taken action to cut the number of their
direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 at present, but
the number is expected to drop
The upheaval now under way most critically in the German motor industry
among both vehicle makers and their components suppliers is central to the
restructuring of the entire European auto industry.
Germany alone accounts for 47 per cent of the production of the EU
independent components industry (excluding production by the vehicle makers
themselves), for 53 per cent of the sector's added value and for 46 per cent
of employment. France accounts for 19 per cent of production, the UK for 12
per cent, Italy for 11 per cent and Spain for 7 per cent.
Concentration of ownership is one of the main structural changes facing the
sector. The process is being driven, says the report, by 'the lack of
competitiveness of many suppliers in an extremely fragmented industry,' and
by changes in vehicle makers' policies towards:
More outsourcing and the transfer of design and development to the supplier
industry;
The sourcing of components to single rather than multiple suppliers;
The purchasing of systems rather than individual components; and
The formation of strategic buying alliances.
As the industry restructures, it will be transformed. There will be fewer
but larger suppliers. They will have a European presence assembling systems
in factories near the car plants, and sub-contracting non-core production to
second and third-tier suppliers. They will enjoy supply contracts for the
life-time of vehicles and will share R &amp; D with the vehicle makers.
From a structure based on confrontation between the vehicle makers and their
suppliers, the motor industry will also have to move 'towards one based on
partnership where profit is shared among the different players in the value
chain'.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (3): Fortunes begin to
improve - European suppliers are building a global presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The recession has left a heavy imprint on the financial performance of
leading European automotive components suppliers, although companies believe
that the industry's fortunes have begun to improve this year.
Some groups such as Valeo of France and T &amp; N of the UK have improved
profitability in the past two years, but few have been spared the painful
task of drastic restructuring to cut costs and improve competitiveness.
Despite the challenge of dealing with widespread losses the front-rank
European automotive components producers are also having to move
aggressively to build a global presence and are expanding into new markets
in particular in Asia and eastern Europe.
For the first time in the post-war period the Bosch group of Germany, the
largest European components producer, suffered a substantial operating loss
of more than DM500m last year. Under intense pressure from a 23 per cent
fall in German vehicle production, its turnover also declined for the first
time since 1967.
Bosch has accepted that its costs, along with those of much of German
industry have been too high. 'Because of global competition we can no longer
cover our costs in some products,' says Hermann Scholl, Bosch chief
executive. 'The situation is being exacerbated by the strong pressure, in
particular from the car makers, to reduce prices significantly every year.'
Structural weaknesses, which had been covered up by the surge in economic
activity triggered by German unification, have been exposed by the
recession, says Mr Scholl, and 'drastic cuts' have had to be made to turn
the company round. The Bosch group eliminated 13,200 jobs last year to
reduce its workforce to 156,600, and Mr Scholl expects the workforce to be
reduced again to 152,500 by 1995.
Magneti Marelli, the leading Italian automotive components producer and a
majority-owned subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, has been loss-making for four
years but plunged to its deepest loss of the period last year of L211bn
(Dollars 132m) from a loss (before minority interests) of L53.3bn a year
earlier.
Michelin of France, the world's largest manufacturer of tyres, was hit by a
net loss of FFr3.67bn (Dollars 625m) last year, under the impact of
depressed European markets and the costs of an ambitious restructuring
programme. Sales fell by 5.3 per cent to FFr63.29bn.
Michelin is seeking to make savings of FFr3.5bn in its operations by 1995
through a package of job cuts and productivity measures.
Elsewhere in the European tyre industry Pirelli, the Italian tyre and cables
group, managed to reduce its net losses last year to L96bn (Dollars 57m),
compared with a loss of L154bn in 1992. Pirelli has suffered three years of
net losses, and more than two years of painful restructuring. In the two
years 1992 and 1993 Pirelli has had to set aside L550bn to pay for
rationalisation, including 10,000 redundancies and the shedding of one of
its three divisions.
Continental, the German tyre maker, avoided red ink last year but its
pre-tax profit was more than halved to DM74m (Dollars 43.5m) in 1993 as a
result of the decline in the world automotive industry. It is responding to
the continuing downward pressure on prices by reducing fixed costs. A
further 2,000 jobs are being cut this year, following a reduction of 4,900
in 1993.
In the UK, BBA suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.8m and is cutting 2,000
jobs as part of a rationalisation programme. It was burdened by
restructuring costs of Pounds 76.8m last year mainly for redundancies and
plant closures. Many of the job cuts are being made in the automotive
components division, where operating profits fell by 43 per cent last year.
By contrast Valeo, the leading French automotive components group, which
specialises in areas such as lighting, clutches, air conditioning, heaters,
radiators and electrical systems, managed to achieve marginal increases in
operating and net income with the latter rising to FFr705m from FFr700m a
year earlier.
Valeo's group turnover also declined by 2 per cent to FFr20.2bn against the
background of deep recession in Europe and recovery in North and South
America.
It is benefiting from its policy of globalisation, it gained market share in
Europe, and has been successful in significantly reducing its debt and its
financial costs with net debt falling to FFr1.16bn by the end of 1993, from
FFr2.15bn a year earlier.
T &amp; N, one of the leading UK automotive components makers, which specialises
in bearings, friction materials, and engine components such as pistons and
piston rings, increased its pre-tax profits last year by 12 per cent to
Pounds 70m helped by cost-cutting and winning increased market share.
Prospects are improving significantly for Europe's components makers this
year, as the recovery from recession becomes more firmly established.
Mr Scholl maintains that Bosch will return to operating profit this year,
and Michelin says that it is also well positioned to return to profit this
year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (2): Demand likely to
accelerate - Forecasts suggest new car sales will rise this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales worldwide are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent this
year, ending three years of falling demand and providing increased orders to
the automotive components supply industry.
Car sales fell last year to a six-year low, but demand is forecast to begin
a sustained period of growth in 1994 rising to record levels throughout the
second half of the 1990s, according to the latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill1,
the London-based automotive analysts.
While worldwide new car sales are forecast to rise by 5.4 per cent this year
to 34.95m units from 33.2m in 1993, in the longer term DRI suggests that
sales could increase by close to 30 per cent to 42.5m in 1999.
Much of this growth will originate outside the traditional car consuming
regions of western Europe, North America and Japan, however, with South
Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe offering the best
growth prospects for the 1990s and beyond.
The short-term recovery is being driven chiefly by the strong rise in demand
in North America.
New car sales in the US and Canada are forecast to increase by 11 per cent
to 10.46m this year.
The latest DRI forecast suggests that the recession in the new car markets
of western Europe and Japan has also bottomed out, and the focus for growth
is expected to switch to these regions next year.
'The relatively prolonged recovery phase in Europe and Japan, plus the
take-off of developing countries particularly in Asia, should set the scene
for a steady improvement towards record levels of global car demand
throughout the mid-1990s,' says the study.
Sales in western Europe are set to rise by 3 per cent or more this year to
11.8m-11.9m, as the region begins to recover from last year's precipitous
decline of 15 per cent, the biggest drop of the post-war period.
The recovery in Europe will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and
Italian markets emerge more firmly from recession, and sales in western
Europe are forecast to rise by between 6 and 7 per cent in each of the three
years from 1995.
The DRI forecast suggests that western European new car sales will finally
equal the previous peak years of 1991/92 in 1996 at around 13.45m. It
expects continuing strong growth for the rest of the decade with new car
sales rising to 15m in 1999.
However, a much less optimistic forecast has recently been issued by the
Economist Intelligence Unit2, which maintains that 'the scope for western
Europe's new car market to achieve growth beyond pre-recession levels in the
next few years is limited'. After recovering to 13.15m in 1996 new car sales
are forecast by the EIU to remain within the range of 13m-13.5m for the rest
of the decade.
While new car sales in Japan are forecast by DRI to rise by 5 per cent next
year - after falling for three years in succession from 1991 to 1993 - the
record level of 5.1m reached in 1990 is unlikely to be exceeded this decade.
The rate of decline in new car sales in Japan is slowing, and DRI forecasts
a marginal rise in the whole of the year to 4.2m.
While the market may be bottoming out this year Japanese domestic car
production is likely to suffer a further fall by around 3 per cent to 8.3m,
a fourth successive annual decline from 9.9m in 1990.
In North America, new car sales and production are rising strongly this
year, but DRI says that the 'economy and car market now appears to be moving
fast towards a cyclical peak in 1994.
'This will be a great year in the light vehicle market (in North America),
but a combination of disappointing replacement demand, rising short-term
interest rates and weakening consumer confidence in an economy, which cannot
retain 1994's momentum, will lead to reduced car volumes in 1995.'
Unlike some of the US vehicle makers, DRI is cautious about growth prospects
for the remainder of the decade in North America.
It forecasts total light vehicle production rising only to 15.25m by 1999
with virtually all the production growth coming in light trucks rather than
in cars.
There is expected to be continuing strong growth in both sales and
production in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan).
New car sales in this region have already grown significantly from 1.96m in
1989 to 2.8m last year and sales are forecast to jump again to 4.6m by 1999.
Sales in China could more than double, according to forecasts, from 430,000
last year to 1.1m in 1999, while new car sales in South Korea are forecast
to grow by 50 per cent during the same period to 1.45m in 1999 from 963,000
last year.
Thailand, Malaysia and India are also expected to be strong growth markets.
The growth in new car production in China is forecast to be even more
impressive with output nearly quadrupling from 241,000 last year to 925,000
by the end of the decade.
South Korean car makers are also urgently adding new capacity to make good
their threat to break into the front rank of the world's auto makers.
The DRI report suggests that new car production in Korea could jump from
1.5m last year to 2.6m by 1999.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (4): Maastricht warfare - Policy towards
Europe has been quietly modified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
France's conservative government has quietly modified its policy on Europe,
but not on the aims it wants the European Union to pursue.
Paris still retains its across-the-board ambitions for Europe to assert
itself commercially and culturally in the world - if necessary against the
US and Japan - to be the predominant geo-political force in its region of
the world; to build something close to a European army that could be
deployed independently of the US; and keep alive the possibility of economic
and monetary union by the end of the decade.
But the French government has shifted its position on how it wants these
goals to be fulfilled.
Most importantly, it says it wants a less political role for the European
Commission, which should remember that it is merely the EU's executive, at
the bidding of EU governments whose autonomy in many areas should be better
respected in the name of subsidiarity. As Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the
RPR gaullists, puts it: 'The Commission should remember that only the
Council of Ministers has true political legitimacy'.
If that sounds like a phrase out of one of UK prime minister John Major's
speeches, it is because the French right has gone through the same debate
about Europe as its British counterpart (in a lower key) and it has come to
some of the same conclusions.
In France's 1992 Maastricht referendum campaign, the Commission became the
butt of much anti-Maastricht criticism, and remained so because France
accused it of exceeding its negotiating instructions in the Gatt farm trade
deal it struck with Washington. If evidence were needed that the Battle of
Maastricht is still not over, it was provided last month by the success of
Mr Philippe de Villiers and his anti-Maastricht dissident conservatives in
winning 13 seats in the European Parliament.
If, then, many French would agree with Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, that there is no longer any place for 'philosopher kings' such as
Mr Jacques Delors in the Commission, why did the UK end up vetoing the
choice of France, Germany and eventually nine other EU countries, to succeed
Mr Delors? This row was particularly revealing of the limits to Anglo-French
convergence on European policy.
While France saw in the Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's avowed
federalism the right kind of managerial type to broker the Belgian-style
compromises which will be needed to keep an enlarged EU together, Mr Major
saw only the trouble the Belgian's avowed federalism could bring him within
his own Tory party. But the UK also claimed to want to warn Paris and Bonn
that they could not foist their choice on others. For it may be that the
logic of France's new European policy will lead Paris and Bonn to step more
into the Commission's guiding role.
Elsewhere, Paris wants to:
Put the Commission on a tighter rein in negotiating trade agreements.
However, when it comes to anti-dumping policy, Paris has shown itself happy
for the Commission to have a certain leeway from the Council of Ministers,
where often a group of 'free traders', such as the UK, the Netherlands and
Germany, often block such action;
Increase the standing of the EU presidency in the conduct of foreign policy
and improve the co-ordination of the policies of the 12 member states
through some means other than the Commission.
Put some substance into EU foreign policy. This was the aim of the
'conference on stability in Europe', which prime minister Edouard Balladur
initiated in Paris in May. Whether it succeeds in getting East European
countries to settle ethnic and minority problems by reaching 'good
neighbour' accords with each other is open to doubt.
Enhance the Western European Union (WEU) organisation as the EU's defence
arm. In theory this should be much easier now that the US has agreed that
WEU can use Nato assets. In practice, the WEU remains largely a debating
society - as France found last month when it sought WEU backing for its
humanitarian intervention in Rwanda.
Looking ahead to the EU's next constitutional revision in 1996, Mr Alain
Lamasoure, France's European affairs minister, has floated an interesting
proposal. EU members should all agree to drop, over time, any opt-outs they
won at Maastricht, and to restore some uniformity of rights and obligations
among EU members.
Otherwise, the EU may become unworkable as it gains new members. But the
trade-off for countries such as Britain would be formal agreement that no
further steps in European integration would be taken for a generation or so.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (3): Presidential hopefuls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first round, on April 23, in next year's election to succeed President
Mitterrand in the Elysee will attract the usual mixture of mainstream and
fringe candidates from which the two top scorers - usually but not
invariably one from the right and one from the left - will go on to the
decisive May 7 run-off.
Vying for the gaullist nomination are Mr Jacques Chirac, and prime minister
Edouard Balladur, who tops all rivals in the opinion polls. Ex-President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing still hankers after the Elsyee which he won 20
years ago. If he stands, he may face a generational challenge from within
the UDF by Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister.
The Socialists ousted Mr Michel Rocard because of his bad performance in the
June Euro-election. Many left wingers are now entreating Mr Jacques Delors
to carry their colours into battle.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (2): Up off the floor - John Ridding
reviews an economy on the mend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy is on the mend.
A stream of industrial production and consumption data over the past few
months, and a 0.5 per cent increase in first quarter Gross Domestic Product,
show that recession has now been left behind. But the statistics also reveal
a pattern of hesitant recovery, struggling to find momentum.
Not surprisingly, the government has been quick to welcome the emergence of
green shoots. 'Our predictions of recovery from the beginning of the year
have been proved correct,' says one official at the economy ministry. Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, greeted the first quarter results
with a prediction of faster growth to come.
Many private sector economists have also revised upwards their forecasts for
the French economy.
Beginning of year estimates that GDP would expand by about 1 per cent have
been edged up nearer the 2 per cent mark. Mr Bernard Godement, chief
economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris, is predicting growth of
1.9 per cent this year, and just under 3 per cent in 1995. Mr Alphandery has
indicated that he is likely to raise the government's own forecast from 1.4
per cent for 1994.
If there is consensus, however, that recovery is under way, there is less
agreement on the composition and quality of growth and on progress towards
resolving the structural problems of the economy. Of particular importance
are actions to reduce the budget deficit and the level of unemployment
which, at a rate of 12.7 per cent, is one of the highest among
industrialised economies.
The government has argued that recovery will be based on a rise in exports,
investment and consumption. But the economy has yet to fire on all
cylinders. 'We have moved from a phase of deterioration in the economy to
one of improvement,' says Mr Ernest Antoine Selliere, vice president of the
Patronat employers' organisation, 'but recovery is slow, partial and
fragile.'
Consumption has shown improvement, partly because of special fiscal or
budgetary incentives. In February, for example, car owners who traded in
vehicles more than 10 years old to buy new ones received FFr5,000 of
assistance from the government. Car sales boomed, providing a boost to
consumption and industrial production statistics.
Such measures are temporary and, in the case of the car bonuses, have
already weakened significantly. But further fiscal measures, such as tax
cuts which take effect in the summer, should maintain the upward trend in
spending.
So far, revival is less clear with respect to investment. Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros, points out that while first quarter
growth was increased by a sharp reduction in stocks, there is still little
evidence of a substantial pick-up in new investment.
Exports, which resisted the impact of recession relatively well, have been
sluggish. 'There is some improvement in exports if you take a rolling
average,' says Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais
Capital Markets. 'But at the moment we are not experiencing a strong
export-led recovery.' Economists at Insee, the French national statistics
office, report a healthy increase in export orders in the second quarter,
but the contribution to GDP growth could be offset by rising imports.
Despite such caution, there are grounds for optimism.
With unemployment expected to stabilise at its current level, and to start
falling from the end of this year, consumers will be more inclined to spend
without the carrot of government incentives.
Mr Patrick Artus, chief economist at the Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
the powerful state financial institution, argues that the strong financial
situation of the corporate sector, which is currently a significant net
lender, will help stimulate investment. For most economists, this increase
in investment spending will gather strength from the second half of this
year.
But whether France achieves a sustained recovery will depend partly on
factors outside its control, and on its own success in tackling deep-rooted
structural problems.
On the first count, the most direct effect will come from recovery in its
economic partners, and in particular from Germany, its largest trading
partner. Stronger growth across the Rhine will combine with recovery in the
US and Britain to support French exporters.
But the international environment also gives cause for concern. In
particular, the turmoil in international bond markets over the past few
months has prompted a rise in long term interest rates.
Since the beginning of this year, yields on 10-year French bonds have
climbed steadily upwards, from about 5 per cent, to breach the 7 per cent
level.
During last summer's exchange rate crisis, which shattered the narrow bands
of the European exchange rate mechanism, French monetary and economic
officials provided a stream of arguments to the effect that it is long term
interest rates, rather than the short term rates with which the markets were
then obsessed, that dictate the health of the French economy. Recent
movements on the yield curve would suggest, therefore, that there are
grounds for concern.
Mr Alphandery, along with officials from the newly independent Bank of
France, have sought to play down the threat to French growth from the bond
markets. They argue that with inflation running at a meagre annual rate of
less than 2 per cent there is little justification for the pressure on long
term yields and that the markets will stabilise. That may be true. But a
sustained rise in long term yields, combined with a fall in the dollar,
could dampen recovery.
In the longer term, it is structural considerations whichloom largest. Mr
Balladur has sought to increase the flexibility of the labour market through
measures to encourage training and reduce the costs of employment.
He has had some success. The first quarter of this year saw the first growth
in employment since 1990. But other initiatives, such as an attempt to
reduce the minimum wage for young apprentices, have been abandoned in the
face of strong protests. Without further reforms, there is a danger that the
underlying rate of unemployment will again rise through the economic cycle.
Equally important is the task of curbing the public sector deficit. Mr
Balladur's administration has set itself a five-year plan to reduce the
deficit, and so far it is on target. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget
minister, believes the central budget deficit can be brought below FFr300bn
this year, compared to the FFr317bn recorded last year.
Of greater concern, however, are the deficits on social security expenditure
and local government finance. Taking these items into account, the total
public sector deficit is equivalent to about 6 per cent of GDP.
With the approach of presidential elections, scheduled to be held next
spring, fiscal rigour may be increasingly hard to maintain. Mr Balladur says
he is committed to bringing the public finances into line - an objective
which will be facilitated by broader economic recovery. But failure to
implement structural reforms, from the labour market to the establishment of
a private pensions fund system, would mean that recovery may only mask the
economy's ills.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (1): The challenge is
clear, change or die - As the pressure to cut costs intensifies, the focus
has sharpened on the relationship between the vehicle maker and its
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading vehicle makers have been preaching for several years the
necessity of reforming their thorny relationships with components suppliers.
Now in the face of fierce competition in the world auto industry,
intensified by several years of recession, first in North America and then
in Europe and in Japan, the pressures for change in the adversarial
relationships of old are proving irresistible.
New car sales worldwide fell for three years in succession from 1991 to
1993, and during the period red ink has been splashed over the accounts of
many of the world's leading vehicle makers in the US, Japan and Europe, as
well as over those of their suppliers.
Demand has started to pick up, beginning in North America, but this is
allowing only a short pause from the need to restructure. As the pressure to
cut costs and rebuild balance sheets has grown, the focus has sharpened on
to the crucial relationship between the vehicle maker and its suppliers.
Well over half of the ex-factory value of a car is generated by materials,
components and systems bought from the supply sector. When a vehicle maker
has struck trouble, the immediate reaction has been to squeeze its
suppliers, as the quickest way of reducing costs.
'More than ever automakers today recognise suppliers' impact on their cost
and quality goals,' says Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive,
a leading US component maker.
'As suppliers, we used to operate in the shadows of our customers. Business
was awarded on the basis of three bids and a cloud of dust. If we happened
to be the low bidder, the only challenge we faced was to build the part to
the automaker's exact specifications and deliver it on time. When times were
tough we took our 3 per cent price cuts, but we were rarely consulted on how
to make our parts more cost-efficiently. Times have changed.'
The squeeze on costs throughout the supply chain, coupled with other
pressures, means that the automotive components industry is going through a
period of unparalleled change and painful dislocation. At same time,
significant opportunities are opening up for the companies learning most
quickly to play by the new rules.
The first tier of automotive components suppliers are having to establish a
global presence - to meet demands from the vehicle makers for global
sourcing - and they are having to enhance their research and development
capabilities as they take over functions previously performed by the vehicle
assemblers.
Increasingly, components producers are having to develop into suppliers of
systems rather than simply of components, as the vehicle makers themselves
transfer operations previously carried out in-house to outside suppliers.
The car makers are seeking to concentrate more and more on their own core
activities of new product development (overall programme management rather
than the design and development of vehicle components) and final vehicle
assembly.
A structure is fast emerging which reflects more closely the pyramid
organisation of the Japanese industry with its tiers of suppliers. The
participants in the first tier are growing in size and technological
capability as they assume new responsibilities, but at the same time the
number of operators in this category is falling, as the vehicle makers
themselves try to rationalise their supply bases and reduce radically the
number of suppliers with which they have to deal.
'These new requirements will result in a shake-out that will leave fewer
than 300 truly global tier-one suppliers by 2000,' says Mr Reins. 'Those
that cannot meet the demands of global sourcing, programme management and
systems packaging will either drop further down the supply chain or fade
away. The bottom line for suppliers today is crystal clear: change or die.'
Individual car makers have already taken drastic action to cut the number of
their direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 at
present, according to a report produced by the Boston Consulting Group for
the European Commission.
The number is expected to drop again to around 400 by 1997 and the number of
companies operating as second or third-tier suppliers may fall by up to a
third, warns the study.
'The European motor industry still has more suppliers than it really needs,'
claims Eckhard Jokisch, vice-president of supply at Ford of Europe. 'A lot
have already fallen by the wayside, because they could not even meet today's
challenges and others will follow . . . Changing our philosophy from buying
nationally to buying globally has already led to a reduction in numbers. Our
strategy of purchasing higher levels of sub-assemblies will reduce the
number of suppliers even further.'
Ford has more than 700 suppliers - all in North America - for its US-built
Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz range. The successor Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique
models due to be launched later this year will have only 227 suppliers drawn
from around the world.
The first-tier components producers are themselves being as rigorous as the
vehicle makers, spreading the reduction in supplier numbers down the chain.
Valeo, the leading French automotive components producer, was served by
3,500 suppliers in Europe in mid-1991, but this number has been cut to
1,800, and the aim is to reach around 1,000 by the end of 1995.
The rationalisation of the industry is having severe consequences for jobs.
Employment in automotive components production in the European Union could
decline by at least 40 per cent up to 1999, the BCG report warns. More than
400,000 jobs are likely to be shed, as European components makers seek to
close the productivity gap with the Japanese industry.
Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US car makers, which was faced by
renewed financial crisis at the end of the 1980s has taken a decisive lead
in reforming the relationship between vehicle assembler and suppliers.
'We view our suppliers as an integral part of a value-added chain - a chain
that leads not to us, but through us to the real boss, the customer. We call
it the extended enterprise,' says Bob Lutz, Chrysler president.
'We treat suppliers as fully-fledged members of our platform (individual car
range) teams. We have scrapped the old system of auctioning off contracts to
the lowest bidder. Instead we set an overall 'target cost' for a given
vehicle. And then we work with pre-selected 'supplier-partners' to arrive at
mutually agreed costs for that vehicle's parts and components.'
Chrysler maintains that it has made savings of Dollars 400m a year during
the last four years through a programme designed to reduce supplier costs.
'Those savings came from waste reduction, not from cutting suppliers' profit
margins,' insists Mr Lutz.
While dramatic reforms have been put in place by some manufacturers, there
is a long way to go before the new era of partnership reaches all levels of
the industry.
The 'necessary levels of trust' are still not present between vehicle makers
and components suppliers, according to a highly critical recent report in
the UK, sponsored jointly by the government and the motor industry,
'The mistrust is the result of many years of broken promises, abuse of
confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' the study prepared by
Professor Richard Lamming, professor of purchasing and supply management at
Bath University School of Management, reports. 'In developing new working
agreements with their suppliers most vehicle manufacturers still appear to
deal more in rhetoric than reality.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (1): A revolution in a state of slow motion
 -Mr Balladur is carrying on with labour, tax and welfare reforms and
privatisation, but full economic recovery may not come in time for the
presidential election next spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France is still in a state of slow motion, before the burst of activity that
will come with next May's presidential election and the French presidency of
the European Union from January 1 nest year.
This impression of slow motion derives in part from the economy, recovering
only very gradually from the 1993 recession, and in part from the current
division of power between the lame-duck Socialist president, Francois
Mitterrand, and the cautious conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, a
division that militates against bold policy moves.
But there is also the picture of the various presidential rivals, at this
stage only circling around, each determined to be ready for the final sprint
towards the Elysee but not wanting to be seen to jump the gun. However, one
dramatic change in the line-up has occurred, with Mr Michel Rocard being
removed from the Socialist starting-block after his poor showing in the
preliminary heat of the June 12 Euro-election. The man chiefly responsible
for spiking him on the Euro-track was Mr Bernard Tapie, the maverick
populist whose Energie Radicale list gained more than 12 per cent of the
Euro-vote - only a couple of percentage points behind the Socialists, who
dropped to their lowest electoral level since the 1960s.
The Socialists' awful performance, plus the fact that the new Socialist
leader, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, is not a serious Elysee runner, has had two
contradictory knock-on effects on France's governing conservatives, who won
nearly 80 per cent of seats in the 1993 parliamentary election.
The first has been to increase the number of presidential hopefuls on the
right, making them believe that almost any conservative could beat a
socialist for the Elysee.
For instance, despite his low public rating these days, ex-President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF federation, refuses to
rule out that he might seek to re-occupy the office he left 13 years ago.
Socialist weakness has also given Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR
Gaullists, fresh hope that, after failing to win the presidency in 1981 and
1988, he might be lucky the third time.
But the possibility that the Socialists might eventually field Mr Jacques
Delors, after he returns to France at the end of this year from his decade
in Brussels, introduces an element in Mr Balladur's favour. It is far from
sure that the outgoing European Commission president will respond to the
entreaties of the 'Draft Delors' movement among the Socialists; apart from
anything else, he would want to avoid a disastrous electoral flop which
might jeopardise the career of his daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, a rising
star in the French socialist firmament. But if he threw his hat in the ring,
Mr Delors is the one Socialist who, according to the polls, would come near
to beating Mr Chirac in the final run-off presidential race.
In the endless opinion polls by which the French constantly take their
political temperature, only Mr Balladur still appears to outdistance Mr
Delors. That is his trump card in his increasingly acid rivalry with his
former patron, Mr Chirac, to carry the conservative colours into battle next
year. Mr Balladur's moderate Gaullism and consensual nature fits him better
to compete with Mr Delors, a centrist socialist, for the vital middle ground
of French politics.
For precisely that reason, Mr Balladur is almost more popular in the UDF
than in his own RPR party. These two parties reflect a cleavage that goes
back to the Revolution, with RPR 'Jacobins' who believe in a strong central
government and the UDF 'Girondists' who believe in a more decentralised
system and economic liberalism (always a relative term in France). It is
therefore unlikely that Mr Balladur, even as president, could ever bring
them together in a single unified conservative party.
But from the day he became prime minister of a government with 16 UDF
ministers and only 13 ministers from his own RPR ranks, Mr Balladur has been
clearly angling for UDF endorsement for his presidential candidacy. And he
will probably get it, at least from the UDF's largest constituent party, the
Republicans.
This party has itself been split by the highly successful campaign that one
of their number, Mr Philippe de Villiers, ran on an anti-Maastricht ticket
in the European Parliament elections, winning Euro-seats for himself, Sir
James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, and 11 others. But, in general
terms, the Republicans are increasingly restive under the nominal tutelage
of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who has himself drifted closer to the Christian
Democrats within his federation, because they are more in tune with the
ex-President's strong pro-Europeanism.
In French presidential races, party labels are never very important anyway.
The Elysee is won on a candidate's ability to act as a rassembleur, or
builder of coalitions. The run-up to a presidential election, therefore, is
generally considered not the right time to launch bold new initiatives. And
Mr Balladur has no quarrel with this conventional wisdom, because it accords
with his own innate caution.
Mr Balladur has had his caution reinforced by two policy blunders over the
past year. To most foreigners, neither initiative seemed very daring, but
both triggered an explosive domestic reaction.
At the turn of the year, the government passed a bill allowing local
authorities the possibility of meeting some of the capital expenditure of
private schools. (Under a long-standing concordat between church and state,
the latter pays almost all teacher salaries of private schools.) Fearing
this would end in neglect of state schools, several hundred thousand
demonstrators took to the streets. The government backed down.
Exactly the same pattern was repeated later over a government law, allowing
employers the possibility of paying young apprentices less than the
so-called Smic national minimum wage provided they spent the saving on
training. There followed uproar from the unions, street protests by
students, silence from cowed employers - and Mr Balladur finally said that
he would pursue his aim of trying to price young people into jobs by paying
employers a direct subsidy to hire them.
Part of the problem lies in France's ineffectual parliament, where measures
are nodded through, leaving the real debate for the streets. In a classic
gaullist response, RPR leaders such as Mr Chirac and Mr Philippe Seguin
(ironically, president of the National Assembly) propose putting measures to
combat unemployment to a referendum.
The upshot is that Mr Balladur resembles a man walking on eggs as he
continues his 'reforms'. Privatisation has slowed down, partly because the
stock market's state is not propitious for new flotations but also because
he does not want to tangle with the unions, who remain strong in state
companies such as Renault. To French capitalism's long term detriment, the
much mooted creation of capitalised private pension funds has been put on
ice, for fear of alerting people to the inadequacies of the state pension
system and alarming them.
Only in fiscal and macro-economic policy does Mr Balladur seem to be
plugging on with his original aims. His goal is to see the budget deficit
decline from FFr 320bn last year to FFr 301bn this year, to FFr275bn next
year. If realised, this will be a considerable achievement, given that he is
also reducing social payroll charges on the lower-paid to try to stimulate
employment. It will also require nerve, given the temptation to loosen
budget strings in an election year.
His end-game is to get the deficit down to 2.5 per cent of gdp (nearly half
the present ratio) by 1997, to preserve for France the option of being able
to join any European monetary union created then.

FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo pressured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo saw its share price fall sharply in afternoon
trading as a US takeover left the UK giant looking potentially stranded.
Eli Lilly &amp; Co announced it was buying PCS, the pharmacy benefit management
(PBM) arm of McKesson for Dollars 4bn. PCS is one of the last benefit
managers to be available and the high price paid by Lilly was seen as
reflecting the scarcity value.
The move was seen as wrecking Glaxo's chance to make that kind of inroad
into the US market and putting paid to speculation that Glaxo intended to
buy McKesson itself. However, after the close one US commentater suggested
Glaxo might enter a bid auction. Many analysts believe Glaxo will have to
invest in a PBM - which negotiates bulk discounts with drug companies for
user groups - if it is to be represented in an increasingly important area
of the US market.
Glaxo supporters said that the company had avoided paying what could be a
top-heavy price and added that it was more likely to follow the course of
Pfizer and go for strategic alliances. The shares which had been 3 higher,
ticked back smartly to close 8 down at 563p.
SmithKline Beecham was very heavily traded in the 'A shares as one house
sold a block of around 8m just before the end of official trading. The deal
was carried out at 398p a share, well below the mid price, and pulled the
shares down from a high of 407p to close 5 lower at 400p. Traders said the
stock was sold by Smith New Court, the house renowned for large aggressive
market operations.
Mirror Group was the most heavily traded share in the London market, rising
4 to 150p on turnover of 11m as the latest newspaper circulation figures for
June showed that the Independent, in which Mirror has a stake of just under
40 per cent, had not been hit by the broadsheet price war.
Brewing retail and leisure group Scottish &amp; Newcastle fell 3 to 495p on
competition worries for its prestigious Center Parc's operation which
generates around a third of the company's profits. Rival Rank announced
plans to open a similar venture in Kent to S&amp;N's 'roam in a dome' operation
but analysts said Center Parcs were well established and Rank would not be
able to compete in the same way. Rank, which has first half figures on
Thursday lifted 12 to 374p.
Press speculation that the oft-mooted plan by Bass, Whitbread and
Allied-Lyons to sell their Pounds 400m stake in Britvic had fallen through
failed to affect the shares. The three brewers own 90 per cent of Britvic
between them.
Bass, the main share holder has consistently refused to comment on whether
it is preparing to sell. Analysts said sources close to Pepsico, the company
expected to buy the stake, had also suggested that the talks had cooled but
they believed the deal was bound to go through eventually, it was just a
question of when. Bass rose 4 to 521p, Whitbread 7 to 504p and Allied 6 to
555p.
The prospects of demerging several of its businesses continued to boost
Thorn-EMI. The shares added another 14 to 1053p. Rank Organisation were in
demand ahead of Thursday's interim figures and the shares put on 12 to 374p.
News of the departure of Forte's director of operations was another blow to
the hotels group. The shares eased to 221p, after trade of 5.3m. Detailed
sell notes from BZW and NatWest Securities hit sentiment in the stock last
week.
Great Universal Stores bumped up 14 to 567p ahead of the annual figures on
Thursday as the market returned to its lingering fixation that the company
is poised to buy back equity. Some analysts said that the company could buy
back as much as 10 per cent or 100m shares and although the official offer
price is unlikely to be much more than 590p a share the ACT tax breaks for
pension funds would mean that, for them, the shares could have a nominal
value closer to 700p.
GKN jumped 15 to 603p as NatWest Securities became the latest house to
recommend the stock to clients.

FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong two-way pull in conglomerate Tomkins, brought turnover of 9.4m
shares as the market gave a cautious welcome to the group's robust full year
figures.
Profits jumped 50 per cent to Pounds 257m, in line with forecasts but the 16
per cent increase in the dividend to 7.38p was ahead of expectations.
Early demand saw the shares advance to 226p, before a more cautious mood set
in following the meeting between the company and City analysts, leaving the
shares just  1/2 ahead at 218p.
Explaining the retreat, Mr Geoff Allum at NatWest Securities said there was
concern in the market at the length of time it was taking to integrate its
last big acquisition RHM. In addition; 'there is concern as to how
successful the company will be to grow by acquisition in unrelated areas.'
However, Mr Allum edged his dividend forecast for the current year slightly
forward to 8.5p, and said, 'the negatives are now in the share price.'
But Mr Ian Rennardson at stockbroker Yamaichi, was more bullish on Tomkins
and said: 'The market's caution is misplaced. The company has delivered the
goods on RHM. There is no acquisition needed to show continuing growth.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: US funds sellers of BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil majors, BP and Shell, were among the worst performers in the FT-SE
100 index, with US institutions said to have been big sellers of the stocks,
particularly BP, in the wake of dollar weakness.
The underperformance of the big oil issues was all the more surprising given
that oil prices were exceptionally strong yesterday afternoon when August
Brent was some 40 cents a barrel higher around the Dollars 17.75 level. Some
analysts began to worry, however, that the latest upsurge in oil prices,
along with other commodities, could begin to unnerve the US authorities and
provoke moves to cap rising prices.
BP settled 5 off at 380p, on turnover of 6.5m, after some aggressive selling
from all the big US investment houses, notably Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs
and Salomon Brothers. Shell Transport also underperformed but managed to
post a closing gain of 1 at 698p as the market waited for confirmation of
the sale of its Billiton metals business in South Africa to Gencor for
upwards of Dollars 1bn.

FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Producer price figures boost gains in
shares - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence that weakness in the US dollar will not provoke hasty action on
US interest rates helped shares move ahead strongly in London yesterday.
With British government bonds also very strong as the June producer price
statistics confirmed that domestic inflation remains subdued, the stock
market moved to within 8 points of the FT-SE 3,000 mark before closing off
the top as Wall Street made a cautious start to its new trading session.
At 2,983.8, the FT-SE Index was finally a net 21.4 up on the day, and gains
across the broader range of the market lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by
19.3 to 3,473.9. Trading volume was brisk, bearing out indications that
retail, or genuine investment interest in UK equities, has recovered from
the nervousness seen ahead of the G7 meeting in Naples last weekend.
Equities opened cautiously behind the weaker trend in the US currency
following comments from President Clinton as well as the widely-expected
absence of any strong statement on the dollar from the G7 meeting. But
shares soon responded to firmness in European bond markets.
London was also encouraged by a shift towards optimism on gilt-edged
securities by UK fund managers, disclosed in the latest survey of investment
funds by Gallup for Smith New Court, the London investment house.
Early gains were extended after UK producer prices for June, showing the
lowest rise in output prices since 1967, were seen as convincing evidence
that commodity price inflation has yet to reach manufacturing producers.
The UK market reached the day's peak with a net gain of 30 points as it
waited for Wall Street to show its response to the G7 meeting and the
renewed slide in the dollar. Shares later came off the top as US Federal
bonds eased and Wall Street failed to hold its early gain to show a fall of
9 Dow points in London trading hours.
The UK market closed in confident mood, brushing off some concerns that this
week's list of statistics on the US economy, beginning today with the
producer price data, could still bring action from the Federal Reserve.
Much of the upward impetus for share prices came from stock index futures as
the big securities houses moved themselves on to the bull tack after nearly
a fortnight of uncertainty regarding the outlook for the dollar and global
interest rates.
Consequently, the focus was on the Footsie listed stocks which are included
in the baskets of shares making up the futures contracts. Of the 542.5m
shares traded, around 47 per cent were Footsie-listed issues, and the
remainder the non-Footsie stocks which drive the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. On
Friday, retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.46bn, confirming the
recovery in investment activity.
The oil sector provided one of the few weak spots among the
dollar-orientated issues, which were otherwise little affected by the
selling of the US currency. Interest-related stocks attracted buyers,
several leading building issues responding to optimism on rates in Germany.
There were widespread gains across the broad range of UK manufacturing
stocks, with engineering and vehicle industry shares to the fore. Retail
stocks recovered poise on growing confidence that the recovery in the UK
economy can be extended without causing inflation dangers.

FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze pushed stock index futures above the 3,000 level for the first
time in more than three weeks, but the contract closed below the day's best
as London was unsettled by a faltering Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,962, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
moved steadily ahead with UK economic data on output prices for June taken
to indicate inflation remained under control.
Dealers also cited hopes of greater stability in currency markets for the
new positive tone to the market. Demand for September was said to have come
from both independent (local) traders and the large institutions and the
contract pushed through the 3,000 barrier to reach a day's high of 3,012.
However, the poor opening in New York in the afternoon checked a further
advance and September finished the day at 2,997, up 38 on its previous close
and 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5
points. Volume was 15,720 lots.
Traded options lacked the strong activity seen in futures and volume fell to
23,905 lots. The FT-SE 100 saw business of 8,724 and the Euro FT-SE 100
option traded 4,424 contracts. BP was the busiest stock option with a day's
total of 1,326. It was followed by Glaxo at 1,238 lots and Argyll Group at
1,010.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities steady despite
weaker bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Although the dollar plunged again on foreign exchange markets yesterday, US
share prices held their own in the face of the rapidly declining US currency
and a weaker bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.15 at 3,702.99
well above its low for the day of 3,680.33. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 ended down 1.49 at 448.06, while the American Stock Exchange
composite finished off 0.68 at 424.77 and the Nasdaq composite down 0.63 at
706.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was light at 224m shares.
Stock prices took their cue from the bond market in early trading. After
firming slightly at the opening, stocks soon retreated as bonds posted
modest losses. The quarter-point decline in the benchmark 30-year bond was
sparked by higher commodities prices and further declines in the dollar. By
late afternoon the US currency was down at a new post-1945 low against the
Yen of Y97.65, and below the DM1.53 against the D-mark for the first time
since November, 1992.
The fall in the dollar unsettled bonds because fixed-income investors feared
it would persuade the Federal Reserve that interest rates would have to go
up to protect the ailing currency. The drop in bonds, however, was not
especially disturbing, and the resilience of fixed-income investors appeared
to buoy stock market sentiment. Both bonds and stocks were helped by the
opinion of analysts that Fed would not make a decision on whether to tighten
monetary policy until after the release of the June inflation figures today
and tomorrow. Among individual stocks, McKesson was the star of the show,
soaring Dollars 24 1/2 , or 33 per cent, to Dollars 97 5/8 in volume of 3.2m
shares after drugs group Eli Lilly agreed to buy McKesson's retail drug
distribution subsidiary, PCS Health, for Dollars 4bn in cash. The news,
however, was not so well received by Eli Lilly shareholders: the company's
stock dropped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 50.
Caterpillar continued to be the stock of choice among cyclically-minded
investors. Cyclical stocks have been strong recently as buyers anticipated
improved earnings in the wake of the growing economy, but none has benefited
more than Caterpillar, which yesterday firmed another Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 107 3/8 .
Dow Jones dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 in busy trading after the
financial publishing group announced second quarter net income of 46 cents a
share, up from 40 cents a share a year earlier but below the consensus of
analysts' forecasts. On the Nasdaq market, Gaming Corporation of America, a
Nasdaq-quoted stock, dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 2 5/8 after the
company was denied a renewal of its licence by the Wisconsin Winnebago
gaming commission.
Canada
Toronto prices ended mixed in moderate trading, despite higher gold stocks.
The TSE-300 composite index added 5.04 points, or 0.12 per cent, to close at
4,103.94, although losing issues led winners by 394 to 325.
Volume of 42.06m shares was down from 45.82m last Friday, and trading value
was CDollars 515.5m compared with CDollars 567.5m.
Northern Telecom was downgraded to intermediate-term neutral from above
average by Merrill Lynch. The company also announced a Dollars 100m cellular
system contract in Taiwan. The stock fell 3/8 to 40 7/8.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Uncertainty over North
Korea takes toll on region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares posted small losses in low volume as investors remained inactive due
to uncertainty over the North Korean situation and the movement of the yen,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 53.42 at 20,473.09 after a low of 20,369.07
in the morning and a high of 20,534.51 just before the close. Domestic and
foreign traders were initially braced for heavy selling due to political
uncertainty on the Korean peninsula following the death of President Kim Il
Sung at the weekend, but were surprised after most investors failed to
react. Late afternoon arbitrage selling, however, eroded earlier gains.
Volume was 210m shares against 342m. 'People who were expecting a sell off
and were waiting to buy shares at lower prices were disappointed and failed
to join the activity,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.72 to 1,656.16 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.74 to 300.74. On the first section, 653 issues declined
while 301 advanced, with 209 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.39 to 1,343.73.
Consumer spending related stocks were up on hopes of a rise in consumer
purchases due to the hot summer weather. A sharp rise in sales of summer
items such as air conditioners, summer clothing, and beer, has been
encouraging investors, and prompting some Japanese economists to call the
current heat wave a 'divine wind'.
Among retailers Takashimaya rose Y50 to Y1,530 and Matsuya Y20 to Y685,
while Kirin Brewery, the leading beer manufacturer, added Y20 to Y1,240.
Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y1,150.
Reports that the company had discovered a second oil field of Vietnam helped
to fuel interest.
Large capital stocks were sold on profit-taking. Kawasaki Steel fell Y6 to
Y348 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y12 to Y788. Electricals were
also weaker, with Hitachi down Y20 to Y1,030 and Toshiba falling Y8 to Y801.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 93.35 to 23,018.65 in volume of 17.6m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y6,890 on profit-taking.
Roundup
Seoul was unnerved by developments in North Korea, but elsewhere the region
could find few fresh investment incentives.
SEOUL was overshadowed by uncertainty following the death of North Korean
president Kim Il-sung, although the composite index recovered from an early
2.1 per cent fall to finish 7.54 lower at 948.84.
The early decline was the result of a lack of immediate information about
the heir, Kim Jong-il, together with news of the indefinite postponement of
the scheduled summit.
One analyst commented that the outlook for the Seoul market was one of
heightened uncertainty in coming months from a political view, but with much
more realistic prospects of economic benefits from a more open policy in the
North in the long run.
Trading houses, which had recently gained momentum on hopes of bettering
North-South relations, lost ground more than other shares. Its sub-index
shed 23.97 to 734.99.
TAIPEI saw intensified buying in the heavily weighted financial sector in
the last minutes of trading which pushed the market 2.1 per cent higher,
although some brokers noted increasing profit-taking.
The weighted index rose 127.73 to 6,313.00, but turnover fell to TDollars
68.86bn from TDollars 85.38bn in Saturday's short session.
The financial sector added 3.9 per cent, with China Development up TDollars
6 to TDollars 162. Petrochemicals also saw strong buying because product
prices have been rising in recent weeks.
SYDNEY finished close to a 10 month low, the All Ordinaries index dipping
3.7 to 1,961.2, with a lack of local economic news and conflicting
influences from other bourses making for lacklustre trade.
The day was punctuated by activity surrounding Bridge Oil, which fell 1 cent
to 90 cents with 12m shares changing hands as Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum
built its stake.
WELLINGTON fell to a year's low, driven more by lack of interest than
specific factors, and the NZSE-40 capital index closed down 10.42 at
1,945.51.
Analysts commented that the strength of the local currency, at a 40-month
high, was a negative for some exporters, but helped to support interest
rates.
But confirmation from Westpac Bank that mortgage interest rates were on the
rise came as little surprise and was expected to have only a minor negative
impact on equities.
MANILA fell 1.6 per cent in the absence of fresh incentives. The composite
index fell 40.1 to 2,543.75.
HONG KONG remained aimless, the Hang Seng index giving up another 38.02 to
8,394.94 in turnover that fell to HKDollars 1.78bn from Friday's HKDollars
2.60bn .
Recently steady utilities fell victim to profit taking and suffered the
heaviest losses. Hong Kong Telecom, an index heavyweight, dipped 20 cents to
HKDollars 13.80, China Light dropped 30 cents to HKDollars 37.20 and China
Gas eased 15 cents to HKDollars 13.15.
SINGAPORE closed lower with interest in Malaysian shares traded over the
counter quickly waning as investors turned cautious. The Straits Times
Industrials index closed 11.69 lower at 2,151.25.
On Friday, a late spate of buying in OTC shares was seen following a
recycling of old rumours that an early Malaysian general election was about
to be announced.
KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains and closed mostly lower on profit-taking
although the composite index put on 1.10 to 988.88, bolstered by a MDollars
1 gain in Genting, the casino owner.
BANGKOK was in negative territory throughout the day on concerns about US
interest rates. The SET index closed 8.97 lower at 1,278.37, up from the
day's low of 1,273.08.
KARACHI saw profit-taking on settlement day as brokers offloaded blue chips
fearing that the market's retreat was gathering pace. The 100-share index
fell 35.14 or 1.6 per cent to 2,227.62.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Asia/Pacific performs badly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With a few exceptions the world's equity markets performed relatively
strongly last week, although the Asia/Pacific region again came out badly as
worries over US interest rates remained on investors' minds.
Goldman Sachs, in its latest investment strategy report, has slightly
increased its weighting in Hong Kong and Singapore, at the expense of
Europe, for two reasons. Firstly, the fact that recent Chinese economic data
has pointed to a gradual slowing of inflation and industrial output, which
may 'somewhat allay investor concern about the country's medium-term
economic outlook'. Secondly, Hong Kong's valuation levels are presently
attractive, while corporate earnings in Singapore should be positive since
GDP growth there has been better-than-expected.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses retain
forward momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity among the major equity markets on the continent was generally muted
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ticked up another rise as the CAC-40 index added 28.97 or 1.5 per cent
to 1,949.75. Turnover remained low at FFr2.5bn.
In the automotive sector Peugeot rose FFr28 to FFr789 after reporting a 12.4
per cent rise in first half car sales, Michelin improved FFr2.80 to
FFr238.50 and Valeo FFr4.30 to FFr278.90.
In a review of this sector Kleinwort Benson noted that in spite of the
'ephemeral and artificial' nature of a recovery in the market following the
government's initiative earlier in the year to boost sales, there did seem
to be an underlying trend towards recovery of registrations throughout
Europe, although the risk remained that demand could dry-up in the second
half.
France, and the UK, they added, stood to benefit the most.
FRANKFURT kept track of movements in the currency markets but the Dax index
managed a slight increase on the day in spite of continued dollar weakness.
The Dax closed the official session up 14.81 at 2,065.66, off the session
high of 2,072.99. In Ibis-indicated trading the index rose further to
2,069.46.
A number of brokers have moved to an underweight position in Germany, in
spite of the equity market's outperformance of the continental average.
Hoare Govett, for instance, noted in its third quarter review that while
corporate earnings forecasts had become more positive, 'ratings still look
historically demanding'.
Favouring the chemicals sector among cyclicals Hoare's also recommended an
overweight position in construction which continued to be supported by
rising investment in the east.
Siemens, up 50 pfennings at DM655, drew moderate interest after forecasting
that 1994 earnings would be in line with year ago results. Elsewhere
Mannesmann made DM11.50 to DM418.50 while Volkswagen slipped DM3.40 to
DM469.60 as rumours, all of them denied, swept the market regarding the
future of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez.
AMSTERDAM moved higher with the AEX index rising by 1.40 to 387.24.
Paribas Capital Markets has maintained its neutral weighting on the market
given that Dutch equities are so closely tied to dollar movements.
Paribas added that it had lowered its AEX target to 415 for the year-end,
and to 435 for 1995.
However, the broker said that it expected 'some momentum from positive
surprises in interim earnings, given the generally good first quarter
results and the characteristic caution of the majority of Dutch companies'.
Fokker rose 40 cents to Fl 16.10 following the announcement a cash injection
of Fl 1bn.
MILAN remained becalmed in very thin trade with much of the activity
technically driven by end of account considerations.
The Comit index dipped 2.57 to 684.35, the mood soured by further friction
within the government coalition, and the continued absence of clear budget
proposals.
Banks were mixed with some benefiting from Cariplo's last minute decision
last Friday to postpone its planned flotation. Credito Italiano picked up
L10 to L2,040 and IMI put on L120 to L10,650 as cash reserved for the
flotation flowed back into the sector.
In the opposite direction BCI fell L99 or 2.2 per cent to L4,375: it will
ask shareholders this week to approve its planned capital call.
Insurers remained under pressure as investors switched to the
newly-privatised INA. Generali lost L650 to L40,000 while Fondiaria was down
L15 to L12,190.
ZURICH was flat in low volume with most activity restricted to trading among
professionals. The SMI index rose 2.2 to 2,562.5.
The weak dollar limited activity and weighed on shares like Ciba, SFr7
easier at SFr757, and Nestle, up SFr3 at SFr1,096.
Roche certificates held steady at SFr6,000, supported by reported buying by
BZ Bank. Roche is due to release its half-year revenue figure this week.
Elsewhere, Alusuisse saw some buying interest, rising SFr7 to SFr654 after
the company announced that it had sold its Conalco US unit to Ormet for an
undisclosed price.
Banking and insurance issues closed higher on buying off the lows. UBS rose
SFr5 to SFr1,169 and Zurich Insurance gained SFr15 to SFr1,310.
MADRID was higher in thin trade although prices came off their highs as Wall
Street opened. The General index rose 2.48 to 296.4 but trading volume of
Pta17.6bn was one of the lowest recorded this year
Among the banks, Banco Santander rose Pta165 or 3.7 per cent to Pta4,665 on
expectations of an 8 per cent profits rise and Bankinter dropped Pta10 to
Pta10,690 before the bank disclosed a higher than expected 9.2 per cent drop
in consolidated net profit in the first half of 1994.
STOCKHOLM was helped higher by a number of positive factors, with the
Affarsvarlden general index rising 22.3 to 1,378.3.
Turnover improved to SKr1.6bn from SKr1.3bn as Volvo B shares, the day's
most active issue, rose SKr24 to SKr682.
WARSAW was stronger for the fifth consecutive session, with the Wig index
gaining 445.9 to 9.610.0.
ISTANBUL regained most fo Friday's fall to close the session up 3.3 per cent
on bargain hunting.
The composite index added 682.87 to 21,106.38, although volume was reported
as light.
Brokers forecast that the index could rise to the 22,000 level before
encountering a resistance level.
Among the days most actives Izmir Demir Celik rose TL250 to TL2,175.
The equity market will extend trading to four hours from Thursday, and also
switch to a two-day settlement period.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar ebbs lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar weakened further yesterday after the failure of the weekend G7
summit in Naples to produce any form of dollar support package, writes
Philip Gawith.
This omission had been widely predicted and was discounted in the market.
This did not stop traders and investors selling the dollar, but since the
market was already short of the currency, levels of activity were not
particularly dramatic.
Against the D-Mark the dollar slipped sharply, closing in London at DM1.54
from DM1.5741 on Friday, levels last reached in April 1993.
The dollar also finished at a new post-war low of Y97.365, from Y98.575 on
Friday, against the yen. Losses were pared slightly by uncertainty following
the weekend death of the North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung.
Dollar weakness continued to set the tone for currency markets in general.
The D-Mark remained a leading beneficiary, and maintained its recent
strength against most European currencies. It closed at FFr3.436, from
FFr3.434, against the French franc.
Sterling weakened further against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4081 from
DM2.4241. These losses were largely offset by gains against the dollar, with
sterling finishing at Dollars 1.5638 from Dollars 1.54 on Friday. The
sterling index slipped to 79 from 79.1.
Analysts remain very gloomy about the short term outlook for the dollar,
with most predicting that it will fall further to the Y90-95 range, and
DM1.50-55 in the near term.
Although the G7 was widely written off before the fact as an irrelevant
talk-shop, the fact that it lived down to its reputation - as least as far
as the dollar was concerned - was taken by the market as a further reason to
sell the currency.
The decisive event - moreso than the failure of the final G7 communique to
mention currencies - was President Clinton's comments last Friday that the
US did not intend to use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy
(comments he repeated to reporters yesterday after meeting Mr Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor).
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the president
had been unpersuasive. 'The market still believes the US is adopting a trade
policy that is happy to see a weaker dollar.'
A second concern, following last Friday's strong non-farm payroll numbers in
the US, is the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
The market is increasingly concerned that the Fed is falling 'behind the
game' in terms of combatting inflation. This conclusion is aggravated by the
perception that this may be the result of political pressure.
Mr Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ International in London
comments: 'The perception that the market has is that Clinton appears to be
adopting a policy of benign neglect towards the dollar. If it came to a
choice between a weaker dollar or higher interest rates, he would clearly
choose the former rather than risk jeopardising the economic recovery.'
Mr Hannah said the dollar would continue to weaken 'until a strong consensus
emerges that it is too cheap, or the Fed makes aggressive interest rate
moves.'
The IBJ analyst said neither occurrence seemed likely at the moment, adding
that it was far from certain whether even a 50 basis point increase in US
rates would be enough. 'While uncertainty about stock and bond markets
continues, it is doubtful whether people will want to buy US assets,' said
Mr Hannah.
He noted that the good performance of European bond and equity markets
yesterday, combined with stable currencies, was not a situation that would
encourage dollar demand.
Improved sentiment in the gilts markets spilled over into the short end of
the interest rate futures market. The December short sterling contract
settled in London at 93.64, seven basis points up from Friday. Volume was
fairly good, with more than 21,000 lots traded.
The December euromark contract did even better, trading nearly 58,000 lots
to finish at 95.08 from 94.97. Further along the yield curve, the movements
were even sharper, with most of the 1995 contracts rising by over 20 basis
points.
Analysts said there was no real fundamental explanations for these
movements. They reflected, instead, greater bullishness about the outlook
for bunds and gilts, and a technical rebound from Friday where the market
had got itself into an oversold position.
In the money markets, German call money firmed to about 5 per cent from 4.9
per cent on Friday as dealers sought to bolster reserves that had been run
down over the weekend. The securities repurchase (repo) rate is currently
4.93 per cent.
In the UK the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 200m to the
money markets after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 650m. It had earlier
provided Pounds 150m liquidity. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6
1/2 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium touches 40-month highs -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late profit-taking kept London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices from building
on an early move to 40-month highs, although the market still closed firmer
and looked set for fresh advances, dealers said.
The three months price closed reached Dollars 1,549 a tonne, but closed at
Dollars 1,540.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 1.
Buyers had been encouraged early on by the International Primary Aluminium
Institute's announcement that stocks held in member countries fell by 64,000
tonnes in May; and a further fall in LME warehouse stocks is expected today.
Looming supply tightness from September onwards was also underpinning the
market.
At the London bullion market the GOLD price profited from the continued
weakness of the US dollar, ending Dollars 2.60 higher at Dollars 386 a troy
ounce.
The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market, although operating in the shadow
of the extraordinary rise in coffee futures (see story above), itself posted
quite respectable gains.
The September futures position closed at Dollars 1,049 a tonne, adding
Dollars 33 to Friday's Dollars 22 rally, as market sentiment improved. This
was helped, some traders suggested, by 'sympathetic buying' linked to
coffee's surge.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp maker defends 50 per cent
price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 50 per cent rise in pulp prices this year has come just in time for the
struggling paper industry, according to a leading US pulp and paper
manufacturer.
Defending price rises of over 20 per cent for some paper customers so far
this year, Mr John Kennedy, president of Federal Paper Board Company of New
Jersey, said yesterday: 'For the last two years we were selling pulp at
below cost - six months ago substantially below cost. . . We were at the
point where we would have had to shut down our North Carolina mill'.
Mr Kennedy, speaking before a visit to the company's Tait paper mill in
Scotland, said he appreciated customers' concern. 'Three or four price
increases in a relatively short period is a surprise and difficult to
comprehend,' he admitted. 'But when we analyse the losses over the last two
to three years and where we need to be to get a reasonable return on our
investment, that's what has to happen.'
Federal made a profit of Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 1.4bn last year,
thanks to its separate lumber operations. It made virtually no return on
capital invested.
'Last year was probably the worst year in our industry in 40 years,' said Mr
Kennedy.
He pointed out that the latest rise, which will take world pulp prices to
Dollars 620 a tonne this summer, would leave them well below their peak of
Dollars 850 a tonne in the late 1980s.
However, some paper users are being so badly squeezed by the price rises
that they fear for their survival. Hinton Corrpack, a small company in
Staffordshire, north-west England, which makes cardboard boxes for
supermarkets, says the price of the board it buys is due to rise by 50 per
cent by the end of the year.
'Some 60 to 70 per cent of our selling price is the raw material, so it's
quite serious,' said Mr John Weedon, managing director of the company, which
has sales of Pounds 2.5m. 'We've raised our prices by about 7 per cent, but
the market won't bear any further increase. . . It's the small businesses
that will give - those who get caught in the middle.'
The slump in the paper industry was caused not by a fall in demand, which
has grown steadily over the past few years, but by overcapacity. Following
the last upswing in the early 1980s, capacity grew at 6 to 7 per cent a year
during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It costs about Dollars 750m to build a 1,000-tonne-a-day pulp mill and takes
three to four years, so supply is often out of kilter with demand by the
time the new capacity comes on stream.
'Demand has finally caught up with that increase in capacity,' said Mr
Kennedy.
The Tait mill, which buys over half its pulp from Federal's Carolina plant
to make white uncoated free sheet - used for photocopying and computer paper
 -has itself more than doubled capacity in the past five years to 220,000
tonnes.
Mr Kennedy said Tait had been operating at or below break-even for two and a
half years until the second quarter. But this year its customers have seen
prices rise 24 per cent and the mill is fully stretched, with a 40-day order
backlog.
The sharp rise in demand as much of the world emerges from recession has
taken even the industry by surprise. Demand for cut size paper, which had
been growing at 4 to 6 per cent a year, rose by 7 per cent in the first five
months of this year. The temporary closure of pulp mills last year in North
America, Scandinavia and Spain and Portugal, coupled with low customer
stocks, has squeezed supplies of pulp.
Mr Kennedy believes another boom and bust cycle could be tempered by the
huge environmental costs facing pulp and paper companies, especially in the
US, which could hamper hefty investment in new capacity. Environmental
regulations proposed in the US are expected to cost the industry between
Dollars 8bn and Dollars 10bn.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU aims to short circuit
subsidy payment disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has set up a new body to speed up settlement of
disputes with member governments about money being wasted through incorrect
payment of subsidies under the European Union's common agricultural policy.
The establishment of the five-man committee is seen as a serious effort by
the commission to address the practical problems of overspending on
agriculture - which accounts for about half the European Union's Ecu70bn
(Pounds 55bn) budget.
The group is to be chaired by Mr Jo Carey, a former UK Treasury official. He
will act as a mediator in disputes between the commission and EU member
states about how much agriculture spending individual countries should repay
to EU funds in cases where the commission thinks that they have not stuck to
spending rules.
Mr Carey is viewed as a robust, non-establishment figure and an such is
expected to bring a common sense approach to bear on difficult disputes. For
nine years until end of 1992 he was the UK's representative on the
Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main spending watchdog.
According to the commission, Mr Carey and his team will probably review
about 20 cases a year involving disputes over spending totalling more than
Ecu500m a year.
The other members of the group will be Mr Walter Kittel, a former official
in the German agriculture ministry; Mr Bernard Vial, a former inspector
general in the French agriculture ministry; Mr Albert Simantov, a Greek who
is former agriculture director at the Paris-based Organisation of Economic
Co-operation and Development, and Mr Sabatino Loreto, an Italian Treasury
official.
The type of cases Mr Carey will investigate will include disputes such as a
long-running argument between Italy and the commission over milk quotas and
allegations that Greece overspent by up to Ecu50m in 1991-92 through handing
out subsidies to cotton farmers.
The committee, which is schedule to start work in September, will be
part-time and its judgments will not be binding. However a commission
official said that he hoped the group would 'reduce the tensions' in
arguments over spending by bringing to bear outside judgments.
Commission officials also express that hope that establishment of the new
committee will give to those member states that complain about commission
judgments an alternative way to press their cases instead of going through
the lengthy procedure of bringing a case at the European Court of Justice.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian supply worries fuel
rally in oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices rallied yesterday amid fears of possible supply disruptions from
Nigeria, where a strike by oil workers is set to intensify this week.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for September rose by about 30 cents,
to around Dollars 17.35 a barrel, in late London trading. Concern over
Nigerian supplies, much of which are destined for the US, caused the spot
price of West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, to rise above Dollars 20
a barrel in New York trading.
The rise was attributed to fears that a strike by Nigerian oil workers,
which has so far had little impact on exports, could lead to supply
disruptions if senior employees joined in.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at London brokers Kleinwort Benson, said
recurrent market fears of cutbacks from politically unstable oil producers
have so far not been realised. But they were 'symptomatic of the market
turning toward a bull phase', he said.
Earlier there was little market reaction to a report that production by
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in June was
more than 500,000 barrels a day above its output ceiling of 24.52m b/d.
The Middle East Economic Survey said that a number of Opec members,
including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria and Iraq, were producing
above their quotas. Iran yesterday said it was producing at its Opec quota
of 3.6m b/d. But Mees said quota violations by Iran and the others pushed
Opec production in June to 25.02m b/d.
Production discipline among Opec producers during a period of rising demand
has a factor in the recent rally in oil prices from lows of around Dollars
13 a barrel last February.
Analysts say any sign of serious cheating could undermine prices. But many
think it unlikely that past offenders such as Iran and Nigeria would be able
to sustain higher output because they are operating close to capacity.

A fair demand prevailed, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Best and good
medium east Africans ruled fully firm to dearer after a hesitant start while
mediums were irregular with quality. Central Africans sold readily around
last rates. Ceylons came to a selective market with brighter teas steady,
others 4 to 8 pence down. There was limited demand with Ceylons often
neglected. Quotations: best available 270p/kg, good 160p/kg, good medium
148p/kg, medium 123p/kg, low medium 90p/kg. The highest price realised this
week was 271p/kg for a Rwanda pf. 1.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee market gets back to
record-breaking ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's opening surge in London coffee futures notched up another market
record. At Dollars 924 for the September robusta futures contract, it was
the biggest ever opening rise, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at
brokers GNI. It easily beat the previous opening record of about Dollars
500.
Just as significant as the market's extraordinary gain is the fact that the
earlier record was reached in 1976, a year after the frost that decimated
Brazil's coffee crop.
The second severe freeze in a fortnight has increased the prospect of
serious shortages for the next two years. That prospect has driven the
market up 220 per cent this year, with a 77 per cent rise in the past two
weeks alone.
Traders in London said they could not remember two such severe frosts coming
so close together before. Although they are only just beginning to get a
clear picture of the damage from last month's frost, the initial fear
yesterday was that as much as half Brazil's 1995-96 crop could now be in
jeopardy.
The Brazilian government had already cut its estimate for the crop to 17m
bags from at least 25m before last Saturday's frost. The latest damage to
coffee trees spread through the southern states of Parana and Sao Paolo but
also again hit southern parts of the major producing state, Minas Gerais,
where coffee production was moved during the 1980s to escape such freezes.
One producer in a co-operative in the south of the state told the Reuters
news agency: 'This was a very hard blow for us. It was worse than the frosts
two weeks ago.'
Particularly galling to farmers was that the latest frost - which left ice
in some areas - damaged coffee fields that had been planted at 1,000 metres
or above in order to avoid the frost danger.
Ms Judy Ganes, softs analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said futures
prices would go on rising because there was a danger that Brazil might run
out of stocks if demand remained constant.
Supply deficits looked set to continue from the 1993-94 season through to
the 1995-96 season 'at a time when producers have already reduced their
stockpiles of coffee'. The US Department of Agriculture puts the 1994-95
deficit at 9m bags, which will have to be met from producer stocks.
Furthermore, the USDA is suggesting that only about 9m bags of the 17m-bag
Brazilian government stockpile may be fit for consumption. 'If Brazil is
going to sell 5m to 7.4m bags in the next 11 months, that's exhausting their
stockpile,' said Ms Ganes.
Brazil has suspended exports in order to assess the damage to the crop.
Colombia yesterday announced it would halt registrations for private
exporters, giving an added fillip to the New York market.
There were mixed views about the likely impact of the price rise on
production. While some Brazilian farmers may be scared off replanting in
frost-damaged areas, other south American farmers may wish to cash in on the
price bonanza by planting more. However, they will have to wait about three
years before new plantings yield a crop.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall in wake of weaker
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell across the maturity range yesterday in the wake of
higher commodities prices and another plunge in the value of the dollar.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 83,
yielding 7.716 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic statistics, all eyes were on the dollar
when the market opened, and it was a dollar that continued to weaken against
other major currencies.
It was not long before bonds began to slip in the dollar's wake, as the
currency slumped to a new post-1945 low against the yen of Y97.70 and to
DM1.53 against the D-Mark, its lowest level since late 1992.
The decline in the dollar undermined prices because investors believed the
Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates, although most
analysts said any move was unlikely until today's and tomorrow's June
inflation figures had been released.
A rise in commodities prices further undermined bonds, although the increase
in the Commodity Research Bureau's closely-followed index was attributed by
analysts to a surge in coffee prices following news of a bad frost in
Brazil.
As the dollar continued to tumble, portfolio shifts into Europe's safe
havens out of US Treasuries bolstered European bond markets.
'After the G7 failed to offer a package in support of the dollar, there now
seems to be less danger in allocating funds to Europe,' said Mr Chris
Anthony, head of fixed interest research at Hoare Govett.
While some traders reported large shifts in cash bonds by institutional
investors, others said cash activity remained thin, with most of the action
taking place in the futures pits. This spurred talk that hedge funds, which
are often active in the futures markets, were behind some of the buying.
Over the last two trading sessions, European bonds have shrugged off sharp
declines in US bonds. 'The markets' resilience on Friday and yesterday has
reawakened the issue of decoupling between US and European yields,' noted Mr
Stephen Dulake, bond strategist at PaineWebber in London.
However, he added that 'we haven't seen this uptrend confirmed by investor
sponsorship, and I feel there are still many reasons to be cautious.'
Mr Dulake said it was unlikely that European bond yields could fall on a
sustainable basis unless US bonds recover or at least stabilise.
Several key US statistics are due this week, and 'there's a strong risk that
further declines in the US could undermine European bonds', he warned.
French bonds rose sharply yesterday, outperforming their German counterparts
after underperforming them last week. The September notional French
government bond future on Matif rose by 1.12 points to 115.68.
Sentiment was boosted by positive data, showing June inflation unchanged at
1.8 per cent year-on-year, and by foreign buying, traders said. Moreover,
last week's successful bond auction has lent the market a healthier tone, a
dealer said.
UK gilts also had a strong day, boosted by buoyant continental European
markets and overseas investor buying. The September long gilt futures
contract on Liffe rose by points to 101 3/4 .
The market was further cheered by a Gallup report of leading UK investment
funds for Smith New Court, which showed that many fund managers are becoming
increasingly bullish about gilts and view the market's recent weakness as a
buying opportunity.
German government bonds also benefited from the flight to safety by
investors. The September bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.83 points
to 93.32.

forint interest futures

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Budapest Commodities Exchange (BCE) will introduce trading in
forint-denominated interest rate futures in October, the exchange's head
said, Reuter reports from Budapest.
The futures are expected to be for three months, with six-month and
nine-month versions to be introduced at a later date, said Mr Szergej
Keresztesi, chief executive of Arutozsde, which operates the exchange.
Because of uncertainty about the central bank's interest rate policy and
future inflation, setting medium-term rates is a risky exercise for
Hungarian banks, Mr Keresztesi said.
However, interest rate futures will allow banks and businesses to hedge
themselves against the uncertainty, he added.
'(With the introduction of the futures) the risk will disappear for the
banks . . . and for the general population as well,' he told reporters.
The smallest underlying amount of a contract will be Ft1m. Purchases on
margin will be allowed. Settlement will be in cash.
The new contracts are the latest innovation from the BCE, which now trades
grain, meat and foreign exchange contracts.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Traders brace themselves for a rush of
new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders are bracing themselves for a rush of new issues this week, despite
continuing nervousness in the world's government bond markets.
To start the week, Italy's Dollars 4bn offering of floating-rate notes in
dollars, D-Marks and yen was officially launched, and is due to be priced
today.
The Dollars 1.5bn portion denominated in US dollars will have a discounted
margin of 11 to 13 basis points over Libor, while the D-Mark tranche,
totalling DM1.25bn, will be priced to give a discounted margin of 12 to 14
basis points over Libor.
The smaller size and more generous indicated pricing of the D-Mark portion
reflects the weaker demand for D-Mark FRNs following last week's large
offering by Portugal.
In order to entice investors, the first coupon will be set over six-month
rather than three-month D-Mark Libor, because many investors expect rates to
fall within six months. However, dealers said there is still some way to go
before the issue is fully placed.
The yen tranche, the largest of the three at Y175bn, will be priced at 8 to
10 basis points over Libor. The larger size and tighter pricing of the yen
tranche reflects the strength of demand, mainly from Japan where investors
still have a lot of cash to invest in the market, according to one of the
lead managers.
That tranche has already been exhausted, dealers said. 'The easiest sales
were into Japan, which is not surprising given the current strength of the
yen,' said one trader.
All three tranches will pay  1/16 point over Libor, but their issue prices
will differ.
Also in the yen sector, the Kingdom of Spain launched a Y150bn issue of
10-year bonds, priced to yield 25 basis points over the comparable Japanese
government bond yield, via Nikko Europe.
Dealers said the fixed-rate offering was targeted at a totally different
group of investors, so the issue did not compete for attention with Italy's
floating-rate transaction.
However, the 10-year maturity of the Spanish deal proved a deterrent for
some investors, given the recent bond market volatility. In addition, there
is some concern about the volume of paper in the yen sector.
As well as a spate of smaller offerings last week and yesterday, Credit
Foncier de France is expected to launch a Y75bn to Y100bn deal, also
maturing in 10 years, later this week.
However, dealers said the Japanese are still keen buyers of yen assets at
the right price. The yield spread on the Spain issue widened by one basis
point to 26 basis points, according to lead manager Nikko.
Still to come in the dollar sector are global offerings of Dollars 1bn to
Dollars 1.5bn for Finland today and Dollars 1.5bn for Freddie Mac, the US
agency, by Wednesday.
Dealers said sales of these transactions are likely to be skewed towards the
US as European investors could be discouraged by the continued weakness of
the dollar.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Hindalco prices global
offering

<TEXT>
Hindalco, India's largest private-sector producer of aluminium, has priced
its Dollars 100m offering of global depositary receipts (GDRs).
The Hindalco GDRs were priced at Dollars 24, compared with a local closing
price on Thursday of Rs825 (Dollars 26.26), which represents a discount of
8.5 per cent. The GDRs are currently trading at Dollars 25, according to
lead manager Lehman Brothers.
The deal is one of a handful of offerings by Indian companies to have been
completed since the Indian government was forced in May to postpone a
planned Dollars 1bn issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the
state-controlled telecommunications monopoly, when investors balked at the
proposed pricing.
Since then, most deals have been priced at a discount of 5 to 15 per cent
below the market rate.
Also in the pipeline is a Dollars 100m issue of GDRs plus warrants for Tata
Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), via CS First Boston. A number of
other deals are planned, but dealers said that only specialist fund managers
are currently buying paper.
The National Stock Exchange, which opened for business in Bombay last week,
has given a new lease of life to the Indian debt market, writes Naazneen
Karmali in Bombay.
Since its launch, the NSE has recorded transactions worth Rs300m, a rather
insignificant amount compared with the Rs2bn of deals traded daily by
stockbrokers over the telephone.
However, Dr RH Patil, NSE's managing director, estimates that daily volume
will be in the region of Rs5bn by year-end.
Set up at a cost of Rs250m, the NSE has been promoted by a consortium of
insurance companies, financial institutions and commercial banks.

DHL Worldwide Express, the international express mail courier, is
negotiating to buy a minority interest in Philippine Airlines (PAL), the
country's flag carrier.
DHL is negotiating for a bloc of shares in the airline currently held by
three state institutions: Philippine National Bank, Development Bank of the
Philippines, and AFP Retirement and Separation Benefits System.
The three institutions own 20 per cent of PR Holdings, the consortium that
acquired 67 per cent of PAL for 9bn pesos (Dollars 334m) in a public offer
in January 1992. The 20 per cent holding in PR Holdings represents a 13 per
cent ownership of PAL.
DHL's interest in PAL was apparently prompted by the 1992 decision of rival
Federal Express to establish a hub for its Asian operations at the Subic Bay
freeport zone, the former US naval base. A tie-up would also expand DHL's
involvement in the airline industry.
The express courier company, based in Brussels, already has equity interests
in Guam-based Continental Air Micronesia.
On the other hand, PAL stands to gain, according to industry experts, from
DHL's business in cargo-handling in the US.
An earlier bid by Brunei Investment Agency, which is described as an
investment entity of the Sultan of Brunei, failed to take off because the
group also owns a majority stake in Malaysian Airlines, which PAL regards as
a competitor in regional traffic.

<TEXT>
Reliance Industries, the Indian petrochemicals and textiles conglomerate,
yesterday said it was one of five contenders chosen by the Indian government
to explore and develop potential diamond mines in the central Indian state
of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional diamond mining area.
De Beers, the international diamond group, was among the bidders which made
presentations to the state government last week. The contract is likely to
be awarded later this month, and the successful bidder is expected to spend
Rs1.5bn (USDollars 48m) on the exploration and development of diamond
deposits.
Reliance, India's largest private sector company, has also bid for a
facility to produce methane gas from coal in Mehsana district, in Gujarat
state. The company will spend Rs150m for the initial exploration required,
if its bid is successful.
The Indian government recently liberalised the country's coal, gold and
other mining industries. They were formerly under the tight control of the
government.
Reliance's forays into mining follow its successful bid earlier this year to
develop three medium-sized oil and gas fields off India's west coast
together with Enron, the US power company. Reliance's 9m tonne crude
petroleum refinery is being set up in nearby Jamnagar at a cost of
Rs51.42bn, which was raised through an ambitious public issue last year.
Reliance yesterday declared its audited results for the year ended March 31
1994, saying it had established a record total income of Rs54.61bn.
A company spokesman said Reliance was now 'India's largest corporation in
terms of sales, operating profit, cash profit, net profit, net worth and
assets'.

production setbacks

<TEXT>
Gold Fields of South Africa reported a decline in after-tax profit to
R392.3m (Dollars 106.6m) for the June quarter, from R441.1m in the previous
quarter. The fall, which came in spite of a higher gold price received, was
due largely to election-related work stoppages and public holidays which
depressed production.
Tons milled dropped to 3.19m from 3.31m in the March quarter, while gold
production dipped to 29,721kg from 30,982kg. Working costs per kilogram rose
to R25,265 from R23,410 and working profit declined to R543.3m from R582.2m,
largely as a result of the lower throughput. Capital expenditure rose R70m
to R203m.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said that it had been an 'eventful
quarter' and that the six public holidays had depressed production while
increasing working costs because of extra overtime pay.
Of the group's mines, Kloof performed best. In spite of a drop in ore
milled, due to a 10-day work stoppage in May, it was able to take advantage
of a higher yield and better gold price to maintain pre-tax profit at
R194.5m, close to the previous quarter's R194.4m.
Driefontein, the group's other big producer, was also affected by industrial
action. However, a continuation of abnormally high yields at its East
Driefontein division meant pre-tax profit dipped only slightly, to R396.8m
from R405.8m in March.
However, the group's two smaller mines had a harder time. Although it
managed to increase tonnage, a lower yield meant Doornfontein reported a
R12.6m loss on the quarter following a R4.5m profit previously, although
this figure was distorted by a R6m payout following a court action by former
employees.
Deelkraal's after tax profit was up at R15.7m from R15.67m, but this was
largely due to a R8m tax credit, and pre-tax profit was sharply down at
R9.1m from R21.1m.

a decline of 67 per cent, a statement released by the company said, Reuter
reports from Jerusalem.
Company officials attributed the sharp downturn in profits to increased
competition, which they believed would continue into 1994.
Regarding prospects for the current year, Mr Rafi Harlev, president of the
airline, said: '1994 promises to be a more challenging year for El Al than
last year, as competition in the Israeli market has grown considerably and
the government has announced plans to privatise the airline.'

Reliance yesterday declared its audited results for the year ended March 31

A spokesman for the company said Reliance was now 'India's largest
corporation in terms of sales, operating profit, cash profit, net profit,
net worth and assets'.
The company's directors have recommended a dividend of 51 per cent for the
year, constituting a dividend payout of Rs1.39bn. The dividend, the largest
in the private sector, will be shared by the company's 2.4m shareholders in
India and abroad.

<TEXT>
Net profit at Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium company, almost
halved in the six months to June, reflecting lower sale prices and a
stronger Australian currency.
The company - part of a merger proposal between its two largest
shareholders, Aluminium Company of America and Western Mining Corporation,
the Australian mining group - yesterday reported a decline in earnings to
ADollars 124.7m (USDollars 91.60m) from ADollars 258.4m.
Total revenue fell 7.7 per cent, to ADollars 1.00bn from ADollars 1.09bn.
The company reduced its total dividend payout to ADollars 120m from ADollars
180m and its capital expenditure to ADollars 63.2m from ADollars 85.2m in
the half-year.
Directors said production cuts at the group's smelters caused lower sales of
aluminium ingots, and gold sales volumes were hit by lower ore grades.
But production costs were lower and sales volumes increased for both alumina
and chemicals.
The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 63.8m, down from ADollars
100.8m previously, and depreciation of ADollars 76.8m, against ADollars
73.4m last time.
The previous year's result included a ADollars 59.7m abnormal tax gain.
Meanwhile, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, saw earnings rise to Dollars
45.4m, or 50 cents a share, in the second quarter as the company gained from
cost-cutting and a steady rise in aluminium prices.
Earnings amounted to Dollars 35.3m, or 40 cents a share, in the comparable
1993 quarter.
The company, which is the world's biggest aluminium group, said sales rose
to Dollars 2.5bn in the quarter, up slightly from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago.
The revenue increase came despite a slight drop in aluminium shipments,
which fell to 661,000 tonnes from 670,000 tonnes in the same 1993 quarter.
For the first six months, Alcoa made a net loss of Dollars 62.9m, or 72
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.7bn.
The company fell heavily into the red in the first quarter when charges
relating to production cuts were taken.

Hua Nan Commercial Bank, one of Taiwan's three main government-owned banks
dominating the local market, posted preliminary pre-tax earnings of
NTDollars 6.4bn (USDollars 239m) for the fiscal year ended June 30.
This was an increase of 21 per cent from a year earlier. However, analysts
cautioned that most of the growth had been in the second half of 1993, while
the first half of this year had been stagnant due to slower loan growth and
increasing pressure on interest rate spreads.
The bank also reported revenues of NTDollars 55.8bn, up 4.9 per cent from
1993.
Taiwan's 16 commercial banks set up since 1992 are aggressively expanding,
which will make it increasingly difficult for the three state-run commercial
banks to build their loan portfolios, analysts said.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Eli Lilly to test new formula: Planned purchase comes as the
US drugs industry is reshaping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly's planned purchase of PCS, a pharmacy benefits management company,
looks set to complete the reshaping of a big part of the US drugs
distribution business. If finalised, it will bring to three the number of
benefits managers sold in less than a year, for a total consideration of
around Dollars 13bn.
Two others, Caremark and Value Health, have formed close ties of their own
with drugs manufacturers in recent months, though they have stopped short of
outright sale.
In a low-growth US drugs market, manufacturers hope that control of
distribution will help them gain market share. Pharmacy benefits managers
fill out prescriptions for big buyers of healthcare. Through their
formularies - lists of recommended drugs - they exercise considerable
influence over the drugs patients buy.
According to figures provided by the distributors, their influence on drug
buying habits is growing fast. The five mentioned above claim more than 75m
people on their formularies, accounting for nearly one in three Americans.
PCS, the biggest by this measure, claims 30m people as customers. Its growth
has come from converting existing customers to the formulary approach,
though it has also won some big new contracts.
PCS is widely believed to be less interventionist in its sales of drugs than
rivals like Medco. The Merck subsidiary takes an active approach to doctors'
prescribing habits, telephoning physicians and encouraging them to switch to
Medco-recommended drugs whenever a patient submits a prescription for a drug
not on its formulary. In future, PCS is likely to emulate Medco more
closely. 'They have the informatics capacity to intervene more than they
do,' said Mr James Cornelius, Eli Lilly's chief financial officer.
Eli Lilly probably needed to acquire a pharmacy benefit manager more than
most pharmaceuticals companies. The group's sales growth during the first
quarter this year slowed to only 3 per cent, a far cry from the heady double
digit growth of the early 1990s, and certainly worse than most of its
competitors.
The company has been especially hit by the increasingly acute competitive
environment in the US. All Eli Lilly's most important markets - antibiotics,
anti-depressants and ulcer therapies - have been undermined by price
competition. Bulk purchasers of medicines have effectively made such
products commodities.
Take Prozac, Eli Lilly's top-selling anti-depressant, the first central
nervous system medicine to achieve sales of more than Dollars 1bn. Although
Prozac was first into the market, a slew of competitors such as Pfizer's
Zoloft and SmithKline Beecham's Paxil have undermined the drug's growth.
Eli Lilly has also performed poorly in the increasingly difficult antibiotic
market, Ceclor, the group's top-selling antibiotic, lost its US patent
protection in 1992, and posted sales down 9.5 per cent to Dollars 515m.
Successor drug Lorabid has proved disappointing.
Finally, Axid, the company's fourth most important medicine, continues to
compete in an increasingly turbulent anti-ulcer market. SmithKline Beecham's
competitor product Tagamet, lost US patent protection in May. Early data
suggest Axid's share of new prescriptions is falling.
The theory put forward yesterday by Mr Randall Tobias, Eli Lilly's chairman
and chief executive, is that PCS Health Systems can offset this increasingly
difficult environment.
It remains to be seen, though, whether the pharmacy benefits managers can
sustain the difficult balancing act of pushing one manufacturer's products
while at the same time convincing their customers that they are providing
the best drug at the best price to each patient. PCS yesterday said that its
acquisition by Eli Lilly would make no difference to the selection of drugs
on its formulary, for instance - though such a stance seems disingenuous
given Eli Lilly's willingness to pay Dollars 4bn in cash for the
distributor.
Judging by Wall Street's initial reaction yesterday, Eli Lilly is paying too
much to secure this line of distribution. The slide in its share price and
the prospect of a ratings downgrade reflected a general belief that the deal
would weaken the company financially and fail to produce sufficient sales
growth to justify the price tag.
Some of the cash should come from future sales of businesses. Mr Cornelius
said the company plans to raise Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m after tax from the
sale of its 40 per cent stake in Elanco, an agricultural products company
jointly owned with Dow Chemical. An approach has been made to Dow, which has
first right to buy the stake. A further Dollars 1bn will come from the
previously announced flotation or sale of the company's diagnostics
businesses, which will be completed by the end of this year, Mr Cornelius
said.
With around Dollars 1bn in cash and slightly more than Dollars 1bn in debt
at the moment, Lilly's balance sheet can bear the strain of Dollars 4bn of
new debt. After paying off Dollars 1.5bn from the proceeds of sales, it
would be left with a debt/equity ratio of around 40 per cent, Mr Cornelius
said.
It will take time for the financial ramifications of the deal to turn
positive, though - even based on Lilly's assumptions. According to the
company, it will not be until 1997 that higher sales as a result of the PCS
acquisition begin to outweigh the extra debt-servicing costs.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Delta to shed 4,500 more
full-time jobs

<TEXT>
Delta Air Lines, the third biggest US airline, yesterday announced it was
cutting 4,500 full-time jobs from its airport customer service division
during the next 12 months.
The cuts are part of a drastic restructuring, announced in April, under
which Delta hopes to cut Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs in an
attempt to overcome competition from low-cost US carriers, such as Southwest
Airlines.
Delta's airport customer service division is responsible for baggage and
cargo handling, aircraft refuelling, customer service at the ticket counter
and some administrative functions. It employs 21,000 worldwide.
The airline aims to achieve a 20 per cent cut in the division's workforce by
requiring staff to work more flexible hours, including split shifts;
requiring them to do other people's jobs as well as their own when they are
not busy; making more use of part-time workers; and sub-contracting work to
outside companies.
Delta said it hoped to achieve the job cuts through a combination of
voluntary severance, leave of absence and early retirement. Compulsory
redundancy would be used if necessary.
The cuts follow Delta's announcement last month that it was to shed 2,500
jobs from its technical operations division, which is responsible for
maintenance.
Together, the announcements take the company half-way towards its targeted
cut of between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs from the workforce of 73,000 in the
next three years.
Delta's goal is to reduce costs per available seat mile from 9.26 cents last
year to 7.5 cents by 1997. That figure will be almost on a par with
Southwest's 7.2 cents.
Delta has already shed more than 7,400 jobs since June 1992, and last
February it cut employees' pay by 5 per cent. Only its 8,500 pilots belong
to a union, so it has largely avoided labour strife to date.

Eli Lilly's planned purchase of PCS, a pharmacy benefits management company
which is part of McKesson, the US healthcare group, looks set to complete
the reshaping of the US retail drugs distribution business.
If finalised, it will bring to three the number of benefit managers sold in
less than a year, for a total consideration of around Dollars 13bn (Merck
paid Dollars 6.7bn for Medco last autumn, while SmithKline Beecham has
agreed to buy Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn).
Two others, Caremark and Value Health, have formed close ties of their own
with drugs manufacturers in recent months, though they have stopped short of
outright sale.
In a low-growth US drugs market, manufacturers hope that control of
distribution will help them gain market share.
Pharmacy benefits managers fill out prescriptions for big buyers of
healthcare, such as the Blue Cross/Blue Shield organisations which provide
health coverage at state level to many Americans, or companies which pay for
their workers' healthcare benefits.
Through their formularies - lists of recommended drugs - they exercise
considerable influence over the drugs patients buy.
According to figures provided by the distributors, their influence on drug
buying habits is growing fast. The five mentioned above claim more than 75m
people on their formularies, accounting for nearly one in three Americans.
PCS, the biggest by this measure, claims 30m people.
It also has one of the fastest-growing customer lists (the number of people
on its formularies has grown around 50 per cent in the past year). Much of
this growth has come from converting existing customers to the formulary
approach, though PCS has also won some big new contracts: this year, for
instance, it added nearly 1m people with the BlueCross/Blue Shield of North
Carolina.
Eli Lilly probably needed to acquire a pharmacy benefit manager more than
most pharmaceuticals companies. Its sales growth during the first quarter
this year slowed to only 3 per cent, a far cry from the heady double-digit
growth of the early 1990s, and certainly worse than most of its competitors.
The company has been especially hit by the increasingly acute competitive
environment in the US. Eli Lilly's most important markets - antibiotics,
anti-depressants and ulcer therapies - have been undermined by price
competition. Bulk purchasers of medicines have in effect made such products
commodities.
For example, Prozac, Eli Lilly's top-selling anti-depressant, was the first
central nervous system medicine to achieve sales of more than Dollars 1bn.
Although Prozac was first into the market, a raft of competitors such as
Pfizer's Zoloft, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil, and American Home Product's
Effexor, have undermined the drug's growth. Allegations by the Church Of
Scientology that the medicine can cause suicidal and violent behaviour have
also affected volumes.
Eli Lilly has also performed poorly in the increasingly difficult antibiotic
market.
Ceclor, the group's top-selling antibiotic, lost its US patent protection in
1992, and posted sales down 9.5 per cent to Dollars 515m. The successor
drug, Lorabid, has proved disappointing.
Finally, Axid, the company's fourth most important medicine, continues to
compete in an increasingly turbulent anti-ulcer market. Tagamet, SmithKline
Beecham's competitor product, lost US patent protection in May. Early data
suggest Axid's share of new prescriptions is falling.
Eli Lilly has responded by increasing its research and development
investment to create new drugs that would be less susceptible to price
competition. R&amp;D investment rose 10 per cent to Dollars 955m in 1993, and by
an estimated 7 per cent to Dollars 1.020bn this year.
However, there are few new drugs in the pipeline, according to analysts.
The theory put forward yesterday by Mr Randall Tobias, Eli Lilly's chairman
and chief executive, is that PCS Health Systems can offset this increasingly
difficult environment.
It remains to be seen, though, whether the pharmacy benefits managers can
sustain the difficult balancing act of pushing one manufacturer's products
while convincing their customers that they are providing the best drug at
the best price to each patient.
PCS yesterday said its acquisition by Eli Lilly would make no difference to
the selection of drugs on its formulary, for instance - though such a stance
seems disingenuous, given Eli Lilly's willingness to pay Dollars 4bn in cash
for the distributor.
Judging by Wall Street's initial reaction yesterday, Eli Lilly is paying too
much to secure this line of distribution.
The slide in its share price and the prospect of a ratings downgrade reflect
a general belief the deal will weaken the company financially and fail to
produce sufficient sales growth to justify the price tag.
Some of the cash should come from sales of businesses. Eli Lilly said it was
continuing with its plan to concentrate on pharmaceuticals by floating five
of its nine medical devices businesses during the fourth quarter this
financial year. The remaining operations will be sold separately. However,
the company still expects to borrow some Dollars 2.5bn to finance its
acquisition.

chief executive
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bata, the family-owned footwear group, has brought in an outsider as chief
executive for the first time in its 100-year history.
Mr Stanley Heath, executive vice-president of Nabisco International, the
international food arm of RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and consumer products
group, will move to Toronto next month as Bata's president and chief
executive.
Mr Heath's appointment coincides with the retirement of Mr Thomas Bata Sr as
chairman. Mr Bata, who rebuilt the family shoe empire in Canada after
leaving his native Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s, ahead of the Nazi
occupation, will be 80 in September.
Mr Bata will be succeeded as chairman by his son Tom. The younger Bata has
been chief executive for the past nine years, but is considered a less
forceful and effective manager than his father.
Bata owns about 40 shoe factories and more than 6,000 shops around the
world, selling 300m pairs of shoes a year. The company has never disclosed
revenues, profits or market share, and members of the Bata family have
generally confined their public profile to philanthropic and other
non-business interests.
Mr Bata Sr has played a prominent role in recent years in the reconstruction
of the Czech and Slovak economies. The family business was one of the
biggest in pre-war Czechoslovakia, but was taken over by the communists in
the late 1940s.
Mr Heath, aged 56, is an Englishman who is fluent in French and Spanish and
has a reputation as a bright and easy-going manager. His biggest challenges
are to revive morale among Bata's senior management, and strengthen the
company's presence in fast-growing markets, especially eastern Europe and
south-east Asia.
Bata has faced increasing competition in recent years from low-cost shoe
factories in countries where it has had little presence, such as China and
Taiwan.
It has also sought to break into the countries of the former Soviet Union,
which are viewed by Mr Bata Sr as one of the few remaining vacuums in the
international shoe business.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dell Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, is withdrawing from
the retail stores distribution channel in order to focus on direct sales via
mail and telephone.
It said retail sales 'have never been more than 10 per cent of our business'
and the company had been winding down its retail distribution over recent
months. Retail sales are expected to contribute less than 2 per cent of
revenues in the current quarter, it added.
The move reflects intense competition among the largest US PC companies for
shelf space at computer 'superstores' and Dell's struggle to increase profit
margins after losses in the last fiscal year.
For the year ending January 31, Dell reported a net loss of Dollars 35.8m,
or Dollars 1.06 per share, on sales of Dollars 2.87bn. Dell is the
fifth-largest PC manufacturer, according to Dataquest, a market research
company.
Dell said direct sales 'offer the opportunity for more robust profit
margins' and play to Dell's strengths. The Texas-based company pioneered
mail and telephone sales of personal computers in the late 1980s.

<TEXT>
Alusuisse, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and chemicals group, is to sell
its lossmaking US aluminium business, Consolidated Aluminium Corporation
(Conalco). The buyer is Ormet Corporation, the fourth-largest producer of
primary aluminium in the US.
The sale, for an undisclosed price, marks a further step in Alusuisse's
strategy to reduce dependence on aluminium, which is suffering from
overcapacity and depressed prices. The weighting of the group's aluminium
division has shrunk from over two thirds of sales in 1988 to an estimated 43
per cent this year.
Analysts are predicting a strong revival in company profits after
disappointing results in 1993, when net income slid 31 per cent to SFr83m
(Dollars 62.6m) on sales of SFr6.2bn.
Alusuisse said yesterday it planned to focus its North American activities
on expanding its profitable packaging and chemicals businesses.
Conalco employs some 1,400 and has production plants in four US states.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Victoire reshuffles capital for
CU deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Victoire, the French insurer, plans to reshuffle its share structure and
distribute FFr4.11bn in bonus shares and dividends to shareholders in
preparation for its takeover by Commercial Union of the UK.
Commercial Union last month ended months of negotiations by clinching a
FFr12.5bn (Dollars 2.24bn) deal to buy the bulk of Victoire's interests from
Suez, the French holding company that owns 89 per cent of the insurance
company.
Before completing the deal Victoire must restructure its equity base and
redistribute the proceeds raised by the disposal late last year of its
interest in the Vinci insurance group. The buyer was Union des Assurances de
Paris (UAP).
The share restructuring will involve doubling the nominal value of
Victoire's 22.5m existing shares to FFr200 in a two-for-one exchange.
The value of Victoire's share capital will then be increased to FFr2.73bn
from FFr2.25bn by issuing 13 new bonus shares to investors for every 60
shares held.
Victoire's shareholders will also receive a special dividend of FFr1.3bn.
The company will then distribute to shareholders the FFr2.89bn interest in
UAP that it received in payment for the Vinci deal.
The news of the Victoire transaction coincides with mounting speculation
that Allianz, the powerful German insurer once seen as a prospective buyer
of Victoire, is in talks with Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank,
over a co-operative venture in France.
Credit Lyonnais is known to be interested in forging links with a large
insurance group following the failure of plans to form a co-operative
venture with Assurances Generales de France.
Allianz yesterday declined to comment on German press reports that it had
begun talks with Credit Lyonnais.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Executive bail-out holds TWA
off-course - How does an airline lose five top men in a few months?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To lose one top executive is unfortunate: to lose two, it might be said,
looks like carelessness. How, then, does one describe the loss of five in a
matter of months?
Since coming out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of last
year, Trans World Airlines, the seventh-biggest US airline, has seen an
exodus of senior managers.
In January, it lost a chairman and a vice-chairman; in May, it lost its
senior vice-president for marketing; last month, its chief financial officer
quit; and last week another vice-chairman resigned.
A favourable interpretation of such a rapid turnover might be that the
newly-resurgent company is clearing the decks to make way for fresh talent.
Given the company's precarious financial condition, however, it is equally
tempting to ask whether it is a case of executives leaving a sinking ship.
Once one of the world's biggest and best-known airlines, TWA first ran into
trouble in the 1980s, when losses in the deregulated US market started to
outweigh profits from its international operations.
Bad turned to worse when Mr Carl Icahn, the one-time corporate raider, took
over the airline in a leveraged buy-out in 1988, adding hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of borrowings to the balance sheet. With the airline
industry as a whole struggling, TWA was dragged into bankruptcy in 1992 by
the cost of servicing its debt.
When the airline emerged from Chapter 11 last November, it was under
different ownership. As part of the rescue plan, employees agreed to swap
some Dollars 660m worth of labour concessions for 45 per cent of the
company's shares. The remaining 55 per cent went to the creditors.
TWA also emerged with a management team aimed at accommodating the differing
perspectives of its new owners.
Mr Glenn Zander, one of the two TWA executives who had been running the
company while it was in Chapter 11, was seen by the labour unions as too
hard. Mr Robin Wilson, the other, was seen by the creditors as too soft. So,
both were made vice-chairmen, and an outsider was appointed above them: Mr
William Howard, a 71-year-old airline industry veteran, who became chairman
and chief executive.
Unfortunately, this seemingly happy compromise was a spectacular failure.
The airline missed its financial targets, squabbles about strategy burst
into the open and, just six months after the team's installation, Mr Howard
and Mr Zander resigned.
In January, Mr Howard was replaced as chairman by a non-executive member of
the board: Mr Donald Craib, a former chairman and chief executive of
Allstate Insurance with no previous airline experience.
One of Mr Craib's first decisions was to bring in an experienced airline
boss as chief executive: Mr Jeffrey Erickson, the tough-talking chief
executive of the upstart US airline Reno Air.
Since joining TWA in April, Mr Erickson's determination to stamp his
authority on the airline has seen off the other vice-chairman and two more
senior executives. 'I am building my own management team, and you can't do
that without people leaving,' he said.
Hence, the clearing-of-the-decks analogy stands up better than that of the
sinking ship. Yet there is no doubt TWA has financial problems. Last week
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded the airline's
senior secured debt to triple C, and revised its ratings outlook on the
airline to negative. Mr Philip Baggaley, S&amp;P's airline industry analyst,
says the company could run out of cash this winter.
Although TWA has gone a long way towards overcoming the poor reputation for
service it earned in the Icahn years, fierce competition from other airlines
is preventing it from meeting its revenue targets. And, with one of the
highest cost structures in the US airline industry, it is ill-equipped to
fight a fares war.
In the quarter to March, TWA incurred net losses of Dollars 124.4m. More
important, at the end of the quarter it had only Dollars 135m in cash. All
its credit facilities are drawn and, with virtually all its assets pledged,
it cannot raise more funds. Next January, it is due to repay some Dollars
190m worth of debt extended by Mr Icahn. Clearly, it will be unable to do
so, though equally clearly it will hope to extend or refinance the loans.
If TWA survives the lean winter period, other problems lie ahead. In the
middle of next year, its labour concessions expire.
Its airliner fleet, one of the oldest in the US, is long overdue for
renewal. Its only hub - St Louis, Missouri - serves a relatively small
segment of the US market, and suffers competition from the low-cost
Southwest Airlines. Its few remaining transatlantic routes are weak.
TWA is fighting back with an efficiency drive aimed at lopping Dollars 135m
a year off operating costs.
However, some Wall Street analysts say employee ownership could prevent the
company from making the staffing cuts it needs to survive. Nearly all of
them rate it as the US airline least likely to be around in five years.
Mr Erickson retorts: 'I am here to prove them wrong.' However, he does not
rule out the possibility that TWA could change a lot in the meantime.
Nothing is sacred, he says. Some routes - including the transatlantic ones -
could be cut. Others will be added.
'You have to respond to what the marketplace wants,' Mr Erickson says. 'I
think the final chapter in the 15-year saga of US air deregulation is being
written now, and the airlines that respond to the marketplace in this final
chapter are likely to be around. My job is to make sure we're one of them.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Report expected to lambast
Credit Lyonnais team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French parliament will today publish an official inquiry into the
problems of Credit Lyonnais, the beleaguered banking group. The report is
understood to be fiercely critical of both the regulatory authorities and of
the management team led by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the bank's former chairman.
Credit Lyonnais, a public-sector company which is one of Europe's biggest
banks, was forced earlier this year to ask the government to support a
FFr44.9bn (Dollars 8.3bn) financial rescue to repair its balance sheet,
after running up a net loss for 1993 of FFr6.9bn.
The government immediately formed a parliamentary committee of inquiry led
by Mr Philippe Seguin, the outspoken president of the National Assembly, to
investigate the causes of the bank's difficulties. Although the inquiry is
believed to be critical of the French treasury for its failure to heed
warnings about Credit Lyonnais, it is understood to have identified Mr
Haberer as the chief architect of the bank's shortcomings.
Mr Haberer, who was appointed chairman in 1988 by the then-socialist
government and ousted from Credit Lyonnais last autumn by the new
conservative administration, is thought to have been accused of
mismanagement but cleared of any personal misappropriation of funds.
French press reports suggest the inquiry is critical of Mr Haberer's
draconian management style, and of the failure of his management team to
make full reports to the state on Credit Lyonnais's problems. These included
its exposure to MGM, the crippled Hollywood movie studio, and to Sasea, the
Swiss holding company which subsequently collapsed.
Mr Haberer has, since the announcement of the rescue package, been removed
from his state-appointed post as chairman of Credit National, another French
banking group. A number of his senior executives at Credit Lyonnais have
also left the bank following the arrival last autumn of Mr Jean Peyrelevade
as its new chairman.
However Mr Peyrelevade, who orchestrated the FFr44.9bn rescue package, is
reported to have clashed with the government over the level of provisions he
plans to report for the first half of this year.
Societe Generale last week forecast that Credit Lyonnais, which had
initially been expected to break even in 1994, would instead report a net
loss of around FFr1bn for the year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Debt reduction helps lift net at
France Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications operator, yesterday
announced a sharp jump in net profits for last year, to FFr4.8bn (Dollars
888.8m) from FFr3.3bn in 1992.
The increase was achieved on a slight rise in sales, from FFr122.6bn to
FFr127bn, and reflected a fall in financial charges as the operator pursued
a policy of debt-reduction.
At the end of last year, group borrowings were down to FFr105.6bn, compared
with FFr111.6bn at the same time in 1992.
As a result, financial charges fell to 6.9 per cent of sales, against 8.4
per cent the previous year. There was a FFr15.2bn payment to the state, the
same as in 1992.
France Telecom said the rise in sales, which confirmed its position as the
world's fourth-largest telecoms group after NTT of Japan, Deutsche Telekom
and AT&amp;T of the US, was achieved against a background of depressed demand in
France.
Considering the difficult environment, it said the improved revenues
reflected the impact of new products such as Itineris and Bi-Bop, its mobile
telephone services.
Itineris, which operates a mobile radio-telephone service, had 78,700
subscribers at the end of last year. Meanwhile, Bi-Bop, which requires the
user to be near a base station, had 38,000 subscribers. Both services have
seen strong growth.
The group also saw continued growth in its Minitel teletext activities.
Subscriptions rose to 6.5m from 6.3m, while the number of services available
on Minitel rose to 23,000.
France Telecom plans to pursue its strategy of reducing debt, while seeking
partnerships in its core telecommunications activities, and in new areas
such as multimedia.
Last month, it announced the formation of a partnership with Deutsche
Telekom and Sprint of the US to provide services to multinational clients.
This represented an extension of the French operator's existing alliance
with Deutsche Telekom, agreed in 1993.
The alliances do not yet involve equity participations, partly because of
France Telecom's public-sector status.
Plans to reform this status, a necessary step before any eventual
privatisation, have been delayed while the proposal is discussed with
unions.

<TEXT>
Select Appointments (Holdings) has announced its fifth overseas acquisition
in the past year, with the purchase of Canadian recruitment company,
Reliance Resources Group, for up to CDollars 5.5m (Pounds 2.6m).

and managing director of Reliance, Mr Dave McDougall.
Select, which has been 90 per cent owned by a Swiss investor group since
1991, has also undertaken to procure the repayment of loans made to Reliance
by the vendor, not exceeding CDollars 1m.
In the year ended April 30 1993, Reliance reported sales of CDollars 19.3m
and profits before tax and Mr McDougall's remuneration of CDollars 1.2m.
Select reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 642,000 (Pounds 950,000) in 1993, on
turnover 60 per cent higher at Pounds 34.9m.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Charter to reduce links with S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of shares held by South African investors in Charter will
fall from 20 per cent to 16 per cent as a result of last month's Pounds 93m
rights issue by the diversified industrial conglomerate.
Exchange controls prevent South Africans taking up their rights in the
1-for-4 issue, made to help fund Charter's recommended Pounds 390m offer for
Esab, the Swedish manufacturer of welding products.
The rights issue was in the form of an entitlement to Charter convertible
stock units. The prospectus said South Africans would be able to sell their
entitlements, nil paid, in London but if they did so they would be obliged
to repatriate the proceeds to South Africa in commercial rands.
The South African authorities have now granted a listing for all the units
in Johannesburg in nil-paid form with effect from yesterday, so investors
will be able to sell their shares without suffering any adverse currency
effect.
The acquisition, which more than doubles the size of Charter, is the
culmination of a restructuring which last year unwound its links with Anglo
American Corporation, the South African mining group, by unscrambling its
ties with Johnson Matthey and Minorco.
Charter's offer was agreed by Incentive, the Swedish investment group and
Esab's biggest shareholder, which speaks for 49 per cent of the voting
rights. Charter has since bought shares in the market to increase the share
of Esab's voting rights it has secured to 52.7 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AG Barr tops Pounds 2m and pins hopes on
good summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company which manufactures Irn-Bru
and Tizer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.23m for the six
months to April 30 1994, compared with restated profits of Pounds 1.61m for
the equivalent period of 1992-93.
The restatement, from Pounds 2.1m, follows a decision to apportion marketing
expenditure according to turnover levels instead of charging it when it
occurs.
Turnover fell 4.5 per cent to Pounds 40.1m as the company turned away
business in retailers' own label brands because of the low prices on offer
from the big supermarket chains. Own label brands normally make up about 10
per cent of Barr's turnover.
Mr Robin Barr, executive chairman, said current pricing levels were too low
to provide manufacturers with a satisfactory long-term return. Competition
in own label brands was intensified by the introduction in April of
Sainsbury's Classic Cola.
AG Barr says its own brands, where profit margins are higher, had a 2.5 per
cent sales increase in the half year.
Mr Barr said turnover during the first nine weeks of the second half had
followed the same pattern as that of the first. But he hoped the recent warm
weather, particularly in the south of England, presaged better weather for
the rest of the summer.
Last year's poor summer had had a disastrous effect on sales, he said.
Earnings per share emerged at 7.95p against a restated 5.91p and the interim
divi-dend is being increased to 2p (1.75p).
The shares closed up 7p at 346p.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Loss of Pounds 1.5m for Drew Scientific
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drew Scientific, the medical technology company which was forced to issue a
profits warning six months after its stock market launch last year, turned
in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.49m for the year to March 31 against a
comparable profit of Pounds 151,000.
'The loss for the second half was less than the first but remained
substantial,' said Mr Trevor Barker, chairman, who also announced his own
retirement through ill-health. He will remain a non-executive director and
will be replaced as chairman by Mr Bill Fulton.
The problems associated with the Glycomat testing equipment, which led to
the product being temporarily suspended and resulted in the profits warning
have now been corrected. Sales improved in the second half, but have been
particularly disappointing in the US and Japan.
Turnover was Pounds 977,000 (Pounds 1.72m).
The loss was stated after charging research and development spending of
Pounds 503,000.
Losses per share came out at 6.1p. The shares closed down 4p at 40p.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Motor boost helps DC Cook to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial upturn in its motor division enabled DC Cook Holdings to
report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.21m for the year to April 30 compared
with losses of Pounds 132,000, restated for FRS 3.
There was also a Pounds 576,000 fall in interest payable to Pounds 908,000
as borrowings were cut over the period by Pounds 670,000 bringing gearing
down to 60 per cent.
However the results were held back by increased losses in the UK and Spanish
property divisions. The UK side, which includes the shopping centres, saw
losses increase from Pounds 498,000 to Pounds 585,000. In Spain, where no
sales were completed during the year, there was a loss of Pounds 629,000,
compared with profits of Pounds 130,000.
Mr Derek Cook, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said that motor turnover
was up 40 per cent with the numbers of new cars sold up by 21 per cent and
used cars rising by 32 per cent.
The division's operating profit advanced to Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 2.95m) with
margins rising from 2.9 to 3.9 per cent.
Group turnover was up 33 per cent at Pounds 143.4m (Pounds 108m). Earnings
per share came out at 3.6p (0.44p). A final dividend of 0.7p is recommended
making a total for the year of 1p (0.6p).
On prospects Mr Cook said the motor division was continuing its strong
performance with new car sales in May up 52 per cent compared with an
overall national rise of 10 per cent. He was also confident that there would
be an improvement in the non-motor activities having substantially reduced
UK property stocks and adapted to changed trading conditions in Spain.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard rises 30% to Pounds 15.9m -
Company wins greater market share and makes significant volume gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ellis &amp; Everard rose 16p to 225p yesterday after the chemicals
distributor defied historic lows in the price of some industrial chemicals
with a 30 per cent profits increase.
The Bradford-based group saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 12.2m to
Pounds 15.9m after winning greater market share and making significant
volume gains in the year to April 30.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by a strong performance in the US, where
operating profits rose 23 per cent to Dollars 12.2m (Pounds 8m), against
Dollars 9.9m, on turnover of Dollars 363.4m (Dollars 352.4m).
The group also made a Pounds 700,000 gain on favourable currency
transactions, which helped offset an average 5 per cent fall in chemical
prices.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said the results had pushed the company into
fifth position in the league of leading distributors and pledged to improve
that ranking with further investment in facilities in Cleveland and Atlanta.
In the UK, operating profits rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 10.7m despite low
prices, especially for products such as anti-freeze and caustic soda.
Mr Wood said the figures had been held back by flat operating profits of
Pounds 600,000 in Ireland and increased losses of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds
200,000) in its swimming pools equipment and chemicals business.
However, turnover rose from Pounds 171.1m to Pounds 183.5m and he predicted
'significant future benefits' from Ronmar Plastics, the polymer distributor
acquired for Pounds 1.2m in January.
The group also acquired three US businesses - Metrochem, Tristate and
Trinity - but overall capital expenditure fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds
8.8m as the tough pricing environment delayed expansion plans.
Those plans, including the redevelopment of its South Yorkshire storage tank
facility, are expected to be completed this year following a recent upturn
in chemical prices.
Earnings per share rose by 30 per cent to 13.4p (10.3p) and the prospect of
a recovery in prices persuaded the company to lift its final dividend to
5.15p, making 7.6p (7.05p) for the year. Shareholders have been offered a
scrip alternative for the second successive year.
COMMENT
The international distributor has moved swiftly to shore up its activities
after seeing chemical prices fall by 25 per cent against the 1990 average.
It has delayed some large capital spending, overhauled its sales team and
forged partnerships with suppliers such as BP and customers including
Nutrasweet and Indchem. This has reduced its exposure to price volatility,
while also ensuring a product range wide enough to reduce the burden of
environmental regulations on some of its facilities. With prices moving
upwards, profits this year are expected to reach Pounds 18.3m on a multiple
of 14.6, making the shares one of the cheaper options in the chemicals
sector.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Unidare settles early on US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unidare, the Dublin-based industrial group, yesterday announced it had
reached agreement and completed a transaction with the former shareholders
of Nasco to satisfy its obligations under the share sale and purchase
agreement in respect of the deferred and performance-related consideration.
Unidare bought Nasco, a US welding and safety distribution business in May
last year.
The settlement, which is 15 months ahead of the date provided for in the
agreement, was for a total payment (excluding costs) of IPounds 7.1m (Pounds
7m) which, under the purchase formula implies operating profits at Nasco of
Dollars 8.1m (Pounds 5.32m) in the year to June 1995.
Half of the payment was funded with bank debt, with the balance being
satis-fied from cash accumulated in Nasco since its acquisi-tion.
Following this payment the total cost to Unidare of the purchase is IPounds
32m, including debt assumed.
The directors said the outcome had considerable benefits for Unidare,
including the elimination of uncertainty as to the potential gearing and
goodwill written off in the balance sheet and removal of potential conflict
of interest for the management - nine of whom shared in part of the proceeds
of the deal.
Following the transaction, Unidare's gearing at September 1994 is expected
to be between 50 per cent and 60 per cent, with a fall to about 40 per cent
by September 1995.
Unidare also announced it had reached a settlement in respect of a dispute
between Nasco and the US Internal Revenue Service, the effect of which would
be that Nasco would incur no tax charge in the current financial year and
would realise total tax savings of about Dollars 2.4m, which were not
foreseen at the time of the acquisition.
The shares rose 10p to close at 265p.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove falls to Pounds 7.2m but
confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bromsgrove Industries, the specialist engineering group, yesterday sought to
reassure both the market and its shareholders, as it announced lower pre-tax
profits for the year to March 31 of Pounds 7.19m.
This compared with Pounds 7.6m previously and a record Pounds 8.85m in
1990-91.
'Strategically and financially, we are making very good progress. Bromsgrove
is now a focused engineering group with a strong balance sheet, three core
divisions and a clear strategy,' said Mr Bijan Sedghi, the chairman.
The results were well in line with market expectations. The shares, which
have been languishing at the bottom of this year's trading range, on a
modest p/e of 11.3 and a yield of 6.3 per cent, gained 3 1/2 p to 91p.
This is less than half the price touched before the market collapse of
October 1987, but there are now 72.6m shares in issue. When Mr Sedghi took
over as executive chairman in January 1987 there were 10.2m. At the end of
the 1986-87 financial year, shareholders' funds were Pounds 5.7m; now they
are Pounds 36.06m.
The numbers cloak the expansion of what was an aluminium founder,
unhealthily dependent on the then Austin Rover for its motor component
sales. However, interest in the automotive market is no more. Bromsgrove is
far more interested in products like orthopaedic implants, pumps and valves,
golf shoe studs and forged steel.
For the shareholders this expansion has never been a dull ride.
Recently there have been rumours of a revolt in the making, following
Bromsgrove's appointment of Smith New Court as its broker, and the
resignation of Albert E Sharp. However nothing has happened and Mr Steven
Mills, the managing director, said yesterday: 'All institutions have held or
increased their holdings in the last three months.'
But he acknowledged that 'there may have been a little bit of shareholders'
frustration'.
The cause is uncertainty. Bromsgrove has always seemed to be bobbing and
weaving. Companies have moved in and out of the group with bewildering
speed. Financial services were a good thing to be in at one stage. Then they
were not. Environmental services offered the promise of a revenue stream but
not, as it turned out, the reality.
There have been two distinct phases in Bromsgrove's development under Mr
Sedghi, both of which mirror business fashion.
The first was the conglomerate, or, as the 1990 annual report had it, 'an
industrial holding company which operates within the parameters of carefully
formulated policies'.
The second, which reflected the contemporary canon of retreating to core
activities, began in 1992 when Bromsgrove marshalled its subsidiaries into
six divisions and more closely defined the sectors in which it wanted to
operate.
Further reorganisation and the sale of the group's automotive and
environmental companies have reduced the divisions to three and further
tightened the definition.
The financial effect of this has been to cut gearing to 7 per cent at the
year-end and 17.5 per cent now, putting the group in a comfortable financial
position, from which it should not be necessary for it to issue any more
paper.
For that, the stock market will offer thanks. The abundance of Bromsgrove
paper has been a factor in keeping the share price down.
The market will also be cheered by accelerating group sales in the second
half of the year under review.
Group turnover for 1993-94 came to Pounds 123.7m (Pounds 110.9m). Earnings
per share were 7p (7.7p) and the proposed final dividend is 2.85p, making a
total of 4.5p (4.4p).

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Soros sells stake in British Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, the international financier, has sold the majority of his
Quantum Fund stake in British Land for a 35 per cent profit, and has also
disposed of the fund's shares in Berkeley Group, the Surrey-based
housebuilder.
The proceeds of the British Land stake will be ploughed back into the
British Land Quantum Property Investment Partnership (BLQ), Mr Soros's
Pounds 500m joint venture with British Land.
The shares were part of a 4.8 per cent stake purchased when the fund was set
up. Quantum UK Realty and G. Soros Realty Investors sold 5.3m British Land
shares at 402p, compared with their 298p purchase price. They retain 4m
shares.
The Quantum Fund also sold 2.48m shares in Berkeley Group, which, based on
yesterday's closing price of 398p, raised about Pounds 9.86m. The Berkeley
shares were purchased in January 1993 at less than 330p.
Mr Soros and his Quantum Fund will realise Pounds 21.3m from the British
Land disposal. It is to be reinvested in the fund with the Pounds 250m
already committed to BLQ.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said British Land would match the
additional Soros investment, enabling the fund to invest a further Pounds
80m since the equity would be matched by debt.
The setting up of the Quantum Fund marked a turning point in perception
towards the UK property market, and the share price of British Land has
reacted accordingly. Brokers said it made sense for Mr Soros to focus his
investments in the UK property market on the British Land fund.
The fund has so far invested Pounds 600m in UK property.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OFT to investigate Healthcall charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate allegations of anti-competitive
practices by Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors
which came to the stock market in May.
The OFT said yesterday that it would make 'some preliminary inquiries' into
charges regarding Healthcall's relationship with the British Medical
Association and its treatment of potential competitors.
Mr Maurice Henchey, Healthcall's chief executive, dismissed the allegations
as the work of 'political activists who accuse of us of privatising the
National Health Service by the back door'.
He denied suggestions that Healthcall threatens to cut off its service to
doctors immediately it hears that they are planning to set up a duty
doctors' co-operative in competition.
'But if we find that they are approaching our staff or deputies, we will
make their lives difficult,' he said.
Healthcall's duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides GPs
with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Tight cost controls benefit Low &amp; Bonar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low &amp; Bonar, the packaging, plastics and specialist materials group,
yesterday unveiled a 42 per cent increase in interim profits following a
sharp improvement in sales and productivity.
Contributions from new subsidiaries and tight cost controls helped lift
pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 20.4m in the six months to May
31, on turnover up 18 per cent at Pounds 201m.
Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said such subsidiaries - dominated by Cereal
Packaging and CMB Carton Systems - had turned the group intoBritain's
largest food carton manufacturer and a market leader in Europe.
'We're modestly proud of these results. We've got very good operational
gearing and margins have risen in all three divisions,' he said.
His comments prompted a 16p rise in the shares to 403p.
The strong performance - led by its UK-dominated packaging division - was
held back only by adverse currency movements and flat trading in continental
Europe.
Although unfavourable exchange rates wiped Pounds 500,000 off group profits,
the packaging business saw profits surge by 75 per cent to Pounds 8.4m in
Europe and by 12 per cent to Pounds 2.8m in North America.
Currency losses were also offset by the group's plastics and specialist
materials businesses, which together accounted for 48 per cent of trading
profits. Of those divisions, the plastics business reported profits of
Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.6m) in Europe and Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 900,000) in
North America.
Profits in the specialist materials business, which manufactures products
including floor coverings for civil aircraft and fibres for artificial
hockey pitches, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 6.9m in Europe, although it made a
small loss in the US and Canada.
The figures were enhanced by a decline in interest payable from Pounds 2m to
Pounds 1.2m as the group reduced its borrowings from Pounds 18m to Pounds
16m, equivalent to gearing of 10.9 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 33 per cent to 13.59p (10.22p) and an interim
dividend of 3.2p (2.9p) is declared.
COMMENT
Low &amp; Bonar should not be modest about its achievements. It has transformed
itself from a conglomerate weighed down by eight divisions into a tightly
focused three-pronged business. Despite Pounds 22m of acquisitions, it has
also strengthened its cashflow and has enough leeway to make further
purchases without coming to the market. Mr Leng, however, is determined to
do better and has earmarked some 'underperforming parts of the business to
bring up to scratch'. His record suggests he will achieve that aim and
forecasts for pre-tax profits were raised yesterday to Pounds 42m for the
year. The shares, on a multiple of 13.3, remain at a discount to the sector
average.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher revokes scrip dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albert Fisher has revoked its scrip dividend alternative because a recent
slump in the food processing and distribution group's share price means the
cash dividend is worth substantially more to shareholders.
Albert Fisher's shares have fallen from 56p at the beginning of June, when
the scrip alternative was offered, to yesterday's close of 47p, up 1p on the
day.
The shares slumped from 63p in April, after the group announced a Pounds 51m
rights issue to fund its purchase of Rahbek, a Danish-based seafood company.
Analysts were critical at the time of the decision to issue high-yielding
paper for an acquisition, but the rights issue was taken up by 90 per cent
of existing shareholders - well above market expectations.
There seems no specific reason for the continuing downward drift in the
group's shares, although recent concern over high fish prices may have been
a factor. One analyst said low produce prices in the US, where the group
does significant business, had still not turned the corner.
The Stock Exchange said all scrip dividend proposals had a get-out clause,
so shareholders would not be disadvantaged by a fall in the share price, but
said such cases 'were fairly few and far between'.
All shareholders will receive the interim dividend of 1.85p per share for
the six-month period to February 28.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OFT to investigate Healthcall charges

<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate allegations of anti-competitive
practices by Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors
which came to the stock market in May.
The OFT said yesterday that it would make 'some preliminary inquiries' into
charges regarding Healthcall's relationship with the British Medical
Association and its treatment of potential competitors.
Mr Maurice Henchey, Healthcall's chief executive, dismissed the allegations
as the work of 'political activists who accuse of us of privatising the

He denied suggestions that Healthcall threatens to cut off its service to
doctors immediately it hears that they are planning to set up a duty doctors
co-operative in competition.
'But if we find that they are approaching our staff or deputies we will make
their lives difficult,' he said.
Healthcall's duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides GPs
with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply.
Under an exclusive agreement first signed in 1966 the BMA promotes
Healthcall's duty doctor service and monitors its standards in return for a
fee set at 0.5 per cent of reven-ues.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, has asked the OFT to consider
whether the agreement falls under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.
The OFT said yesterday that it fell outside the scope of the Act, because of
an exemption for the provision of medical services, but added that it would
look at some of the other allegations being made against Healthcall.
These centre on the effective monopoly Healthcall has in many urban areas
and the difficulty some GPs say they have setting up co-operatives to
compete with it.
Dr John Cockburn, managing director of Nestor Medical Duty Services,
Healthcall's smaller commercial rival, said that in many smaller urban areas
there was only room in the market for one commercial duty doctor operation
and that it was reasonable for Healthcall to warn doctors thinking of
setting up co-operatives that Healthcall might have to pull out.
He also dismissed the idea that the BMA agreement prevented Nestor competing
effectively with Healthcall.

FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: An efficacious formula - Daniel Green on
Smith &amp; Nephew's new found prominence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few happy investors in the healthcare industries these days, but
shareholders in Smith &amp; Nephew might at least have a half-smile on their
faces.
S&amp;N's shares have outperformed the falling FT-SE 100 index and the
pharmaceuticals sector by more than 10 per cent this year.
The unhappy pharmaceuticals sector has been hurt by falling margins because
those who pay for drugs - insurance companies in the US and governments
elsewhere - are bearing down on healthcare costs.
The profitability of the drugs industry, where operating margins of more
than 30 per cent are typical, makes it an obvious target for efforts to cut
prices.
But S&amp;N seems to have been relatively unaffected. Annual sales in 1993 were
Pounds 949m, up 11 per cent on 1992. Pre-tax profits before exceptional
items were Pounds 163m, up 16 per cent.
Perhaps most important, trading profit margins have risen from 16.5 per cent
in 1992 to 17.1 per cent last year and 'are trending up again this year',
says Mr John Robinson, chief executive. He says that they are likely to stay
in the 17 to 18 per cent range.
S&amp;N is happy with its new-found prominence. It has struggled for years to
shrug off its image of a slow-moving pedlar of bandages and creams. Without
medical magic bullets and blockbuster drug sales, the company's shares have
been outpaced by the likes of Glaxo and Wellcome.
The turnround this year is the result of the very dullness of S&amp;N's product
range. Drug companies rely on a handful of big sellers for their success.
Trouble with one can mean trouble for the whole company. S&amp;N has 2,000
brands and none is vital to the future of the company. In a time of
declining growth in healthcare, that gives S&amp;N a rare defensive appeal.
Almost two thirds of sales are in four sectors:
Casting and support. These include joint bracing devices and modern versions
of the plaster cast. S&amp;N says it is the world's biggest supplier, ahead of
3M and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. Sales in 1993 were Pounds 162m, up from
Pounds 121m a year earlier;
Trauma and arthroscopy. These are fracture repair devices and keyhole
surgery equipment. S&amp;N says it is second and first respectively in world
sales competing against the likes of Stryker of the US and Zimmer, part of
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US drug company. Sales last year were Pounds 199m
(Pounds 155m);
Orthopaedic implants, mostly artificial knees and hips. This is a fragmented
business led by Zimmer and Howmedica, part of Pfizer, the US drugs company.
S&amp;N sales last year were Pounds 118m (Pounds 95m) and Mr Robinson
acknowledges that the company is too weak, especially in hip implants. 'We
are vulnerable there,' he says;
Wound management, mostly specialist dressings for skin ulcers and pressure
sores which often afflict the bedridden. Sales last year were Pounds 136m
(Pounds 127m) and S&amp;N says it is in fifth place in world sales behind the
likes of 3M and Johnson &amp; Johnson.
Other products include consumer goods such as Lil-lets tampons and
Elastoplast plasters, eye and ear implants and surgical gloves.
Some of these products have defensive characteristics in themselves. Nurses
must be trained to use specialist dressings, so a hospital manager offered
cheaper dressings would have to bear in mind the costs of retraining.
Nevertheless, Mr Robinson concedes that there is price competition in some
areas, especially in the US. He has tried to minimise the effect in three
ways: by concentrating on high-margin, high-technology products in which S&amp;N
is a world leader; by broadening the group's geographical base; and by
increasing research and development efforts.
So in 1992 S&amp;N sold the Nivea cosmetics brand to Beiersdorf of Germany. It
is no longer in simple bandage cloths and gauze, which are produced in
developing countries at low prices.
It is trying to expand in Europe, especially Germany. Its European market
share is low - almost half S&amp;N's sales are in North America and only one
fifth in continental Europe. The region is also promising because cost
controls have tended to focus on cutting drug bills rather than total
hospital costs as in the US.
And in May it set up a joint venture with Advanced Tissue Sciences, a
Californian biotechnology company, to develop a means of growing living
cartilage in the laboratory. A product, which would be surgically inserted
into a patient's knee, is scheduled to be launched by the end of the decade
and sales could reach Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year.
Mr Robinson is convinced that this strategy will maintain the company's
outperformance, but some analysts are not convinced.
Mr Stuart Adkins at Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker, argues that the whole
of the healthcare business is a buyers' market. 'There is price pressure yet
to come for Smith &amp; Nephew,' he says.
Even relatively high-technology medical goods such as hip implants are
subject to heavy competition and 'near commodity status'. Investing in
biotechnology companies is necessary but not sufficient for success, he
says.
Mr James Culverwell at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, is more optimistic,
arguing that S&amp;N is more accustomed than drug companies to the tendering
process increasingly used by cost-conscious healthcare buyers.
Lower margins make it less of a target for bargain-hunting clients, and in
any case the S&amp;N sales effort already includes cost benefit analyses, an
area still new to most healthcare suppliers.
Either way, it is clear that S&amp;N is in a race against time. It must sell
more in Europe and harvest the fruits of new research before price pressures
begin in earnest and spill out from the US into Europe.

FT  12 JUL 94 / MR Data shares fall 19% on sales delays at Memex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in MR Data Management fell by 19 per cent yesterday, after the group
warned that delays in sales orders for its Memex software subsidiary and
higher than expected reorganisation costs meant full year profits would be
below expectations.
The shares closed down 33p at 144p after the data transcription and document
image processing group issued a trading statement.
However the statement added that the second half would show an improvement
over the first half.
When it reported a 34 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
2.66m in early March MR Data blamed reorganisation costs, lower net interest
income and development costs in the Memex software.
At that stage, the company said it was awaiting 'significant sales
decisions' from police forces on both sides of the Atlantic for its
Crime/Criminal Informations Management System developed by Memex.
Yesterday Mr Mike Elliott, chief executive, said these orders had still not
been received by the end of June. However he emphasised that they had not
been lost or withdrawn. 'We are still in the official tendering process and
still confident we will be successful.'
It is understood that two orders have been delayed because of the European
Union's lengthy tendering requirements for public contracts. A third order
is expected to be confirmed shortly from the US.
After appointing independent consultants to review Memex's business and
prospects, MR Data's board said it was 'confident that Memex is well placed
to take advantage of the increasing emphasis on law enforcement in the UK
and US and other markets for its unique text retrieval products'.
In addition, the board said the cost of reorganising the group's document
management and geographic information systems businesses was 'higher than
expected and had adversely affected the results for the year to end-June,
but will lead to significant ongoing savings'.
In an apparent attempt to reassure investors, the board added yesterday that
the group's core business was now performing well. It intended to recommend
at least a maintained final dividend for the year ended June 30, resulting
in an increase in the total payment of 6.7 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Eli Lilly pays Dollars 4bn for distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, is to pay Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for
PCS, a drugs distributor, in the third big acquisition of its kind in the US
in less than a year.
PCS, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based McKesson, claims to sell drugs to
50m Americans under various healthcare programmes, with drugs sales last
year of Dollars 6.4bn, making it one of the biggest companies of its type.
The planned deal is the latest sign of the rush by drugs companies to secure
distribution for their products in the US, the world's biggest
pharmaceuticals market. Faced with pressure to hold down prices,
manufacturers have sought to build market share by buying distribution
companies or by gaining preferential treatment for their drugs.
If completed, the deal will leave three of the biggest US distributors under
the control of pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Last year, Merck paid Dollars
6.7bn for Medco Containment Services, while SmithKline Beecham recently
agreed to acquire Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn.
McKesson had discussed a sale of the distribution arm with other
manufacturers, but did not hold a formal auction of the company, PCS said.
Following other links between distributors and manufacturers, it was the
only big pharmacy benefits management company left on the market. These
companies provide prescription drugs to people covered by the healthcare
programmes of big US employers.
In London, shares in Glaxo, which had been rumoured to be interested in PCS,
fell 8p to 563p.
The main reason, said analysts, was that a substantial proportion of US
patients would now be more difficult for Glaxo to reach, particularly with
its top-selling anti-ulcer drug Zantac.
Merck, SmithKline Beecham and now Eli Lilly would each push their respective
anti-ulcer products through their newly acquired distribution companies,
explained Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at Morgan Stanley.
These subsidiaries claim to have nearly 50m people covered by their
formularies. 'This is a material tightening of the screws for Glaxo,' he
said.
PCS claimed that it would continue to make available the most beneficial and
cost-effective drugs to its customers after the deal, regardless of who
manufactured them. 'The deal was not done for us to market Lilly's drugs
over other companies.'
The structure of the deal leaves McKesson open to higher offers for PCS.
Lilly has launched a tender offer for McKesson's shares. It said it would
spin off all McKesson's businesses apart from PCS into a new company, shares
in which would be distributed to existing McKesson shareholders. 'It does
open the door to other offers,' PCS said yesterday.
News of the deal drove McKesson shares up by a third yesterday, to Dollars
97 5/8 . By contrast, Eli Lilly's shares slid 12 per cent to Dollars 50 on
fears that it was paying too much for the acquisition. The all-cash purchase
would be financed with short and medium-term debt, Eli Lilly said. Moody's,
the US credit rating agency, said it would review the company's debt for a
possible downgrade.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Soros takes 35% gain on British Land sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, the international financier, has sold the majority of his
Quantum Fund stake in British Land for a 35 per cent profit, and has also
disposed of the fund's shares in Berkeley Group, the Surrey-based
housebuilder.
The proceeds of the British Land stake will be ploughed back into the
British Land Quantum Property Investment Partnership (BLQ), Mr Soros's
Pounds 500m joint venture with British Land.
The shares were part of a 4.8 per cent stake purchased when the fund was set
up. Quantum UK Realty and G. Soros Realty Investors sold 5.3m British Land
shares at 402p, compared with their 298p purchase price. They retain 4m
shares.
The Quantum Fund also sold 2.48m shares in Berkeley Group, which, based on
yesterday's closing price of 398p, raised about Pounds 9.86m. The Berkeley
shares were purchased in January 1993 at less than 330p.
Mr Soros and his Quantum Fund will realise Pounds 21.3m from the British
Land disposal, but this is to be reinvested in the fund in addition to the
Pounds 250m already committed to BLQ.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said British Land would match the
additional Soros investment, enabling the fund to invest a further Pounds
80m since the equity would be matched by debt.
The setting up of the Quantum Fund marked a turning point in perception
towards the UK property market, and the share price of British Land has
reacted accordingly since Mr Soros took his stake. Brokers said it made
sense for Mr Soros to focus his investments in the UK property market on the
British Land fund.
The fund has so far invested Pounds 600m in UK property, and Mr Weston Smith
said it was roughly 55 per cent geared, indicating that Quantum and British
Land have each injected Pounds 135m in equity funding. The fund's main
purchases have been the Pounds 128m Sterling Estates portfolio and a Pounds
70.5m office property at Leadenhall Street, in the City of London.
It has also purchased a 29.9 per cent stake in the property developer
Stanhope, which it is hoping will enable it to secure a half share of
Broadgate Properties, also in the City, providing a high quality core to the
Quantum portfolio.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Tomkins jumps 50% to Pounds 257m: Chief executive finds
share price 'depressing' but foresees further acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gregory Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, yesterday expressed
astonishment at the industrial conglomerate's low share price after it
announced a better-than-expected 50 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 257m. 'We win every match and we are still bottom of the league,' he
said.
He pointed to the 14 per cent increase in earnings per share to 15.1p in the
year to April, compared with a UK average of 6 per cent. Yet the shares have
underperformed the market by almost 30 per cent since it announced its
Pounds 990m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall in October 1992. They rose just
1/2 p to 218p yesterday.
The RHM businesses contributed profits of Pounds 102.5m and enhanced
earnings per share by 'at least' 4 per cent despite a bitter price war in
the volume bread market. 'We have always delivered to shareholders what we
said we would, which is what makes the share price so depressing,' said Mr
Hutchings.
He added that the lowly share rating would not prevent the group taking
advantage of acquisition opportunities. 'With a very strong balance sheet we
could gear up if we saw a major acquisition.' He stressed that nothing was
presently being contemplated and any large deal would be outside its main
businesses. 'We like being a diversified company.'
Dividends rose 16 per cent to 7.38p, after a final payment of 5.3p, which Mr
Hutchings said reflected the group's strong cash flow and good growth
prospects. 'We are very optimistic and excited about the future. We are in
the best position we have ever been.' He said that the integration of RHM
was largely going to plan although delays in the delivery of capital
equipment had pushed back the rationalisation programme. It has spent Pounds
23.3m out of the Pounds 81.2m provision set up for reorganisation.
Profits from milling and baking rose to Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds
682.2m - compared with a 21-week contribution of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of
Pounds 287.9m the previous year - but return on capital employed was still
'unsatisfactory'. The Mr Kipling cakes business has been disappointing and
bread baking suffered from the price war, which Tomkins estimated had cost
the main supermarket chains more than Pounds 50m in the last nine months.
Profits from food products rose to Pounds 80.4m on turnover of Pounds
939.5m, against Pounds 28.4m on sales of Pounds 374.9m, and Mr Hutchings
said there was 'a lot more still to come'.
Profits from the non-food businesses rose 13 per cent to Pounds 130.6m on
turnover of Pounds 1.62bn (Pounds 1.32bn). US housing and housing-related
activities had a second year of 'solid growth'. The lawnmowers business
performed well, but bicycle margins suffered from the threat of Chinese
competition.
Tomkins generates half its profits in dollars and a hedged rate of Dollars
1.59, compared with Dollars 1.76m the previous year, added about 4.5 per
cent to sterling profits on translation. This year's rate is Dollars 1.48,
giving it a gain of more than 3 per cent.
The company said the UK was at last showing some signs of emerging from
recession with companies serving the light engineering and housing markets
seeing some pick-up.
Tomkins ended the year with net cash of Pounds 156m, after spending Pounds
100m on the acquisition of Noma Industries, and shareholders' funds rose to
Pounds 897.8m (Pounds 802.0m).
Broker Hoare Govett forecasts profits of Pounds 300m this year with earnings
up 19 per cent at 17.9p.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Exco issue more than three times subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the moneybroking arm of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group,
yesterday gave a note of encouragement to the lacklustre new issues market
with the announcement that its public offer was 3.2 times subscribed.
The response to the Pounds 23m public portion of Exco's Pounds 93m share
offer was far more favourable than the highly publicised flotation of
venture capital group 3i, which spent Pounds 2m on marketing the offer to
the affluent investor type, 'Jeremy'.
The 3i flotation was only 1.1 times subscribed, with less than 20 per cent
of the 385,000 individuals who registered for its prospectus putting in
applications.
Exco received 9,500 individual applications after spending Pounds 200,000 on
advertising.
Mr Simon Neathercoat, of Exco's brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities, said:
'There were fond memories of the success story of the eighties that Exco
was.' Exco was acquired by B&amp;C in 1986, after an extremely successful phase
on the stock market.
Mr Neathercoat added that 'with a good story and a sensible price, the new
issue market remains open'.
Pricing was certainly an issue for Exco. Some merchant bankers suggested the
shares were 'given away', but the pricing had to reflect the low esteem in
which the moneybroking industry has been held by investors, due to concern
about volatility.
Exco shares were offered at 175p, offering a historic price-earnings ratio
of 9.5 and a notional yield of 6 per cent. Given the strong cash generation
of the industry and the success of Exco's global diversification, investors
have clearly been persuaded that the dividend is sustainable.
The issue was also helped by the fact that the Cayzer family's Caledonia
Investments, a canny investor, opted to retain its stake.
By comparison, 3i was considered to be relatively aggressively priced, with
a discount to net asset value of 13.5 per cent, and a gross dividend yield
of 3 per cent.
Baring Brothers, the sponsor, emphasised the importance of the institutional
portion of the 3i offer, which was 1.7 times subscribed, but it must have
been disappointed that the 'Jeremies' had failed to deliver.
Kleinwort Benson said that some institutions had applied for Exco shares
through the public placing. With this level of demand, the shares are
expected to show a healthy premium when they start trading on July 19.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Siemens to shed 7,000 jobs as profits shrink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the German electronics and electrical group, yesterday announced it
was cutting a further 7,000 jobs this year. The news came alongside
confirmation that annual operating profits were likely to fall by between 10
and 15 per cent.
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, president and chief executive, said that by the end
of September the total workforce would be reduced to 385,000. Additional
staff from the inclusion of the Osram Sylvania lighting business in the US
had masked a reduction of 13,000 jobs, he told the summer press conference
in Prague.
While there were 'a number of signs of an upward trend' in the German
economy, the improving business climate would not have an impact on the
company's results this year, which ends in September, said Mr von Pierer.
Although new orders for the eight months to May were up 6 per cent at
DM56.7bn (Dollars 35bn) and sales were 3 per cent higher at DM50.4bn, the
increase came from foreign business. Domestic orders and sales were down.
For Germany in the same period, domestic orders fell 7 per cent to DM22.2bn
and sales were down 6 per cent at DM20.8bn. Foreign orders increased 17 per
cent to DM34.5bn, while sales were up 11 per cent at DM29.6bn.
Foreign business now accounted for more than 60 per cent of Siemens' total
operations, up from less than 55 per cent in the last financial year, said
Mr von Pierer. This reflected the more rapid advances in America and
South-East Asia, compared with Europe.
He said that Siemens expected to achieve the orders and sales targets it set
itself at the beginning of the year. It anticipated new orders of DM87bn, up
from DM84.1bn, and sales of DM84bn, against DM81.6bn. These increases were
mostly due to the initial contributions of Osram Sylvania.
Net income remained 'under pressure', however, because of continuing price
deterioration and weak underlying sales.
Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, chief financial officer, said operating income this
year would fall by 10-15 per cent. He added that this would be offset by an
extraordinary gain from the sale of the cardiac pacemaker division, which
would be included in fourth-quarter figures.
Siemens expected to pay an unchanged dividend. 'I think you can say there
will not be too much change in either direction,' Mr Baumann said. The group
paid DM13 per share in the last financial year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / French and US end Aids research feud: Americans agree to
climbdown on royalties for HIV testing kits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French and US health researchers said yesterday they had reached a
settlement in the bitter medical feud which erupted in the 1980s over who
should reap the commercial and scientific rewards for discovering the Aids
virus.
The agreement, between the US National Institutes of Health and France's
Pasteur Institute, will provide the French with a bigger share of the
royalties from the sale of testing kits for HIV, the virus that causes Aids.
The deal represents a climbdown by the Americans who also acknowledged
officially that 'scientists at NIH used a virus provided to them by (the
Pasteur Institute) to invent the American HIV test kit'.
Dr Harold Varmus, NIH director, said the agreement should 'normalise the
sometimes rocky relations' between his agency and the Pasteur Institute. The
French called the accord 'a satisfactory conclusion' to the concerns raised.
Yesterday's settlement replaces a 1987 agreement which gave the two sides
equal credit for discovering the virus and was supposed to divide the
royalties from the testing kits equally between the US and France. In fact,
since the agreement NIH has received about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.1m) in
royalties and the Pasteur Institute about Dollars 14m, because more US
testing kits are sold than French kits.
This discrepancy - and the 1991 acknowledgement of Dr Robert Gallo, the US
researcher credited with discovering HIV, that he had accidently used a
French virus sample in developing his test - angered the French who
threatened to sue to recover royalty payments.
Dr Gallo was cleared of any misconduct by an internal review last year. But
yesterday's acknowledgment by NIH means that Dr Luc Montagnier, the French
co-discoverer of the virus, will receive more scientific credit.
Under the latest agreement, each country will be allowed to keep the first
20 per cent of royalties from the sale of kits. However, the remaining
royalties will be pooled and divided under a new formula - 50 per cent will
go to France, 25 per cent to the US and 25 per cent to the World Aids
Foundation, an international research charity.
The Pasteur Institute will receive 'several hundred thousand more dollars
per year' as a result of the new deal, an NIH spokesman said.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Ukraine president beaten in poll: Links with Russia may grow
 -Fears over nuclear disarmament

<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former Soviet missile factory boss, won Ukraine's first
presidential election since independence in 1991, defeating incumbent Leonid
Kravchuk in an upset that could improve relations between Kiev and its
former Soviet neighbours.
His victory raises questions about the country's pledges to the west on
nuclear disarmament and the fate of a troubled reform programme for its
ailing economy. Mr Kuchma, 55, who campaigned to strengthen ties with Russia
in order to revive Ukraine's economy, won 52 per cent of the vote compared
with Mr Kravchuk's 45 per cent, a difference of about two million votes,
according to the Central Election Commission's preliminary returns.
The key to Mr Kuchma's victory was the unexpectedly high turnout of about 65
per cent in Ukraine's densely populated eastern regions, where residents are
largely Russian speakers from working class backgrounds and where there are
high concentrations of ethnic Russians.
Mr Kuchma, who is expected to be sworn in as president on July 19, faces the
task of reconciling his often contradictory campaign promises, which could
be undermined by a potentially hostile parliament.
Eastern Ukrainians and separatists on the Crimean peninsula, to whom he owes
his victory, expect him to seek closer ties with Russia. However, Mr Kuchma,
who insisted upon his Ukrainian patriotism in the campaign, must also assure
nationalist western Ukrainians that he will preserve the country's
independence. He appeared to have begun the process of reconciliation on his
arrival in Kiev, saying: 'Everything that happened during the campaign was
criminal in terms of confrontation between east and west . . . If we act
intelligently, we can overcome this split.'
On the economic front, Mr Kuchma must also appease warring constituencies.
His aides have claimed that his pro-market campaign and support for
liberalisation as prime minister in 1993 won the pro-reform vote. He has
promised to include market reformers in his cabinet. However, communists
from eastern Ukraine voted in the hope that Mr Kuchma would restore
Soviet-style administrative controls over the economy.
Western diplomats are concerned about the impact of Mr Kuchma on Ukraine's
relationship with the west. Kiev received a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.56bn)
boost at last week's G7 summit, but warm relations with the west depend on
its promise last January to surrender its nuclear weapons.
An anti-disarmament speech by Mr Kuchma last year, where he argued
forcefully that Ukraine should retain its nuclear weapons, still troubles
the west.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton's policy of 'benign neglect' towards the dollar had
predictable results yesterday. The currency tumbled against the D-Mark and
fell to a historic low against the yen. Mr Clinton may not want the pain of
higher interest rates before this year's mid-term elections. But, given the
high US trade deficit, he cannot afford to see the dollar slide turn into a
rout. Some inducement is needed to persuade foreign investors to finance the
trade gap. The best move would be a rise in short-term rates, which would be
justified anyway because of the strength of the domestic recovery. But if
the Fed is unwilling to act, the pain will come through higher bond yields.

FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: British Land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the overblown reputation of Mr George Soros that when his Quantum
funds sell down their stakes in British Land and Berkeley Group then half
the market seems to run around trying to read the runes. Whether it is
significant that Quantum is exchanging British Land paper for a greater
exposure to direct property at this point in the cycle is a moot point. On
the face of it, Quantum's approach contrasts with that of other investors,
such as PosTel, which have been busy swapping properties for shares. But
that difference may owe more to both parties' respective portfolio needs
than any striking divergence in investment strategy. Quantum's move may
simply reflect the fact that it can sell its British Land shares for 35 per
cent more than it bought them a year ago.
British Land's shares are unlikely to match that performance over the coming
year. After the mini-bounce of the past few weeks, property shares have
narrowed their discount to net asset values. Yet growth in rental income is
proving hard to achieve. There must also be some uncertainty about what the
financial implications of British Land's longing for Broadgate Properties
will turn out to be.

Yesterday's producer price figures provide ammunition for both optimists and
pessimists on inflation. Input prices are accelerating faster than financial
markets expected, driven by the upswing in the commodity cycle. That will
not surprise companies operating at the cutting edge of the real economy;
prices of basic raw materials such as pulp, plasterboard and PVC have been
rising for months. Yet the lowest annual growth in output prices since the
late 1960's suggests these manufacturers have not been able to pass on
higher raw materials costs to their customers.
Against that background, the rise in the number of companies looking to
increase prices - recorded by the CBI last month - looks more like wishful
thinking than a real inflationary threat. There is no denying that
manufacturers' margins are being squeezed at present, even though falling
input prices in the second half of last year allowed margins to be widened a
touch. Commodity prices are also a relatively small proportion of
manufacturers' total costs. If tomorrow's average earnings figures show
upward pressure on unit labour costs, the markets will have more reason to
worry.

FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market might seem churlish in continually marking down Tomkins' share
price relative to those of its peers. Mr Greg Hutchins, the conglomerate's
chief executive, certainly thinks so. He argues that the Pounds 1bn RHM
acquisition at the end of 1992, which was responsible for the change in
market sentiment, was a good deal. It has enhanced group earnings per share
in the year by 4-5 per cent to the end of April. And though some of the food
businesses in which RHM operates have been difficult, others have not. In
the meantime, Tomkins presses ahead with introducing management controls and
cutting costs.
All this is fair enough as far as it goes. But until the points are made
with greater conviction, doubts will remain. For example, Tomkins has done
nothing to help investors understand how its figure for the contribution of
RHM to earnings per share is calculated. Moreover, integrating RHM is taking
longer than anticipated - four years rather than three.
None of this means the RHM deal was a dud. But it is good enough reason for
the market to wait for further evidence. While Mr Hutchins may continue to
be disappointed, a weak share price is unlikely to constrict his freedom of
manoeuvre. With a strong balance sheet, including Pounds 156m net cash, he
probably does not need the market to underwrite his next big deal.

FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lilly in the pink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's acquisition by Eli Lilly, drugs companies have spent
Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.5bn) buying their biggest customers. All the large
pharmacy benefit managers - the middle-men who buy drugs on behalf of US
healthcare providers - are now in the hands of manufacturers. While Lilly
and SmithKline Beecham have followed the trail blazed by Merck, though,
Glaxo has yet to make a move. The fall in its shares yesterday suggests some
disappointment that Glaxo has not followed the herd into vertical
integration.
Yet it is not clear that Glaxo could justify the high prices paid by its
peers. Lilly yesterday agreed to spend Dollars 4bn on a business with
earnings of Dollars 30m. The sums only stack up if owning a benefit manager
allows Lilly to increase sales of its leading drugs far faster than it could
otherwise do. Since Lilly has a number of drugs with relatively low market
shares in highly competitive areas of therapy, it may be able to achieve as
much. SmithKline Beecham was in a similar position. Glaxo's dependence on
Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which is already market leader but whose future
will be decided in the US courts, makes the benefits of vertical integration
less clear cut.
That is not to deny Glaxo's strategic weakness. The three biggest US benefit
managers are now in the hands of companies which make competitors to Zantac.
And Zantac still accounts for an uncomfortably large proportion of Glaxo's
profits. An acquisition to widen its spread of products would be a way out
of the group's strategic bind. Direct links with providers, such as
healthcare management organisations or even hospital groups, cutting out the
pharmacy benefit middlemen, might also do the trick.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine looks ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those inclined to pessimism about the non-Russian republics of the former
Soviet Union would do well to look closely at the results of Sunday's
presidential elections in Ukraine and Belarus. Both polls passed off
peacefully and were generally attested free and fair. Both resulted,
moreover, in a genuine alternance of power and the replacement of Soviet-era
incumbents - in Belarus by a populist sloganeer of uncertain policies, in
Ukraine by a former missile factory manager promising gradual economic
reform. Whatever now transpires, the fact that both republics have passed
this test of democracy in difficult times is a remarkable and hopeful sign.
Of the two, the Ukrainian result is the more encouraging. Outgoing President
Leonid Kravchuk deserved credit in his time for building a sovereign state
from the ruins of the Soviet one. But he failed utterly to consolidate
independence by establishing a viable economy, preferring to concentrate on
a series of futile disputes with Russia. The election of Mr Leonid Kuchma,
who as prime minister last year flirted with reform, is a fitting verdict on
Mr Kravchuk's failure, and a signal that a majority of Ukrainians now want
better relations with their eastern neighbour.
As a result, the new president will be able to make a fresh start - if he so
chooses. By campaigning on a pro-Russian ticket, Mr Kuchma won overwhelming
support in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and in the
disputed region of Crimea, but he did not completely alienate the rest of
the country by calling into question Ukrainian independence. His challenge
now is to unite his country in confronting the twin tasks of reforming the
economy and coming to terms with Russia.
Neither will be easy. For Mr Kuchma to embark on serious reform will mean
inflicting severe pain on the very people who got him elected, industrial
workers in eastern Ukraine who look to mother Russia for economic salvation.
Equally, if he anticipates much help from Moscow - whether in continuing
supplies of cheap energy or in more far-reaching economic links - he may be
deluding himself. The danger is that he may have raised inflated
expectations as to what he can achieve on this front; subsequent
disappointment may be bitter.
If only for this reason, Mr Kuchma may well feel that he has no alternative
but to press ahead with reform. If he does, he will add to his support in
the east of the country that of nationalists in the west who yearn for
policies guaranteeing them greater economic freedom. Provided he does not
backtrack on promises to hand over nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil,
external conditions will also be set fair, with the European Union's
recently concluded association agreement and the G7's promises of financial
assistance. Time is short, but the desire of Ukrainian voters for change is
now clear. If Mr Kuchma does not deliver, they will not be as patient with
him as they were with his predecessor.

Red faces at Salomon Brothers after Italy's Cariplo, the world's largest
savings bank, suspended its planned share offering, for which Salomon was
global co-ordinator.
Only days before the postponement, Salomon had issued a press release
attacking a 'misleading press report' in Il Sole 24 Ore, the Italian
financial newspaper, which had suggested that the international offering was
likely to be postponed. Salomon's release - headlined 'Cariplo share
offering very much on track' - even carried a quote from Cariplo chairman
Sandro Molinari stating: 'It is certainly our intention to proceed as
planned.'

Calling all opera buffs. Whether or not Verdi wrote Aida to mark the opening
of the Suez Canal in 1869 or the new Cairo Opera House, it is a mite
surprising that Sir Harrison Birtwhistle, or one of the Living Opera mob,
has let the inauguration of the Channel tunnel pass without offering up a
musical tribute.
It has been left to Paul Smith, organ builder, musician and security guard,
to pen an organ work which he has dedicated to the tunnel. If all goes well,
it will get its world premier in Trier Cathedral in Germany later this year.
Smith, a lay clerk in Ely Cathedral choir, is a humble sort and admits that
his work could double up as background music on Channel tunnel trains and in
the terminals. It is called Fantasy: Endure to the end, from a Biblical
quotation also borrowed by Mendelssohn for a chorus in his Elijah oratorio:
'He that shall endure to the end shall be saved'.
Given the constant delays which have dogged the Eurotunnel project in recent
months, it's just the sort of overture which should catch the fancy of a
promoter like Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: Royal parking slot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Donald Gosling's generous offer to contribute Pounds 5m and orchestrate
a fund to replace the Royal Yacht Britannia has caught the popular
imagination. If anyone can pull it off, it is the National Car Parks'
swashbuckling boss, dubbed the merchant adventurer of the parking lot.
Gosling already owns the 245ft Leander, proudly trumpeted as the largest
non-royal British yacht afloat, so he should know where to get the best buy
 -even if it means shopping abroad.
Leander, unlike Britannia, was built using largely Russian naval expertise
at a military dockyard in former East Germany which used to build ships for
the Soviet navy. Gosling was not the original client. The mysterious Tim
Landon, a Hampshire landowner and ex-Army officer, commissioned the ship,
which was a by-product of a 'swords into ploughshares' programme. Leander
was sold to Gosling before it was launched.
Landon is more than just a farmer. At one stage he was the link between the
Oman government and Whitehall during the secret war largely fought by SAS
troops against Omani rebels. Sources in the super-yacht industry say that
Landon, still close to Sultan Qaboos, is planning to build an even bigger
gin-palace inside the former Soviet Union. Could he have the biggest client
of all in mind for this one?

FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: Peanut index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the things Deutsche Bank chairman Hilmar Kopper will not want to be
remembered for is that he was the man who introduced 'peanuts' into the
popular German banking vocabulary. He first coined the term several months
ago to describe the DM50m owed to tradesmen working for the bankrupt Jurgen
Schneider property group.
Kopper's throwaway remark at a press conference was immediately picked up
(and translated into German) by the domestic tabloid press, which seized on
it to illustrate the big banks' arrogance at a time of recession. Despite a
belated, and somewhat grudging, apology from Kopper, it is starting to take
hold in Frankfurt business and banking circles as a convenient unit of
account. As in: Deutsche Bank will have to make a 10 peanuts - alias DM500m
 -provision against likely bad debts on its exposure to Schneider.
But a backlash is already under way. 'Because we're speaking German here,
I'm not going to use the word peanuts,' said Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of
the Metallgesellschaft group last week, rebuffing a request to know how many
peanuts the group hoped to raise from the sale of its mining activities.
(The answer: about 10.)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad luck all those who hoped that MI6, that branch of Britain's intelligence
service which supposedly concentrates on keeping Britain safe from foreign
spies, would be adopting as high a public profile as its sister
organisation, MI5.
The Secret Intelligence Service has moved quietly into its expensive new
Vauxhall Cross HQ, adjacent to London's Vauxhall Bridge, without even
bothering to have an official opening to thank the representatives of the
British taxpayer. It admits to a postcode (SE1 1BD), but its new telephone
number remains a state secret.
Indeed, the secrecy is such that Observer hears Britain's taxpayers can no
longer use the coin-operated public telescope on the other side of the River
Thames to inspect the country's substantial investment in MI6. It
disappeared in mysterious circumstances earlier this year and cannot be
traced. So much for the openness of government promised by the prime
minister.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Personal View: Europe must sharpen competitive edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDGAR S. WOOLARD JR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would the chief executive of a multinational company with Dollars 1bn to
invest choose Europe as a location during the next decade? My experience is
that many large companies are directing discretionary investment elsewhere.
Why? Europe is an enormous market, but despite rises in gross domestic
product per capita, Europe's ageing population and low birth rates point to
slower growth in the future. Moreover, the World Competitiveness Report,
compiled by the Imede business school in Switzerland, points out that a
region's competitiveness is grounded in processes that turn assets into
results. It concludes that Europe is not transforming ideas into better
products, more quickly and more cheaply than other regions. Increasing trade
deficits and unemployment are the result.
At the same time, it costs more to produce in Europe today than anywhere
else in the world. One factor is the high cost of labour and the
inflexibility of rules and regulations affecting it. Another is the fact
that energy, many raw materials and telecommunications cost more in Europe
than in the US and Japan.
All this suggests Europe has yet to confront its competitive disadvantages -
or pursue its competitive advantages. Policymakers should focus their
attention in four areas.
First, giant strides have been made towards a genuine single market, but the
job of freeing up business is far from complete. The Uruguay Round is
important, but free trade is about more than the absence of tariffs - it
requires the elimination of old mindsets that are still evident in Europe.
Consider an example: improving efficiency in the workplace. Instead of a
dialogue about how production processes can be streamlined, we have seen in
Europe a long, unresolved debate about procedural mechanisms for consulting
workers. In other regions, new work systems are being tested and adopted to
make companies more aggressive, customer-orientated and productive.
Second, European Union laws and regulations should be simplified to allow
companies to organise themselves efficiently. One particular problem is the
variety of national requirements in Europe which mean companies have to
organise networks of local subsidiaries. The administrative costs of
parallel national subsidiaries add cost but no value to the customer. In the
US, a company can be incorporated in one state and operate in all 50.
Third, policymakers should recognise that industrial restructuring is
essential to long-term competitiveness. It can take several forms, including
the shutting down of excess capacity or obsolete plants, modernising assets
to make them globally competitive, and purchasing or selling businesses to
focus a company's strengths. A year ago DuPont acquired ICI's nylon business
and ICI acquired DuPont's acrylics business. Approval for that agreement was
given by the European Commission in a timely way - more timely than the
process required by the US Federal Trade Commission. We found officials of
the European Commission to be enlightened, focused on economic and
competitive realities, and quicker than US counterparts. European companies
should see that as an advantage.
While facing up to the need for restructuring, Europeans should also realise
that eastern Europe is not a drag, it is an opportunity - a frontier. But
standard project analysis is likely to preclude many companies from
investing in eastern Europe because of risk and long-term payment concerns.
Business and government will require leadership and determination to see
eastern Europe as an opportunity rather than western Europe's special
burden.
Finally, it is important that Europe adopts a single currency. From the
international perspective, this is essential for European integration and
for creating a transparent market. Without a single market it is difficult
to harmonise the terms under which we deal with our customers in different
countries - who are, after all, competing in a single market.
Years of patient and difficult effort to promote a level playing field have
been undone overnight by recent devaluations. We are, for example, still
feeling the effects of the devaluations of the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish
currencies, as well as the floating of the Italian and British currencies -
some of which took place nearly two years ago.
I believe Europe can find the resolve needed to make progress on social,
economic and political fronts. But the successful integration of the
European market is not a foregone conclusion and it is not clear Europe has
yet realised the change needed to become internationally competitive.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Water prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water customers have had a raw deal from the industry's 1989 privatisation,
according to the National Consumer Council, the government-funded body that
represents the interests of consumers. The accusation is not new, but it has
struck a chord with public and politicians, coming just two weeks before
Ofwat, the regulator, reveals the rate at which water bills will rise in the
next decade.
The NCC's case rests on two charges: that the water companies' investment
programme is too costly, and that the regulator has allowed too much of
these costs to be passed onto households, rather than shareholders.
On the first point, the NCC has growing support. Much of the capital
spending - which water companies estimate will reach Pounds 40bn this decade
 -is driven by European Union environmental directives. Some of these - such
as the permitted level of nitrates in drinking water - appear unnecessary on
health grounds. Nonetheless, the rules are currently part of UK law, which
means the industry's ability to rein back spending is limited.
The NCC is right, too, to maintain that privatisation gave shareholders too
good a deal. Some of its financial arguments are misjudged, such as its
attack on the rise in operating costs, which is largely due to new
construction. But it is clear, in retrospect, that the pricing formula did
not take adequate account of efficiency gains which were achievable.
It would be wrong to lay the failings of the privatisation formula at the
regulator's door. But this year's review has given Ofwat its first chance to
devise a new one, and its claim to be a tough regulator will rest on the
figures it reveals on July 28.
The test of Ofwat's strength centres on the return on capital it grants the
companies. That rate should be much lower than in the past; given the
industry's low level of risk, it should be scarcely above that on government
bonds. The industry has failed to make a convincing claim that it needs a
real rate of return of 9 1/2 per cent to attract finance.
Although Ofwat should sharply restrain the rate of increase in household
bills, one reform that would cut the present level of bills is beyond the
scope of its review: shifting more of the costs onto industry and
agriculture.
The government says that it bases its environment policy on the 'polluter
pays' principle. Factories and farms which discharge effluent to sewers are,
indeed, charged large sums by water companies. But if they discharge to
rivers, they pay only a token amount to the National Rivers Authority,
although the water companies must still bear the cost of removing this
pollution.
Under present UK legislation the NRA is entitled to recover only
administrative costs from polluters. Allowing it to charge the full cost of
the clean up would at least help Ofwat redistribute the painful burden of
paying for cleaner water.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Germany's role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As President Bill Clinton reminded Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn yesterday,
Germany's partners have a right to expect an active and constructive role
from united Germany on the world stage. The country's six-month presidency
of the European Union which started this month will provide a test of
whether it can live up to these expectations.
The federal republic's geographical enlargement since its last European
presidency in 1988 has increased its political weight, but has also made its
internal problems more complex.
When they scrutinise Europe's senior economic power, Germany's partners are
sometimes not averse to employing double standards. Germany is frequently
criticised for not making a weightier effort in international peace-keeping.
But when Germany tries to take a stronger policy line, for example in its
desire for a permanent seat on the UN security council, it faces suspicions
that it is unduly flexing its muscles.
An important milestone is expected today with a judgment from Germany's
constitutional court clearing some legal obstacles on the use of Bundeswehr
troops outside Nato. However, the electorate's aversion towards using German
troops in foreign conflicts has been increased by the international
community's failures over Bosnia. The troop deployment policy will remain
highly restrained.
In the EU presidency, punctuated by the October general election, caution
will be a watchword. The German electorate favours European integration, but
has become more hesitant about policies constraining national
decision-making. Mr Kohl wants to widen the EU towards central and eastern
Europe, yet he is well aware of the economic reasons ruling out rapid
membership for these countries.
Mr Kohl also has the responsibility of bringing the search for the next
president of the European Commission to a successful conclusion. In trying
to push through Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, Mr Kohl showed
insufficient regard for his EU partners, but during the 10 days since the
Corfu summit, he seems to have digested the lessons of that misjudgment. If
Bonn can steer through agreement on a new candidate at or before Friday's
summit in Brussels, that would be welcome evidence that Germany can adapt
national goals in the interest of finding compromises.
As the pivotal power in Europe, Germany has to accomplish the difficult
balancing act of setting a lead for its EU partners and at the same time of
taking account of their sensitivities towards a larger nation at the centre
of Europe. Nearly four years after unification, Bonn has yet to come to
terms with its new position. If it still leans more towards hesitancy than
towards assertiveness, that is partly because Germany's partners and
neighbours make clear that, on balance, they prefer the former to the
latter.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Aspirin for a lingering ailment: Venezuela's economic crisis
will prove difficult to resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who follow the world's emerging stock and bond markets often mince
their words. But they are almost unified in their despair at the
developments in Venezuela since the government of President Rafael Caldera
took office in February.
'The Caldera administration has, (since) taking the reins of power,
succeeded in shooting itself in the foot . . . and blowing away most of its
good leg,' Mr Victor Galliano of LatInvest, a London-based stockbroker
specialising in Latin American markets, told the firm's clients.
According to Mr Peter West, an economist with West Merchant Bank, the London
subsidiary of Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank: 'The rapid deterioration in
the country's economic situation this year under the Caldera government can
only be seen as the unfolding of the worst case scenario.'
In international financial circles, where Venezuela was until three years
ago viewed as one of the most promising prospects in Latin America, the
Caldera government is reckoned to have inherited an economy in bad shape and
succeeded in making it worse. The financial markets now price Venezuela's
Brady bonds, issued as part of the government's 1990 debt agreement with
international banks, at levels comparable with Nigeria's.
The view of foreign financiers may be the least of Mr Caldera's worries as
he grapples with the crisis which, if it continues, may threaten the
country's already fragile social and political fabric.
Yet the country's fall from grace underlines the difficulties of managing an
economy dominated by a single commodity, in this case oil. As the three
biggest Latin American economies, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, face
presidential elections in the next 12 months, it may also demonstrate to
other countries in the region the risks of authoritarian and populist
responses to economic problems.
With justification, the 78-year-old Mr Caldera blames others for the genesis
of the crisis he now faces. Announcing wide-ranging new controls on the
economy last month, he said: 'This crisis was not created by us. It is a
crisis that is the product of a long period of corruption, of a long period
of serious mistakes made in the life of the nation. We have tried to
confront this crisis using all ordinary means, but we have arrived at the
point where we feel the urgent need to use . . . extraordinary means.'
These measures, announced on June 27, included the abolition of six
constitutionally guaranteed economic freedoms, controls on foreign exchange
operations and on the prices of many goods and services, an official pledge
to push for lower interest rates, and the obligatory payment of a monthly
'bonus' to most government and private sector employees. Together, they
constituted the most significant attempt to impose state control over an
economy in Latin America since the 1980s.
The government almost immediately put some of its new powers to work.
Police, national guard soldiers and state security officers launched a
series of raids aimed at apprehending criminals in the massive slums -
barrios - around Venezuela's main cities. They jailed 'price speculators'
and confiscated food products held by 'hoarders', as well as investigating
individuals believed by the security police to be planning destabilisation
efforts against the government.
The measures were prompted by the worst banking crisis to hit Latin America
since the collapse of the Chilean banking system 11 years ago. It was
triggered by the failure of the country's second-largest bank, Banco Latino,
in January - the culmination of years of lax regulation and doubtful
lending.
The state now owns a significant minority of the banking system and controls
the rest. The knock-on effects threaten other enterprises - and some
well-known business dynasties.
Foreign exchange transactions formally restarted yesterday at a
government-set fixed exchange rate of 170 bolivars to the dollar - after
being forbidden for nearly two weeks. This followed near-collapse in the
free-market price of the bolivar, which has fallen by half since the start
of the year.
As the government pumped in money to shore up the banks, the budget deficit
widened, according to an International Monetary Fund document quoted in a
Venezuelan newspaper, to 17.5 per cent of GDP this year. Inflation is rising
 -to a forecast 70 per cent or more this year, from 46 per cent last -
though, if price controls hold, inflation may be curbed. Overall, the
economy is expected to contract for a second successive year - economists'
expectations range between 3 per cent and 10 per cent.
The roots of the problem, as Mr Caldera says, go back a long way. Oil made
Venezuelans the richest citizens of Latin America, but encouraged them to
view themselves as shareholders owed dividends by a rich enterprise. The
country's latest period of democracy, which dates from 1958, survived by the
judicious distribution of oil wealth. The oil boom of the 1970s brought an
epoch of government extravagance and corruption.
Throughout most of the 1980s, the government continued in this vein, failing
to adjust to the collapse of oil prices. By the time Mr Carlos Andres Perez
assumed power in 1989 for a second term as president, the state-dominated
economic model, with high inflation and heavy government deficits, appeared
to be in its death throes.
Mr Perez initiated a series of market reforms. After price controls were
abandoned in February 1989, 300 people were killed in food riots. The
rentier mentality encouraged by oil wealth meant Venezuelans were always
likely to find free-market medicine more unpalatable than other Latin
Americans.
Moreover, in retrospect, Mr Perez was ill-suited to the task of demanding
economic sacrifice from his people. His 1970s government was regarded as one
of the most venal in Venezuelan history. Last year, after facing two
military uprisings in 1992, he was forced to step down early to face
corruption charges and is now in jail.
Mr Caldera's reputation is as austere as Mr Perez's was flamboyant. His
victory in last December's elections followed a campaign emphasising
energetic measures against corruption, inflation, and devaluation, and a
rejection of market reforms. Some viewed it as a vote for nostalgia - Mr
Caldera entered politics in the 1940s and his first term of office from
1969-74 seems a golden age in retrospect.
But now he faces the problems of shortage, not the plenty of the 1970s. Like
most Latin American politicians of his era, he is of an authoritarian cast
and appears to have overruled his ministers on many occasions. 'The clearly
interventionist nature of the new measures points strongly to Caldera
himself as the architect of these misguided populist policies,' said Mr
Galliano of LatInvest.
The efficacy of the price and currency controls are widely doubted. Mr
Francisco Vivancos, professor of economy at Andres Bello Catholic University
in Caracas, says controls on prices and foreign exchange 'are like an
aspirin that doesn't attack the illness'.
Many economists believe the best hope lies in the statements from government
officials that the measures will be 'temporary', and that price controls and
the other actions could end in December. While controls are likely to be
popular initially - as will the boost to salaries - if they last too long,
hoarding, shortages and a high-priced black market could develop, causing
popular dissatisfaction.
The hopes that the policies will be reversed somewhat lies with a group of
supposedly more market-oriented ministers - perhaps including Mr Julio Sosa,
the finance minister. Mr Caldera has lost four cabinet ministers and the
governor of the supposedly independent central bank, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy.
According to Mr George Philip of the London School of Economics, the
government now needs to take decisive fiscal measures to close the budget
deficit. This will mean taking a tough line with depositors of the failed
banks, higher taxes and public spending cuts.
This, he argues, will bring about real political conflict, something Mr
Caldera has avoided so far. Yet if he avoids this conflict, the alternative
is hyperinflation. That is only likely to worsen the country's deep social
and military tensions.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bleakness of US economy overstated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AVINASH PERSAUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Three cheers for a weak dollar' (July 6), Wynne Godley and William
Milberg fall into the trap of heralding economic disaster through the
extrapolation of some unpleasant trends in the US trade deficit. In
practice, economic disasters are much flagged but seldom arrive as alarming
trends turn into cycles. This will be the case in the outlook for US trade.
Godley and Milberg argue that world output would have to rise 1.5 times as
fast as US output for the trade deficit to remain a constant share of gross
domestic product, and they intimate that this is unlikely. They conclude
that far from being resisted, a gentle dollar slide now is preferable to the
vertical drop that would follow if rising external deficits led to a loss of
investor confidence in US assets.
But the reality is far less bleak. The pattern of US exports is shifting in
favour of Latin America and east Asia, regions where economic growth
outstrips that in the US, not by 1.5, but by an order of 2 to 3 times. In
1990, only 27 per cent of US trade went to these two regions, but just three
years later, in 1993, this had risen to 35.6 per cent. In the process, US
exports to Latin America and east Asia leaped 37 per cent, while exports to
the rest of the world grew a paltry 2.1 per cent. A staggering 88 per cent
of US exports growth since 1990 can be attributed to the growth of exports
to these two regions.
The US appears to have maintained a comparative advantage in industries only
now opening up to international trade, such as financial services. Between
1986 and 1993, global exports rose 88 per cent in merchandise goods and 105
per cent in services, while the US share of global service exports inched up
from an already high 20 per cent.
Fears of serious current account problems for the US are therefore
overstated and suffer from neglecting the shift under way in the pattern of
US exports towards the new industries and the new industrial power houses.
Assuming Godley and Milberg's trends are indeed off mark, further dollar
depreciation should be resisted as it will serve to shove the global economy
off balance. Further dollar weakness threatens to derail the fragile
economic recoveries in Europe and Japan and to aggravate inflation pressures
growing in the US. Where exchange rate changes worsen global economic
imbalances rather than soften them, as today, policy makers should readily
consider countervailing action.

Sir, Your story referring to the negative worth of some of the world's
leading brand names ('IBM plunges to bottom of brand name value league',
July 11) is misleading as regards Del Monte. The company referred to in the
article is Del Monte Corporation in the US. Del Monte Foods International,
based in the UK, is completely independent from the US company. Since 1992,
the Del Monte brand name in the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa has been
licensed to the Del Monte Royal Group of Companies listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

FT  12 JUL 94 / With strings attached: Does the independence of UK auditors
require greater protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the difference between an auditor and an airport luggage trolley?'
asks Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, the body
which decides how financial information is presented in the UK. 'The trolley
has a mind of its own.'
The jibe does not endear him to many of his colleagues. But their
sensitivity illustrates a nagging problem facing the profession: is the
independence of auditors being compromised by the commercial relationship
they have with the executive managers on whom they report?
The debate has rumbled for many years but today the Auditing Practices
Board, which sets auditing standards, moves a step closer to proposing
changes to the way in which the profession works that could protect the
independence of the accountants. It is to discuss a series of proposals for
reform, expected to be published later this year.
'It is the tension in auditing,' says Mr David Hatherly, professor of
accounting at Edinburgh University and a member of the board, who presented
a paper suggesting radical measures for enhancing auditors' independence to
the European Accounting Association in Venice earlier this year.
At the heart of the debate is an auditor's legal duty to give shareholders
an assurance that a company's accounts present 'a true and fair view' of its
financial position each year. The possibility of a conflict of interest
arises because auditors normally report to, and are paid, hired and fired
by, the company's directors.
Management often has an interest in presenting financial information in a
way that differs from the insight into corporate performance desired by
shareholders.
Two years ago a 'green paper' by the Auditing Practices Board, which led to
today's discussion, noted that auditors often referred mistakenly to
executive management, rather than shareholders, as 'the client'.
Increasing the pressure for some kind of reform in the past few years has
been the failure of a number of fraudulent companies which had their
accounts approved as 'true and fair' without qualification by the auditors.
Examples include Polly Peck International, Maxwell Communication
Corporation, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Other companies have had their accounts approved by auditors only for the
Financial Reporting Review Panel, which enforces accounting standards, to
order amendments because of breaches of the rules. In the past three years,
almost 20 companies have been forced by the panel to restate their accounts.
Auditors admit privately to sometimes stretching accounting standards to the
limit to further the interests of directors without breaking formal
obligations to shareholders. Many auditors 'approve things that just about
cross the line (into acceptability) but do not serve the shareholder,' says
Prof Hatherly of Edinburgh University.
The pressure auditors face is that if they refuse to bend to the wishes of a
company's management, they may lose their contract. The process can be
subtle. The directors will rarely fire the auditor. Rather, Sir David says,
they will suggest that the firm's costs are too high and the audit should be
put out to tender. The incumbent firm rarely wins.
One senior accountant says: 'Some of my colleagues scratch their heads, suck
their pencils and look at the audit fees.' A partner in a large accountancy
firm mentions the name of a large, well-known organisation and says: 'If I
lost it as a client, I would have to consider my future with the
partnership.'
As competition between accountants has intensified, fears of upsetting
companies have risen. 'I think in the 1980s commercialism really almost
overtook professionalism,' says Sir David. 'The sheer competition outweighed
judgment. Auditors would approve accounts that were acceptable rather than
right.'
Many accountants argue the climate has now changed. In the 1980s auditors
often found that companies were prepared to bring in lawyers to exploit to
the full loopholes in the professional standards. Mr Ian Plaistowe, chairman
of the Auditing Practices Board and senior partner with accountants Arthur
Andersen, says: 'It was much more difficult in the 1980s to resist pressure.
There were no yardsticks, accounting standards were looser, and lawyers were
not doing us any favours.'
Now, Mr Plaistowe argues, standards have been tightened and the setting up
of the FinanCial Reporting Review Panel in 1991 has strengthened the hand of
the auditors.
Furthermore, he says, while auditors' independence will always create
tensions, his firm has never allowed pressure from directors to jeopardise
its objectivity.
Like many accountancy firms, Arthur Andersen brings in other partners, not
directly involved in the audit, to adjudicate when a company proposes
contentious accounting techniques.
Nevertheless the Auditing Practices Board believes that the potential for
conflict remains serious enough to warrant a thorough review. One radical
suggestion to be discussed today is the creation of a government - or Stock
Exchange - controlled audit commission which would be responsible for the
annual appointment and remuneration of auditors to all companies. But even
strong critics of the current system, such as Prof Hatherly believe this
idea would create a remote, impractical and bureaucratic system. He suggests
instead a 'shareholder panel' selected from among a company's investors, to
which auditors would be directly accountable. The panel might also be
responsible for the selection and payment of auditors.
Prof Hatherly is unlikely to win a majority for his proposals at today's
meeting. Instead the Auditing Practices Board is expected, in its report
later this year, to call for a strengthening of the role of independent,
non-executive directors in supervising auditors. It is likely to press for a
greater role for audit committees of non-executive directors, already
recommended as 'best practice' for companies, suggesting these committees
should be responsible for appointing and paying auditors as well as
receiving the auditor's report.
Prof Hatherly, however, says that establishing a direct link between
auditors and shareholders through a shareholder panel is the only real
long-term solution if the interests of investors are to be paramount. 'I
feel that if something is conceptually wrong you can patch it up but in time
the cracks show again.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obvious advantages to a Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL RIVLIN and Mr PETER NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Debate of the issues raised by the Lloyds Bank bid for Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester has focused on the problems of structuring a bid within the
Building Societies Act. Too little attention has been paid to the
transaction itself.
Although C&amp;G has restricted information to members, it is apparent from the
wider briefings given to analysts and the press that there is at least one
immediate and viable alternative to the Lloyds bid. The current position
appears to be:
1. C&amp;G could convert to a public company and obtain a Stock Exchange listing
within the existing legislation (as did Abbey National).
2. The Stock Exchange value of C&amp;G would be about Pounds 1.8bn according to
most analysts of the banking sector - ie about the same as the Lloyds bid.
3. In a flotation there would be no restriction on distributing shares to
members of less than two years standing. Consequently the board could
allocate shares on the basis originally proposed.
4. The listing could be underwritten so that members could choose to receive
value in cash or shares. On an underwriting price of Pounds 1.8bn, the
amount payable to members would be the same as the Lloyds offer, ie Pounds
500 and 10 per cent of deposits up to Pounds 100,000.
There are three obvious advantages to a flotation. First, C&amp;G members should
be able to receive the money or shares within six months as compared with
the Lloyds bid timetable of mid-1995. Second, if Lloyds wishes to acquire
C&amp;G, it will have to pay the proper bid premium for control. Third, members
receiving shares should be able to defer any capital gains tax liability to
suit their circumstances.
There may be some losers from the proposal, including Lloyds Bank
shareholders, who benefited from a 10 per cent increase in share value on
the announcement, and any others with arrangements dependent on the success
of the bid. It is unlikely, however, that ordinary C&amp;G investors or
borrowers would be any worse off.
It follows from this analysis that the merits of the bid should be subjected
to far greater scrutiny. What are the real advantages of the Lloyds bid over
a flotation? Is Lloyds paying the right price ? Are there other purchasers
prepared to pay more? Are there other options? How will the board ensure
that members have a real choice?
Analysts have spent some time and effort informing Lloyds Bank shareholders
of the advantages of the bid. Who will perform a similar independent review
for C&amp;G members? There is no obvious body to provide investor protection for
the interests of members in these circumstances, but the press can help by
asking why the C&amp;G board seems committed to a proposal with obvious flaws
when there may be better alternatives.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: One for the road to healthy living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dabbling in futurology is clearly a hazard to journalistic objectivity.
Michael Prowse's speculations on lifestyles 50 years hence are interesting
('Why vegetarians will inherit the earth', July 11), until he touches on
alcohol and its future. Then his crystal ball disintegrates due to an
overload of errors and half truths from today's world.
The litany of social woes Mr Prowse seeks to attribute to alcohol reads like
an extract from a Band of Hope pamphlet. His opinions conveniently ignore
some rather important facts. First, 95 per cent or more of those who drink
do so without harm and are far removed from the problems of excess, which
affect only a small, unhappy minority - but who colour Mr Prowse's thinking.
Second, estimates of the social cost of abuse, on which he places much
emphasis, are notoriously unreliable - even when produced by the US
government. They vary from as little as 10 per cent of the Dollars 100bn
quoted to up to 40 per cent more. Questioning commentators might be a little
more cautious about statistical reliability when they see divergences as
wide as this.
Mr Prowse is right on one point. In the US heart disease is the leading
cause of death. In which regard a better predictor of why alcohol will still
be a part of healthy lifestyles in 2044 can be found in a recent
pronouncement from the World Health Organisation, assessing alcohol and
health. 'It can be concluded, therefore, that moderate drinking provides a
moderate protective effect against cardiovascular disease, as compared with
abstention and heavy drinking.' Perhaps Mr Prowse should think again about
giving up at least one of his fleeting pleasures. A little of what he
fancies should do him good. No less than the WHO says so.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Hosing us for all we've got
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Water privatisation is a rip-off, a steal, a plunder, legalised mugging,
piracy, licensed theft, a diabolical liberty, a huge scam, a cheat, a
snatch, a grab, a swindle. You already knew that, of course, as did I. We
may even have found a few of the ducats falling in our own direction, taking
one thing with another. What is fresh, and the cause of a sense of annoyance
I find hard to suppress, is the evidence in yesterday's report from the
National Consumer Council. We are talking, the council reminds us, not of 10
large and 21 small private companies struggling to scratch a living in a
competitive market, but of an industry that is a 'monopoly supplier of an
essential service to a captive market'. What else would it be but a huge
machine for taking money out of customers' pockets?
The late Nicholas Ridley, the minister principally responsible for this
outrage, told me his game plan in advance of its announcement. The pipes and
sewers had been allowed to rot, he explained. Worse, the environmental
movement wanted purer water. 'It would be cheaper to deliver free Perrier to
every house in the land,' he said. No Treasury, under any government, had
found or would ever find the necessary capital. Besides, water charges were
linked to the rates, which he was abolishing in favour of the poll tax.
Private companies could raise capital in the markets. They would be more
efficient. That would release further funds. There would be a modernisation
charge, but it would be manageable.
If you believe the consumer council, these forecasts were wrong. As to
raising money in the markets, the overall gearing of the water businesses
rose from virtually zero in 1989-90 to 24 per cent in 1992-93, the last year
for which full accounts were available. To be fair, the companies are about
to borrow a great deal more. Against that, no significant capital has been
raised through equity issues. That could be expensive, but only while the
industry insists on paying out many times its honest worth. Apart from the
near-tripling of its share valuation, gross dividends rose by 63 per cent a
year on average between 1989-90 and 1992-93. Yet these should be low-risk
investments, comparable to index-linked gilts. As to efficiency, operating
costs per unit of water delivered rose by 9.7 per cent between 1990-91 and
1992-93. The equivalent figure for sewage was 16.5 per cent.
That leaves the modernisation fees, the ones you and I pay. Far from being
manageable, the consumer council finds them incomprehensible. The companies
are masters of financial disguise. The opacity of their accounting practices
varies, but little daylight gets through. The consumers' council has to make
best guesses. It questions transfers between budgets for continuing
maintenance and the costs of construction of genuine new assets, not to
mention cross-subsidisation of non-core businesses. In language we can all
understand, the water gang has exaggerated its forecast bill for
modernisation, spent less rapidly than it said it would, gambled and lost on
out-of-industry ventures, and (although the consumer council does not say
this) paid its directors handsomely for their non-service. These
caporegimes, some of them unemployable in competitive industry, have awarded
themselves large slices of the protection money they extract from us.
And do we pay] 'Of all the privatised utilities, domestic water and sewerage
bills have shot up the most since privatisation - by 67 per cent on average
between 1989-90 and 1994-95,' the council observes. Using a variety of
assumptions, it intimates that the bulk of the money has been distributed in
dividends. It notes that '. . . the 69 per cent contribution by consumers
to-wards additional capital expenditure looks extreme-ly generous', which is
a kind way of putting it, since the renovation and environmental expenditure
story, while clearly true, has plainly been exaggerated in a bogus effort to
excuse the monopolists' voracity.
Genuine hardship is inflicted on the poor. Income support does not account
directly for water bills. A notional, demonstrably inadequate, amount is
included in the overall payment. It may be unreasonable to ask the water
companies to bear this burden, but the pre-1988 practice, of taxpayers
reimbursing all or part of the actual water bill along with the rates and
the rent, is the only civilised alternative to a cap on charges. Tory
policies have made the poor worse off, in some cases absolutely as well as
relatively. Making water high-cost for low-income households is indecent.
The industry regulator, Ofwat, must not allow itself to be deceived. Its
director general, Mr Ian Byatt, has to show he can be tougher than the
initial Ridley formula. It will be difficult, given his terms of reference.
He has to allow for a reasonable rate of return. Few private companies enjoy
such a guarantee. I would adore a portfolio of stocks backed by the
Ridley-inspired promise. It permits all sorts of jiggery-pokery to be
inflicted upon the accounting process. The regulator should be called Ofrip.
We shall see how well Mr Byatt has learnt this lesson when he publishes his
price decisions on July 28.
Meanwhile, the voters are being roused to take their revenge, as they did
over the poll tax. There has been a large swing to the Liberal Democrats in
the south-west, where water charges have risen most rapidly. Northern
electorates are already aware of the political significance of water
imposts. Labour's spokesman, Mr Chris Smith, is a moderate who would not
dream of advocating renationalisation. He speaks, rather, of toughening the
regulatory regime, encouraging the companies to borrow long term,
challenging charges to consumers, and reducing the growth in dividends.
Labour even favours 'efficiency', which means fewer jobs, preferably through
natural wastage.
A sensible Conservative government would pre-empt such a campaign, and admit
that it fumble-fingered water privatisation. The Tories must get it right,
or Labour will. This does not constitute an argument for renationalisation.
State monopolies are thoroughly discredited. We know their faults. But when
you turn to private monopolists to do a job, you regulate them with chains,
and where necessary beat them with rods, lash them, kick them and confine
them. Do all of that, or they will take you for everything you've got.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: Heroic years of American painting - William Packer
reviews the work of Franz Kline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So often it is by the smaller things - the shift of emphasis, the pattern
recognised only at a distance - that we learn revolution is achieved. We may
believe, for example, that painting and drawing are under siege, that the
orthodoxies of conceptualism run triumphant in the halls of Tate and Hayward
and the Councils of the wise. Indeed much of the current art-critical debate
is set on just this premise of embattled truth.
Yet suddenly we look about us and painting - good, solid, modern painting -
is everywhere. From Bonnard to assorted Brits, the Tate, Hayward, the
Serpentine and now the Whitechapel are full of the stuff.
Franz Kline could hardly be shown to greater advantage than at the
Whitechapel, with its high, open spaces and gentle light, where indeed we
last had a proper view of him all of 30 years ago. The group of large,
deceptively simple canvases with which the show begins, black abstract
figures on white grounds, is spectacular. Here at once we confront a true
artist in his pomp. It is an exciting moment.
Kline was one of the leading figures of the New York School of painters of
the 1940s and '50s, that we know collectively as the abstract
expressionists. Such artists as Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning were his
friends and, if he was not the greatest, he was certainly, in his time, the
equal of any of them. But his fate was to die of a heart attack in 1962, a
little short of his 52nd birthday, at just the time when the painting of
which he was so conspicuous a champion was sweeping the world at last.
It was no longer, then, a question of whether, as an artist, you were
figurative or abstract, let alone modernist or academic. For a brief
art-historical moment it was enough to be American and from New York. There
were the abstract expressionists, and there were the rest.
The pre-eminence that American criticism claimed for the abstract
expressionists seemed to work against Kline simply by the accident of his no
longer being there to enjoy, or perhaps be exploited, in the words of his
present apologist, Stephen Foster: 'by the commercialisation of the avant
garde'. He was neither the hero dead too soon - Pollock, Gottlieb - nor yet
another 'greatest living painter' - de Kooning, Rothko, etc. Now revisionist
criticism, it seems, is trying to detach him from his peers and claim him as
a radical traditionalist all along - one who attempted 'to reject the entire
modernist legacy'. That too would seem another doubtful favour.
'Art and the Structure of Identity' is the exhibition's sub-title, which
shows what we are up against. 'I here understand Kline,' says Professor
Foster, 'as one of the last in a long 20th century history of anti-modernist
statements. He lays claim to our serious attention because of his successful
transaction of a period without modernism's clear critical, theoretical,
aesthetic or historical guidelines and without its inevitability, tradition,
or aesthetic directionality.'
What we are actually left with, once the critical heroics fall away, are
paintings, monumental in their authority, extremely moving in their
emotional charge, and very beautiful. The show covers the last 15 years of
Kline's life, and shows us the steady and natural development of his work in
that time, as it moved from the external, albeit abstracted visual
reference, fraught with surreal and symbolic suggestion, towards something
much purer, more simple and self-contained.
This was a journey Kline took along with his fellows, arguing vociferously
the while. From our vantage point it is clear that the truly heroic years in
modern American painting were the 1940s, when this course was being charted,
rather than later, when achievement became fixed as style and mannerism.
But with Kline this later fixing never quite happened. Always there remained
the implicit possibility change and surprise, even in the later, seemingly
more formulaic works. The image, the calligraphic figure is a loosely-stated
structure or compositional scaffold, laid on with great sweeping strokes of
the broadest of brushes. The paint is vigorous and spontaneous in the act of
painting, various in consistency and surface, and over-painted again and
again, to leave the history of the making half-visible in hints of colour
here, and changes of direction there.
'I don't decide in advance that I am going to paint a definite experience,'
he said, 'but in the act of painting, it becomes a genuine experience for
me.' It is as simple, and as imponderable, as that.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: Dangerous Corner - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JB Priestley was born a hundred years ago this year, and the West End run of
last year's National Theatre production of An Inspector Calls continues. You
would think that these two facts would prompt a slew of other Priestley
revivals. But no. Chichester, which has just revived his first play, the
seldom-seen thriller Dangerous Corner, is almost alone in honouring JBP.
Strange.
The fun of watching Dangerous Corner for the first time is its suspense.
About once every five minutes, Priestley springs another brilliant surprise
on you. 1: Who went to see Martin the night he committed suicide? 2: Who
else went to see him that night? 3: Was it really Martin who stole the
firm's money? 4: Who was in love with Martin? 5: Who else was in love with
Martin? 6: Who actually shot Martin? 6: Why was Martin shot? 7: Who was
taking drugs at the time? 8: Who knew who killed Martin? 9: What did the
killer see after shooting Martin? And there are a few other twists, most of
which reveal who else around the room has actually always been in love with
whom. Then the two big twists at the end. Not a dull moment.
This production is, for Chichester, a sequel to last year's staging of
Patrick Hamilton's Rope. Priestley was one of the earliest admirers of the
original Rope; last year's Rope (which recently had a short-lived West End
transfer) and this year's Dangerous Corner share the same director, Keith
Baxter. The pacing is good, and the period style tolerable. The first
half-hour has considerably too much restless musical-chairs moving around
the stage - I missed one of Freda's main revelations because I got
distracted by the posey glide she was making across the room - and a
photograph in the programme shows you that the 1938 production created a
more authentically lived-in drawing-room than Simon Higlett's model
interior-design set.
Freda (hostess to the evening's dinner-party, wife to Robert, and
sister-in-law to the late Martin) is Gayle Hunnicutt, every aspect of whose
glamour and deportment is so synthetic that it is hard to believe in her,
though this leads to a good moment when her poised facade cracks and she
sobs for the first time. Peter McEnery is Robert - slightly underpowered but
expertly focused. Emily Raymond, as the level-headed and well-mannered
Olwyn, gives a much more arresting performance than she did across the road
in The Rivals.
Charles Stanton (one of Robert's co-directors in the firm and in love with
*****) is played, perhaps too affably but with just the right assurance, by
Christopher Timothy. Betty, a young wife who turns out to be that bit more
experienced than we knew, is played, well, by Biddy Hodson. Her husband
Gordon (Freda's brother and a co-director in the firm) is Tristan Gemmill,
who gives the evening's finest performance, with a good flair for both
period elegance and neurotic disturbance. Oh yes - and Jean Boht contributes
a little cameo performance as the drawling Miss Mockridge, which she
delivers with enough panache to make you surprised that her role turns out
to be the smallest.
In repertory at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, until August 6.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: A volatile Don Giovanni - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glyndebourne's new Giovanni, Gilles Cachemaille, never stops stripping. No
sooner has he donned one shirt than he yanks it off to be replaced by
another which Leporello hands him, or else he struts bare-chested for a
while. That suggests that he is perpetually hot, and also that he wants to
show it (perhaps that is part of his technique): hot for it, hotter than
hell. This last presumptive claim is wrong, as proved by the designer
Hildegard Bechtler's final vision of hell as a monstrous, flaming
grill-room.
That is the only 'realistic' set in Deborah Warner's production - and of
course it is not realistic. Otherwise there is just a moveable platform
(lowered ever so slowly from the flies onto a pit during the Overture), a
high industrial tunnel, a tacky plastic curtain and the occasional
staircase. Miss Warner has chosen to stake everything on character and
visible action (and Mozart's music, which she leaves intact) while shunning
anything picturesque.
No palaces, meadows or ballrooms, let alone an equestrian statue; nothing
'period' that might fix the social status of the characters, though Sue
Blane's choice of modern gear for them conveys many a sly hint. Many of the
Glyndebourne audience loved it (as did I), probably most; some booed. Of the
latter, some were no doubt traditionalists who pined for the usual
trappings, but others - especially those new to the opera - were foxed,
perhaps, by this parade of passions anchored in no solid reality. Knowing
more about the opera than Miss Warner wants to show us may be a prerequisite
for relishing what she actually does with it.
Simon Rattle conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with his
usual towering vitality. I was less struck by any special period-instrument
colours, perhaps because they have become familiar now, than by how faint
some of the witty string-comments sounded. But anything from the pit
dwindled against what we heard and saw from the singers; Miss Warner has
wrenched terrifically vivid character from most of them (slow though they
are with recitatives). Even glum, passive Don Ottavio is at least made
vividly glum and passive, and beautifully sung, by John Mark Ainsley.
Amanda Roocroft's Donna Elvira is wrong-footed by her first appearance, as a
pretty waif travelling with plastic water-bottle and shopping-bag, but she
restores the lady's essential dignity in her music later. Hillevi
Martinpelto sings Donna Anna with elegance, if without much sense of tragedy
beyond melodrama. Juliane Banse's Zerlina, sweetly knowing, throws Roberto
Scaltriti's seething Masetto (perfectly defined by his flash suit) into
still better relief; they are a splendid pair, with unending explosions
clearly indicated for their wedded life post-opera.
Though I am not convinced that a live, dinner-jacketted Commendatore can
carry the full dramatic weight of a stone statue, Gudjon Oskarsson sings him
with measured aplomb. As Leporello, Sanford Sylvan - the memorable Chou
en-Lai of John Adams' Nixon in China - is a ripe model of seen-it-all
weariness, full of comic touches, and delivered with a quick musical
alertness rare in Leporellos. Above all, however, it is Cachemaille's
riveting anti-hero who carries the show, and the evening.
As if hellbent to prove that he is not just one of Nature's Leporellos
(Cachemaille's usual role in the opera), he displays a range of vocal
variety and feeling that leaves most Giovannis standing, even to
unexpectedly seductive, honeyed tones for 'La ci darem' and the Serenade.
Writers sometimes suggest that Don Giovanni is really a failed seducer, on
the strength of his failed seductions in the opera; the manic, acharne lust
with which Cachemaille invests him gives the lie to that utterly.
Beyond it there is a mad, dangerous volatility, a constant threat that he
may do anything next, just for the hell of it. There is something absolutely
right about that. From now on, Giovannis who lack it, whatever their other
virtues, are going to seem a little pallid - decorous persons impersonating
a seriously wild man.
In repertory at Glyndebourne until August 24.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on Cypriot import certificates
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When citrus fruit and potatoes are imported from the part of Cyprus to the
north of the United Nations buffer zone, member countries of the European
Union are precluded from accepting movement and phyto-sanitary certificates
issued by authorities other than the competent authorities of the Republic
of Cyprus.
This was the European Court of Justice ruling on the interpretation of the
1972 EEC/Cyprus Association Agreement and a 1977 directive on plant health
controls. The ruling was given in the context of English judicial review
proceedings against the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by
Republic of Cyprus fruit and potato exporters.
They challenged the UK authorities' practice of allowing imports into the UK
accompanied by certificates issued by the Turkish community. Movement
certificates prove goods' Cyprus origin, in particular for purposes of
preferential treatment, and phyto-sanitary certificates guarantee plant
health.
It was agreed by the parties that the Republic of Cyprus is a sovereign
state, recognised by European Community member states; that the UK imports
significant volumes of citrus products and potatoes from the part of Cyprus
to the north of the UN buffer zone, accompanied by certificates issued by
the Turkish community there; and that none of the certificates are issued by
the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus.
The ECJ confirmed previous decisions establishing that the system whereby
movement certificates are regarded as evidence of the origin of products is
founded on the principle of mutual reliance and co-operation between the
competent authorities of the exporting and importing states.
Such co-operation was excluded with the authorities of an entity such as
that in the northern part of Cyprus, which is recognised neither by the
Community nor by the member countries. The only Cypriot state they recognise
is the Republic of Cyprus.
Accordingly, the ECJ held that the provisions must be interpreted strictly,
to ensure uniform application of the agreement. 'The customs authorities of
the exporting state' must be interpreted as referring exclusively to the
competent authorities of the Republic of Cyprus when exports to the EC are
involved. The agreement, therefore, precluded acceptance of certificates
from other authorities.
The Greek and Irish governments intervened in support of the applicants. The
UK and the Commission, however, claimed that the special situation of Cyprus
justified acceptance of certificates issued by the entity in the northern
part of the island, in order to prevent discrimination between nationals or
companies of Cyprus, so as to ensure the entire population of Cyprus enjoyed
the commercial advantages available under the agreement.
The ECJ held that the de facto partition of the territory of Cyprus, as a
result of the intervention of the Turkish armed forces in 1974, into one
zone where the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus continue fully to
exercise their powers and another zone where they cannot do so, raises
problems difficult to resolve in connection with the application of the
agreement to the whole of Cyprus. However, that did not warrant a departure
from the clear, precise and unconditional provisions of the agreement's
rules on the origin of products and administrative co-operation.
The Court also rejected arguments based on international law which the
Commission claimed justified a practice which it was found to have
unilaterally applied of distributing stamps and signatures used on
unauthorised certificates. For similar reasons, the ECJ held that the term
'authorities empowered' in the 1977 directive must be interpreted as
referring exclusively to the authorities empowered by the Republic of Cyprus
to issue phyto-sanitary certificates. The directive, therefore, precluded
the acceptance of certificates issued by other authorities.
The ECJ also ruled that the answers would be no different even if certain
circumstances connected with the special situation of the island of Cyprus
were taken as established.

FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Burgmans to head southern Europe for Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Antony Burgmans, Unilever's director of personal products, is about to swap
the world of perfumes and toothpaste for that of ice creams and beverages.
On August 1, he takes up a new appointment on Unilever's Foods Executive as
director for southern Europe, succeeding Charles Miller-Smith, just
appointed chief executive of ICI. The three-strong executive oversees the
smooth running of the group's foods businesses around the world, divided
between north and south Europe and the US.
The appointment will take Burgmans, 47, back to his native Netherlands;
Rotterdam will be the base for his travels around southern Europe.
Burgmans has been in charge of personal products business since he became a
director of Unilever in May 1991. He is also responsible for Unilever's
marketing projects group.
After studying business administration in the Netherlands and social and
political sciences in Stockholm, Burgmans gained a degree in business
administration at Lancaster University in north west England.
He joined Unilever in 1972 and his career has given him an opportunity of
working in near and far-flung parts of the multinational's empire. He was
marketing director of Lever Germany from 1985 to 1987 and then chairman of
PT Unilever in Indonesia until 1991.
Burgmans will be succeeded in London by American-born Robert Phillips, 55,
currently chairman of Unilever Prestige Personal Products. Phillips was
president of Chesebrough-Pond's before joining Unilever in 1991. He is
expected to be nominated to the board next May. If this happens, he will be
the only American director, and only the second American ever to have sat on
the Unilever board.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A consultancy specialising in advice on the psychology of human resource
management to the legal profession was launched last week by former City
solicitor and psychologist Catherine Berney.
Berney, who worked in international finance at McCann Fitzgerald in Dublin
and Linklaters &amp; Paines in London, says many firms expanded in the late
1980s without any clear sense of direction and are now faced with
communication, career development and related personnel issues, which they
are ill-equipped to handle.
Personal skills are also not something which come naturally to most
solicitors, she says, yet increasingly they are asked to be ambassadors for
their firms without having received any presentational or communications
skills training.

FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Young promoted at Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of who will succeed Jeremy Lancaster, the chairman and managing
director of Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and
plumbing products, has found a partial answer in John Young's appointment as
group deputy managing director.
Lancaster, 58, a publicity-shy figure who took over from his father, Norman
Lancaster, in 1976, has transformed Droitwich-based Wolseley from a
poorly-performing builders' merchants into one of Britain's most admired
companies. In terms of its market capitalisation of Pounds 2.2bn, it is now
over 50 per cent bigger than Tarmac which once tried to take it over in the
1970s.
Although Lancaster has not formally said when he intends to retire, it is
widely believed that he may hand in his notice when he reaches 60, hence the
growing interest in the succession. The assumption is that the company will
recruit a non-executive chairman and a new chief executive will be promoted
from within.
However, several of the obvious candidates are close to retirement. Richard
Ireland, Wolseley's finance director who has also been standing in as
non-executive chairman of Severn Trent, is expected to retire after the
annual meeting later this year and William Ferris, chief executive of
Wolseley's engineering, electrical and plastics operations, died in April.
In some respects Young, 49, comes from a similar background to Lancaster who
did his apprenticeship at GKN before joining the family company in 1961.
Young trained as an apprentice at TI Group before joining Wolseley in 1978
when his family business of PJ Parmiter was bought for Pounds 1.8m. He was
promoted to the board in 1982 when he was made responsible for the
agricultural division and subsequently became responsible for the
photographic and technical services operations.
Young is the most senior of several new appointments to the Wolseley board.
It has already been announced that Steve Webster, a partner in Price
Waterhouse, is joining the board at the end of the month as deputy group
finance director. Gerard Pinault, president directeur general, Brossette
BTI, and Andrew Hutton, managing director Wolseley Centers, are also joining
the board.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: The trouble with bananas - Anton van
Schijndel on the effect of Gatt rules on EC legal protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTON VAN SCHIJNDEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulations on banana imports mean the European Community may be on the
point of scrapping the enforceability of rules drawn up under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In February last year, the EC Council adopted a regulation for the European
banana market as part of the EC internal market programme. It is designed to
protect banana cultivation in the EC and to maintain the existing level of
banana imports from former colonies of France, the UK and Italy. Otherwise,
imports of bananas from Central and South America are expected to gain an
increasing share of the EC market.
The move caused several Latin American countries, which are exporters of
bananas, to file complaints under the Gatt. A Gatt panel found that the
regulation violates the Gatt's prohibition of import quotas and its
prohibition of discrimination between Gatt members.
Shortly after the EC Council adopted the regulation, Germany challenged its
validity in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg. The Germans
dislike the regulation's bureaucratic, Gosplan-like set-up and the higher
prices it entails. One of the grounds which Germany invokes to invalidate
the regulation is that it breaches Gatt rules.
Last month, however, in an opinion in the case, Claus Gulmann, advocate
general at the ECJ, concluded that the regulation had been lawfully enacted.
His opinion will be a concern to those who believe the Community should not
stray from its commitment to free trade. But more worrying is the way he
deals with the issue of legal protection against illegal Community acts. The
advocate general proposes to eliminate an entire class of EC legal rules as
grounds for review by the ECJ. In large part, the EC's obligations under the
Gatt are to be scrapped as grounds for review.
In the EC, the chances of legal action succeeding depend partly on the
grounds which may be invoked before the courts. In this respect the 'direct
effect' of many rules of Community law helps EC citizens, by allowing them
to rely on those rules in their own courts.
Moreover, the ECJ has ruled that international agreements entered into by
the Community may also contain provisions with direct effect. This is
because Article 228 of the Rome treaty provides that international
agreements are binding on the Community's institutions and on its member
states.
In EC law, the Gatt ranks on a par with such international agreements, even
though the Community never formally acceded to the 1947 Gatt accord. In the
1972 International Fruit Company case, however, the court denied direct
effect to the provisions of Gatt. It is therefore not possible to invoke the
Community's obligations under the Gatt in national courts.
Yet, five years ago, the ECJ confirmed that Gatt rules constitute grounds
for review in actions brought before it. As a result, EC secondary
legislation (such as the Council's banana regulation) will be annulled if
the Court finds it conflicts with Gatt obligations.
It is this rule of EC law which the advocate general wants to curtail.
His point of departure is the fact that the banana scheme is currently the
subject of negotiations with several Latin American countries. It could
therefore jeopardise the Community's chances to safeguard its interests if
the ECJ invalidated the Council's regulation.
He then points to the reasons given in the International Fruit Company case
for denying direct effect of Gatt rules. In the 1972 case, the ECJ referred
to the flexibility of the Gatt system and to its basic principle of
negotiations aimed at mutual exchange of advantages. In particular, the ECJ
pointed to the many possibilities for derogations to Gatt rules, the
provisions concerning unilateral safeguard measures and the Gatt's
consensus-based dispute settlement system as examples of the Gatt's
flexibility. The Court's assessment has been criticised as a misjudgment of
the binding nature of Gatt rules, but it did not reverse its case law.
The advocate general then says neither the Gatt's reciprocity principle nor
its dispute settlement mechanism precludes Gatt rules from having legal
effects under EC law. Moreover, he adds, notwithstanding the Gatt's
flexibility, its rules may be sufficiently clear and unconditional to be
applied by the European Court.
Then comes a change of direction. The advocate general says the reasons
which preclude national courts from applying the Gatt also apply in actions
brought before the ECJ, unless the disputed Community measure itself
expressly refers to the Gatt.
In support of this argument, he quotes the 1989 Fediol and 1991 Nakajima
cases. In these cases the ECJ recognised that Gatt rules constitute grounds
for judicial review. They both concerned Community legislation in which
explicit reference was made to particular Gatt rules - a fact the Court
mentioned in both judgments. This leads the advocate general to conclude
that only Community legislation which expressly refers to Gatt obligations
may be reviewed in the light of Gatt rules.
It is very clear, however, that the banana regulation does not refer to the
Gatt. In fact, it could never have done so, because it breaches pertinent
Gatt rules.
The advocate general's reasoning is unconvincing. First, international
agreements are part and parcel of the EC legal order, binding on all
Community institutions, including the ECJ. Such is the wording of Article
228 (7) EC. Second, rules contained in international agreements thus form
part of the law which the Court is charged to uphold. Third, both member
states and private parties are entitled to invoke these rules in actions
brought before the ECJ.
Yet Article 228 EC receives scant attention in the 16 pages of the opinion
which deal with the Gatt. Instead, a strange new category of EC legal rules
is introduced, namely those which can neither be enforced through the
national courts nor through the European Court. This is highly
unsatisfactory - especially when considering the existing imperfections in
the EC system for legal protection. A decline in the level of protection
would therefore be all the more undesirable.
The advocate general's reasoning seems to reflect a sense of unease about
the potential consequences under EC law of the Uruguay Round's new Gatt
rules. The new Gatt Codes provide for stringent disciplines in many areas,
and include dispute settlement procedures which no longer allow the
Community to block unwelcome Gatt dispute panel reports.
Yet some EC member states still believe that compliance with Gatt rules is a
matter to be dealt with at diplomatic conferences only. They feel the
Community would be 'defenceless' against its trading partners if Gatt rules
could be enforced through the ECJ. They therefore believe the internal
effect of the Gatt rules should be limited within Community law.
One wonders, however, how this view could be squared with the pertinent
provisions of the Rome treaty. Moreover, the trade diplomacy argument fails
to appreciate the Community's overriding interest in a free and orderly
trading system based on liberal principles.
Contrary to the advocate general's apparent belief, the enforceability of
Gatt rules within the EC is an asset and not a weakness. It allows the EC
institutions to withstand protectionist pressures, thereby strengthening the
Community's position in pushing for further liberalisation of world trade.
In this broader context, there are no reasons to ask the European Court to
abdicate its powers of review under the Treaty of Rome.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Technology: On the move, but still in touch - Pan-European
mobile telephones are becoming increasingly popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are pan-European mobile telephones a business necessity or the ultimate
executive toy? Whatever the answer, we shall soon be hearing more about
them. James Ross, telecommunications analyst at Hoare Govett, says Vodafone
will be promoting its EuroDigital service more heavily this summer and
Cellnet has launched a rival service this month.
Friedman Wagner-Dobler, a computer consultant at Clasma Software, bought his
Vodafone GSM telephone because 'our marketplace is Europe, so it's useful to
be contactable on the numerous occasions I escape to Sweden or Germany'. GSM
(Global System for Mobile) is a digital cellular technology which is
becoming the standard for new European digital mobile telephone services.
British Nuclear Fuels bought a number of Cellnet GSM telephones from
Securicor Cellular Services to comply with European regulations for the
transportation of hazardous goods. It uses the telephones to keep in touch
with trucks carrying fuel rods and to inform the authorities of the position
of its vehicles.
The benefits are clear enough, but what are the choices if a telephone is
needed that works on the Continent? In the UK, Vodafone and Cellnet offer
GSM cellular services which can be used in continental Europe through
so-called roaming agreements with national service providers. Although
Cellnet's service is officially launched this month, it has been available
for some time to customers who request it.
The two GSM services are separate from the analogue services offered by
Vodafone and Cellnet. This means would-be users will have to buy expensive
new handsets costing around Pounds 200-Pounds 500, whereas the analogue
equivalent can be bought for as little as Pounds 50-Pounds 100.
However, because any GSM telephone will work with any GSM network, it is
possible to shop around for telephones and even services, according to Peter
Coates, marketing director of Multinational Automated Clearing House, a
company which helps to simplify cross-charging between a number of European
mobile telephone operators.
'Phone prices vary from country to country and you may pay different prices
depending on whether you buy the phone with or without airtime,' says
Coates. Tariffs for services also vary. 'Switzerland is one of the cheapest
places to get GSM from, as is Sweden.'
In addition to the GSM options, two UK mobile services, Mercury's One-2-One
and Hutchison Microtel's Orange, are signing roaming agreements with other
European operators whose services are also based on PCN (Personal
Communications Network) digital technology, a variant of GSM. At present,
there are few of these, but One-2-One and Orange users should eventually be
able to use their telephones in Germany, where PCN operator E-Plus is
offering services in Leipzig and Berlin.
Whatever service is chosen, a pan-European mobile telephone is unlikely to
be cheap. This is not because registration charges or monthly subscription
charges are particularly high; a Vodafone or Cellnet GSM user pays about the
same for UK calls and for registration and subscription as a business
customer of its analogue services. The reason is that the mark-up on calls
between countries can be vast. Yet despite this, most customers feel they
receive value for money when using their GSM telephones in Europe.
Would-be GSM users should be aware that if they receive a call when they are
away from their home country, they must pay for the international leg of the
call at BT rates. The caller pays the usual UK charge for dialling a
cellular phone and may not even know the person being called is abroad.
Using the voice mail services provided by cellular operators can also prove
expensive. Wagner-Dobler says: 'If you use your phone in, say, Sweden, any
unanswered calls will be redirected to Vodafone Recall (voice messaging).
The calls will first be bounced from the UK to Sweden and then bounced back
to the UK and you will pay for both international calls.'
One way of avoiding this expense, according to Vodafone, is to pre-program
the telephone to 'call forward unconditional' before leaving the UK. All
calls will go straight to Vodafone Recall and can still be checked from
Sweden or elsewhere.
GSM coverage in Europe is still patchy. Mike Caldwell, a Vodafone spokesman,
says it is very good in Germany and Scandinavia, good in Italy and the UK
and virtually non-existent in Spain. Service in France is limited.
Using an overseas GSM network is easy. Provided a credit-card sized
Subscriber-Identity-Module Card (with built-in computer chip) is inserted
into the telephone, it will select a local GSM network automatically. The
local GSM network will also notify the home network where you are so it can
transfer calls.
Call quality is better in some countries than others, and mountainous areas
are particularly subject to difficulty.
Despite such teething problems, Wagner-Dobler is not alone when he says:
'It's a miracle that this kind of thing works at all.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Technology: All change at Lloyd's - The insurance market is
about to embrace electronic processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high-tech appearance of the glass and steel building in London occupied
by the Lloyd's insurance market has rarely been matched by the state of the
technology used within it. Until 1990, for instance, Lloyd's was one of the
world's largest users of punched cards, a near-obsolete form of data
processing.
The punched cards, which it used to carry details of insurance risks, have
now been dispensed with. But several other aspects of Lloyd's business
systems still look old-fashioned. For example, nearly all risks at Lloyd's
are placed in the traditional fashion by brokers clutching heavy leather
folders of documents and walking from underwriter to underwriter.
The need to improve Lloyd's use of technology has been given a high priority
as it attempts to pull itself back from the record-breaking losses of recent
years. The importance placed on the new systems last month prompted Peter
Middleton, chief executive, to ask each of the broking and underwriting
firms to appoint a main board director to take responsibility for the
changes.
Lloyd's plans to cut Pounds 20m of operating costs each year by a move to
electronic processing and the streamlining of its business processes were
announced in Lloyd's business plan last year. One of the most fundamental
changes proposed by Lloyd's is the introduction of electronic placing
support, which means that all contracts will have to be put on screen by
January 1996.
The significance of the electronic contract is that it should create cost
savings down the processing chain. These should flow from reduced paper
handling, from the elimination of the need to re-key data and the associated
cost of validating data and correcting errors.
At the same time, full electronic processing will also improve the
centrally-held information for syndicates and managing agents. For instance,
Lloyd's believes that more timely information on signed premium income will
allow it to manage its capacity more effectively.
On the face of it, this move towards a paperless market has taken an
inordinately long time. When the use of the electronic placing system
becomes mandatory in 1996, it will be nearly 10 years after Big Bang swept
away the need for face-to-face dealings on the stock exchange.
The slow pace of progress is blamed partly on the complexity of the business
handled at Lloyd's and partly on the highly fragmented nature of the market,
which means there are few big players with sufficient clout to force through
changes. The need for consultation and consensus has restricted the pace of
change.
Nonetheless, Lloyd's and the other players in the London insurance market
have made some strides towards electronic processing. In the summer of 1987,
underwriters and brokers from all sectors of the London market joined
together to develop a market network - called the London Insurance Market
Network (Limnet) which embraced electronic data exchange, interactive
terminal switching, electronic mail, and various information services from
Lloyd's and outside suppliers. Limnet is now the largest commercial
insurance network in the world, handling some 25m transactions every year.
The most recent development in Lloyd's efforts to press ahead with new
systems was the Lloyd's Outwards Reinsurance Scheme (Lors).
Since the beginning of December 1993, this has processed all outward
reinsurance debit and credit notes electronically, thus scrapping the need
for processing 1m pieces of paper a year and cutting the average cost of
each transaction from Pounds 1.21 to 60p.
But the introduction of Lors did not go entirely smoothly. 'The problem was
that the staff needed training which was done in a haphazard way,' says
Janine Bailey of Lloyd's Business Applications Support. Instead of building
up gradually to the deadline of December 1 1993 when the use of Lors became
compulsory, too many firms had a last-minute rush to get familiar with the
system.
Lloyd's wants to learn from its experience with Lors by gradually increasing
the volume of business placed electronically until it becomes compulsory in
January 1996. But progress so far has been halting. Since electronic placing
was introduced in March 1992, there have been 3,000 risks placed on the
system, equivalent to just 0.05 per cent of the total volume.
Lloyd's is adamant that the impending arrival of electronic processing
should be taken seriously by the senior executives of the broking and
underwriting firms, and not just by their IT specialists. The reason is that
the impact of the new systems will go far beyond the IT department to affect
the working lives of everyone in the business. 'It is not a technological
problem. It is a cultural problem about change in business practice,' says
Andy Coppell, Lloyd's systems and operations director.
It is not yet clear how radical the changes to business practice will be. It
still remains to be seen how far the arrival of electronic processing will
erode the practice of 'face-to-face' negotiations and the personal
relationships on which the market has been built.
So far, the consensus is that simple types of insurance such as personal
accident policies will be placed electronically. But face-to-face
negotiations will still be needed in the insurance of more complex risks,
which involve copious amounts of information. 'For anything with the
slightest complication, there will still be a need for face to face,' says
Martin Hall, a broker.
But even if the new technology does not sweep away existing business
practices completely, some of the consequences of introducing new technology
may be painful.
The ironing out of inefficiencies will save costs, at the expense of jobs.
It is no wonder that electronic processing is not viewed with enthusiasm by
everyone.
Coppell acknowledges the problem. 'You are asking people to embrace this
technology knowing it will put them out of a job. It is a psychological
barrier.'
However, he believes that Lloyd's has no choice but to embrace the new
technology. 'If you don't modernise and become more cost effective, your
volumes will come down. There is a bigger history of job reduction in
industry by inefficiency rather than by successful application of
technology.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Shy lenders on the high
street - A bar to corporate borrowing from building societies is being
removed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society bought Girobank in 1990, it was
not allowed to take over the bank's commercial lending portfolio. To have
done so would have contravened the 1986 Building Society Act.
In retrospect, Alliance &amp; Leicester might be grateful that it was spared the
dreadful losses many commercial banks suffered in the recession from lending
to smaller companies.
But government plans announced last week mean that, subject to members'
approval, building societies will be able to expand dramatically their
lending to corporate customers.
According to Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, this will provide
a welcome new source of funds for business and 'introduce a new element of
competition into an area traditionally dominated by a small number of high
street banks'.
Are building societies likely to want to compete with high street banks and
would this move be welcomed by borrowers?
Under the 1986 act, the societies have been able to lend if their loans are
secured on assets such as pubs, hotels, nursing homes and factories. 'Some
regret doing it,' says Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building
Societies Association.
They will now in theory also be allowed to lend against any type of asset,
or even unsecured.
The BSA has given this part of the government's proposed changes a lukewarm
reception. But they welcome the changes at the smallest end of the market.
In the past, societies lending to sole traders had to stop lending if they
incorporated. 'We did not see why we had to withdraw because the sole trader
incorporated,' says Coles.
The reaction from small-business lobby groups has also been less than
universally enthusiastic. They welcome any move that increases sources of
lending because that would tend to bring down the cost of borrowing. But
they would not want a return to the experience of the past five years when,
they say, over-zealous lending has been followed by a cooling of banks'
enthusiasm. The plan to increase competition is most likely to be thwarted,
however, by the building societies' own reluctance. The most compelling
example of that disinclination can be found at Abbey National, which shed
its building society status in 1989 when it became a publicly quoted bank.
Since then Abbey National has made no move into commercial banking and says
it has no intention of straying beyond its personal finance market.
The societies are fully aware of how badly the banks were damaged by the
recession. Their losses are well recorded. But the societies are just as
scared of the bad publicity that banks received after cutting overdraft
lines and calling in receivers.
'Most societies will be very wary and approach commercial lending
tentatively,' says Coles. 'They will see what the banks lost in the early
1990s and what happened to the banks' PR.'
Chris Smith, analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, also doubts that societies
will now rush into commercial lending.
Small and medium-sized corporations are repaying more than they are
borrowing at the moment, meaning the societies would be chasing a share of a
shrinking market.
If the societies moved quickly into commercial lending they would risk
picking up only those accounts the banks were happy to lose.
Longer term, however, Smith believes building societies might consider
taking on the main lending banks, but only if there were first significant
mergers of societies and if returns from lucrative mortgage lending showed
signs of a long-term decline.
For the time being, it seems, companies seeking loans will be making
appointments with high street bank managers and not their counterparts next
door in the building society.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Fujitsu staff go it alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan, where lifetime employment is the norm and people tend to be paid
on seniority rather than merit, leaving the corporate fold to set up a risky
new business is almost unheard of.
But Fujitsu, the computer company, wants to encourage some of its 54,000
Japanese employees to do just that and maybe help them become rich in the
process. As part of its campaign to make staff more flexible, it will put up
money for them to strike out on their own to develop new technology products
and services.
The idea of corporate venturing is well established in the US and, to a
lesser extent, in the UK. Despite the absence in Japan of a widespread
venture capital mentality, Toru Katsurada, Fujitsu's planning and personnel
director, hopes technology experts can be spurred to develop an aggressive
entrepreneurial streak. The programme, called new venture system, is still
at an embryonic stage, with only two projects (still confidential) under
consideration.
It was announced last month and, believes Katsurada, is virtually unique in
Japan. For every venture it approves - up to five are expected to be
launched each year - it will match funds from the ex-Fujitsu owner, who will
own 51 per cent.
'It's a high-risk, high-return programme,' he adds. 'We might lose an
excellent engineer and incur a large loss if the venture fails - but we
might be able to introduce new products as a result of this system.'
Fujitsu will expect each venture to start making profits after three years.
Because Japanese stock market listing requirements are so strict, start-up
companies cannot easily use flotation as a way to take profits. So if the
owner wants to sell, Fujitsu will buy the shares at a 'very high' negotiated
price, if justified.
The ventures could be in any area of information technology, says Katsurada.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call for a repeat
performance - You must remain innovative but in doing so you could lose
everything. Richard Gourlay on a necessary risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Producing a technological innovation that will create a market and launch a
company is difficult enough. Repeating the trick so that the competition
does not catch up and turn your innovation into a commodity product is
altogether a trickier proposition.
The result is that many companies that should have sold out after stage one
are unable to maintain the momentum into stage two and see their value fall.
One company that is trying to negotiate the tricky path of innovation is
Newport Technology Group, a maker of electrical components based in Newport
Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.
Four years ago the company developed a new way of making small DC-DC
converters - devices used by design engineers to produce the different
voltages required by small components and to isolate power sources.
The converters are an unlikely hybrid. Using skills originally developed in
the local lace-making industry, a small army of part-time outworkers 'sew'
the wire windings on to Newport Technology's miniature ferrite transformers.
This cottage industry is then brought together with the 20th century. The
windings are mounted on a ceramic substrate, or board, which disperses heat
more efficiently than the printed circuit board used by many DC-DC
converters. The result is that Newport Technology has consistently been able
to make its converters smaller than the competition's, saving valuable
space.
Not only has Newport Technology carved out a worthwhile slice of the niche
DC-DC converter market and built sales from Pounds 1m to nearly Pounds 8m in
four years. The improved margins have helped finance innovation in the
production process so that the 'sewing' ladies now share a factory with
robots that help assemble the converters.
The manner in which Newport Technology has innovated products and processes
is instructive. Since the first innovation, the company has moved relatively
cautiously. But the initial break with the company's worthy past required a
degree of entrepreneurial chutzpah.
John Cummings, the recently arrived managing director of Newport Components,
the main group subsidiary, says the team which backed the push into hybrid
DC-DC converters took a gamble.
'John Baxter (the technical director) was convinced there was a market but
there was no established market,' he says. The customers did not know they
wanted the product until they were told it could be made at the right cost.
He compares the process with the selling of televisions in the 1950s when
the existing market was still small.
John Laurie, who invested in Newport Technology in 1990 and is now group
managing director, says deciding whether to back innovation is tricky. There
must be a balance between getting ahead of what the customer wants but not
so far ahead that the customer is not interested. No one wants to suffer the
fate of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, which introduced the laser
disc before the market was ready. 'There is no point developing something if
no one wants it,' says Laurie. 'But it's a fine balance because if you are
creating a market you have to stick your neck out.'
Newport Technology believes this move led to the development of a converter
that electronic product designers say is now a standard part of their tool
kit.
The company took a similar risk when it replaced the manual placement of
components with a robot-controlled process. 'Initially it was a bit of a
punt going with robotics,' says Laurie. 'We were not sure the computer could
handle the accuracy of placement.' But with some modifications of the
software it has become a feature of its operation, leading to a better
quality, yield and reliability.
The innovation of the hybrid DC-DC converter was followed by dozens of
further developments, many leading to reductions in size or increasing
capability to isolate high voltages. But Cummings says most of these
developments would not be classified as innovations. 'We have been in an
innovative period. Now there is a period for good product development and
market development,' he says.
Many companies do not get beyond this stage, according to Stuart Slatter,
visiting professor at the London Business School and author of the book
Gambling on Growth: How to Manage the Small High-Tech Firm. 'So many British
companies have an innovation that is enough to start up a company that gets
sales of Pounds 5m and then they have to come up with the next generation,'
he says. 'Often the next generation involves a new jump that is like
starting a company all over again.'
Newport Technology has in practice accepted this. But instead of seeking its
next innovation within the main operating company, it has set up a discrete
subsidiary, Newport Power Devices. This separately funded company is
developing ways to measure the life and residual power of lead acid
batteries.
'John (Laurie) is not confusing the need for the next level of innovation
with the money-making requirement of the existing idea,' says Cummings.
For Newport Technology, the mixture of product development and innovation -
and the ensuing improvement in margins - has put it in a virtuous circle.
The group has just opened a new manufacturing facility in Guangdong, China,
to increase capacity and take advantage of lower labour costs.
This has given Newport Technology the option to consider moving into the US
 -where it recognises margins will be squeezed - and in particular the mass
market supplying makers of boards for local area networks, each of which
require a DC-DC converter.
With Lans spreading at rapid pace, the attractions of the market are clear.
But Newport Technology does not want to lose the fruits of successful
innovation by going the way of so many British companies that have been
dazzled by the US market and stumbled.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Revenue moves on charity tax clause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue acted quickly yesterday to stave off a mistaken
interpretation of law which would have forced many charities operating
lotteries to pay additional tax.
In a parliamentary written answer, Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general,
said the Revenue had received advice that a technique used by charities to
set off lottery income against tax was 'incorrect'.
The change affects all charities that operated a lottery through a
subsidiary company which passed on the income through a deed of covenant.
Until now, the Revenue believed it was acceptable to use this structure
under section 5 of the 1976 Lotteries and Amusements Act to set the lottery
income against tax.
Its new advice suggests that the income from the lottery belongs to the
charity rather than to the subsidiary and the charity is therefore taxable
on the income.
However, Sir John stressed that the government did not want charities to be
disadvantaged by the changes in the interpretation of the law.
He said new legislation would be introduced in the next finance bill to
ensure charities would be exempt from tax on the lottery income as long as
the income is applied solely to the charity.
He said small lotteries operated under section 3 of the 1976 act would also
be exempted. The amendment would apply for accounting periods after March 31
next year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Hurd issues plea over EU entrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, appealed to Tory Euro-sceptics in the
Commons last night not to oppose the bill enabling Britain to agree the
entry of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria into the European Union.
He said that if their fears that the new entrants would boost the
development of the EU's social dimension proved well-founded, it would
increase the value of Britain's opt-out from the relevant section of the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Hurd urged the Euro-sceptics not to start opposing enlargement of the EU
'simply because we do not always agree with all the views of those who come
in'.
He stressed that as Sweden, Austria and Norway would be net contributors to
the EU's budget, they would share Britain's interests in budgetary
discipline and value for money.
Mr Hurd also emphasised that as a result of the additional number of net
contributors it was expected that the UK's contribution would be some Pounds
300m less during the first six years of accession than it would otherwise
have been. Other favourable factors included the benefit to Britain's
agricultural exports through the opening of the previously protected markets
of the four applicant countries.
Producers of offshore supplies for the oil industry would benefit from
Norway's acceptance of EU rules, he said.
Mr Hurd forecast that overall British business would benefit 'not hugely but
significantly' from enlargement of the EU.
He also looked to the entrants to support the UK's drive for vigorous
application of 'subsidiarity' - ensuring that where possible decisions are
made at national level.
The European Union (Accessions) bill was given an unopposed second reading.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Defence group cleared on Iraq case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of defence consultants, convicted on its own admission in an
arms-for-Iraq case, was cleared by the Court of Appeal yesterday after
arguing that Customs prosecutors had abused the process of law by dissuading
defence witnesses from giving evidence.
Atlantic Commercial, based in Cuckney, Nottinghamshire, was fined Pounds
7,500 in November 1985 for exporting arms with intent to evade export
prohibitions. Two company directors, Mr Alexander Schlesinger and Mr
Reginald Dunk, were fined Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 12,500 respectively.
The defendants insisted that end-user certificates showed that Sterling
sub-machine guns intercepted by Customs, although paid for by Iraq, were
legitimately destined for Jordan and Sudan.
They had planned to contest the case and call witnesses from the Iraqi and
Jordanian embassies in London.
Last June the Scott inquiry heard evidence from Sir Stephen Egerton, former
assistant under-secretary at the Foreign Office, when it emerged that
Customs, backed by the Foreign Office, had deliberately interfered with
potential defence witnesses and persuaded embassies not to allow them to
give evidence.

FT  12 JUL 94 / No end of ways for an MP to top up pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Reverend William McCrea can testify, there are no end of ways in which
MPs can supplement their Pounds 31,687 salaries without accepting payment
for tabling parliamentary questions.
The Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster has an alternative source of
income more unusual than most: he is a gospel recording artist.
But he is not alone at Westminster in turning his creativity to profit. Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mrs Edwina Currie, the former health
minister, write fiction. Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the veteran Tory MP for
Perth and Kinross, paints.
No doubt Mr Hurd would continue to write and the Rev McCrea to sing
irrespective of whether they were MPs.
More controversial are the ways in which MPs exploit their positions to
augment their income.
Probably the most common method is agreeing to act as non-executive
directors or parliamentary advisers for companies, trade associations and
pressure groups.
Some directorships pre-date the time when an individual became an MP;
equally not all terminate when an MP ends his or her association with
Westminster.
But an MP on the payroll is particularly useful for organisations which are
keen to keep up with developments in parliament and ensure their views are
given satisfactory airings in the corridors of power.
One service which MPs might provide in return for their retainers is tabling
parliamentary questions on subjects of interest to their remunerator.
Another widespread source of income which is often but not always dependent
on an individual's position as an MP are fees received for journalism and
broadcasting.
Many allude to such payments in the annual register of members' interests -
including Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, who writes a
fortnightly column in Travel Weekly; and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary, who contributes two regular racing columns.
Restrictions on ministers are more stringent than those on ordinary MPs.
Directorships must be relinquished on taking office. Investments which might
give rise to a conflict of interest - actual or apparent - should be
disposed of or put in a blind trust.
This sometimes results in MPs having to take a sharp fall in income on being
promoted to office. Many ministers are permitted to remain members of the
Lloyd's insurance market. But they must obtain clearance from the prime
minister to do so.
Corporate directorships and many of the available posts as parliamentary
adviser are traditionally associated with Conservative MPs.
What is traditionally associated with their Labour counterparts is
sponsorship by a trade union. Details in the register of members' interests
are often accompanied by a note saying there is no personal gain to the MP
concerned.
There are one or two examples of Labour MPs having links with companies,
however. The register indicates that Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign
secretary, advises three companies, while Mr Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP
for Coventry North West, is chairman of a machine-tool company and an
engineering group.
This is sometimes said to be the age of the career politician, with more and
more MPs seeming to arrive at Westminster with little experience of
employment outside one party organisation or another.
But there is not much evidence that the extent of outside interests or the
high proportion of MPs who have them is on the decline.
Just 60 MPs had nothing to declare in the 1994 register, a document
requiring disclosure of overseas visits and land and property holdings in
addition to other interests. In 1987, the corresponding figure was 82.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Pearson chief warns at delay on multimedia law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday accused of squandering the momentum behind a
multi-media revolution by delaying legislation for the foreseeable future.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson, the media and
entertainment group which owns the Financial Times, warned that a couple of
years or more could be lost.
Speaking in the context of existing cross-media ownership rules, Mr Barlow
said the UK had a chance to lead the world in the media if the government
acted quickly and positively. Existing rules prevent newspapers owning more
than 20 per cent of broadcasters.
If the government did not act 'it could be hard for even the best players in
the industry to go forward as they would like to', Mr Barlow told a Media
Society lunch in London.
The danger was that even before a final set of recommendations had gone to
ministers from a committee looking into cross-media ownership rules, the
word in Whitehall was there would be no time for legislation.
If there was no time in the 1994-95 legislative programme real changes in
the 1995-96 parliamentary session could not be guaranteed because an
election would then be looming.
'So by squandering the momentum now, the government could be losing a couple
of years at least, perhaps more,' Mr Barlow said.
He added that he wanted to see the media treated like any other industry in
terms of ownership, subject to the normal rules of competition and
concentration of ownership.
Mr Barlow said he thought the barrier for individual ownership could be set
at 25 per cent of the whole market including newspaper sales and revenues
and television advertising and subscription revenues.
Such a suggestion if implemented would allow a much greater concentration of
media power than is permitted under existing legislation.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Channel 4 to lift spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 plans to end a three-year freeze on its programme budgets and
commit a further Pounds 20m over 18 months.
Because of the recession the channel's programme budget has been stuck at
Pounds 184m since 1991. This represents a substantial drop in real terms
because as well as being hit by inflation and the rising price of programmes
bought from the US, Channel 4's budget now also has to cover schools
programmes.
Mr John Willis, the channel's director of programmes, said yesterday that
competition between Channel 4, ITV, the BBC and British Sky Broadcasting -
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake -
had pushed up prices by between 60 per cent and 70 per cent in the past two
years.
Channel 4 has, for example, had to pay about Dollars 120,000 (Pounds 80,000)
per one-hour episode for the 22 episodes of ER, a hospital drama that will
probably be called Emergency Resuscitation when it is shown next year.
The extra Pounds 20m spending over 18 months will be spread across the
range, with special emphasis on UK drama and children's programmes.
Mr Willis said every Channel 4 department would be able to commission the
equivalent of three extra documentaries or one short series.
Last year Channel 4 won a 10.98 per cent share of total viewing. Until the
start of the World Cup - which will probably depress the channel's total
audience temporarily - the share had settled at 10.84 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Lilley acts on 'benefits tourism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced that it was stopping the payment of three
social security benefits to citizens of the European Economic Area on
temporary visits to the UK.
From August 1 people from the EEA - the European Union plus the Efta
countries - will have to prove that they are habitually resident in the UK
to claim income support, housing benefit or council tax benefit. These
means-tested benefits are paid to people on low incomes as a form of 'safety
net'.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the measures would bring an
end to 'benefits tourism' - the use of the social security system to finance
stays in Britain.
'In recent summers we have seen a growing number of European nationals
taking advantage of the accessibility of our benefit system to spend a few
months in Britain at the taxpayer's expense,' Mr Lilley said.
Entitlement to these benefits was stopped for most people from outside the
EEA in April. A series of court hearings involving foreigners who had abused
the benefits system enraged Tory MPs and led Mr Lilley to promise action at
last year's Conservative party conference.
Mr Lilley did not know how many from the EEA were involved in benefit
tourism. 'It is probably quite small, a few thousands at the start. But if
we were not to close this loophole it would grow.'
There would be no restrictions on freedom of movement, he said. People from
the EEA would still be welcome to seek work in Britain and would be paid
contributory benefits such as unemployment benefit if they already received
it in their own country.
Mr Lilley said that the measure would close a loophole, the existence of
which amazed other European countries. He added: 'Most other European
countries do not permit this kind of behaviour and neither should we.'
The German Family Ministry in Bonn - responsible for sustenance payouts
under the country's social security system - pointed out that Germany, too,
was sometimes the target of foreigners seeking to profit from generous
benefit payments.
Needy people can claim living allowance benefits of DM1,100 (Pounds 458) a
month. It is not limited to those with residence permits.
Non-Germans qualify only if they convince local social security offices that
they did not travel to Germany specifically to claim allowances.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, had serious
reservations about the government's approach. 'Any reform must be based upon
proper research and effectively target those responsible for abuse,' he
said. 'The government must demonstrate that the new regulations are fair and
workable.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / BCCI officer denies responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former official with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International accused
of helping to fraudulently boost the bank's profits was only following the
instructions of top management whose honesty he never doubted, he told the
Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Imran Imam, a former credit control officer at the bank's London office,
is charged with helping to boost the bank's profits by Dollars 250m by
manipulating loan accounts. He denies charges of conspiring to conceal
documents, furnishing false information and conspiring to falsify records.
Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Evans QC, prosecuting, Mr Iman agreed that as
credit control officer working with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief
executive, he had been involved in authorising loan guarantees for some of
its biggest customers. The prosecution claims these guarantees were part of
a fraudulent profit-boosting scheme.
Mr Imam agreed that, with hindsight, some of the documents he dealt with had
not been genuine. Yet he insisted he had always been acting on the
instructions of Mr Naqvi, who had usually drafted the documents, or the BCCI
board.
'I had no reason to doubt my superiors,' he said. If Mr Naqvi asked him to
transfer money around the world, he would do so, he said.
Mr Imam said the former chief executive had been in total control of affairs
at BCCI's headquarters.
'Information was given to me by Mr Naqvi on a need to know basis for
whatever work had to be carried out,' he said. He had not had full knowledge
of the transactions.
Mr Evans claimed that Mr Iman was trying to minimise his role in the alleged
fraud by pretending he was only the 'errand-boy'. As an official earning
Pounds 37,000 a year, his job was more than making the tea or making sure Mr
Naqvi's desk had been cleaned, Mr Evans said.
Mr Iman denied this but said that his job could involve running minor
errands at times.
The trial continues.

Labour yesterday warned the government not to deregulate the domestic gas
market without consulting parliament.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'Political decisions on
the provision of fuel should be made by elected politicians rather than by
unaccountable regulators.'
He was reacting to a statement by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry
regulator, that she would consider various ways to introduce wider
competition if the government failed to put forward a new gas bill in time
to meet the 1996 deadline to begin phasing in deregulation.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Church looks for finance stop-gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt is to be made to give the Church of England a longer period to
solve its financial problems by enabling the Church Commissioners to incur
negative reserves.
The Church faces serious financial difficulties following a sharp reduction
in the amount available from the commissioners' efforts.
This led to the commissioners proposing a Pounds 22m cut in their
contribution to clergy stipends and other expenditure next year. But
following complaints that this could cause permanent damage to the Church's
structure, they agreed to try to limit the 1995 reduction to Pounds 12m.
Because the commissioners are not legally empowered to run negative
reserves, the Church's General Synod was told in York yesterday that as a
last resort the gap between Pounds 22m and Pounds 12m might have to be
bridged by loans to dioceses.
Power for the commissioners to incur negative reserves would require
parliamentary approval. Some Church leaders might be unhappy to support the
proposal, as it would open up their financial problems to renewed scrutiny.
A financial crisis was generated by a Pounds 800m reduction in the value of
the commissioners' assets between 1989 and 1992, caused mainly by the
collapse of the property market.
A move to disestablish the Church from parliamentary control was defeated
last night by the Synod by 273 to 110.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Speaker considering cash for questions inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nature of an inquiry into claims that two Conservative MPs were willing
to accept money for tabling parliamentary questions remained in doubt last
night after Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said she was considering the
matter, David Owen writes.
Her comments came just 24 hours after the two MPs - Mr Graham Riddick and Mr
David Tredinnick - were suspended as junior ministerial aides.
This followed newspaper allegations that they had been willing to table
official questions in the Commons in return for Pounds 1,000 each.
Downing Street said their suspension was pending the outcome of 'any inquiry
which may be instituted by the committee of privileges'. If there was no
privileges committee inquiry, an internal party probe would be conducted by
the whips.
Mr John Major yesterday threw his weight behind 'clear and appropriate'
rules on MPs' conduct, letting it be known he was 'very concerned' to ensure
that high standards in public life were maintained. But Downing Street
emphasised it was not yet clear that the two men - who both deny wrongdoing
 -had a case to answer.
Mr Riddick backed an inquiry, saying it would enable him to make clear he
had done 'nothing illegal or improper'.

A campaign to introduce legislation to cut the amount of road traffic was
launched yesterday by Friends of the Earth, the Green party and Plaid Cymru.
The organisations are seeking all-party support for a Traffic Reduction Bill
to stabilise road traffic volumes at 1990 levels by 2000 and to reduce them
by 10 per cent 2010.
They plan to put down an early-day motion later this week to build support
both locally and nationally and hope to persuade an MP successful in the
private members' ballot to put forward a bill later in the year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Retention of two-tier Devon urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plymouth will have its own free-standing local authority but the rest of
Devon will keep its two-tier council structure under plans announced
yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England.
The commission's preferred option follows the pattern of other large
counties, where cities would be given unitary councils - allowing them
control over education, social services and strategic planning - while the
system of county and districts would remain intact elsewhere.
The plan would leave nine district councils working with Devon County
Council, and would cost between Pounds 2m and Pounds 6m to implement. It
would generate no savings in the longer term, the commission said.
Two alternatives which would involve abolishing the county council were also
proposed. As its second preference, the commission suggested that Plymouth,
Torbay and Exeter should all be unitary, while rural districts would be
merged to form three more unitaries: Northern Devon (including North Devon,
Torridge, and part of West Devon districts); Eastern Devon (formed by
merging East and Mid Devon districts); and Southern Devon and Dartmoor,
which would merge South Hams and Teignbridge with part of West Devon.
Costs of this option were put at Pounds 19m to Pounds 23m, with no savings
in future. However, a modification which would merge Exeter with Eastern
Devon to create five unitaries in total might save up to Pounds 5m a year,
the commission said.
Similar plans to create two new unitary authorities in Essex, based around
Southend and Basildon, while leaving the two-tier structure intact in the
rest of the county were also confirmed by the commission. It said this would
cost between Pounds 6m and Pounds 12m with no savings, while its alternative
of six unitaries would cost between Pounds 26m and Pounds 32m with annual
savings of up to Pounds 8m.

FT  12 JUL 94 / South leads rise in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of the housing market remains very mixed, with the biggest price
rises in the south, according to a survey published yesterday by Halifax
building society.
Its quarterly survey shows that prices across northern England and Wales
have fallen on average by as much as 2.1 per cent during the past year.
The survey, which compared prices in the three months to the end of June
with those for the same period last year, showed prices had risen in seven
regions and had fallen in five. Prices increased overall by 0.6 per cent.
Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, said: 'The underlying trend
in house prices in the UK is still broadly flat.
'While the market should become more buoyant as general perceptions of
economic recovery become more widespread, we do not expect annual house
price inflation to rise above 2 per cent to 3 per cent this year.'
According to the survey, prices in Northern Ireland, traditionally the
lowest in the UK, have risen 6.6 per cent in the past year. Prices in
Scotland have risen 0.4 per cent.
Halifax said that overall there was little change from last year in the
number of people searching for a new home, although there were marked
differences between regions. Demand for properties was outstripping supply
in much of southern England.
The second largest increase was in the south-east, where the average price
of a home rose 2.2 per cent to Pounds 77,360, according to the society.
It added: 'The upper end of the market, particularly in rural areas, is
reported as being the best for some time, with quick sales being achieved on
competitively priced properties.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Plymouth tackles casualties of peace: Roland Adburgham on a
city where more than one in five jobs is defence-related
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Plymouth Hoe in Devon, there is a memorial to the port's servicemen and
women who were casualties of the two world wars, inscribed with no fewer
than 23,182 names. Today, Plymouth is having to come to terms with the
casualties of peace.
The 850 redundancies at the city's Devonport naval dockyard, announced last
month, are the most recent consequence of the peace dividend.
In the seven years since the consortium DML took over the yard as a
privatised manager, the workforce has shrunk from 11,400 to 4,350 even
before the latest losses. It is expected that Thursday's defence review
could mean further losses, with the possible relocation of Royal Marines.
Last year's euphoria after winning the contract to refit Trident submarines
has evaporated.
Plymouth has one of the highest concentrations of defence establishments in
the country. As well as the dockyard and employers such as British
Aerospace, there are 18 military bases in its travel-to-work area. According
to Plymouth Business School, defence accounts for more than one in five
local jobs.
Mr Tudor Evans, chairman of the city's employment and economic development
committee, says the latest Devonport redundancies are the equivalent of two
pit closures, but the scale of the rundown has not caught the national
imagination. 'There is no surplus in the local economy to soak up the job
losses,' he said. The Plymouth area has an unemployment rate of 11.6 per
cent, with male unemployment rising to 25 per cent in some parts of the
city.
The first cuts were made with early retirements and large pay-offs.
Redundancy costs, met by the taxpayer, averaged Pounds 30,000 a person. Mr
Peter Whitehouse, DML's business development director, said: 'Now the young
and those who genuinely want to work will be unemployed and the social and
economic impact will be much higher.'
Many of the redundancies are among the well-paid and skilled. At the crowded
Devonport job centre, nearly all the vacancies are for unskilled or
semi-skilled work, often part-time. A tea-shop assistant is wanted at Pounds
3.25 an hour and a fruit packer at Pounds 3. 'There's nothing for me,' said
a former weapons fitter.
Mr Whitehouse described it as 'a horrible situation of almost continual
attrition'. DML had diversified into civil work such as steel yacht
building, accounting for 15 per cent of its workload. Mr Whitehouse said:
'We are starting to move towards the limits of the volume of that work we
might expect. To turn swords into ploughshares is always difficult.'
The defence dependency, not only of Plymouth but of Devon and Cornwall, has
stimulated a recognition that the sub-regional economy needs to be
restructured.
A public and private-sector partnership, Westcountry Development
Corporation, has been set up to help job creation in the two counties. Mr
Mike Boxall, the WDC's chief executive, said the defence rundown was
compounded by events in traditional industries.
'Tourism, agriculture, fishing and mining are all facing fundamental
structural changes,' he said. 'We need a combination of government support
and local initiatives.'
European and government funding is starting to come into the region.
Plymouth last year gained European Objective 2 status, aimed at helping
declining industrial regions.
The city has also been designated an assisted area, but Plymouth Business
School has calculated that funding to compensate for the loss of
defence-related spending had been insignificant.
The government has recently become conscious of its vulnerability in the
south-west. Last month the Conservatives lost the European parliamentary
seat of Cornwall and Plymouth West to the Liberal Democrats.
One action has been the creation of a development corporation for three of
the waterfront military sites in Plymouth.
Other moves have been to tempt international companies such as Toshiba and
Wrigley to the city and a science park is being set up to attract high-tech,
'clean' industries. Plymouth is also promoting itself as a 'historic
waterfront city' to encourage tourism.
Mr John Mannell, chief executive of Devon and Cornwall Training and
Enterprise Council, said: 'Plymouth has such natural potential. But as it
sheds its garrison town image, it is finding it difficult to say what it
wants to bein the future. We want to create a different image - convince
people it is a good place to live, work, invest and visit.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Research agencies recommended for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Whitehall research agencies have been recommended for privatisation in a
report published by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit yesterday.
The report on government research establishments recommends privatising
Adas, the farm advisory and research agency with a large agricultural
consultancy practice. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
reviewing its future. Adas was identified as a candidate for privatisation
when it became an agency in 1992.
The report also recommends privatising elements of the Building Research
Establishment, the environment department agency that carries out research
on the design, construction and performance of buildings.
If the government accepts the report's recommendations, laboratories
accounting for almost 50 per cent of such spending will be in line for
privatisation. The 50 establishments employ some 31,000 staff and cost about
Pounds 1.3bn a year to run (some of which is earned in fee income).
Research establishments not ready for privatisation should be considered for
transfer to universities or to private-sector companies, the report
recommends.
It also proposes reorganising about 30 life sciences research laboratories
into new agencies, with two options:
A geographical split, one agency for Scotland and the other for England and
Wales, with some smaller establishments being transferred to research
councils.
A four-way 'market sector' split, with agencies for marine resources,
non-marine environment, biotechnology and biological science, and food and
agriculture.
Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, said: 'I am determined to ensure
that government resources are spent to the maximum extent possible on
science rather than administrative overheads.'
The privatisation of Adas and the BRE would mean seven research agencies are
still in line for privatisation.
The others are AEA Technology, National Engineering Laboratory, Laboratory
of the Government Chemist and the Transport Research Laboratory. The
National Physical Laboratory is to become a government-owned,
contractor-operated agency.
The report was drawn up by a team of five civil servants and a part-time
member seconded from Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Intense competition holds manufacturers' prices steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in commodity prices helped push input prices for
manufacturers to higher-than-expected levels last month, official figures
yesterday showed.
But intense competition has so far prevented manufacturers from passing
these rises on to their customers, the data suggested.
The cost of materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers rose by a
seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in June compared with May, the Central
Statistical Office said. Measured over the year as a whole, input prices
rose 1.6 per cent.
However, the price of goods leaving factory gates in the manufacturing
sector as a whole remained flat between June and May.
Measured without the volatile food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum
sectors, output prices rose 0.1 per cent between May and June, and 1.9 per
cent over the year.
The rise in input prices was higher than the City had expected, with some
analysts warning that this might feed through to output price inflation
later this summer.
But the fact that input prices have been rising faster than output prices
for several months now, reversing the trend seen last year, suggests that
the intense competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers to absorb the
costs themselves, analysts said.
A rise in the price of metals and other imported commodities accounted for
nearly half of the 0.8 per cent change in the input index, with the metals
sector seeing the sharpest monthly rise in input prices, reflecting the
recent surge in commodity prices. Metal input prices rose 1.5 per cent
between May and June, and 8.3 per cent over the year.
This rise was partly offset by a fall in the cost of domestically produced
commodities and fuel. The cost of home-produced food manufacturing inputs
and fuel both fell 1.2 per cent last month.
Nevertheless, nearly all categories within the manufacturing sector saw
input prices rise at a faster rate than output prices last month.
The wood and wood products sector saw the sharpest yearly rise in input
prices, with input prices growing 5.6 per cent over the year, after edging
up rapidly in recent months. Output prices, by contrast, grew just 2.6 per
cent in the same period.
In the basic metal and metals product sector, input prices grew 6 per cent
over the year, while output prices rose just 4.6 per cent.
The electrical and optical equipment sector saw a rise of 3.9 per cent in
input costs, while output prices grew 1.3 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Nationwide cuts rate on overdrafts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, is to offer its
mortgage-holders the cheapest high-street authorised overdraft.
It is to tempt its 1.2m mortgage holders to open a Flex-Account current
account by cutting its equivalent annual rate on authorised overdrafts from
18.1 per cent to 8.74 per cent from August 1.
Nationwide's other current-account customers will see their equivalent
annual rate fall to 11.5 per cent from August 1, the society said yesterday.
Nationwide is the latest savings institution to enter the price battle for
new current-account business.
Abbey National, the building-society-turned-bank, and Woolwich, the
third-largest building society, recently halved the cost of their authorised
overdraft rates.
Nationwide's equivalent annual rates, which, unlike annual percentage rates,
do not include fees, undercut Abbey National's APR of 9.9 per cent and
Woolwich's 9.8 per cent APR. Mr Dennis Brockwell, director of marketing,
said: 'Nationwide is determined to remain competitive.'
When Abbey National halved its overdraft rate a fortnight ago, unleashing
market fears of a price war between banks and building societies for
current-account customers, it said that its main target was its
mortgage-holders with whom it already has a lending relationship.
Nationwide's move underlines a similar strategy even more explicitly.
Nationwide's unauthorised overdraft rate remains unchanged at 28.3 per cent
EAR.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Job prospects for graduates improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Job opportunities for graduates are increasing, according to companies which
recruit from universities and colleges.
The Association of Graduate Recruiters said member companies had reported a
4.2 per cent increase in vacancies, mostly in the non-industrial sector -
the first rise reported in its annual survey for four years.
However the survey said the number of graduates continues to grow faster
than the number of jobs. Almost a third of 300 companies said they had some
difficulty in filling vacancies, with a small number reporting a serious
shortage, mainly of science and engineering graduates.
Mr Roly Cockman, executive secretary, said that employers were now looking
for business awareness and communication, whereas three years ago employers
had complained of a shortage of knowledge and competence among graduates in
their subjects.
Mr Cockman said: 'Increasing numbers of graduates mean there are more people
around with the academic competence they are looking for.
He added: 'What they are looking for are other skills as well, awareness of
how business works, communication skills and proven capacities for teamwork
and leadership.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Fewer businesses likely to fail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of business failures in the second quarter of the year will fall
19 per cent from the first three months, the specialist trade credit insurer
Trade Indemnity predicted yesterday.
It forecast 835 failures for the quarter, down from 1,037 in the first
quarter of this year and from 1,433 in the second quarter of last year. The
figure is expected to be the lowest quarterly total in the past three years.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said the drop was above expectations,
but companies were paying off their debts before embarking on further
domestic investment.
He said this could threaten their ability to increase productivity because
the cost of borrowing would increase significantly when businesses finally
do decide to invest.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Upward pressure on pay eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay settlements in manufacturing fell slightly in May, easing fears of
further upward pressure on pay generated by rising inflation and tax
increases, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, David
Goodhart writes.
Pay awards in manufacturing averaged 2.7 per cent between March and May,
slightly down on the 2.8 per cent recorded for the three months to April.
But service-sector settlements remain at 3.2 per cent.
According to the CBI, one-third of all settlements in manufacturing and
services were between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, and overall 84 per cent
of settlements were between zero and 3.5 per cent.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said: 'Manufacturers are
continuing to keep the lid on settlements, though since productivity growth
is dropping the prospect for unit labour costs is not promising. Service
settlements seem to be on the rise, especially in the financial sector. That
is not good news.'
Productivity in manufacturing improved by an average of 4.1 per cent in the
first quarter of the year compared with 4.7 per cent in the second half of
last year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Brown offers plan to save Rosyth base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday sent Mr John Major, the
prime minister, a last-minute plan which he said would enable the threatened
Rosyth naval base in Fife to survive and also save money for the government.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is believed to be poised to announce
a further rundown or even closure of the base on the Firth of Forth when he
reveals the results of the latest defence review, probably on Thursday.
The possibility of the base closing has produced vigorous opposition from
MPs of all parties, as well as from trade unions and local government
representatives in Scotland.
Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes the base, proposes
that the navy locates all minesweeping activities there. This would entail
moving one squadron of six minesweepers and their support services from
Portsmouth to Rosyth, instead of transferring two squadrons of 12 ships from
Rosyth to Portsmouth, as defenders of the base believe is intended.
Mr Brown said he had devised his plan using 'detailed inside knowledge' and
'meticulously gathered expert information', including two internal navy
reports which support the case for retaining Rosyth.
He said the annual extra cost of keeping the base open had been wrongly
costed by the Ministry of Defence at Pounds 10m but was in reality Pounds
6.7m. That could be turned into a net saving of Pounds 4m: locating all
minesweeping activity at Rosyth would save Pounds 2m and concentrating other
minesweeping services would cut Pounds 1.5m.
Some amalgamation of existing facilities could be achieved, saving up to
Pounds 4m, and marine service support at Rosyth would be directed to the
base itself at a saving of Pounds 3m. There would be some job losses among
the 1,300 civilian and 1,800 naval personnel numbers to which the base will
be reduced by next April, but these would not be 'considerable'.
He said none of the minesweeper support, fishery protection work and North
Sea oil strategic support functions which the naval base performs was 'the
victim of the post-cold war changes in military requirements'. He said the
government wanted to close Rosyth both because the base was disliked by MoD
personnel and because its priority was to protect defence jobs in southern
England.
Mr Rifkind, who was visiting the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde
yesterday, hinted at a slightly enhanced role for Faslane.
He said the decision on Rosyth would be made 'in a sensitive, thoughtful
fashion'.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Docklands reports property upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial and residential properties in London's Docklands are letting and
selling faster than at any stage since the late 1980s, the London Docklands
Development Corporation said yesterday.
Some 800,000 sq ft of offices were let during the 12 months to the end of
March, the largest annual total since 1987 and 50 per cent more than the
previous two years combined, Mr Michael Pickard, corporation chairman, said.
Construction of 1,000 homes also is under way in the area after a sharp rise
in private-sector sales. New residential development had virtually ground to
a halt during the previous few years.
Mr Pickard, announcing the publication of the corporation's annual report
yesterday, said: 'The tide has definitely turned and is now running firmly
in London Docklands' favour.'
Almost 500,000 sq ft of offices had been let since January. More than half
of the office space in Canary Wharf, which came out of administrative
receivership last year, was let.
About 5,600 jobs were created last year, taking the total employed in the
8.5 sq miles of Docklands to 55,600. This compares with 27,200 when the
corporation was formed in 1981.
Several factors had encouraged more tenants to choose the area. These
included the opening of the Limehouse Link which had radically improved road
access to the City, the opening of the Docklands Light Railway extension to
Beckton and the start of work on the Jubilee Underground line extension.
Transport to and within the area was now as good as anywhere in London, Mr
Pickard said. The reliability rate of the Docklands Light Railway was 98 per
cent last year. Nonetheless there was still much to be done, he said.
Docklands had more than 5m sq ft of empty offices, representing a vacancy
rate of more than 40 per cent.
Since the corporation was formed in 1981 it has acquired 1,146 acres of land
for development. Of this 738 acres have been sold to developers, leaving 408
acres to be developed.
The corporation is due gradually to hand over its responsibilities to local
authorities prior to being wound up in March 1998.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Foreign banks face costs blow in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of setting up and running an international bank branch in London
have continued to rise during the past two years - after a dip in 1992 - to
record levels in many cases.
The findings come in an analysis by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy
which specialises in financial statistics. It looked at four separate cases
 -setting up just a London representative office, or establishing a branch
in any one of three sizes.
The study showed, for example, that both the opening and annual costs of
setting up a small branch, at Pounds 2.14m and Pounds 984,000 respectively,
were above the previous records of Pounds 1.86m (in April 1993) and Pounds
963,900 (in February 1990).
The annual cost of running a medium-size branch was estimated at Pounds
2.24m, compared with Pounds 2.12m in April last year. The opening cost for
such a branch was Pounds 3.28m - above the level of last year but slightly
down on the record of Pounds 3.30m in February 1990.
The study also highlighted the notably higher costs of setting up a
representative office using an expatriate rather than a UK resident.
Start-up cost of such an office with an expatriate was estimated at Pounds
822,550, while with a local representative it falls to Pounds 273,590.
Annual running costs are also cheaper for the local option - Pounds 235,370
against Pounds 308,520.
A marked change compared with some previous years is that property costs
make up only a small proportion - about one-tenth - of the total
calculations. This is partly because, the consultancy says, the London
property market is such that it is possible to negotiate two or three years'
occupation rent-free.
Staff costs are the largest single element in the estimated budgets, ranging
up to three-quarters of the totals.
The number of foreign banks in London has been rising in recent years, and
is now more than 500.

<TEXT>
Wimpey Homes and a consortium of housebuilders - Barratt, Fairclough and
Ideal Homes - have been shortlisted for one of the single largest housing
developments in London's Docklands.
A decision on the identity of the developer of the first phase of West
Silvertown Urban Village, on the south side of Royal Victoria Dock, is due
to be announced next week by the London Docklands Development Corporation.
The first phase, providing up to 1,200 homes, is expected to have a value of
more than Pounds 100m. It will be the biggest development so far undertaken
in the former Royal group of docks.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Judge's 'hands tied' on MoD plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A judge yesterday admitted his 'hands were tied' over seven test appeals
brought by the government against large compensation awards to former
servicewomen dismissed after becoming pregnant.
Mr Justice Morison said he was aware of public disquiet over more than 2,000
awards already made against the Ministry of Defence - some of which have
been six-figure sums - but there was little he could do as far as the cases
before him were concerned.
On the final day of an Employment Appeals Tribunal in London, the judge said
his freedom to reduce the awards was limited by the way the MoD had
conducted its case. The hearing was told that an 'all or nothing' approach
had been used in making many of the original awards but the ministry had not
made that a ground of its appeal.
The judge said the tribunal could only deal with points at issue in the
appeal.
The awards came after the MoD breached European legislation by forcing
pregnant women to leave the services.
The tribunal's ruling is expected before the end of the month.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Accountants win surprise recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of a little-known accountancy body based in the north of England
were yesterday given government approval to carry out the audits of limited
companies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade
and Industry, said in a parliamentary answer he had decided to recognise the
Association of International Accountants (AIA).
His authorisation means that the qualification offered by the
Gateshead-based association is recognised as legitimate for company auditors
under section 32 and section 12 of the 1989 Companies Act.
Mr John Turnbull, director general of the AIA, said last night: 'This
recognition gives additional choice to people wanting to take
qualifications.'
The announcement caused surprise in the accountancy profession, with a
number of officials in rival bodies saying they had never heard of the
association.
In a strongly worded and dismissive statement the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants said few students were likely to opt to take the AIA's
qualification.
'Although the DTI has recognised the qualification, it has not granted the
AIA supervisory status,' said Ms Anthea Rose, the chartered association's
chief executive.
'Holders of the AIA qualification will not be able to work in public
practice - it will simply be a paper qualification of little practical value
when compared to the other recognised qualifications offered by the
accountancy bodies which are supervisory bodies, such as the ACCA.'
Mr Turnbull said: 'That's ridiculous. What's it got to do with the
certifieds? We have met the requirements of the government which were very
onerous.'
He said the AIA had been in existence since 1928, and offered qualifications
in many parts of the world including south-east Asia - where it competed
with the ACCA.
He said the association had applied for recognition from the DTI in 1990 and
its examinations had been approved by accounting professors from Aberystwyth
and Essex.
Mr Turnbull said the association had about 6,000 members, including 1,750 in
the UK, of which 750 were fully qualified; about 4,000 were students.
He stressed it had not applied to become a supervisory body because it
believed there should be a single body to monitor auditing quality.
Accounts filed with Companies House show the AIA had turnover of Pounds
98,000 and profits of Pounds 91,000 in the year to December 1992.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Motor industry attacks coach ban
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to ban coaches from the outside lane of motorways could damage
customer perceptions of coach travel, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders warned yesterday. The ban is scheduled to be introduced to
carriageways with three or more lanes from the beginning of 1996.
The SMMT has told the Department of Transport that coach passengers 'could
be disconcerted by vehicles being forced to mingle with slower heavy goods
traffic. This could lead to a perception that coach travel was slower.'
The society was responding to a transport department consultation paper
issued after the European Commission directive that coach speed should be
limited. Police found defects in half the coaches they stopped in a
safety-check operation on the M5 - the biggest operation of its kind - in
which transport department examiners carried out checks at four service
areas on 336 coaches.
The worst case involved a coach carrying 46 children. Engine oil was leaking
on to the hot exhaust. Police said it was 'in imminent danger of catching
fire'.
It and two other coaches were ordered off the road. Twenty four others were
told to make repairs within a week.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Tees clean-up plan threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for one of the UK's biggest estuary clean-up projects, intended to
help transform the Tees into a salmon river, are being reconsidered. This
follows Du Pont's announcement that it is to close five Teesside plants
acquired last year from Imperial Chemical Industries.
Northumbrian Water and ICI had proposed a Pounds 100m scheme for an effluent
treatment works on a disused ICI waste-disposal site to deal with sewage
from 400,000 Teesside residents and industrial discharges from the Wilton
petrochemicals complex, occupied by ICI and others.
The project was to be financed by Northumbrian, with ICI and other chemical
companies paying for each tonne of waste treated. It was linked to the
National River Authority's goal of bringing migratory salmon back to the
Tees by 1996.
A planning application was submitted to Cleveland County Council in May.
But the news a fortnight ago from Du Pont, the world's largest nylon maker,
that it will close five nylon intermediates plants at the Wilton site in
early 1997 has forced Northumbrian to re-evaluate the scheme's economic
feasibility. Discussions have been held between Northumbrian and ICI and the
project is now under review.
Its first Pounds 50m stage included construction of a Pounds 35m, eight-mile
underground sewer along the Tees' south bank, to discharge sewage nearer the
river mouth, from beside the Wilton site. But the cut in Du Pont effluent
resulting from the closures means pollution from the Wilton site into the
Tees will be substantially reduced, diminishing the proposed treatment
works' commercial spin-off.
Should the project be abandoned, Northumbrian is committed to reducing
pollution into the river, but the timescale will be longer.
The NRA has expressed concern this could mean the Tees may not be
re-established as a salmon fishery until the next century.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inner-city teenagers feel positive about their education, but a third feel
they have been discriminated against, according to a report published today
by the Policy Studies Institute.
The survey, of 3,000 children of school-leaving age in east and south
London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester found that staying-on
rates in education were above the national average. About 80 per cent were
still in full-time education, compared with the national average of 68 per
cent. Only 5 per cent were in full-time employment.
School was generally regarded as useful and only 3.3 per cent admitted to
playing truant for 'weeks at a time'. But a third felt they had been treated
unfairly because of colour, sex, religion or where they lived.
There were wide disparities between ethnic groups. Black and Caribbean
pupils were most likely to truant, achieved the fewest GCSEs and were less
likely than Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis or Chinese to stay on at
school. Whites made up the lowest proportion staying on - 72 per cent.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Lloyds drops opposition to PIA watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank, one of the largest organisations to make public its
reservations about the personal investment authority, the new regulator to
protect the private investor, is to join the PIA after all.
The Lloyds' decision, taken at the end of last week, is a boost for the PIA
which is due to become operational on Monday. The regulator has been the
subject of controversy within the life industry, but gained from the lack of
a consensus about what should replace it.
Lloyds, which sells life insurance through its Lloyds Abbey Life arm,
entered the argument publicly in March when it said the new regulator
offered 'neither the merits of genuine self-regulation nor the settled
framework and clear accountability of regulation by a statutory body'.
The bank said yesterday that its concerns about the new regulator had not
been met, but that it felt it had no choice about joining.
It is currently regulated by Imro, the regulator for the investment
management industry. Last week, however, Imro announced a change in its
remit, aimed at excluding organisations which deal mainly with private
investors.
Lloyds' decision leaves Allied Dunbar, the life insurance subsidiary of BAT
industries, and Halifax building society, which is to set up a life
subsidiary next year, among the most high-profile organisations yet to
apply.
Allied Dunbar has had a number of discussions with the regulators, and
though there are no signs of a change in the company's direction it seems
conscious of the possible disadvantages from refusing to join the PIA.
So far only Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has insisted on its
right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the
chief financial watchdog, and has not applied to the PIA.
The PIA said yesterday that it had received almost 3,500 applications, from
a total potential membership of 5,500 to 6,000.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Balladur denies Rwanda agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, United Nations Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, yesterday sought to allay
developing countries' misgivings that France had a hidden agenda in its
intervention in Rwanda, in an appearance before the United Nations Security
Council.
He insisted that the motivation was entirely humanitarian and that France
acted only after the international community failed to respond adequately to
an 'unacceptable tragedy'.
Mr Balladur told a press conference later that although France was committed
to withdrawing its troops at the end of July, he would reassess the
situation if the UN was still unable to fill the gap. The Security Council
has approved the dispatch of 5,500 troops to Rwanda but equipment and
training problems have delayed their arrival, which could still take some
weeks.
In his remarks during a New York visit lasting just a few hours, Mr Balladur
emphasised that only France, Senegal and Ghana had supplied troops -
implying some criticism that other states had not provided the support
sought by both Paris and the UN.
'The time has now come for others to take over the task begun by France and
Senegal,' he said.
He hotly denied an Amnesty International charge that French troops had
previously trained Rwandan death squads blamed for massacres. If the
allegations were true, the French intervention in the past few days would
not have been welcomed, 'as it has been by the populations concerned'.
In his Security Council address, Mr Balladur said UN credibility was at
stake in Rwanda. The world body's limits were exposed when it had been in a
position to save threatened civilians in the civil war. 'The UN cannot take
the place of states or parties to a conflict when they themselves lack
political resolve,' he said.
Referring to the French-sponsored commission that will investigate the
massacres, he said the perpetrators must be brought to account before the
international community.

A Seoul high court yesterday suspended a three-year jail term for
embezzlement and election fraud imposed on Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of
South Korea's Hyundai group, Reuter reports from Seoul. Mr Chung, 79, was
convicted last November of diverting more than Won50bn (Pounds 40.3m) from
the group he founded and funnelling the funds to his political party to
underwrite his 1992 presidential bid. The jail sentence imposed at the time
was for three years with no suspension.

<TEXT>
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, outlawed by the Cambodian government last week after
the failure of peace talks, announced yesterday that they were establishing
a rival government based in Preah Vihear province, a jungle area on the Thai
border in the far north of the country, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
According to a guerrilla radio broadcast Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer
Rouge chief, will be prime minister and defence minister in the 'provisional
government of national union and national salvation'. But Pol Pot - who
presided over the deaths of 1m Cambodians between 1975 and 1978 - is
believed to remain as real leader of the organisation.
The guerrillas control only about a tenth of Cambodian territory and depend
heavily on selling gems and timber to Thailand, but they defeated government
offensives earlier this year around Pailin in the west and Anlong Veng in
the north.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Murayama fails to convey stability: Gerard Baker on the
Japanese PM's performance at the G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
See Naples and die, they said, and for one awful moment on Saturday,
Japanese thought their new prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, had
interpreted the old Italian saying literally. A hastily arranged midnight
press conference during the Group of Seven summit in Naples, relayed to
Japan, hinted that the prime minister's emergency hospital visit might mean
the worst.
Within hours it emerged that the septuagenarian leader had succumbed to
nothing worse than a bout of gastroenteritis, and he was able to resume his
place at the Group of Seven talks on Sunday in the city which the old saying
implies is so beautiful there is nothing else that remains to be seen on
earth.
But as he returned home to Tokyo last night, it was clear that the meeting
had failed to resolve many of the lingering doubts about the durability of
Mr Murayama's coalition.
The government's verdict on the meeting betrayed pre-summit fears that Mr
Murayama, elected to the premiership just two weeks ago with no ministerial
experience, might not prove able to hold his own with his G7 colleagues.
'Prime minister Murayama relayed his views and ideas very frankly and
effectively through talks with the six other countries,' said Mr Kozo
Igarashi, the chief cabinet secretary.
Mr Murayama had been schooled extensively in the arts of international
relations in the days before the meeting, and there was relief that,
intestinal matters apart, he had proved up to the job.
But the more difficult task for the Japanese delegation was to convince the
other members of the G7 that the new government, principally a coalition of
the unlike-minded Social Democratic party and Liberal Democratic party,
represented both stability and continuity with its predecessors. There was
little evidence that they succeeded.
In bilateral talks with US President Bill Clinton, and later in the first
plenary session, Mr Murayama, from the SDP, and the LDP's Mr Yohei Kono, the
deputy prime minister, stressed that in the key areas of trade and security
relations the government was committed to the same goals as its
predecessors: progress would be made on the economic framework talks and the
Japan-US security relationship would remain the bulwark of Japanese foreign
policy.
The only acknowledged reservation was the role of Russia, elevated to the
status of semi-member of a G8. Foreign ministry officials were reported to
have expressed concern that Russia's presence at future political
discussions would make it difficult for Japan to use the G7 as a forum for
raising the subject of the Kurile Islands, disputed territory occupied by
Russia at the end of the second world war.
But the Japanese delegation had hardly left Naples before doubts emerged.
The unwieldy coalition seems certain to face big difficulties in maintaining
the commitments given at the G7 meeting.
The death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung presents an immediate
problem. The SDP has traditionally been friendly towards the Pyongyang
regime, and the LDP has also adopted a conciliatory stance. The uncertainty
following Mr Kim's death is likely to create strains between Japan and its
allies if, as seems likely, the government adopts a dovish approach.
But it is on economic policy that the coalition appears to be in disarray.
At the summit, Mr Murayama committed himself to continuing the pump-priming
of the economy to stimulate more imports and redress Japan's large trade
imbalances. But the SDP is anxious not to offset the large income tax cuts
implemented this year with increases in consumption tax, while the LDP and
the powerful finance ministry support an early rise in consumption tax.
As he left Naples Mr Murayama was forced to correct a misunderstanding from
an earlier statement in which he seemed to imply that Japan had agreed to
implement income tax cuts for another year, without an offsetting rise in
consumption tax.
Yesterday Mr Kiro Saito, the senior official at the finance ministry,
described as 'meaningful' the view expressed by the G7 heads of government
that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals, adding, 'It was
important that a common stance was reaffirmed among the summit
participants.'
The verdict of business on the summit was mixed. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda,
president of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations,
welcomed the meeting's call for international policy co-ordination and
structural measures for global recovery. But Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of
the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, or Keizai Doyukai, expressed
disappointment that the summit had failed to agree on specific measures to
combat the rise of the yen on the foreign exchanges.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Domestic politics sets France apart on Algeria policy: Paris
finds it difficult to concur with US-led calls for dialogue with Islamic
militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria has been put back on the international agenda. Terrorism against
westerners working there was discussed at the Group of Seven summit in
Naples at the weekend, two days after six Italian sailors were killed on
board their grain ship in a harbour east of Algiers.
In the communique after the summit, the seven heads of government called
cautiously on the Algerian government to establish a dialogue with the
Islamic fundamentalists whom it outlawed when they were on the point of
winning parliamentary elections 2 1/2 years ago.
This represented a delicate compromise between the positions of France on
the one hand and the US and Italy on the other. The French are suspicious of
the American view that 'reliable and moderate' elements of the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) can be found for a dialogue without compromising the
current power structure of the military-led government.
Yesterday gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a
Romanian working with Algeria's state oil company Sonatrach.
French and American policymakers agree that, in the words of Mr Alain Juppe,
the French foreign minister, 'the status quo (in Algeria) is no longer
tenable'. And they concur that wide-ranging economic reforms are desperately
needed whatever Algeria's political fate.
However, neither Paris nor Washington rates very highly the chances of
economic reforms being implemented soon because of the political turmoil,
though both have backed the programme Algerian leaders agreed with the
International Monetary Fund in May and the Dollars 1bn standby loan which
came with it. And both supported the rescheduling of Dollars 5bn worth of
Algeria's Dollars 26bn (Pounds 17bn) foreign debt by the country's Paris
Club official creditors.
Beyond that, however, the two capitals appear to be drawing different
conclusions from the failure of all attempts so far to bring to the
negotiating table Algeria's military commanders and the leaders of the FIS.
The difference between the US and French positions is that while Washington
is attempting to build a long-term strategy towards a political force which
it is convinced is here to stay, French leaders, who privately agree that
political Islam will not disappear overnight, feel constrained by domestic
considerations.
US officials say they are trying to avoid 'demonising' supporters of the
FIS, a party which Mr Juppe describes as 'extremist, terrorist,
anti-European and anti-western'.
French politicians, on the other hand, are caught in a bind. While they
acknowledge the present political system is not viable, what conservative
politicians fear above all is the fundamentalists either sharing power with
the military or seizing power in the run-up to the French presidential
election next year. As they see it, such an event would draw the issue of
Algeria, radical Islam and perhaps France's 2m immigrants of North African
extraction into the election campaign and boost the vote for far-right
politicians such as Mr Jean-Marie le Pen.
French officials also fear the domino effect of a FIS takeover in Algeria.
Some go as far as to argue that Tunisia would 'fall in six months' and that
Morocco and Egypt would quickly be threatened.
In a joint television interview with President Francois Mitterrand last
month, President Bill Clinton made clear that while he shared the concern of
Paris about a fundamentalist takeover spreading unrest in the Moslem world,
the US would encourage 'the present Algerian government to broaden its base
(and) reach out to dissident groups who are not involved in terrorism'.
US policymakers have sought to draw on the lessons learned from their
country's long estrangement from Iran, as well as from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and the strong anti-western feelings it provoked in Arab public
opinion. They note that 17 of the 22 Moslem states have falling incomes and
a predominantly youthful population. 'The potential for explosion is great,'
they warn.
The conclusions were summed up recently by Mr Robert Pelletreau, the US
assistant secretary of state for near-eastern affairs:
'The US does not view Islam as the next 'ism' confronting the west, or
threatening world peace, but does however, object strongly when the US is
labelled a great Satan.'
The US is 'suspicious of those who would use the democratic process to come
to power, only to destroy that process in order to retain political
dominance', a clear reference to the FIS assertion that a victory at the
polls would only prove Allah's greatness, thus making the holding of any
future election a pointless exercise.
While concerned at the role of Iran and Sudan in exploiting Islamic
extremist groups, the US sees 'no monolithic international control being
exercised over the various Islamic movements active in the region'.
While it does not wish to impose a western model of government in the Middle
East, the US believes that broad political participation is 'an important
and necessary contributor to long-term stability. Lack of economic,
educational and political opportunities (are what) give extremists of any
sort their constituency'.
European and US officials also note that French support for reforms in
Algeria is a recent development and occurred just before the Socialists lost
their majority in the French parliament last year. French conservative
politicians acknowledge this and say that not supporting Algerian political
leaders who sought to implement bold economic reforms between 1989 and 1992
was a grievous mistake.
French support, albeit qualified, for the current Algerian leadership is
based on a belief shared by Mr Charles Pasqua, the powerful interior
minister, and Mr Juppe that a FIS victory would spell trouble among the
large Algerian and broader North African community in France. Some French
observers say the high level of unemployment among young North Africans, as
much as 50 per cent in some areas, is a more serious threat to social and
political peace than events across the Mediterranean. Officials in Paris
also say they fear an influx of refugees were the FIS to win power.
Some European countries, notably Spain and Germany, are concerned that while
the acts of terrorism committed by supporters of radical Islam are
repeatedly denounced abroad, the methods used by the security forces, which
are increasingly brutal, are seldom mentioned. They believe that the
European Union has much to gain in the medium run by being more even-handed.
France's key European partner, Germany, the current EU president, needs
France's support on east European affairs and has little to gain by
questioning the support Paris is lending the Algerian regime. Italy and
Spain have their own domestic political difficulties and Madrid is unhappy
about the public expression of divergences between the US and France on
Algeria policy.
French officials agree with their European and US colleagues that most of
those who support the FIS do so out of despair at the lack of jobs,
corruption and contempt for their leaders. They also suspect that the
Clinton administration is hedging its bets by initiating contacts with FIS
representatives abroad but acknowledge that US strategic interests in the
Middle East include Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not Algeria.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Kim's death poses problems for Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government yesterday expressed its support for continued
efforts to encourage North Korea to be open about its nuclear programme
following the death of President Kim Il-sung. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief
cabinet secretary, said: 'We will call on North Korea not to retreat from
its efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue.'
The official Japanese reaction to the death of Mr Kim has so far been one of
extreme caution, as the government tries to gauge developments in North
Korea. Last night, on his return from the Group of Seven summit in Naples,
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama met senior cabinet colleagues to review
developments. Mr Yohei Kono, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has
already cancelled a visit to South America next week, and it seems likely
that Mr Murayama will postpone a visit he was due to make to Seoul this
weekend.
The uncertainty in Pyongyang poses difficulties for the new coalition
government headed by the Social Democratic party (SDP) and Liberal
Democratic party (LDP). The SDP has long had a close relationship with the
(North) Korean Workers' party, and the coalition has been leaning towards a
more conciliatory policy than its predecessor.
SDP leaders expressed regret that Mr Kim had died so soon before his planned
summit meeting with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. The party's
secretary-general, Mr Wataru Kubo, a key member of the government, said:
'The SDP, as a party that has pledged co-operation in improving relations
between Japan and North Korea, heartily offers condolences to the Korean
Workers' party.' He expressed hope for the peaceful reunification of the
Korean peninsula.
North Korean residents in Japan were in mourning yesterday. Mr Li Jin-gyu,
the vice-chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan,
angrily denied rumours circulating in Tokyo that Mr Kim's death might be
part of an attempted coup, saying such reports were 'demagoguery that
deserved no attention. The Korean people admire President Kim from the
bottom of their hearts. Our country will further achieve brilliant
development under Secretary Kim Jong-il.'
The Japanese North Korean community is the largest outside the socialist
state and is an important source of finance for the country. Japan's
internal security forces were said to have stepped up monitoring of the
association in the wake of Mr Kim's death.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Budget deficit falling in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government yesterday reported a preliminary budget deficit
for 1993-94 of ADollars 13.7bn (Pounds 6.5bn), close to the ADollars 13.6bn
revised forecast made in May but ADollars 2.3bn lower than the original
forecast in the budget statement of August last year.
The result will boost the Labor government's hopes of being on course to
reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97. At
3.2 per cent of GDP, the 1993-94 deficit is down from the 3.6 per cent of
GDP recorded in the previous year.
For the financial year which began this month, the government is banking on
the recent surge of economic growth to reduce the deficit to 2.5 per cent of
GDP, at ADollars 11.7bn.
During the three months to March, the latest quarter for which figures are
available, Australia's economy grew at 5 per cent on an annualised basis,
exceeding both the markets' and the government's expectations.
The 1993-94 budget deficit was held down by delays in implementing some of
the government's job creation programmes and an unexpectedly low take-up of
jobs subsidies. Outlays were ADollars 360m lower than the May forecast.
Revenue was ADollars 440m lower than the May estimate because of lower
personal and corporate tax collection.
The strong economic growth during the March quarter has triggered fears of a
rise in interest rates. Speculation intensified earlier this month with the
publication of data showing a widening in the current account deficit and a
strong growth in building approvals in May. Some banks have raised their
fixed rates for home loans.
Markets are awaiting Friday's figures on building activity during the March
1994 quarter to gauge how much inflationary pressure exists.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Peres to make first official trip to Jordan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, is next week to become the first
senior Israeli official to set foot publicly on Jordanian soil, in the
latest sign of the fast-warming relations between Israel and its eastern
neighbour.
Mr Peres announced yesterday he would cross the border on July 20, for an
unprecedented official meeting with his Jordanian counterpart, Mr Abdul
Salam al-Majali, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Two days
earlier, in air-conditioned tents at a desert site just north of Israel's
southern port of Eilat, Israeli and Jordanian officials are scheduled to
hold their first-ever Middle East-based session of peace talks, focusing on
minor border disputes and the vexed question of water rights.
While Jordan's King Hussein is known to have met privately every Israeli
prime minister since Mrs Golda Meir three decades ago, his public
declaration to parliament at the weekend that he was now ready openly to
meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin marked the breaking of a taboo between two countries
still technically at war. The announcement of Mr Peres's official visit can
only heighten expectations of an Israeli-Jordanian peace deal.
Mr Peres declined yesterday to specify where in Jordan the trilateral
meeting would take place, noting only that it would be 'on the other side of
the border, in a place less romantic than the tent'. He added that he did
not yet know how quickly the Jordanians wanted to proceed towards a peace
deal, and that he could not say what obstacles might crop up on the way.
Nevertheless, he went on, 'I'm sure we can reach a peace deal with Jordan in
the not too distant future.'
The thawing relationship with Jordan constitutes another boost for the Rabin
government, which this week marks the half-way point of its four-year term
in office. With the Jordanians extending peace feelers, and the transfer of
power to the Palestinians in the newly autonomous areas of the Gaza Strip
and Jericho proving remarkably trouble-free, the pressure is now on Syria to
move towards an accommodation with Israel, or risk being left behind and
incurring the wrath of an American administration pressing hard for a
comprehensive package of Middle East peace accords.
In Cairo yesterday, Israeli and PLO negotiators settled down for a series of
meetings on extending self-rule arrangements elsewhere in the occupied West
Bank; and in Tunis Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, bade farewell to his
hosts of the past 12 years and headed off, via Cairo, to make his permanent
home in autonomous Palestine.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Mercury poisoning company told to pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A Japanese regional court yesterday ordered a chemical company which dumped
mercury into the sea in southern Japan during the 1950s to compensate those
poisoned as a result, but ruled that the central and municipal governments
were not to blame in the case.
In the latest ruling in a series of lawsuits against the government and
Chisso, the chemicals maker, the Osaka District Court ordered a total of
Y276m (Pounds 1.8m) in damages to be paid to 42 of the 59 claimants.
The group filed a claim 12 years ago, and 16 have already died. Although
nearly 40 years have passed since the first report of disease, more than
2,500 patients and families of dead victims are still seeking compensation
from the government at three high courts and six district courts. The
lawsuits have become ensnared in Japan's slow-moving legal system, and the
government refuses to settle the cases out of court.
The disease, a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by eating
mercury-polluted fish caught near the town of Minamata, became one of
Japan's worst pollution cases and caused a widespread outcry. The government
has recognised only 3,000 patients as official victims of the disease out of
13,000 people who claim to be sufferers.
The court yesterday rejected allegations that the central and Kumamoto
municipal governments were responsible for protecting the lives and health
of Minamata residents, and therefore were responsible for not ordering
Chisso to stop discharging water contaminated with mercury into the sea.
It is the third out of six district court rulings which dismiss claims of
government responsibility, and some plaintiffs are calling for Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, the new prime minister, to seek a settlement of the suits.
Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' lawyers said they would appeal against the
finding to the high court.

system, backed by stiff penalties. The system was approved by the government
at the weekend.
Representatives of the country's main commercial banks met exchange control
officials late on Sunday to discuss the details of the new system, but said
it would take time to train employees and implement the controls
effectively.
Venezuelans have been unable to carry out exchange operations since the last
day of foreign exchange trading on June 23. President Rafael Caldera
announced the government's decision to impose controls on all foreign
exchange transactions on June 27.
Some bankers fear it may take another 10 days for many companies to obtain
foreign currency. The Caldera administration is drawing up a law carrying
stiff penalties, including jail sentences, for violations of the foreign
exchange rules, and this has made the banks extremely careful in
implementing the rules.
There is no system yet in place that would guarantee customers did not abuse
the foreign exchange regulations, for example by applying for the maximum
limit at several different banks.
Commercial banks were yesterday not buying or selling foreign exchange, and
only one large exchange house said it would sell dollars to clients if they
met the new official requirements. Most foreign businessmen and tourists are
being forced to change small amounts of foreign currency at hotels, or on
the street.
Under the new system, commercial banks will sell foreign exchange to
eligible clients at 170 Venezuelan bolivars per US dollar, plus a
commission. The last trades on June 23 were at around 200 bolivars per
dollar.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Mexico's open door lets in winds of change: Damian Fraser on
restructuring companies to compete - The New Economic Order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The manager of the Nissan assembly plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico, which is
the only Nissan plant to export cars to Japan, says he has little interest
in learning how Mexicans run their companies. 'Here we do not care about the
Mexican way of doing things. Anyone who works here has to think only about
international standards and quality. Otherwise there is no way we can
compete,' says Mr Yoshitake Fujikubo.
A decade ago such comments may have caused offence. Now they can be heard
throughout Mexico. To survive in the world of free trade with the US and
Canada, and low-cost imports from Asia, Mexican managers are having to adapt
to the practices of their international rivals, and abandon many of their
traditional ways of doing business.
'In the past, when you did not have to worry about price competition and
open borders, it did not matter so much how you ran your company,' says Mr
Ramon de la Pena of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Advanced
Studies, the management school based in Mexico's leading industrial city.
'But this is all changing. There is not a company in Monterrey which is not
trying to slash layers of management, be more responsive to the customer,
and improve productivity.'
This corporate restructuring, under way since the late 1980s, has led to
average increases in manufacturing productivity of about 5 per cent a year.
According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, productivity in Mexican
telecommunications increased by 24.1 per cent between 1985 and 1993, in
steel mills by 42.3 per cent over the same period, and in the food industry
by 12.5 per cent in the five years to 1992.
The higher productivity has been achieved in large part by companies closing
down unprofitable lines and firing unnecessary workers. This has contributed
to higher unemployment and, over the past year and a half, a sharp
contraction in the manufacturing sector.
The McKinsey study indicates that absolute productivity levels in banking,
steel and food are still between 30 and 40 per cent of levels in the US,
suggesting still more restructuring is necessary. The report concludes that
Mexican companies can close most of the gap by improving management of their
companies, adopting less hierarchical and less centralised organisational
structures, and cutting bureaucracy and unnecessary tasks.
Mr Roberto Batres, a consultant with Arthur D Little, says many foreign
companies in Mexico have been able to reach international levels of
productivity because of superior management. 'Foreign companies have learnt
something most Mexicans have not learnt - the tremendous value in the
Mexican worker,' he said. 'The Mexican workforce is a gateway to lean
manufacturing, if treated right.'
Set in a sprawling 200ha site a few miles outside Aguascalientes, Nissan
would seem to demonstrate this. The Dollars 1bn plant has productivity
levels close to those of plants in Japan and the US, according to Mr
Fujikubo. And since Mexican wages are far lower than those in the US or
Japan, Nissan Mexico is more competitive on a cost basis than other plants.
Nissan attributes the high productivity to world-class technology in the
plant and the heavy investment in training its work force, teaching it the
importance of team-work, discipline and product quality. The plant is less
hierarchical than most Mexican companies, with managers working on or next
to the plant floor, and taking lunch with their staff, keeping costs down,
and improving corporate communication.
Mexican companies are adopting similar practices. Mr Ulrich Sander, head of
corporate communication at Vitro, the glass producer and one of Mexico's
largest industrial concerns, says layers of management are being removed so
the company can cut costs, and compete better against international rivals.
He says Vitro is reducing its workforce by 20 per cent to 30,000, with a
heavy proportion of non-union workers losing their jobs, such as accountants
and secretaries.
Mr Sander notes that a few years ago he had 10 secretaries report to his
division; now he has one. His responsibilities have grown as the company has
sought for the first time to keep workers informed about what is going on at
the corporate level.
Even though Vitro is admired as one of the more modern and efficient
companies in Mexico, the process has to go further, says Mr Sander. Earlier
this year Corning, the US glass company, broke its joint venture with Vitro,
subsequently saying that Vitro's management took decisions too slowly, was
too hierarchical and insufficiently aggressive for the American company,
criticisms partly accepted by Mr Sander.
Vitro 'is caught between the demands of Mexico's emerging free-market
economy and a corporate culture steeped in tradition,' said Mr Ernesto
Martens, Vitro's chief executive, in an interview with Harvard Business
Review. Mr Martens said that Vitro had to walk a 'tightrope' between losing
its identity as a Mexican company with a unique culture, and being battered
in the world market place for not changing fast enough.

<TEXT>
Canada and Mexico will maintain their economic links with Cuba, despite the
US embargo of the island, according to Mr Jorge Bolanos, Cuba's deputy
foreign minister.
Cuba had feared that the US might object to the recent expansion in trade
and economic relations between its two partners in the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and Cuba. However, Cuba had been told that trade with
Canada and Mexico would continue, and that both countries would support an
end to the embargo, said Mr Bolanos.
'This is the assurance we sought and which we have finally received. Both
Canada and Mexico have argued publicly against the continuation of the
economic embargo,' he said.
'There is now no chance that either the Canadian or Mexican governments will
concern themselves with what the US has to say about commercial links with
Cuba.'
In diplomatic discussions with Canada and Mexico, Cuba was told that it had
no reason to be concerned for the effects of the implementation of Nafta on
Cuban trade and economic relations.
However, Cuban officials continued to hint at the possibility of 'subtle
pressure' by the US on the other Nafta members to reduce economic links with
Cuba or to eliminate them altogether. 'Cuba has now been comforted by both
the Canadian and Mexican governments through visits to the island and
statements by officials of both governments,' Mr Bolanos said.
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico had recently indicated his government's
desire to enhance trade with Cuba, and there had been similar assurances on
her visit to Havana from Ms Christine Stewart, Canada's parliamentary
secretary for foreign affairs.

FT  12 JUL 94 / US struggling to find competitive edge
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has not solved the structural problems that have impaired its
competitiveness, despite its recent economic turnaround, a report by the
Council on Competitiveness warned yesterday.
The council, a panel of leaders in business, labour and higher education,
warns that although many high-profile US sectors, such as the car and
semiconductor industries, have regained market leadership, it is not clear
that the US has created the productive assets for future growth.
'The competitiveness challenge is here to stay. We are making progress, but
are in for a lengthy struggle,' said Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief
executive of Xerox and chairman of the council.
The report, Competitiveness Index 1994, combines a macro-economic study with
an opinion poll of the council's members and affiliates. It highlights
several deep-seated structural problems that need tackling.
Although US investment in plant and equipment surged by 11.8 per cent last
year, investment as a proportion of GDP has been the lowest of any of the
Group of Seven leading industrialised nations for six of the past seven
years, the report says.
Growth in US long-term industrial research and development has been running
at less than half the rate for most other G7 countries, with only the UK
showing a lower rate.
The merchandise trade deficit climbed to Dollars 131bn last year as rising
imports outstripped export growth.
In the council's survey, 91 per cent of respondents ranked the threat to
competitiveness posed by weaknesses in the primary education system (from
kindergarten up to 12 years of age) as their top concern.
The US net national savings rate has been the lowest of all G7 nations for
most of the past two decades, dipping last year to 1.8 per cent of GDP,
little more than one tenth of Japan's savings rate.
However, the report notes several positive developments. Last year the US
saw the biggest rise in the standard of living of any G7 nation, at 1.9 per
cent, although this was partly a result of the recession still affecting
many of the US's competitors.
US manufacturing productivity rose 4.2 per cent last year, the biggest
annual increase since 1987.
Two thirds of respondents said that US overall competitiveness was good and
getting better. They pointed to undergraduate and graduate education,
management, quality and technology as particular US strengths.
The Clinton administration received relatively high marks for its technology
and trade policies, but was urged to increase incentives for savings and
investment and strengthen worker training programmes.
The biggest competitive challenge was seen as coming from Japan, followed by
the newly industrialised Asian countries and China. Germany was ranked
fourth. Stiff competition was foreseen, particularly in electronic
components and equipment, machine tools and robotics, and cars.
'Although American companies have cut a lot of fat, many have not yet built
the innovative capacity that will be necessary to compete in the future,'
said Mr Michael Porter, professor of business administration at Harvard
Business School and project adviser for the Competitiveness Index. 'Private
sector investment in people and in productive assets is still much too low.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / No fences for the world's party animals: Fans have mellowed
the forces of law and order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For fans visiting the US, the World Cup has been one long party, and they
have joined in with gusto.
They came prepared. They brought their flags and their face-paint, their
hats, shirts, drums and horns. Every match has been played to the rhythm of
songs and music quite alien to US sports fans.
Early games involving the American team were strangely genteel compared to
other matches. By the later matches they had begun to learn, though they
still have a long way to go to match the Brazilians, for example, with their
samba bands (which have to take turns to play), or the Mexicans and Irish.
Even the Saudi Arabians - where did all those Saudi fans come from? -
arrived with drums and mizmars (traditional horns), and sang their own
version of the unofficial World Cup anthem: Ole; Ole, Ole, Ole; Ole, Ole.
Every match has been a sea of colour: bobbing blocks of yellow or green for
the South American tour groups, all in matching caps; lumps of orange where
the Dutch sat; and everywhere the tricolour green, white and red or orange
of Bulgaria, Italy, Ireland and Mexico.
The friendly atmosphere has surprised the police. They were ready for
hooligans. The weeks before the big start were filled with dickering between
Fifa, soccer's governing body, and local police over temporary fencing
around pitches. The police wanted it. Fifa said pens were for animals.
Every ground has been full of police and guards. At Orlando an armed
policeman stood by each staircase. The cop who stood just below the press
box, crew-cut and black-garbed, was a master of menace. During the
Mexico-Ireland match he kept his back to play, staring unsmilingly through
huge mirrored sun-glasses, daring some unwise fan to make his day.
By the the time the Irish returned to play Holland in the second round,
however, he was going with the flow. Now he smiled. He batted a beach ball
back and forth with fans and allowed them to pose for pictures in his OPD
baseball cap.
Expectations on both sides have been confounded. So far as I know, no
visiting fan has been car-jacked while no law-and-order official has had his
(or her) eyeballs sucked out by a defeat-crazed fan.
Yesterday, the authorities said they had more trouble from American football
and basketball crowds than they have had from the World Cup, which has
attracted record crowds of 3m-plus.
Fifa said there had been about 400 World Cup-related arrests in the nine
host cities, mainly for black-market ticket sales. Fifa secretary-general
Sepp Blatter said that the fans' behaviour - sometimes in heat of 100'F-plus
 -had been 'grand.'
There are plenty of English supporters here, though many are not England
fans.
It is difficult to know how England fans would have behaved if their team
had qualified. Why did it have to be two English fans giving the harassed
gate attendant so much abuse when it looked as if the flight from Dallas to
Orlando last week was over-booked?
I ran into them again in Dallas last Friday night, watching the Brazilians
samba from a slight distance.
'What would it have been like if England had been playing here tomorrow?' I
asked.
'They'd've been smashing the place up,' came the confident reply.
But they were not very observant. The place was crawling with police. Just
round the corner I saw four cops, looking faintly ridiculous in summer
shorts. They, too, were smiling. But they carried guns and long
night-sticks. Party on Ricardo] Party on Krassimir]

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Born-again Brazil find their rhythm - Paulo
Sotero says his team's destiny is to win a fourth title
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULO SOTERO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the teams playing in the World Cup are reflections of the countries they
represent, as the experts in these things claim, the Brazilian national
selecao is the perfect example. It could be said that we play like we govern
ourselves.
As in other fields, it is not for lack of individual talent or an abundance
of collective resources that we are not doing better in the World Cup,
though our 3-2 win against Holland at the weekend, which put us into
tomorrow's semi-finals, against Sweden, has steadied our nerves somewhat.
Not that our hearts weren't in our mouths as Holland rallied from 0-2 to 2-2
in Dallas, before Branco scored with nine minutes to go. After a draw with
Sweden and a brush with disaster against the US, we were confronted with the
reality that has afflicted us for years. The problem is leadership.
As powerful as our team is, and as determined as they are to reclaim their
status as a world soccer power, they have lacked direction and sense of
purpose. Prior to Holland at the weekend, the game plan had resembled some
features of the constitution we adopted in 1988: it does not allow the team
to play to their full potential.
More, our very ability gives our players an exaggerated sense of
self-confidence. You could compare this to the abiding love we have
demonstrated lately for democracy in the face of great disarray. We believe
that somehow we are going to get through. But it is a messy way of doing
things. It has worked so far, but it does not assure us of ultimate triumph.
The same has been happening in the World Cup. Masters of their trade, our
boys play with abandon, as if the outcome was guaranteed in advance. There
is no sense of urgency. After all, we have always believed that God is
Brazilian.
Then, as happened in the game against the US, our shots on goal start
hitting the post. We cannot find the net with shots that are impossible to
miss. What's going on, we ask ourselves?
The fear is that the Almighty, perhaps angry with our presumption, our
arrogance and our carelessness, has applied for a green card (the US ticket
for immigrants). And then bad luck - another feature of our recent play -
sets in. With less than 20 minutes left we were still tied with the US. The
unthinkable became possible.
If we had been kicked out of the Cup by the inexperienced Americans, it
would have been a catastrophe worse than the defeat by Uruguay in the 1950
final in Rio. It would have been the end of out self-esteem, the collapse of
futbol in Brazil. We needed a miracle.
The feeling was strangely familiar. It resembled the lousy game we have been
playing with inflation, that infamous adversary of all national teams.
First, we show complacency, believing that we can live with it. Then, as
inflation starts to score big against our wallets, the possibility of a
disaster becomes apparent. Put against the wall, we finally act.
To dribble inflation, we use an elaborate play known as changing the
currency. We are good at that. It is true that so far the magic has worked
only temporarily. But it does put the adversary on the defensive for a
while. The problem is that we have not explored the opportunities for
scoring.
But things may be changing. Recently, after the worrisome draw with Sweden
and an alarming defeat in the monthly tournament against inflation (we lost
50 per cent to nothing), we reacted with the 'real,' our new currency.
The name has less to do with 'reality' than with 'royal,' (strange in a
country that actually bothered only a couple of years back to vote in a
plebiscite to reject a monarchy).
We Brazilians are tired of playing the same game against inflation. But the
scenario is more favourable this time and the experts are optimistic.
Things may be ready to change on the soccer field, too. After the scary game
against the US, the people cried for change and the players themselves moved
to take charge, organise themselves and liberate the team from the
straitjacket imposed by coach Carlos Alberto.
What we may be seeing, starting with the game against Holland, is a strategy
that could make Brazil great again: a free market approach to futbol, with
more reliance on personal initiative and individual talent and less
interference from a coaching bench that has been acting like a bunch of
bureaucrats, unwilling to take risks.
This is not an imported neo-liberal idea. It is as Brazilian as the Sugar
Loaf and has always worked for us. Vicente Feola, who led us to our first
World Cup in 1958, was a laissez faire coach.
Legend has it that he used to take a nap during practice. The only
instruction his players ever remember receiving from him was: 'Boys, go in
there and score.'
We switched coaches in 1962, but not philosophy - and won again.
In 1970, with the game already under the threat of bureaucratisation, it
took a rebellion by Pele and company against coach Mario Zagalo to assure
the glory of the tricampeonato in Mexico.
Indications are that it will work again this time.
Recent setbacks have made us more realistic and demanding. But, as you may
have noticed, we are a happy, optimistic and confident lot. And, contrary to
current belief, when the going gets tough Brazil is still the only Latin
American country that can really play with the big guys from Europe - even
if the 'big guys' are now represented only by Italy.
See you in LA on July 17.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Guatemalan coffee deal heralds new era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty pence may not buy a cup of coffee in London, but for Guatemalan coffee
workers, an agreement to increase their daily wage by around that amount is
being heralded as the start of a new era in labour relations.
The agreement, signed last week between the Guatemalan coffee association,
Anacafe, and the National Unitary Council of Workers, increases the minimum
daily wage from 10 quetzales (Pounds 1.14) to Q14.50 (Pounds 1.65). It also
sets up a bonus scheme for higher productivity, and promises to improve
living and working conditions for agricultural workers.
It is the first time the coffee industry - the preserve of Guatemala's
extremely conservative economic elite - has negotiated directly with
workers, and the local press has pointed to the accord as a move away from
the confrontation that has fuelled over 30 years of civil war.
'The coffee sector has been the most backward in its labour relations,' said
Mr Mario Solorzano, a former labour minister. 'This is a message that it now
has a new perspective.'
Wage rises used to be negotiated through the Ministry of Labour - the last
one was four years ago - but they were often ignored. Last week's agreement
saw the formation of a bipartisan committee to ensure that the accord is
enforced.
International labour organisations and human rights groups have frequently
criticised farm owners for failing to pay the minimum wage, imposing
appalling working conditions, and, suppressing union organisations, often
violently.
Workers' council leaders believe the accord may have a knock-on effect on
wages and the negotiations for the rest of the agricultural sector, which
employs about 60 per cent of Guatemala's labour force.
'This is an historic agreement because it breaks with the culture of
confrontation between workers and employees,' said Rigoberto Duenas, a
council official.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: End of an era for German veterans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It took only a few minutes after their 2-1 loss to Bulgaria in the World Cup
quarter-finals on Sunday for the German team to start breaking up.
Heads low, the Germans left the field to hear goalkeeper Bodo Illgner
announce his retirement. Illgner, 27, was first to go, though his decision
was not prompted by age.
Several veterans are sure to leave, and captain Lothar Matthaus, 33, could
be among them, although he said he had no immediate plans to quit.
The future of coach Berti Vogts also looks uncertain. Defeat marked
Germany's earliest exit since 1978, when they were stopped in the second
round, also as defending champions.
'Tough times are coming up for the coach, but I want to stay around as long
as I'm having fun and I am still having fun,' said Vogts, 47, who took over
from Franz Beckenbauer after Germany's 1990 triumph.
Veteran defender Guido Buchwald, 33, is moving to Japan in the twilight of
his career, and striker Rudi Voller, 34, and defender Andreas Brehme, 33,
will not return.
Vogts, counting on experience, picked 12 men from the 1990 squad. But many
were over the hill.
'I hope that many players will continue because we need an experienced
basis,' Vogts said. 'But new players also have to come in and new ways have
to be found. We have to rebuild now and concentrate on the 1996 European
championships.'
Qualifying rounds start this autumn - and Germany will play Bulgaria.
