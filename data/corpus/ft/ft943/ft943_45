FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON.

<TEXT>
The market showed its disappointment with preliminary results from GEC, the
flagship of the UK's electronics industry, with the stock the worst
performer among the FT-SE 100 constituents and sliding more than 8 per cent
to its lowest level since January last year.
Explaining the steep fall in GEC shares, dealers said the market had been
expecting news of a successor to Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director,
and was surprised at news that he is staying on for a further two years.
Profits of Pounds 866m were only a fraction above last year's and well below
the consensus forecast of Pounds 890m, while the dividend total was in line
with most estimates. But analysts pointed out that the profits included an
unexpected Pounds 18m exceptional charge for litigation costs involving
Hughes Corporation, of the US, and that adding that figure back would have
put the results virtually in line with most estimates.
Analysts were said to be lowering the current year forecasts from the
consensus figure of Pounds 960m to a number closer to Pounds 900m. Some
analysts said the fall in the shares had been overdone. One commented: 'The
post-results meeting was by no means gloomy and the company's cash
generation was better than expected; this could be a good buying
opportunity.'
At the close GEC was 24 down at 270p, with turnover of 29m shares the
highest in a single day since the profits warning issued last December.

FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Broker support lifts BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT consolidated its position as the UK's biggest company, measured by market
capitalisation, following a strong buy recommendation from Robert Fleming
Securities. BT fully-paid shares settled 6 1/2 firmer at 383p and the
partly-paid 5 1/2 up at 264 1/2 p. Combined turnover in the two classes of
stock was 19.6m shares.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at the stockbroker, set a short term
target price of 420p for the fully-paid shares, telling clients that BT's
first-quarter figures expected on July 25 should please the market. Fleming
expects profits of around Pounds 750m, with inland call volume growth
estimated at 6 to 7 per cent, against 2 per cent last year. 'A little good
news could provide a powerful stimulus to the shares,' said Mr Heyworth.
The analyst added that BT had become very attractive. 'In addition to the
yield and price/earnings ratio, BT's firm value per line (ie market
capitalisation plus debt divided by the number of fixed lines) is now only
Dollars 1,430, the lowest of the quoted European telecom companies,' he
said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in the derivatives reported a dull session as uncertainty over US
and German interest rates overshadowed trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at
2,955, Following a bout of sideways trading, the contract moved gently
forward, with some encouragement drawn from comments from the Treasury
suggesting a steady recovery of the UK economy.
A firm performance in UK gilts brought a further advance in September and
and it hit a high of 2,970 over lunch. Significantly, volume remained poor,
an indication that many of the market's leading participants had chosen to
remain on the sidelines ahead of news on the US dollar and the outcome of
today's meeting by the Bundesbank.
However, active selling, mainly by independent (local) traders, emerged in
the mid-afternoon following an initial retreat in US bonds.
September then fell to a low of 2,936 before recovering to finish at 2,947,
at a premium to cash but 4 below its estimated fair value premium of 5
points. Volume was 10,763 lots.
Turnover in traded options again showed an improvement. A total of 33,603
contracts was traded, of which 12,184 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,118
in GEC, the busiest stock option.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's strength masks broad
market decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip issues posted solid gains yesterday, but otherwise US stock prices
were mostly flat to lower in light trading after the Federal Reserve's open
market committee meeting ended with no hint of any change in monetary
policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.02 at 3,674.50. The
strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poors 500 ended 0.24 off at 446.13, the American SE
composite eased 0.15 to 423.55 and the Nasdaq composite was 2.59 weaker at
701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a moderate 236.2m shares.
As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many
participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still
holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was
considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to
support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent
weeks.
Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change
monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment
report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for
interest rates continued to restrain demand. There was little subsequent
reaction when the meeting ended during the afternoon with no announcement
from the Fed, which was taken by analysts as a sign that monetary policy had
not been changed.
While much of the market languished, the one bright spot was the Dow, which
outperformed other indices thanks to strength in a few cyclical stocks,
including International Paper, which closed Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars
68 3/4 , Alcoa, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 7/8 , and Caterpillar, climbing
Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 104 1/2 .
Texaco advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 as investors bought more
stock following Tuesday's announcement of a major restructuring by the oil
group aimed at cutting costs. The share price was given an additional lift
yesterday by rat-ings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder
and Dean Witter Reynolds.
Dime Bancorp was one of the most active stocks on the NYSE, dropping Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after investors signalled
their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor
Bancorp in a Dollars 1.2bn stock swap. The news also failed to lift Anchor
shares, which ended Dollars  3/8 cheaper at Dollars 15 1/2 .
Salomon fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 1/2 after the company warned that it
would incur a loss of Dollars 200m in the second quarter because of poor
results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other
brokerage stocks: Morgan Stanley softened Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 55 5/8 ,
PaineWebber Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/2 and Dean Witter Discover Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 37.
Canada
Toronto closed modestly lower in light trading after the falling gold
bullion price again pushed gold shares downward.
The TSE 300 composite index lost 10.2 at 4,043.4 and declines led rises by
409 to 311 after volume of 42.8m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, with the golds group weakening 1.5
per cent as the price of gold in New York dipped USDollars 2.10 an ounce to
USDollars 383.85. The transportation group gained 1.4 per cent.
Laidlaw 'B' rose CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 9 5/8 in anticipation of its
third-quarter financial results, expected to be released soon.
Brazil
Sao Paulo rose 5.3 per cent in local currency terms in strong volume, on
optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential
election poll expected later this week.
The Bovespa index ended 1,892 higher at 37,535 and turnover was about
RDollars 221.5m (Dollars 242.1m). Traders saw local and foreign investors
coming back into the market and said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the
basic basket of goods of 0.69 per cent between Monday and Tuesday provided a
boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage
points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into
operation.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Keys resignation adds to S Africa woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg could find little positive news to support prices but limited
selling kept losses to a minimum. Tuesday's resignation of Mr Derek Keys as
finance minister had caught the market unawares; however, the swift
announcement of a replacement steadied nerves and took the sting out of
losses.
In addition, a slightly softer bullion price and continued concern about the
outlook for world markets depressed sentiment, limiting demand until further
concrete factors emerge.
The overall index finished 47 lower at 5,404, industrials lost 47 at 6,220
and golds declined 52 to 2,121. Anglo American relinquished R3 to R225 and
De Beers was R1.25 lower at R106.50. Richemont shed R1 to R37.50.
Key industry stocks were firmer, SAB appreciating R1 to R88 and Gencor
climbing 15 cents to R10.90. However, Iscor dipped 8 cents to R3.42, Barlows
receded 75 cents to R34.50 and Remgro eased 25 cents to R25. Banks were also
soft, Firstbank losing 25 cents at R21.50.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: F&amp;C targets emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial believes the time is right to be moving back into the
emerging markets, including some - like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand -
which have been hardest hit in the recent downturn. Mr Arnab Banerji, F &amp;
C's chief investment officer, told an investment gathering last night that
over the last 20 years there were four occasions when emerging markets fell
by the magnitude seen in recent months. During the early 1980s the markets
were stagnant for two years, but this coincided with the global recession
and the Latin American debt crisis. On other occasions, the downturn lasted
for no more than eight months. Each downturn had followed a rise in US
interest rates, along the lines of that seen in late February. All were
terminated by a recovery, driven by strong OECD growth. With the US economy
strong, the UK recovering, Germany recording expansion and Japan at or near
the bottom of its business cycle, Mr Banerji sees the right conditions to
start buying again.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Varied response to volatility
in dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was an awkwardly timed drop in the dollar towards the end of the
European afternoon but apathy, rather than apprehension, seemed to be the
order of the day in most bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
French and Spanish equities responded in varying degrees; but at Bank Julius
Bar in Frankfurt, Mr Gerhard Grebe said the Bundesbank was not unhappy with
a gentle decline in the dollar, which would help to dampen German import
prices; whereas, he argued, if Buba were to create money to support the US
currency, its long running problem with inflated M3 growth would be
exacerbated.
Short term, this scenario would not be good for the German corporate sector,
said Mr Grebe, but companies would adjust to the situation.
PARIS blamed the dollar for a wave of futures selling which left equities
off the top, the CAC 40 index ending 10.26 up at 1,888.99 after a session's
high of 1,900.12; but traders said there was little weight behind the move.
Turnover stayed light at FFr2.89bn.
Pechiney rose FFr6 to FFr395 as it said its Pechiney International unit
should see a stable first half, and a positive full year. Alcatel Alsthom
recovered a further FFr4 to FFr576.
MADRID's domestic bond market was pressured by uncertainty over the
direction of the US dollar and slowly growing fears of inflationary pressure
in Spain. The general index finished 3.68, or 1.25 per cent, down at 291.43,
a new low for the year. Turnover was light at Pta28.7bn.
There was no obvious pattern: in utilities, Endesa dropped Pta430, some 4
per cent, to Pta5,500 but Ibedrola rose Pta3 to Pta898. In banks, Bankinter
recovered Pta200 to Pta10,800, but Santander lost Pta115 at Pta4,440.
FRANKFURT was trapped in a narrow range in spite of another repo rate cut,
the Dax index rising 3.01 to 2,035.70 on the session and easing to 2,031.33
in the post-bourse, although dealers had said that it would be bad for
equities if the dollar fell again - as it did, in the last hour of Ibis
trading.
Turnover fell from DM5.7bn to DM4.6bn. Viag, the utility based combine, was
one of the few stars of the day, rising DM8 to DM466.50 after forecasting
higher 1994 profits and a rise in dividend next year. However, the
construction group, Philipp Holzmann, dropped DM18 to DM900 after saying
that orders fell in the first five months of 1994.
MILAN was unable to sustain early strength as attention turned again to
today's expected announcement of budget details. The Comit index added 4.35
at 695.59, although the late weakness was reflected in a 50-point fall in
the real-time Mibtel index.
Ina was quoted at L2,430 as it made its market debut, slightly above the
L2,400 price set by the treasury for its sale of 53.5 per cent of the
insurer. At the same time, Ina said that life insurance premiums grew by 25
per cent in the first five months of the year.
Alitalia jumped L63, or 6.7 per cent, to L1,000 in a technical rebound from
recent lows. Analysts also suggested that the government go-ahead for the
modernisation of Milan's second airport, which is important for the airlines
industrial strategy, overcame worries about yesterday's strike by cabin crew
and threatened industrial action by flight and ground staff next Monday.
ZURICH was easier in quiet trade in response to the lower dollar, a weak
futures market and a continuing absence of buying interest. The SMI index
gave up 10.8 to 2,598.9, with dollar related industrial issues feeling some
pressure. Roche certificates fell SFr50 to SFr6,280.
AMSTERDAM featured a strong performance by KLM in an otherwise subdued
market and the AEX index slipped 4.34 to 385.36.
Strong US demand took KLM 60 cents higher to close at Fl 52.80, after
touching Fl 53.70, in response to a favourable article in an American
financial newspaper, which said that its co-operation with Northwest was
paying off.
COPENHAGEN reflected the effect of general and specific fears in ultra-thin
turnover. Topdanmark, the ailing Danish insurance and finance services
group, paid the price for forecasting a current year loss approaching
DKr200m on Tuesday, the shares weakening DKr76, or 9.5 per cent, to DKr724
in minimal turnover. Novo Nordisk declined DKr10 to DKr630 on dollar
uncertainties, but the KFX index eased only 0.53 to 100.90.
TEL AVIV extended Tuesday's 3.4 per cent recovery, the Mishtanim index
rising 8.48, or 5.5 per cent, to 161.51. Turnover contracted from Shk179m to
Shk163m, dealers maintaining that it would have been higher if they could
have found sellers to match yesterday's buying orders.
WARSAW advanced for the third day in a row, the Wig index rising 380.7, or
4.3 per cent, to 8,833.4, but volume fell a sharp 18.5 per cent to just
above 1m shares. Three recently listed stocks, Amerbank, Prochem and Jelfa,
rose by the 10 per cent maximum.
ISTANBUL jumped 3.5 per cent as a wave of buying lifted prices towards the
close, although much of the activity was attributed to investors switching
issues and sellers who were bidding some stocks up to maintain higher prices
before cashing in profits.
The composite index rose 698.24 to 20,509.24, regaining the 20,000 level for
the first time since June 21.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rise in yen leaves
Nikkei losing ground
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A late rise in the yen triggered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, and
the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index was down 205.34 at 20,629.03 after a high for the day of 20,878.78
in the morning, and a low of 20,627.43 just before the close. The yen
returned to above Y98 to the dollar, prompting profit-taking in the
high-technology sector and depressing the futures market.
Volume amounted to 368m shares, against 391m. Small-lot buying by foreigners
and institutional investors failed to counter selling by arbitrageurs and
dealers.
The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 12.84 to 1,670.65, while
the Nikkei 300 declined 2.85 to 303.43 and falls led rises by 701 to 330,
with 160 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.07 firmer
at 1,352.80.
Dealers predicted that equities would trade in a narrow range throughout
this week, ahead of the Naples Group of Seven summit tomorrow. A Japanese
broker noted large-lot buying orders around the Nikkei 20,500 mark, but more
investors waiting to sell around 21,000.
Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y40
to Y1,890 and Bank of Tokyo by Y40 to Y1,560.
High-technology issues, which had recovered earlier this week on the brief
retreat of the yen against the dollar, were sold. Hitachi, Y1,070, and
Fujitsu, Y1,110, slipped Y30 apiece.
Terumo, the medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y200 for the
second consecutive day to Y1,220 on continued bullishness among investors
over the company's development of a new three dimensional television screen.
Speculative investors continued to buy stocks seemingly linked to the 'hot
weather' theme. Traders explained that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most
active issue of the day, put on Y6 at Y817 due to its popular air
conditioner, while Mitsubishi Shindoh, an air conditioner parts maker,
gained Y8 at Y724. Shikoku Chemicals, a pool disinfectant producer, climbed
Y40 to Y625.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.07 to 23,252.30 in volume of 41m
shares. Roundup
Uncertainty about the direction of world and domestic interest rates left
most of the Pacific Rim region lower.
HONG KONG worried about the weak dollar and the impending end of the US FOMC
meeting later yesterday, and a late afternoon sell-off left the Hang Seng
index down by 168.27, or 1.95 per cent, at 8,454.92, just off the day's low
of 8,449.36.
Turnover remained below HKDollars 2bn, registering a preliminary HKDollars
1.84bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 1.60bn. Brokers said investors
were betting on higher interest rates in the short term.
Meanwhile, worries about the profits of property developers, the focus of
the late sell-off, also dogged the bourse. Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1
to HKDollars 31.80 and SHK Properties HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 42.20.
SYDNEY surrendered recent gains to sink below the 2,000 barrier on the All
Ordinaries index, which finished 12.2 points weaker at 1,991.2 and well
below an intraday high of 2,010.5.
Turnover was nearly ADollars 353m. Trade was marked by Western Mining's
announcement of an ADollars 7.5bn alumina merger with Aluminum Co of America
and an ADollars 720m rights issue to fund its side of the deal. The stock
dipped 50 cents, or 6.7 per cent, to a two-month low of ADollars 7.02.
WELLINGTON fell on sell orders just before the close, the NZSE 40 index
shedding 13.19 to 1,984.14. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips. The
composite index fell 7.01 to 953.48.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.07, or 1.15 per cent, to
2,162.88. Brokers said the sliding US dollar in recent weeks had prompted
institutions to sell their Singapore investments as a hedge.
KARACHI tried to rise on new account buying early in the day, but
institutions and investors took to the sidelines, and attendance at the
exchange was poor as rains disrupted communications and power supplies. The
exchange closed an hour early, and the KSE 100 index lost 3.32 at 2,296.27
in thin volume.
TAIPEI, the exception, concentrated on domestic issues, brokers hoping that
the central bank may maintain its loose monetary policy after Tuesday's
announcement of June inflation at 2.14 per cent, and the weighted index
gained 50.23 at 6,115.18.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Ailing dollar driven lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as
markets assumed that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates
unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich.
The US currency lost about 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in
London at DM1.5685 from DM1.5826. Against the yen the dollar ended above the
session's low of Y97.70 in London at Y98.125, down from Y98.825. In New
York, however, it rallied to finish at DM1.5778 and Y98.90.
Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to
pressure the Swedish krona, Belgian franc and Italian lira while markets
focused on these countries' budget deficits.
Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low
against the German currency.
As South African President Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic
policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris
Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar.
As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal
Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed that a dollar support package was
not forthcoming and pushed the US currency down to a 14-month low against
the D-Mark.
Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates, and when the Fed
added reserves to the banking system it signalled no monetary policy
changes.
In late trading the dollar came off the session's lows as analysts suggested
that the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when
the US employment figures are released.
Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest
rate pol-icies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister
Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated that the Bundesbank had been opposed to the
most recent round of interven-tion on behalf of the dollar.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be
playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think
the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the
level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he added.
The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the
US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be
discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples.
In addition to benefiting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed
well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled
by gaping budget def-icits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium.
The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the
psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery
markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast.
The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1,000 against
the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's
three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget
deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian
franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it
normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that
the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political
coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc finished in London
at BFr20.67 from BFr20.63.
Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly
dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said
the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM2.00.
Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/Amro, said sterling performed poorly
against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK
industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May after
1.6 per cent in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily
steady industrial recovery.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 217m liquidity
at established rates after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 850m. The Bank
gave late assistance of Pounds 590m.
The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela
reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the
resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris
Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow
government policy'.
The rand finished in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845.
The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The
December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (11): A jungle that must be cleared - David
Lane on the prospects for further pension reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pensions are a fighting issue for Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of
Italy's CISL trade union. He says, uncompromisingly, that the new
regulations governing the country's state pension system that came into
effect at the beginning of last year have put an end to the debate on
pension reform. 'More changes would be wholly unacceptable.'
Yet, as the dire state of public finances makes news and attention focuses
on the yawning hole in the accounts of the INPS (Istituto Nazionale della
Previdenza Sociale) national pension fund, reform is being mentioned by
many. The recent court decision that awarded increases in second pensions,
to lift them to minimum levels, spotlighted the awesome cost of pension
provision and the awful condition of INPS' accounts. The cost of the court
decision, which includes payment arrears from 1983, has been estimated at
L32,500bn.
The changes introduced by the Amato government, after decades of
procrastination, now seem too little and too late. Until 1992 no government
had been willing to tackle the spiny pension issue and risk disfavour with
the electorate. Whether or not Mr D'Antoni wants the debate re-opened, this
has happened, and proposals for further changes are being discussed.
Gradualness is a feature of the Amato reform, which tried to ease the pain
of extending retirement age by introducing the change over 10 years. The age
for old age pensions was raised from 55 to 60 for women, and from 60 to 65
for men, in yearly steps every two years. The measure will thus only become
fully effective at the beginning of 2002. Similarly, a gradual process lifts
the number of years of pension fund contributions necessary to qualify for
an old age pension from 15 to 20 years.
The reform failed to address two matters that many consider critical. One is
public sector pensions which, although not handled by INPS, are nevertheless
a burden on public finances. Civil servants and local government officials
can enjoy the pleasures of retirement after less than 30 years of
employment. 'It is a jungle,' says Mr Bruno Trentin, the recently retired
general secretary of the leftwing CGIL trade union. He considers that reform
should first tackle public sector pensions.
The other is the seniority pension (pensione di anzianita) which allows
employees to retire on pension after 35 years of contributions to INPS.
Clearly, any man or woman who started work at the age of 20 and has paid
contributions continuously since then may retire at 55.
'Italy must eliminate the seniority pension,' says Mr Giovanni Palladino,
head of the financial analysis division at Confindustria, the
industrialists' confederation. He suggests raising the 35-year requirement
to at least 42 years immediately, and believes that this will be done when
the Amato government's pension reform is modified. 'There will be a
tremendous uproar from the trade unions. But they should understand that the
system must be changed for it to become viable and not be destroyed,' says
Mr Palladino.
Demographic factors are contributing to the erosion of INPS' viability.
People retire earlier and are living longer. Figures from INPS show that the
employees' fund has about 11.7m working contributors, while there are about
5.1m pensioners plus a further 2.7m dependents of deceased pensioners. In
addition, there are 2.2m invalids drawing pensions from the employees' fund.
INPS is a pay-as-you-go scheme, with contributions from active workers being
used to pay current pensions. Every worker is therefore funding one pension
being paid. Mr D'Antoni at CISL describes this as 'generational solidarity'.
The call of solidarity is rather less among Italian shopkeepers, of whom
1.7m are presently paying contributions. They support 0.4m pensioners, 0.2m
dependents of deceased pensioners and 0.2m invalids. However, the situation
is very different for Italy's 0.9m active agricultural workers. They and
other INPS contributors support 0.7m pensioners, 0.4m dependents of
pensioners and 0.9m invalids.
Generational solidarity is one feature of Italy's state pension scheme.
Another is sectoral solidarity. INPS points out that funds generated by
employees' contributions created substantial reserves in the 1960s. These
were diverted to pay pensions to the self-employed - shopkeepers, tradesmen
and agricultural smallholders - and to win their votes. These categories
have contributed little but received a lot.
INPS has also been called to pay for social policy measures decided by
government. Instead of operating solely as the pension fund for which it was
established, successive governments, with the consent of the trade unions
which ran INPS until last year, used it as a social shock absorber. Since
the economic crises of the 1970s, it has paid for early retirement
programmes and unemployment pay, and has subsidised reduced contributions to
encourage employment in depressed areas.
INPS says that it disbursed L70,500bn last year in social assistance. Of
this L25,000bn was paid to bring small pensions up to the minimum, L13,000bn
to cover the deficit on agricultural workers' pensions, L9,000bn for
subsidised reduced contributions, L8,000bn for reduced contributions for
domestic workers, apprentices and trainees, L5,000bn for unemployment
benefits, L5,000bn for benefits to the elderly without pensions, L3,500bn
for early retirements and L2,000bn for other pensions.
Required to range way beyond simply managing the funds of active workers to
pay pensions to those who have been contributors, according to what they
have paid in, INPS has serious problems in balancing its books. This year it
expects to disburse L250,973bn, while receiving L178,823bn. The cash
shortfall of L72,150bn (equal to about one half of the PSBR), will be
covered by transfers from the treasury.
With such figures making headlines in Italian newspapers, it is not
surprising that the crash or collapse of INPS is being predicted and that
there are calls for tough measures to correct the situation.
In addition to making immediate changes to qualifying ages for old age and
seniority pensions, another modification under consideration concerns the
yield for calculating pension amounts. At present, this is 2 per cent of
average annual wage in the final five years of employment, per year of
contribution, giving 70 per cent for those with 35 years of contributions.
Though the Amato reform has introduced changes to the number of years taken
into account for the calculations, it has not touched the yield, which is
generally thought to be generous. Confindustria's Mr Palladino considers
that this should be cut to 1.5 per cent. Mr D'Antoni says that such a move
would be devastating.
Generational solidarity is being stretched as many middle-age employees
wonder how much of the 27 per cent of their annual remuneration, paid to
INPS as pension contributions, they will eventually enjoy.
Yet if the government wants to show that it is serious about putting public
sector accounts in order, it is difficult for it to avoid tackling this
tough problem. Another round of pension reform will not be a vote winner at
home, but it would win respect in international markets.
Some trade unionists are not blind to the need for action. 'The system is
unsustainable. Unless something is done, it will collapse by the year 2000,'
predicts CGIL's Mr Trentin.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (12): Fears grow of softer line on Mafia -
Christopher Matthews assesses signs of a change in government attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mafia's language is traditionally allusive. No self-respecting Mafioso
will directly threaten you with death. Instead, he will graciously inquire
after your health.
This makes Mafia watching rather like old-style Kremlin watching - a
question of interpreting subtle signs and signals. Similarly, any
government's pronouncements or decisions on matters pertaining to the Mafia
are immediately scrutinised and interpreted to gauge the current level of
determination to fight organised crime.
Clearly, Mafiology is no more an exact science than was Kremlinology. All
the same, fears among Mafia watchers that the Berlusconi government is about
to throw the two-year-old successful offensive into reverse gear could be
justified. Some damage has already been done.
If most of the top bosses of the Mafia, the Neapolitan Camorra and the
Calabrian 'ndrangheta are today behind bars, and if police were last year
able to sequester a record L1.5 trillion worth of Mafia property, that is
largely due to the fact that, since 1992, more than 700 Mafiosi have been
induced to come forward as government witnesses.
This, in turn, is largely the consequence of legislation passed following
the Palermo assassinations of Judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino,
which gave the mobsters a number of incentives to collaborate with justice.
Yet a revision of that law was one of the first reforms suggested by Mr
Alfredo Biondi, the new justice minister. Getting Mafiosi to step forward
and grass on former associates was not enough, he argued. There should be
built-in safeguards to ensure that they were telling the truth.
Just what the minister had in mind was not spelt out in detail, though the
idea seemed to be that new collaborators should be obliged to state from the
outset exactly what information they had to 'sell' to avoid subsequent
corrections or 'instalment plan' revelations. Another suggestion Mr Biondi
made was that Mafia witnesses should be placed under the protection of a
specialist agency to be created on the lines of the US marshals' service.
Although Mr Biondi has since made clear that no new legislation is in the
offing, the impression left is that:
a) Mafia justice collaborators are to be considered a suspect category.
b) Magistrates, who at present enjoy complete autonomy in 'controlling'
Mafia informers, risk seeing their role restricted.
According to Mr Pino Arlacchi, professor of sociology at Florence University
and a leading expert on the Mafia: 'The debate on whether collaborators can
be trusted or not is useless and counter-productive. Magistrates should be
capable of telling the difference between lies and the truth without being
told how to.'
Whether or not they are, it is clear that breaking down the wall of omerta,
the code of silence that for long kept the Mafia one of the world's most
successful secret societies, depends largely on the personal alchemy that
develops between individual magistrates and Mafiosi. It hinges, too, on
whether the latter are satisfied that they and their families can be
effectively protected.
Mr Tommaso Buscetta, the first Mafia boss to turn informer, kept his mouth
shut until he met Giovanni Falcone, though Brazilian police had torn out his
toenails and threatened to throw him from a helicopter in which he was
travelling.
Prof Arlacchi, himself under sentence of death from the Mafia, says that the
debate on the handling of informers represents a serious setback in the war
on the mobsters. Many informers, he notes, have already begun to dry up.
Equally damaging, he says, is the current controversy regarding the
conditions under which Mafiosi are being detained. These have been dubbed
'inhumane' by the president of the Chamber of Deputies' permanent committee
on justice.
Until two years ago, many Mafia bosses served their jail terms in extremely
permissive conditions. They had access to cellular telephones, with which
they could impart orders to their henchmen outside the prison walls,
virtually limitless visits, and deferential treatment from prison guards and
authorities. Many, on the strength of medical certificates, enjoyed the
comfort of private clinics.
All that changed after the judges were assassinated. Tough regulations were
introduced. The Mafiosi were all despatched to the island prisons of Pianosa
and l'Asinara, to be cut off from the outside world.
'This proved a serious blow,' says Prof Arlacchi. 'The Mafia bosses saw
their prestige crumble. The myth of their impunity was shattered. But now I
see a serious threat to the very edifice that we've constructed against the
Mafia over the last few years.'
Investigators have repeatedly warned that the Mafia would try to find ways
of discrediting their former colleagues-turned-informers, while Mr Toto
Riina, the supreme Mafia boss, has spoken out against the jail conditions
which he and his associates have endured. In other words, a hypothetical
Mafia lobby might justifiably view today's controversies as a considerable
success.
Why is the debate about informers taking place at all? According to Prof
Arlacchi, it is being orchestrated by corrupt politicians and members of the
judiciary who have the most to fear from the informers' revelations.
A somewhat different view comes from Mr Paolo Cabras, a former senator and
member of the parliamentiary Anti-Mafia Commission. He says the Berlusconi
government is seeking to redress the internal balance of power, which swung
heavily in favour of the judiciary with the Tangentopoli investigation and
the subsequent collapse of the traditional political parties.
Moreover, he notes, several top ministers and aides are all former lawyers -
such as Mr Biondi and Mr Cesare Previti, the defence minister. They are not
necessarily well-disposed towards magistrates.
At this point, it can only be a matter of conjecture whether or not Italy's
new government is 'soft' on the Mafia. We will have to see what the cabinet
does, as opposed to the often contradictory things it says. But the signs
are not encouraging.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (9): Catalyst for change - Privatisation and
the new government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than two years, privatisation, once anathema to Italian governments,
has suddenly become a benchmark for judging Rome's commitment to modernising
the Italian economy.
The three-year programme launched by the Amato government in July 1992
seemed to move slowly or not at all at the start. But when Efim, the now
defunct state holding company, completed the sale of its glass-making
subsidiary SIV to the UK's Pilkington last June, it signalled an
acceleration of the process.
Since then, there have been at least seven substantial sales, raising more
than L13,000bn, not to mention a number of smaller flotations and private
sales, for example by Eni, the state energy and chemicals group. Earlier
this week, the Treasury was completing the largest privatisation yet - the
sale of 51 per cent of Ina, the insurance company. In theory, the market
will soon have to digest the even larger privatisations of Stet, the
telecommunications holding company, Enel, the electricity generator, and all
or part of Eni.
Everybody seems to agree that the process of Italian privatisation is now
unstoppable. One of the first things Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new
administration did in May, when confirmed in office, was to press ahead with
the flotation timetable of Ina, as a signal of its willingness to carry out
the programme outlined by Mr Giuliano Amato and pursued by his successor, Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the new budget minister, said last month that the
government's privatisation ambitions would extend to the contracting out of
services. 'For this government, privatisation doesn't only mean selling
state enterprises,' he told foreign journalists in Milan. 'The sales are
only a small part of the privatisation programme.'
Most of the reasons why the state sell-off is important to the Berlusconi
administration are fairly orthodox.
The proceeds of the sell-offs are channelled into reducing public
indebtedness, helping to prevent a spiralling increase in the deficit and
interest payments which could undermine all Mr Berlusconi's economic
promises. Privatisation also helps public finances because it puts an end to
most state subsidies. That, in turn, helps convince foreign governments and
pan-European authorities that Italy is not going to slide back into its old
trade-distorting habits.
For example, in the case of Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer, the
fact that the Ciampi government's plans involved a commitment to the
division and sale of its main operations helped to persuade the European
Commission to approve a final package of subsidies for the company.
The final motive for continuing with privatisation is to encourage the Milan
stock market. Apart from the interim Amato and Ciampi administrations, the
Berlusconi government is the first in Italian postwar history that actively
wants to stimulate the private sector through the stock market.
Privatisation is one of the catalysts which the stock exchange and the
government hope will encourage wider share ownership and the flotation of
more private companies.
As Mr Pietro Armani, a former deputy chairman of Iri, the main state holding
company, said at a recent conference on privatisation: 'It is no longer
possible today to think of a return to a mixed economy with direct state
control of enterprises . . . That's not only because of the strictures of
the EU, but also because the state can perfectly well control the economy
indirectly, through 'golden shares'.'
However, in practice, some of the government's ambitions have been thwarted
by circumstances. It is proving difficult to sell certain parts of the state
sector - notably the flat steel division of Ilva, and the GS/Autogrill
supermarket and catering companies. In addition, the previous
administration's privatisation of two banks, Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana, has sparked controversy about the control of such
companies, casting a long shadow over future plans.
Mr Romano Prodi, then chairman of Iri, has led protests that powerful
corporate and financial allies - backed by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant
bank - gained control over the boards of the two banks after privatisation,
by pooling their shares to nominate directors. According to Mr Prodi and his
supporters, this circumvented rules limiting individual shareholders to a 3
per cent stake in the company, and thus thwarted Iri's attempts to encourage
wider share ownership.
Neutral observers have pointed out that until Italy develops a pension fund
and unit trust industry along Anglo-Saxon lines it will be difficult to
guarantee small shareholders a voice in privatised boardrooms. In addition,
Mr Prodi's opponents - such as Mr Paolo Savona, former industry minister -
say the establishment of a nocciolo duro or hard core of shareholders helps
privatised companies.
But the new government has still felt moved to dispel the small
shareholders' fears. In the case of Ina, a 5 per cent limit has been imposed
on shareholdings, but the stakes of allies - for example, investors who are
members of the shareholder syndicate of third companies - will be counted as
belonging to a single investor. At the same time, a certain number of seats
on the board will be reserved for small shareholders' nominees. Although it
remains to be seen how these rules will work in practice, the government has
indicated that they will apply to the much more sensitive sell-offs of Enel
and Stet.
These sales, and that of Eni, will be the real test for the new government's
professed enthusiasm for privatisation, partly because they are larger than
anything which has gone before. The Stet offer could set Mediobanca directly
against supporters of wider share ownership, because the merchant bank wants
to form a shareholder syndicate with Pirelli, the tyres and cables group, to
take control of the telecoms company. Critics say links between Pirelli and
one of its principal potential customers would hold back the development of
Stet.
There is also a running debate about how and when to privatise Enel and the
oil and gas interests of Eni. In theory, Stet should be sold before the end
of this year, and Enel shortly afterwards. But Eni is pushing hard for the
government to consider selling its Agip and Snam oil and gas subsidiaries
before Enel comes to the market. 'We've done everything to prepare for the
government to take a final decision,' says Mr Franco Bernabe, Eni's chief
executive.
Critics of the government say it was not too difficult to take a quick
decision about the sale of Ina, because it was uncontroversial and the
ground had been well-prepared by treasury officials. It may prove more
difficult to realise the high-sounding promises of Mr Berlusconi and his
ministers to implement quickly the rest of the privatisation programme.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (8): This may be turning point on Europe -
Andrew Hill considers whether the country can pull its weight in the
Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Domenico Comino, Italy's new minister for Europe, is disarmingly frank
about his country's image in the European Union: 'Traditionally, we're
considered the truffatori (fraudsters) of the Community,' he says.
As self-criticism goes, that may be a little harsh, and Mr Comino himself,
not surprisingly, hopes to disprove it. However, Italy's reputation in
Brussels is certainly lower than might be expected for a country which
signed the Treaty of Rome and has since toed an obsequiously pro-European
line in its public policy statements.
Part of the problem has been the gap between theory and practice. As well as
accusations of (mainly agricultural) fraud, Mr Comino identifies 'a certain
disengagement' on the part of previous ministers, and a perception that
Italy signed up to laws without then enforcing them, as the main reasons for
Italy's disproportionately weak political clout in the Union.
Whatever the reasons, while axes have proliferated between other member
states, Italy has found itself all but frozen out by its biggest partners on
important policy developments. In spite of being a neighbour of the former
Yugoslavia, for example, Italy has taken a back seat in international
diplomatic initiatives in the region, while its own proposals have mostly
been politely ignored.
But paradoxically, the election of an Italian government more sceptical than
any of its predecessors about the European ideal may mark a turning point in
Italy's relationship with the EU.
The groundwork was laid by the preceding 'technocratic' government, headed
by Mr Giuliano Amato and then by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. They impressed
Brussels with their manifest desire to clean up Italy's public finances and
observe the economic criteria of the Maastricht treaty.
Being forced to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism in
September 1992 was a blow, but three months later Mr Amato managed to
persuade his EU partners to authorise an Ecu8bn balance of payments loan to
Italy, partly to offset the loss of reserves used to support the lira during
the exchange rate crisis. The conditions attached to this loan helped
maintain the strong external discipline which Italy needs if it is to reduce
its budget deficit and continue to follow the path laid out at Maastricht.
In this more positive climate, Mr Ciampi's government also managed to
persuade the European Commission and EU industry ministers to approve a
final package of subsidies for Ilva, the loss-making state-owned steelmaker,
on condition that capacity was cut and factories privatised. For the first
time for many years it seemed as though Brussels was actually taking Italian
promises seriously.
In the early months of the Berlusconi government, ministers have been trying
to talk the same language, although they accept that almost no amount of
budget rigour will give Italy a chance of being in the first wave of
countries moving towards European monetary union. 'We're not even in the
picture,' admits Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister.
However, the goal of monetary union remains vital for the country, and the
backbone of European legislation an important pillar of the reconstruction
of Italy after years of disregarded laws framed by discredited lawmakers.
'The political objective of Europe is fundamental for us,' Mr Pagliarini
adds. 'If we look back, the best laws put in place in Italy are the laws
based on EU legislation.'
For federalist members of the new government, such as Mr Comino and Mr
Pagliarini - both from the Northern League - fidelity to the European ideal
also means giving more power to the regions.
But they will have to bear in mind, that overall policy is being laid out by
more sceptical hands. At the helm of foreign policy is Mr Antonio Martino,
son of Gaetano Martino, the Christian Democrat foreign minister who signed
the articles of the Treaty of Rome. Martino fils is a member of the Bruges
Group, inspired by Lady Thatcher's resistance to European integration,
although he sees himself as a critic of previous Italian policy rather than
an out-and-out opponent of Europe.
This sceptical line could well put Italy at one end of a European policy
axis, with Britain at the other. Evidence from the recent summit of EU
leaders in Corfu, however, suggests that this will take time to evolve. Mr
Silvio Berlusconi flew out ready to press for postponement of a decision on
the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. He breakfasted
with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, after which both men
expressed their satisfaction at being on the same free market wavelength.
But in the debate on the Delors succession, Mr Berlusconi switched to
backing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and Britain's bete
noir - helping to isolate the UK.
As an elected rather than a technocratic government, members of the
Berlusconi team may find it slightly more difficult than their predecessors
to take a strictly purist line on certain issues.
For example, there were fears ahead of the Corfu summit that the meeting
might be disrupted by a row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk
production quota. In the event, the issue was overshadowed by the Delors
succession, but Italy's insistence on a solution favourable to its farmers
was reminiscent of the surprise decision by Mr Giulio Andreotti, then prime
minister, to force milk quotas onto the agenda of the EU's 1992 Lisbon
summit.
The new government might find its free market line similarly tested when it
comes to lifting all quotas on imports from beyond the EU - particularly
cars from Japan or leather goods from China. As Mr Berlusconi will be quick
to find out, self-interest often rules at the Brussels negotiating table.
The most immediate challenge for the new government, however, is to combat
the gut opposition of many of its European partners to the presence of the
far right in the coalition. Mr Delors himself has already talked of the
'extreme vigilance' needed when dealing with such a government, and certain
EU ministers have publicly snubbed their 'post-fascist' National Alliance
counterparts at meetings.
One Italian minister points out: 'You put the label on the bottle of wine
when the wine-making is over, not when it's only just started.' But it is
already clear that Italy will only be able to pull its weight in European
and international policy circles if it can dispel the residual fears of its
partners quickly.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (10): Conflict is giving way to conciliation
 -Trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Valentine's Day this year was the tenth anniversary of measures that
reduced the monthly cost of living allowance by about L27,000. As well as
hitting pay packets, the modification of the scala mobile (escalator)
indexation mechanism in 1984 also fractured relations between Italy's three
main trade unions: CGIL, CISL and UIL. It was the end of an era in which
labour always seemed united, organised and ready for the frontline.
Flames of worker solidarity and trade union power now seem to flicker rather
less brightly than in the 1960s and 1970s. Action is rarer, both in the
workplace and on the streets. 'Clashes at Fiat in the 1970s were the high
point,' says Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the research department at
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. He notes, however, that
difficulties in public sector labour relations peaked more recently, at the
end of the 1980s.
As the present decade reaches its mid-point, there appears to be a
different, easier climate. 'Attitudes at Confindustria have changed in
several important respects. There has been a softening, and this has allowed
us to discuss and do many things with the trade unions,' claims Mr Micossi.
Mr Bruno Trentin, who has just retired as general secretary of the leftwing
CGIL, notes that there is a desire to avoid conflict. But he seeks to
deflect charges that his trade union has sold out. 'There is confrontation,
but it is well-behaved.' And tensions still run high in some sectors. Mr
Trentin reports difficulties in dealing with Confindustria's affiliated
associations that represent small and medium-sized enterprises, Confapi, and
construction companies, Ance, and also with the agricultural employers.
However, conflict has generally given way to conciliation. Mr Sergio
D'Antoni, general secretary of the centre-right CISL trade union (linked to
the former Christian Democrat party), talks about reaching understandings
with employers' organisations. 'It is the best way of safeguarding workers'
interests,' he affirms.
Last July's labour agreement, reached under the Ciampi government,
illustrates what the dialogue during the early 1990s has achieved.
First, the agreement contains a framework for incomes policy. Formal
consultations between government, labour and employers are to be held twice
a year, before economic policy measures are decided. Trade unions and
employers have undertaken to act consistently with the objectives set as a
result of the consultations.
Second, it lays down a new structure for collective bargaining,
industry-wide contracts at national level and local negotiations having
different timings, procedures and bargaining items. Trade union
representation at company level has been redesigned and mechanisms
introduced for cooling off disputes.
'This new system of industrial relations is very important,' says Mr
Micossi, who considers that labour's agreement is evidence of realism. 'Wage
bargaining is much simplified, with only two negotiating levels and a
four-year contract period. National contracts are under negotiation this
year and next, and local contracts will follow in 1996 and 1997,' he
explains.
Enthusiasm for last year's agreement is not one-sided. 'It was a great step
forward, establishing a single system across the board, including the public
sector, and creating a new approach to trade union representation at plant
level,' says CGIL's Mr Trentin.
Are there dangers that the new bargaining structure and the economic upturn
now under way will cause inflationary wage settlements? With the complete
abolition of the scala mobile mechanism in July 1992, wage indexation is no
longer the inflationary element that caused damage in the past. Wage
inflation, if it occurs, will arise from agreements at national and local
levels.
Confindustria's Mr Micossi is optimistic. 'Industrial relations are good and
the trade unions are reasonable. We do not foresee an imminent return of
wage inflation. There is no possibility of real wage increases before 1996.'
The industrialists' confederation is concerned, however, about wage drift in
the public sector.
The CGIL also considers that risks of wage inflation are low, though
inflationary seeds may be taking root. Mr Trentin notes that the purchasing
power of workers' pay packets has declined over the past two years. 'The
problem lies in the retail sector. Even with falling factory gate prices,
shop prices increased.'
However, the latest statistics show that inflation is at its lowest in 25
years. Trade union attention is focused most on unemployment, and there is
awareness that moderation on wage claims can help job creation.
Moderation is one of several new words that have broadened the vocabulary of
Italian labour relations over recent years. Flexibility is another.
'Modern trade unions must be open and flexible,' says CISL's Mr D'Antoni. He
believes that flexibility on working hours should be used more widely as a
means of creating employment. 'Employers have dragged their feet on this,'
he alleges.
Mr D'Antoni warns that employees' rights must be protected. And he says that
increased flexibility of existing workforces must not lead to fewer or
temporary jobs, but to stable new employment.
'We do not make a demon of flexibility. But it needs to be managed
carefully. Old certainties must be replaced by new certainties, not by
uncertainty. A fundamental principle, won after a long fight, is that equal
work should be rewarded by equal pay,' says Mr Trentin at CGIL.
With youth unemployment a serious problem, one of the issues under
discussion is starting wages. Mr Trentin says that the CGIL does not oppose
differentials for young people, provided that their pay packets are adjusted
when their skill levels and productivity reach those of older workers.
Another issue is the south, where unemployment is twice the national rate.
One proposal to deal with this problem is a north-south differential (gabbie
salariali - wage cages), with lower southern pay packets to encourage the
creation of jobs. 'It was tried before, and does not work,' says Mr Trentin,
who adds that differentials exist in practice as many employers in the south
disregard national wage agreements.
Italy's high jobless figure has had an impact on trade union membership. The
CGIL's working membership has fallen significantly: last year it was 2.5m
against 3.6m in 1977 and 3.1m in 1983. Indeed, the number of pensioner CGIL
members last year (2.7m) exceeded those in employment.
The other two confederate trade unions (CISL and the centre-left UIL) have
also experienced ageing in their ranks, though not as marked as the CGIL.
This partly reflects corporatist consensus-seeking that is strong in the
conservative and Catholic parts of Italy's trade union movement. 'We must be
involved in policy choices. This important role for trade unions is in the
interests of those in work,' says Mr D'Antoni.
Have Italy's trade unions lost their way or the will to fight that they
showed in the 1960s and 1970s? Certainly the situation is different from the
time when Luciano Lama headed the CGIL and Mr Trentin led the heavy brigade
of its engineering section, the metalmeccanici, with fraternal backing from
CISL's and UIL's engineers. However, Mr D'Antoni believes the need for trade
unionism and support for it from workers remain intact.
As the trade unions come to terms with a rapidly evolving economy and the
radical changes in Italian politics, a major development is in sight for
them. Ten years after the split on the scala mobile, the prospects of
unification seem bright.
'CISL's doubts and reservations have lessened considerably,' says Mr
D'Antoni. And CGIL wants to accelerate the unification process. 'There has
been great progress in relations, and there will be a joint congress of the
three confederate trade unions at the end of this year. Next year offers
prospects of unification,' says Mr Trentin.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (6): Supporters' clubs score a victory -
Robert Graham examines a political transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of a successful political movement calling itself after a football
slogan would have been laughed out of court a year ago. But today almost one
in three voters are supporters of Forza Italia (Come On Italy]).
The movement was spawned in January by Mr Silvio Berlusconi as the vehicle
for the media magnate's political ambitions; and this is essentially what it
remains. Forza Italia has yet to define itself as anything other than a
Berlusconi supporters' club run by former members of his Fininvest business
empire.
Is Forza Italia then the harbinger of a new political phenomenon - a 'light'
party? Ideologically bland, it has moved where Mr Gianni Pilo, Mr
Berlusconi's pollster, has identified the electoral preferences to be. The
emphasis is shifting away from the interplay of parties to the satisfaction
of voters' needs.
Compared to the traditional concept of Italian parties with their highly
politicised and cumbersome party machines, Forza Italia carries little
baggage. If the new premier sustains his popularity, Forza Italia could be
the catalyst that welds together all the heterogenous forces in the centre
and on the right. Its financial resources, backed by Mr Berlusconi's
fortune, give Forza Italia a lead over all its rivals.
The Forza Italia coalition will be one of the two future blocs that many
observers see as the inevitable consequence of Italy adopting a
first-past-the-post voting system. The other bloc will be a broad left or
centre-left alliance. The process began in the March 27-28 general elections
which were essentially between the 'Freedom Alliance' of Forza Italia, the
populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI-National Alliance on the
one hand and the six-party Progressive Alliance on the left. The centre
parties were squeezed.
If Mr Berlusconi's bid for political power had failed, Forza Italia would
have probably disappeared as quickly as it arose. But the party picked up
over 20 per cent of the vote and increased this to 30 per cent in the June
elections for the European parliament. The addition of some 10 percentage
points of the vote in less than two months is the single largest swing in
Italy's postwar history.
Until the March elections Italy was unique in western Europe for the
near-absence of a floating vote and the electorate's loyalty to its chosen
parties. For instance, the Christian Democrats and Italian Communist Party
(PCI) consistently accounted for almost two-thirds of the vote until the
1987 general elections. The biggest swing experienced by the PCI was a 7 per
cent increase in vote in 1976 (against 1972); while the most the Christian
Democrat vote fell was 8 per cent in 1953 (against 1948).
Even today, on the left the old PCI vote has held steady in percentage terms
at around 26 per cent. Three-quarters of the PCI vote has merely gone to its
mainstream successor, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and a quarter
to the hardline Marxist rump, Reconstructed Communism.
The PDS has survived because the leadership realised the need after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall to transform itself into a social democrat
party. In contrast, the Christian Democrats and their allies in government
were shattered by the impact of the corruption scandals that begun to be
unearthed in 1992. Their raison d'etre had been to prevent the PCI coming to
power and once this disappeared there was nothing to replace it.
The well-organised PDS was the first to understand that the new electoral
system encouraged the formation of alliances. It formed a Progressive
Alliance to fight two rounds of municipal elections in June and November
last year and did spectacularly well. Save for the League stronghold of
Milan, the Progressives made a clean sweep of the big cities. Before Mr
Berlusconi entered politics in January, the PDS looked set to walk away with
the March general elections.
Significantly, Mr Berlusconi moulded his campaign round the need to prevent
the left coming to power. But his remarkably quick success was due to the
way he both inherited and exploited the space formerly occupied by the
conservative centre and the right.
A debt-burdened and demoralised Christian Democrat party dissolved in
January. The bulk, representing the centre and left, formed the Popular
Party (PPI), so resurrecting the name of the Christian Democrats' forebear
in the 1920s. Their idea was to be a compact Catholic grouping, whose
strength would be to act as coalition brokers between the left and the
right. The remainder of the Christian Democrats decided to form a right-wing
Catholic grouping, the Christian Democratic Centre.
A small slice of the old Christian Democrats had already jumped ship during
1993 to make common cause with Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader who
split from the party in March last year. Unlike the PPI, Mr Segni saw
himself as the leader of a broad-based coalition drawn from both left and
right.
However, his refusal to strike a deal with either the PDS or the
Progressives ensured that he ended up without real allies. In turn, this
opened the field to Mr Berlusconi himself.
Mr Berlusconi courted the PPI but was spurned. So he was forced to make
common cause with odd bedfellows - the regionalist Northern League and the
Mussolini-inspired MSI. Despite their differences, none had been part of the
traditional power structure: all had escaped the stigma of corruption.
In contrast, the PPI and Mr Segni's Italian Pact in the centre suffered
because they appeared ready to play old political games: wait for the
election result and then act as brokers to form the next government. This
miscalculation cost them dear and they must now decide whether to pursue a
lonely vigil in the hope that the Berlusconi star will wane or become part
of a broader alliance on the left or the right.
Their bargaining power would be greater in making a deal on the left. The
PDS and its allies (Greens, Socialists, Democratic Alliance, The Network and
Reconstructed Communism) appear to have a voter ceiling as long as they fail
to broaden towards the centre. Mr Achille Occhetto, who resigned as PDS
leader in the wake of the European elections, was not prepared to remove
Reconstructed Communism from the Progressive Alliance, aware that they
accounted for 7 per cent of the vote nationwide. But they are an electoral
liability.
The nature of alliances will be the main political theme for the next year
or so, and the subtext will be the identity of parties. Small parties such
as the Republicans, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals have all but
disappeared. They can obtain parliamentary representation only by forging
local alliances and will no longer be able rely on proportional
representation, which may be completely eliminated at the next election.
Practical differences on policies are disappearing and it is hard to see
what most parties even pretend to stand for in this post-ideological age.
Even the MSI on the right is being sucked towards the mainstream, burying
its nationalist and corporatist sentiments.
This fast-changing picture imposes great responsibilities on the leadership
of both the main groupings on the left and right, the PDS and Forza Italia.
The PDS has the organisation but lacks the flair. Forza Italia has the flair
but lacks the organisation.
Mr Berlusconi fostered the idea of supporters' clubs, which could be formed
by almost any group that identified with him. Some 15,000 clubs now cover
every part of Italy. Each tends to regard itself as autonomous. To achieve
some coherence, a separate national organisation was set up, based in Rome.
This controls the political activity of the party and its candidates, and
leaves the clubs with social and support functions rather like a new string
of rotary clubs. Indeed, many Forza Italia activists have sprung from such
clubs.
A more formal party apparatus may be inevitable. Only this will enable Forza
Italia to outlive Mr Berlusconi.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (7): Speroni seeks power for regions -
Institutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform has been one of the most abused words in Italian politics. Much
promised in every sphere of life, at best reforms have been timid and half
completed. Usually, they have been still-born.
Yet Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, more than any other postwar
administration, has come to power with the promise of reform - from the tax
system, pensions, health and the civil service to the very structure of the
state.
There is little doubt about the new government's good intentions. The prime
minister wants to make the state apparatus work better, be
'citizen-friendly' and to reflect a more federal structure. His partners,
the Northern League, have made 'federalism' their battle cry, even if the
concept remains ill-defined.
With an ample majority in the chamber of deputies, reform measures stand a
good chance of passing through parliament without being emasculated. The
main problem is establishing a set of priorities and co-ordinating policy
within the government alliance.
Mr Berlusconi would like to proceed as rapidly as possible with a further
overhaul of electoral reform. The changes introduced at the March elections
showed that the August 1993 electoral reform measures were inadequate. They
managed to combine both the best and worst of the old proportional
representation laws and the first-past-the-post system.
In both houses 75 per cent of the seats were allocated under the
first-past-the-post system. This was designed to encourage the formation of
electoral alliances and promote a move towards a two-party or three-party
system instead of the old 16-odd parties that made up the previous
legislatures. In contrast, the retention of proportional representation,
willed by the bulk of the old parties as an insurance policy for their
survival, led to precisely the opposite tendency. It encouraged the
permanence of small parties which retained at least a few seats.
At the same time, the voting age of the senate was left unchanged from the
minimum 25 years, unlike the minimum 18 years for the chamber. Italy is the
sole European country that now discriminates by age for representation to
the upper house. The age difference produced a slightly different voter
profile in March with maturer voters still favouring the centre. As a
result, the Berlusconi alliance failed to obtain an outright majority in the
senate.
An age change for the senate is an obvious move. But a more fundamental
shift, to 100 per cent majority voting, is also required. This would either
be with a single round of voting or a second round run-off, as in France.
Only with such a system would the electorate clearly vote for a government
and a programme. At present voters are still asked to endorse a particular
party or candidate rather than a programme.
The most tangible evidence of electoral reform is in the hectic activity of
Mr Francesco Speroni, the bicycle-riding League minister for institutional
reform. In the formation of the government, the portfolio was hotly
contested by the League who wanted this ministry, along with that of the
interior, as a symbol of their commitment to federalism.
With elections for 15 of the 20 regional councils in Italy due next May, Mr
Speroni has been drawing up proposals to harmonise the election rules for
the regions with those already introduced for municipal councils. Since last
year, the municipalities have seen their mayors directly elected on a voting
system that also enables the winning party/alliance to enjoy a ruling
majority.
This combination of directly elected mayors and special provisions
enshrining the principle of ruling majorities has brought about a sea-change
in local government. Mayors are no longer imposed by the parties after the
elections but are 'democratically elected' specifically for the task.
Coalitions have been encouraged by a system of second round run-offs between
the two top candidates. This has improved the municipal decision-making
process considerably and ensured that local election results reflect local
issues.
The Speroni proposals would introduce majority voting, while allowing
individual regions to opt for their own type of first-past-the-post system.
But Mr Speroni's real aim is to make this the first step towards far greater
devolution of power to the regions.
He would like to see a high degree of fiscal devolution to encourage better
use of resources and more local initiative. Until now, local government has
been funded by centralised hand-outs from Rome. These were poorly accounted
for and permitted the local authorities to adopt a passive attitude to
administration.
Mr Speroni insists greater fiscal devolution would not be at the expense of
the principle of solidarity between regions. Richer regions would still be
obliged to transfer part of their resources to the poorer ones. However, the
latter would be placed under tight scrutiny as to how such monies are
disbursed.
It remains to be seen how quickly Mr Berlusconi wishes to move down this
path and where he will delineate the bounds of federalism. The neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance is uncomfortable about the League's federalist
impulses and will endorse no measure that weakens the unitary state of
Italy. The League itself has allies outside government, notably in the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), which favours greater
devolution - not least because this would permit greater autonomy in the
'red belt' of Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, parts of Liguria and northern
Lazio.
The government also has its eye on reforming the legislature. It is
increasingly absurd to see the two houses duplicate their powers as well as
their activities in debates and commissions. The attributes of the two
houses need to be more complementary. Forza Italia's electoral programme
proposed to transform the senate into more of a consultative and monitoring
body, elected indirectly by regional councils, representatives of the
provinces and municipalities. At the same time, the party pledged to
increase the legislative authority of the lower house.
Another proposal oft repeated by Mr Berlusconi is to introduce a directly
elected president and reduce his/her term from seven to five years. The
president's limited powers would not be increased, rather he or she would
have increased moral authority from a popular election. In contrast, Mr
Berlusconi wants to increase the powers of the prime minister as the chief
executive.
In all these various proposals, there is a clear move away from the former
system that encouraged compromise and horse-trading to greater efficiency
and transparency. But the inefficiencies of the old way of doing things were
the result of a desire to provide checks and balances, and to avoid the
concentration of too much power in one person's hands. There is now a danger
of swinging the other way, with insufficient attention paid to providing
checks and balances.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (3): Deficit needs tackling - Robert Graham
on a recovery still in its early stages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian economy is in the early stages of an export-led recovery which
is expected to gather momentum in the second half of the year.
But domestic demand remains weak and much here depends on the government's
economic management. The new administration has begun by seeking to
encourage investment with tax breaks and to kick-start activity by
unfreezing a large stock of public works contracts put on hold as a result
of the corruption scandals of the past two years.
In contrast, it has been much slower in formulating policies to tackle the
budget deficit and the huge mountain of Italian debt, now equivalent to
almost 120 per cent of GDP. However, the speed and success of the domestic
recovery will be conditioned by the continuing need to hold down public
spending and reduce the budget deficit, which is still over 10 per cent of
GDP.
Also central to the management of the recovery will be tight control over
inflation and a continuing wage constraint. Inflation is now below 4 per
cent on an annualised basis but is still marginally above projected levels.
All these factors will affect the market's confidence in policy and by the
same token the level of interest rates. Italy's real interest rates remain
high and Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, insists there is
scope for a further percentage point drop despite uncertainties in the
international financial markets.
The economy began to pull out of the two-year-old recession in the final
quarter of 1993. The growth trend, albeit modest, is now firmly established
and should be around 1.5 per cent by the end of 1994 (against -0.7 per cent
in 1993), rising to an annualised 2.5 per cent by 1995.
Domestic demand is projected to grow 0.3 per cent this year, rising to 1.5
per cent in 1995. However, the impact of external demand on the recovery
should be more favourable than envisaged last autumn when the annual
macroeconomic figures were prepared. World demand is expected to rise over 6
per cent, almost double the previous year.
Italy has been increasing its share of world trade since the 1992 lira
devaluation and in 1993 exports grew a remarkable 8.5 per cent in volume
terms. This performance was largely responsible for a dramatic improvement
in the balance of payments. Last year the current account swung from a
deficit of L34,200bn to a L17,900bn surplus - the best result since 1975.
The export drive continues, especially in emerging markets and the US. In
the first quarter sales to Asia were up 53 per cent in value on the same
period last year. Exports are due to increase 7 per cent in volume and 11
per cent in value this year.
The January-February trade balance of L3,300bn was double that in the same
period of 1993; but the annual surplus may not remain so large. Imports are
expected to increase towards the year-end as the recovery strengthens, up by
8 per cent in value terms during the year. The upwards trend in commodity
prices (oil being especially important for energy-dependent Italy) could
further raise the cost of imports.
Industry still has spare capacity to meet export orders and accommodate the
gradual pick-up in domestic demand. Utilisation of industrial capacity is so
far up one percentage point to 74 per cent this year with growing evidence
of selective rebuilding of stocks. The latest business opinion surveys
reflect a return of manufacturers' confidence, while Fiat, having sustained
heavy losses in 1993, is beginning to see higher sales of cars and trucks.
But the overriding sentiment is caution after an abrupt 5 per cent fall in
domestic demand last year. The construction business and heavy industry were
especially hit, with the automotive sector making large-scale lay-offs.
Investment in machine tools, machinery and transport equipment dropped over
15 per cent.
Despite the beginnings of a recovery, unemployment still continues to rise
and is now over 11.3 per cent of the active population. Since 1991 1.2m jobs
have been lost. The real figure is far higher because of the Italian
practice of resorting to temporary lay-offs that can stretch over two years
and more. Last year the number of hours covered by temporary lay-off
payments increased 23 per cent.
Unemployment is also concealed by the use of early retirement, which is an
extensive factor in the restructuring of the automotive industry, steel,
defence industries, chemicals, shipbuilding and the railways. It is worth
stressing the uneven geographical picture of unemployment. In the industrial
north, unemployment is on average below 7 per cent while in the south, where
the public sector economy is still in recession, the level is 20 per cent
and more in some places.
The jobs crisis has forced the unions to place employment above wage
demands. This, coupled with an increased productivity drive, has helped to
hold down wages and production costs. Since 1992 wages in most sectors have
fallen in real terms. Last year average wages increased 3.1 per cent, a good
percentage point below inflation. Meanwhile, unit labour costs increased
only 2.5 per cent. Wage restraint was particularly important among the 3.6m
employees in the public sector and the resumption of talks with the
government on pay increases in the autumn will be watched with great
interest.
The government will try to hold down public sector wages as part of its
efforts to control the public sector deficit. The deficit itself looks set
to overshoot the 1994 budget projections of L144,000bn and reach L160,000bn,
over 10 per cent of GDP. This is due to lower receipts as a result of the
recession carried through from the previous year, plus the increased cost of
social security benefits, particularly pensions. These developments will
probably halve the projected size of the primary surplus (the balance of
revenues and receipts less interest payments) to around L12,000bn.
But the public accounts have been further complicated by a June decision of
the constitutional court, ordering the government to pay arrears on certain
types of pensions dating back to 1983. The cost of the decision has been put
at L32,000bn - the size of the spending cuts and extra revenue measures in
the 1994 budget. Payment can only be delayed until 1995 and at present it
looks as though the monies will have to be covered by a special tax.
As it is, the government will probably introduce a pre-summer mini-budget of
L5,000bn to hold the deficit to below L160,000bn. At the same time, a
further L35,000bn to L40,000bn will have to be found in 1995 just to keep
the deficit at around 9.5 per cent of GDP, which is well above the EU
average.
The government has little room for manoeuvre while the debt stock remains so
high. Annual debt service is equivalent to the entire deficit; and every
percentage point fluctuation in interest rates either adds or subtracts
L15,000bn from the servicing bill. In the 12 months to March 1994, the debt
stock increased 9 per cent. The total volume of debt is now expected to
stabilise in 1995-96 at a maximum of 123-125 per cent of GDP.
Unless the new government takes decisive action to curb spending, little
will be achieved. The prime target will be cuts in generous state pension
benefits.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (2): Focus is turned on smaller businesses -
Andrew Hill looks at the politicians' promises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Italy's myriad small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs in the current
Euro-jargon) had received L1,000 for every political promise or piece of
praise received over the last six months, they would have amassed quite a
tidy sum by now.
Candidates from right and left in Italy's March general election - many of
whom were themselves small-scale entrepreneurs - held out promises of
assistance to the SMEs and lauded smaller businesses as the backbone of the
Italian economy.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, now prime minister, and his supporters bandied around
back-of-envelope figures suggesting that if one in four of Italy's small
businesses were to employ just one extra person, his party's ambitious
target of 1m new jobs could be met. Even President Bill Clinton, at the
Detroit jobs summit this spring, alluded to the innovative drive of north
Italian small business as an example for the world economy.
This emphasis on SMEs is nothing new. Indeed, Mr Berlusconi's focus on
smaller businesses as a potential source of jobs echoes ideas already
broached by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, in the
white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, launched last year.
But the theme has a particular relevance to Italy because of the importance
of small businesses in the economy. Based on 1991 census figures,
Confindustria - the Italian employers' federation - estimates that
businesses with turnover of less than L10bn represent 86 per cent of all
industrial companies in Italy, while those with sales of over L100bn account
for less than 1 per cent. Some 39 per cent of Italian companies have fewer
than 100 employees, compared with 24.9 per cent in France, or 21.1 per cent
in the UK.
As Confindustria's research unit pointed out in a recent report on SMEs*,
the development of Italy's smaller businesses would benefit the whole
economy, because they are sources of innovation and generally employ younger
workers than larger companies.
In the 1970s, Italy's small business sector grew far more quickly than
larger enterprises: the number of companies employing between 10 and 19
people, for example, increased by more than 70 per cent between 1971 and
1981, as did the number of people employed by such companies. But in the
1980s, growth stagnated. The number of businesses employing between 10 and
50 people grew slightly, but employment in larger companies slipped below
the 1971 level.
Small entrepreneurs lay much of the blame at the door of previous Italian
governments, which paid lip service to the promotion of SMEs, while bowing
to the demands of much larger companies (and, in some cases, gratefully
accepting illicit party funding from the same enterprises). This was the
period in which a vast bureaucracy was constructed, imposing a particular
burden on smaller companies.
Entrepreneurs estimate that about 200 different taxes and charges have to be
paid out by each individual business. The financial impact of this is bad
enough, but the administrative burden is also hard to bear. For example, Mr
Luigi Tessera Chiesa, managing director of Tepak, a small company making
padded envelopes near Turin, reckons that of his 38 employees, two or three
could switch to more productive work if they did not have to devote
themselves to tackling red tape.
As chairman of the small business unit of the Turin employers' federation,
he echoes the Confindustria call for less bureaucracy, fewer taxes and more
tax breaks, plus incentives for training, research and innovation.
Mr Tessera Chiesa approves of one step that the government has already taken
by cutting the taxation of reinvested profits for 1994 and 1995, a measure
which he says will particularly benefit SMEs. 'Large companies can't change
their investment strategy to take advantage of this two-year window, but
small and medium-sized companies can respond rapidly to the opportunities
offered,' he points out.
However, the bosses of SMEs are calling for further measures, in particular
those aimed at encouraging alternative means of financing business growth.
At the moment, for example, small companies rely on bank financing. That
means that at a certain point further expansion is hampered, because
entrepreneurs do not want to add to debt already accumulated at higher than
average rates. 'Many companies refuse to invest because they are afraid that
if they overinvest, the company will be put into the hands of the banks,'
says Mr Giuseppe De Carolis, head of corporate finance with Price Waterhouse
in Italy.
'Credit institutions tend to overestimate the riskiness of granting credit
to a small company,' adds the Confindustria report. 'In a number of cases,
SMEs have financing costs which are too high relative to their credit risk,
which indicates a failure of the market.'
Small companies hope that continued reform of the banking system will help
ease the situation. They are also backing the establishment of a second
nationwide stock market which would allow smaller companies to finance
themselves through equity issues, and stimulate the emergence of a new layer
of Italian venture capitalists and small merchant banks prepared to back
SMEs at realistic rates of interest. Competition from the stock market,
entrepreneurs believe, would also put pressure on traditional banks to
reduce their charges.
The snag may be persuading owners of family businesses to give up some of
their hard-earned shares. Mr De Carolis believes it will require strong
incentives to persuade small family companies to seek a stock market
listing. The government, Confindustria, local chambers of commerce and the
stock market authorities are all working on formal proposals which should be
tabled in the next few months.
By then, it should be possible to assess whether the governing parties'
campaign promises can and will be fulfilled. Meanwhile, Mr Tessera Chiesa
and his counterparts around the country have a further simple request:
'We're also hoping that the new government does another thing that few
governments in the past have known how to do, and that is govern,' he says.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oceans set to yield up their
treasures - Canute James reports on the agreement of an international code
of conduct for seabed mining after 11 years of negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 11 years of tortuous and often contentious negotiations, agreement has
been reached on a code of conduct for mining the international seabed.
The agreement, which hinged on convincing industrialised countries that
commercial principles would be observed, is to be be adopted by the United
Nations general assembly this month. It will allow the establishment of the
International Seabed Authority, a new UN agency, which will administer the
Law of the Sea Convention, and will create the Enterprise, the authority's
commercial arm, which will oversee exploration and mining through joint
ventures among private companies and states.
The agreement will also create a tribunal that will adjudicate disputes over
seabed mining among states and companies.
The authority and the Enterprise will be located in Jamaica, while the
tribunal will be in Hamburg, Germany.
At the centre of the debates in the UN Law of the Sea Conference, which
sought general acceptance of the convention are the trillions of dollars
worth of polymetallic nodules that are lying on the international seabed,
outside the 200-mile economic zone of any country. The nodules contain
copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, and varying quantities of other
minerals.
'The intention was to find an orderly method of dealing with minerals
located on the international seabed,' says Mr Kenneth Rattray, rapporteur
general of the Law of the Sea Conference.
'Since these minerals are outside the economic zones of states, it was
important to have an acceptance by all countries that the minerals did not
belong to any one state or private company, but were the common heritage of
all mankind.
'This is an attempt to avert anarchy in mining the international seabed and
to permit orderly exploration and exploitation within a regulatory
framework.'
While developing countries have always been in favour of a convention to
regulate the mining of the international seabed, the discussions were
protracted because of reservations that industrialised states had about the
commercial feasibility of the proposals, and about the sharing of costs and
benefits. In its original form the Law of the Sea Convention was not clear
on the role private business would play in seabed mining, and on how the
technology would be obtained.
Fundamental changes in the world economy, the move by governments away from
central planning to market-based economies and the growing role for private
business, all precluded the creation of an economic agency in which only
governments would be involved.
Under the draft of the convention, the Enterprise was to have been funded by
the member states based on subscriptions and loans, with the first mining
venture estimated to cost about USDollars 1bn. 'Philosophical and economic
arguments indicated that this was not the most desired method, so it was
agreed that the first operation of the enterprise will be done as a joint
venture with the partners providing the investment, on the now accepted
basis that the international seabed is the common heritage of mankind,'
explains Mr Rattray.
'The enterprise is the only way for poorer countries to participate. Some
developed states wanted the Enterprise to be abolished, but it was agreed
that after its first venture the Enterprise will begin operating on a purely
commercial basis.'
There were also concerns among the industrialised states about the transfer
of technology. Since private business, and not governments, own the
technology, members of the UN were unable to get access to it. In the
accord, it has been accepted that if the technology is not available on the
market at commercially fair terms, governments would co-operate with the
International Seabed Authority to make it available. 'This is intended to
give the Enterprise a jump start,' says Mr Rattray.
One of the more fundamental concerns about seabed mining, and in which both
developed and developing countries had common concerns, was the effect the
extraction of the polymetalic nodules and production of the minerals would
have on land-based producers.
While most states eschewed production ceilings, saying this method was an
echo of central planning, land-based producers argued that there could be
unfair economic practices in seabed mining, which could lead to a flooding
of markets and depressed prices. There will be no production limits, but the
principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on unfair
competition have been adopted in the Law of the Sea Convention.
Production plans will include an estimate of the maximum quantity of
minerals to be produced each year and there will be a compensation fund for
land-based producers who are adversely affected by seabed mining.
'The original expectation when the conference began 11 years ago was that
seabed mining would have started by 1998,' says Mr Rattray. 'This was not
achieved because of real and philosophical changes in the world economy.
With this agreement, commercial production from the seabed is now expected
to begin in another 10 years.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany plans second banana
quota challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German economics minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt said yesterday that Germany
would launch a second European Court case over new European Union banana
import quotas, which it claims unfairly disadvantage its traditional Latin
American suppliers, reports Reuters from Bonn.
'(The German government) will ask the European Court to review the legality
of the new export quota regime,' a statement from Mr Rexrodt's ministry
said.
'I stick to my view that the export quota agreement infringes aspects of EU
and Gatt law,' Mr Rexrodt added.
The court's Advocate General has already recommended in an official opinion
rejection of a German case already running. The final judgment on that first
case is due on October 6.
A ministry official said the second case would contend that the quota
decision was invalid because it had not been brought before the EU's Council
of Ministers.
Germany says that the EU banana import rules, which came into force last
July, are biased in favour of former EU colonies in the African, Caribbean
and Pacific group.
The rules allocate a 30 per cent share of the EU market to ACP producers and
limit imports from Latin America, often called 'dollar bananas' because many
of the plantations are owned by US companies.
Germany claims the regulations give British and French importers with
traditional links to ACP countries an unfair advantage. It says they have
prompted a big rise in the price of bananas in Germany, causing sales to
drop by 25 per cent.
Mr Rexrodt said jobs in German ports and in the producer countries were
being endangered by the quota system.
'The absurdity of the regime can be seen in the fact that a support system
for ACP bananas has been passed to counter the sealing-off of the EU market,
which has already taken place,' he said. He added that it was doubtful that
ACP producers were even in a position to fulfil their quotas.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices end lower
after see-sawing day - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metal markets finished a day of see-saw movements largely lower at the
London Metal Exchange as prices responded to short-term speculative
influences.
But traders said markets such as COPPER and ALUMINIUM retained a sound
undertone and were ready to retest the upside resistance at which their
recent rallies had stalled.
London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures finished near the day's
highs on the back of renewed talk about possible frosts in Brazil this
weekend. But COCOA prices, which notched up good gains during the morning
session, succumbed later to technically-inspired selling. 'There are a few
bears out there,' said one trader. 'When cocoa was knocked by selling
pressure, the support turned out to be pretty weak.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RSPCA puts its mark on
humanely-produced food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals launched
its 'Freedom Food' label yesterday, which it hopes will encourage farmers to
improve standards of animal welfare. The mark will be applied to eggs and
pork where animals have been reared and treated according to guidelines laid
down by the charity.
The RSPCA hailed the initiative as 'allowing farm animals to take the first
step back from the factory to the farm'. But the standards adopted were
criticised by other animal welfare groups as being too lax.
For example, the RSPCA does not specify that eggs must come only from
free-range chickens, but that barn eggs are acceptable as long as the birds
have enough space.
Mr Mike Sharpe of Freedom Food argued that the guidelines were based on five
years of research into welfare issues and adapted in a way that farmers
would stick to. The organisation draws up a plan for each participating
farm, tailoring the guidelines to each individual situation.
'It's the beginning of a revolution in farming practice by linking the good,
caring farmer directly to the consumer,' said Mr Sharpe. So far he has
signed up 200 large producers with Tesco and the Co-op agreeing to stock the
produce.
Freedom Food will conduct yearly inspections of the registered farmers as
well as random checks to ensure that standards are being met.
The RSPCA maintains that consumers are prepared to pay a premium for food
that they know comes from well-treated animals. It hopes to extend the
scheme to beef, lamb and dairy products later in the year.
Mr Mike Baxter, an animal welfare expert from Brunel university said:
'Freedom Food's standards are the most comprehensive in existence and most
rigorously derived from scientific experience'.

gold market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian Government has formally established a domestic gold market
through an executive resolution, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported
yesterday.
Officials from the State Committee of Precious Metals were caught unaware
that gold and silver would soon be freely traded in Russia. A government
press officer confirmed the existence of the resolution, but said that it
had not yet been distributed to relevant authorities.
According to the resolution, the new market will be highly controlled; only
a limited number of banks, specially licensed by the central bank, will be
permitted to trade a small sliver of Russia's newly minted gold. Most of
Russia's freshly produced gold will still be governed by the old state order
system and go directly from mining enterprises to the State Committee of
Precious Metals for Russia's gold reserve.
It was not clear when the new market would open or what kind of quality
guarantees would cover the gold bars being traded.
Nevertheless, Russian observers saw the plan as a positive step toward
establishing 'a civilised market for gold and other precious metals', where
none had existed, and 'stimulating foreign investment'.
They said they believed the maintenance of a high level of state control was
necessary to build up Russia's gold reserves, which have been run down over
recent years, to prove the countries credit worthiness to the West.
In the newly established market, the licensed banks will act as
intermediaries between the real buyers and sellers, from jewellers and
industrial buyers to speculators and investors.

Key rubber producing and consuming states will meet in Kuala Lumpur next
week to try to break a deadlock over a new price-stabilisation pact,
delegates to the meeting said, reports Reuter from Singapore.
The rift over pricing blocked efforts to renegotiate the International
Natural Rubber Agreement at the last UN-sponsored talks in Geneva in April.
Delegates said a high-level working group including the top three Asian
producers would meet informally from July 12 to 14 ahead of another round of
talks in Geneva. The group comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the
top three consumers - Japan, the European Union and the US.
The dispute centres on the reference price, which guides market
interventions by the buffer stock manager of the International Natural
Rubber Organisation. Consumers want it held at or near the level at the end
of the current accord. Producers want it raised, but have not said by how
much.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as FOMC leaves policy
unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped lower in light trading yesterday as
traders and investors remained on the sidelines following the conclusion of
the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
3/16 at to 84 3/16 , yielding 7.600 per cent. However, the two-year note was
up  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.084 per cent.
Prices at the long end declined from the start in the wake of a modest
weakening in the dollar during early trading. The dollar fell because the
perception on Wall Street overnight was that the FOMC would not vote at its
meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency.
Analysts said the Fed realised it would send the wrong signal to financial
markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators, who have been
selling the dollar, to dictate the direction of monetary policy.
Once the meeting ended without an announcement, it was judged the FOMC had
decided to leave policy unchanged, at least until more is known about the
state of the economy. The next set of important data is due tomorrow when
the June employment report is published. Traders said nervousness ahead of
the jobs figures explained why longer-dated prices were stuck in negative
territory and trading remained subdued.
European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing
the FOMC meeting and currency volatility.
German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on
short-covering in the futures market.
Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC
meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data
and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples.
Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's
minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93 per cent and the downward
revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4 per cent, from
a provisional 13.7 per cent.
Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5
per cent discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again
with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said
one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4 per cent to 6 per
cent.
UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors
eyed the FOMC meeting.
Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported
sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against
sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform
Germany.
French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of
today's auction of FFr19bn-FFr21bn in medium- and long-dated bonds. Weakness
in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of
France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move
today.
Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency
weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year.
After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected,
many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday.
'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields
were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who
were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko,
international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the
nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73 per cent, a rise of
20 basis points from Tuesday.
Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty
and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher.
The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11 per cent.
In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene's government, and recent nervousness over the budget
outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Voluntary code on derivatives
sought by SEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is hoping that a voluntary
agreement among the big Wall Street firms to accept closer regulation of
their derivatives activities will head off Congress' attempts to seek
tougher regulation of the Dollars 1,000bn derivatives market.
The SEC, the US financial markets watchdog, said yesterday that it had been
in talks with the six biggest derivatives dealers on Wall Street - CS First
Boston, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and
Morgan Stanley - about voluntary standards for several areas of the
business.
The SEC hopes the firms will reveal more about the extent and nature of
their derivatives business, and the amount of capital they have to support
their derivatives trades.
The agency wants to know more about the dealers' derivatives clients. It has
become increasingly concerned about Wall Street selling derivatives products
to companies or financial institutions which do not inform investors or
shareholders of their activities. The SEC has told the country's
money-market funds - which are sold as highly conservative, secure forms of
investment - to stop using complex, risky derivative products.
The SEC believes if the dealers accept voluntary oversight, legislators in
Washington will be dissuaded from passing new laws requiring the agency to
regulate the derivatives activities of securities firms, and insurance
companies.
The derivatives activities of banks are subject to formal regulation, but
Wall Street firms operate through separately capitalised subsidiaries out of
reach from regulation.
Congress is sufficiently concerned about this to propose legislative reform.
This week, congressman Edward Markey, chairman of the House subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance, said legislation was needed to 'close the
regulatory black hole which allows derivatives dealers affiliated with
securities or insurance firms to largely escape any federal regulation'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of re-awakened
eurolira sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a lull due to the volatility of the Italian government bond market,
three borrowers took advantage of renewed interest in the eurolira market
and attractive swap opportunities to launch L700bn-worth of issues
yesterday.
Dealers said swap opportunities had been available for a week or more, as
the gap between the secondary eurolira bond market and the lira swaps market
widened, allowing deals to be priced with double-digit coupons.
The growing yield differential between German and Italian bonds and the
perceived weakness of the lira then started to attract retail investors and
portfolio managers back to the eurolira market, in spite of continuing
nervousness about the Italian government bond market.
Austria's Osterreichische Kontrollbank launched the first of the three
five-year issues, a L200bn offering of 10 per cent bonds arranged by Swiss
Bank Corporation, followed by a L200bn deal with a 10 1/4 per cent coupon
for Deutsche Bank.
The third deal off the blocks was a L300bn offering for Commerzbank,
arranged by IMI Bank.
The issue made up for its late arrival and slightly lower rating (the other
two are both rated triple-A) with a 10 1/2 per cent coupon.
In spite of concern that the heavy flow of paper would quickly exhaust
interest, dealers reported demand from Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux
region. The concentration on the five-year area, where the best swap rates
were available, suited retail investors.
Two large yen offerings for the Province of British Colombia, which launched
three small deals in the sector on Tuesday, and the Kingdom of Sweden were
driven by strong demand for yen assets from Japanese investors. Japanese
institutions had been selling US bonds due to currency concerns and were
cash-rich, dealers said.
The 4 per cent coupon on British Colombia's five-year issue via Daiwa and
the 3.10 per cent coupon on Sweden's short-dated deal arranged by IBJ proved
attractive, according to traders, as Japanese investors such as insurance
companies are interested in coupon rather than yield spread levels.
In the D-Mark sector, the triple-A rated City of Paris launched its first
foreign currency bond offering, a DM130m five-year deal arranged by Banque
Paribas. Decentralisation has allowed French municipalities greater freedom
to diversify their funding, which traditionally has mainly come from the
French agency, Credit Local de France.
The deal was targeted at retail investors in Germany, Switzerland and the
Benelux region.
In the dollar market, Essar Gujarat, the Indian steel company, launched the
first floating-rate note by a private-sector Indian company. The deal was
broadly placed with institutions according to lead manager Chase Investment
Bank.

CS First Boston, the merchant banking arm of CS Holdings, plans to scrap its
Dutch equity operations in Amsterdam and move them to London within the next
few months, writes Conner Middelmann.
Mr Xavier Rolet, managing director of European equities at CS First Boston
in London, said that by concentrating equity operations in London, 'we want
to regroup our strength, develop our pan-European business and increase our
placing power among institutional and corporate clients.' The cost of
running the operation was a factor, although it was not decisive, he said.
CS First Boston is holding talks with the Amsterdam stock exchange 'to see
under what conditions we can continue as foreign-based members or in some
form of association,' Mr Rolet said. 'They have been fairly receptive.'

Mr McKeever, 50, comes from Amax, the US metals and energy group, where he

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Japan Tobacco are to be offered next month ahead of the the
state-owned group's listing on the Tokyo stock exchange in late October,
Japan's ministry of finance announced yesterday.
The decision follows a two-year delay in the share offering due to the
sluggish Tokyo stock market. The stock exchange listing comes a year after
that of East Japan Railway, when demand was so great that the TSE's computer
system came to a standstill for a while.
The success of JT's listing is crucial to the share offerings of other
state-owned companies waiting to be privatised, including the railway
operators splintered from the former Japan National Railway.
The government will release 666,666 shares, or one-third of the outstanding
2m shares. Of this, 230,000 will be auctioned publicly in August. The rest
will be sold at a price based on that auction.
The finance ministry has approved the entry of two US firms, Canter
Fitzgerald Securities and Garban, to operate as inter-dealer brokerages for
Japanese government bonds.
Japan's 'broker's broker' operations are dominated by two Japanese
companies, Japan Bond Trading and Nakadachi Securities. The US firms will be
the first foreign operators to move into the market.
The move is a response to US demands for more open financial markets. The US
firms have undertaken inter-dealer transactions in US government bonds in
Japan since 1988.

<TEXT>
Mazda, the loss-making Japanese carmaker, plans to cut manufacturing costs
by 10 per cent this year, and reduce over the medium term the number of
models it makes.
The group, which in 1993 incurred its first loss in 19 years, would be in
the red again this year, said Mr Henry Wallace, a former Ford executive
recently appointed vice-president of Mazda, which is a 24.5 per cent-owned
Ford affiliate. However, he forecast Mazda would return to profit in the
following 12 months.
Mr Wallace is one of the three senior Ford executives who joined Mazda early
this year - through an agreement between the companies - to expand their
25-year-old partnership and help Mazda adjust to the slowdown in its main
markets.
Since the start of the year, Mazda has nearly doubled the size of its design
engineering team. It seeks cost-savings through the redesign of components,
and has secured 10 per cent price cuts from component suppliers.
This is on top of restructuring plans to close a plant and and reducing the
workforce by 3,000, 10 per cent of the total, during the three years to
1996. The group was also planning to rationalise its product line, where it
had 'too many products we can't support for the future', said Mr Wallace.

This is much higher than the ADollars 10.40-a-share cash alternative being
offered by the bidder, which holds a 48.1 per cent interest in its target.
Bunnings said its advisers had put the value of Wesfarmers' paper
alternative at between ADollars 9.96 and ADollars 10.46 a share, and again
urged shareholders to reject the terms.
'The conclusions of the independent expert support the committee's opinion
that the current offer price is inadequate,' Bunnings said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Banks offer lesson in
regulation - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of how best to police derivatives markets has been exercising the
minds of regulators, bankers and end-users for several years. The usual
regulatory approach has been to apply existing standards to the derivatives
markets.
In a paper published yesterday by the Centre for the Study of Financial
Innovation, Mr Charles Taylor, executive director of the Washington-based
think-tank Group of Thirty, turns that approach on its head. He argues that
not only have regulators got it wrong, but that derivatives specialists at
banks have largely got it right. In fact, he says, the model-based approach
to market risk management adopted by derivatives specialists should be
extended not only to other areas of securities trading, but also to credit
risk and other types of risk.
'The central idea is that the amount of capital a bank needs is related to
the riskiness of its business, measured by the volatility of its income,'
says Mr Taylor. Unlike the traditional approach of assessing credit
exposure, this involves predicting future volatility using historical models
and marking to market.
There are four steps:
regulators need to set risk parameters, such as the scope of historical
data;
they must validate the computer models used by banks;
banks must estimate the overall 'value-at-risk';
finally, the regulator has to apply a 'conservatism factor' to the resulting
estimates, in order to calculate the capital adequacy standard.
The ideas in Mr Taylor's paper, 'A new approach to capital adequacy
regulation for banks', stem partly from discussions with market
practitioners when putting together the Group of Thirty's guidelines on best
practice in the derivatives market.
'Our discussions led me to think that it might be possible to apply concepts
used there, like value-at-risk and statistical measures of income
volatility, to the wider problem of setting capital adequacy standards. Then
I learnt that this idea was nothing but 'best practice' in capital
allocation,' Mr Taylor explains.
As well as setting out how this could be done by regulators, Mr Taylor
criticises the existing approach, embodied in the 1988 Basle Accord, and the
market risk amendment, which he describes as 'rough and ready'.
However, Mr Taylor, who has discussed his ideas with both regulators and
bankers, is surprisingly optimistic about the prospect of regulators taking
up what is effectively a reversal of their traditional approach to
regulation.
Certainly, the Basle committee has delayed implementing its market risk
amendment due to the strong adverse reaction by banks.
Originally, the comment period was to end in December 1993, for a decision
in early 1994, followed by implementation. Mr Taylor says he expects
regulators to allow greater use of models in calculating market risk than is
indicated in the original consultative paper.
There are a number of points in Mr Taylor's favour. First, applying rules
which already correlate with internal risk management is clearly a more
efficient approach. Secondly, regulators' own understanding has advanced in
leaps and bounds in recent years. They may now be ready to apply some of the
lessons learnt to other areas of regulation.
However, there are also problems. The computer models used are extremely
complex and, to police the system effectively, regulators would need to
employ highly-skilled staff. Such staff, as well as being expensive, might
quickly be tempted to move to banks.
Mr Taylor thinks this problem can be overcome. 'Regulators are taking a lot
of time and trouble to train people,' he argues. In addition, he believes
that as the derivatives markets continue to expand, the pool of experts in
the field will grow.
To some degree, the same problem exists among smaller banks and institutions
on the fringes of the market - although, arguably, market participants who
are not sophisticated enough to implement this type of risk management
should not be involved in the market.
Secondly, many of the blow-ups in the derivatives markets have taken place
not because of inherent risks, but because traders have deliberately
misreported or falsified positions. A system relying on traders marking to
market would have to be very closely policed.

However, Mazda's production capacity was now 'pretty much OK', he said. The
group could break even by next year, even if the Japanese currency rose to
Y95 to the dollar, and make a 'significant profit' at Y100 to the dollar, he
said. Mazda had prepared 'contingency plans' to become profitable if the
rate rose above Y95.
Mr Wallace hoped that talks with Ford on possible European co-operation
would be finalised in the next 12 months. The next step in the alliance has
been the subject of renewed speculation since Ford's decision in April to
create worldwide divisions for different classes of car.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thrifts in plan for Dollars
1.1bn merger
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two largest thrifts in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region -
Dime Bancorp and Anchor Bancorp - yesterday announced plans for a Dollars
1.1bn stock-swap merger, the biggest move yet in the consolidation of the
New York area thrift business.
The merger will form the fourth-largest publicly traded thrift in the US,
with total assets of about Dollars 20bn and deposits of nearly Dollars 13bn.
Investors in Anchor will receive 1.77 shares of Dime stock for each of their
shares, valuing Anchor at around Dollars 1bn on the basis of yesterday's
Dime share price, which dipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 . Anchor fell
 7/16 to Dollars 15 1/2 .
The US thrift industry - which has traditionally obtained most of its
deposits from consumer savings and supplied loans to the residential
mortgage market - is facing growing competition for loan business.
Dime, with headquarters in New York City, had Dollars 5.9bn in deposits and
Dollars 9.4bn in assets at the end of the first quarter and operates 34 full
service branches in the metropolis.
Anchor, which has its headquarters in Nassau County, on Long Island, had
Dollars 6.9bn in deposits and Dollars 10.3bn in assets at the end of March.
It operates 51 full service branches in New York, New Jersey and Florida.
Both thrifts have recovered from losses in the property downturn of the late
1980s and early 1990s and the merged entity is expected to be classified as
'well capitalised' under regulatory guidelines.
Mr Richard Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp, will have
the same roles at the new holding company, while Mr James Large, chairman
and chief executive of Anchor, will head Dime Savings Bank.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Future will test wisdom of
miner's gamble - Nikki Tait assesses Western Mining's ADollars 1bn link with
Alcoa's bauxite/alumina business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior mining analyst was in a dither yesterday following Australia's
Western Mining Corporation's decision to buy into Alcoa's international
bauxite/alumina-related operations at an effective cost of about ADollars
1bn (USDollars 700m). 'I'm trying to decide whether we're positive or
negative about this deal.
'There's a list of pluses, and a list of minuses,' he said.
Not surprisingly, WMC, one of the nation's largest mining companies, is
altogether less equivocal. It says that the deal, announced yesterday, is an
important step towards moving WMC from being a predominantly Australian
company, to becoming more of a 'global player'.
It will also enable the company to expand and to diversify a core business
and partly shift it from raw commodity production towards proprietary
products. It will also allow WMC to expand with a US partner it knows well.
The last element is incontrovertible. In the 1950s, several Australian
companies - including WMC - realised that bauxite deposits in the Darling
Range in Western Australia could form the basis of an integrated aluminium
business. Alcoa, the US company, was brought in to provide industrial
expertise and, in 1961, Alcoa of Australia was formed.
WMC has over the years bought out its fellow Australian partners, so that
its current interest in Alcoa of Australia stands at 48.25 per cent. Alcoa,
the US parent, holds 51 per cent.
It has been a successful venture. Alcoa of Australia has become the world's
largest alumina producer and - in spite of oversupply in the world aluminium
industry - made an after-tax profit (before abnormals) of ADollars 389.4m
last year; an increase of ADollars 130.5m over the previous period. Sales
were ADollars 2.19bn.
These results, assisted by a decision to extend the Wagerup Refinery,
largely explained a sharp increase in WMC's own profits during the six
months to end-December, the first half of its financial year.
The latest proposal is that WMC and Alcoa should put all their international
bauxite, alumina, and alumina-based chemicals interests into one
'enterprise,' and share them on a 40:60 basis respectively.
The amalgam of businesses, made up of Alcoa of Australia and Alcoa's other
international bauxite/alumina-based interests, would account for about 25
per cent of the world's alumina production and have total sales of about
USDollars 2.7bn.
To effect the deal, WMC would buy into Alcoa's other bauxite/alumina-related
interests. The 'ballpark' cost, according to Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing
director, would be about ADollars 1bn, but this would not just comprise
cash.
WMC would pass about 9 per cent of Alcoa of Australia to Alcoa of the US,
reducing its own interest to 39.25 per cent. It would then pay a further
USDollars 360m to the US group.
WMC would also expect to contribute about USDollars 120m of working capital,
on a short-term basis, to the new group. The deal would be completed by the
end of 1994.
Although WMC's balance sheet is modestly geared, the mining company plans to
raise ADollars 720m to help fund the transaction. That will be done via a
one-for-eight rights issue at ADollars 5.80 a share.
The problem for some analysts yesterday was that WMC proposes to give up 9
per cent of an established low-cost producer for a larger, 40 per cent
interest in operations which, on historical data, appear to be lower quality
(in terms of return on shareholder funds, for example). Alcoa's
bauxite/alumina-related interests are numerous, but include:
the Point Comfort alumina refinery in Texas;
55 per cent of the Suriname alumina refinery, plus a Suriname smelter and
hydroelectric facility;
50 per cent of a Jamaican alumina refinery;
55 per cent of a refinery in Brazil;
Alcoa Steamships;
Alcoa's alumina-based chemicals division, which comprises 20 plants
worldwide and had revenues last year of USDollars 500m.
According to figures provided to WMC by Alcoa, these operations saw revenues
peak at USDollars 2.32bn in 1990, falling to USDollars 1.16bn in 1993.
Earnings before interest and tax went from USDollars 527m in 1990, to
USDollars 81m in 1992, and then edged up to USDollars 88m last year.
'But that's the historic view,' admits Mr Chris Bain, senior research
manager for resources at ANZ McCaughan. 'Everything depends on the growth
outlook for the Alcoa businesses. You could argue that WMC is getting in on
the ground-floor of the alumina-chemicals business. It's just hard to know
what the prospects are.'
WMC admits the deal is dilutive at current alumina prices. In terms of 1993
earnings, the loss of 9 per cent of Alcoa of Australia's profits - which
works out at USDollars 35m - would be exactly offset by the contribution of
40 per cent of the acquired businesses' earnings. However, the rights issue
means that once the deal is completed there will be more WMC shares in
issue.
Confronted by these analysts' anxieties, Mr Morgan points out that it is the
future which matters. The deal will give the company more leverage in the
alumina market, increasing its share of production capacity by one third to
3.9m tonnes per annum or 10 per cent of world production.
The entry into alumina-based chemicals is 'an important element' of the
transaction. 'It's a business with high growth rate, high margins,' he says.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Labatt and Femsa in N America
beer tie-up
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, has joined Femsa,
Mexico's biggest beverage company, in a North American beer alliance.
It will give Labatt access to the fast-growing Mexican beer market, while
providing Femsa with marketing and technical expertise to shore up recent
erosion of its market share.
Labatt will initially pay USDollars 510m for a 22 per cent stake in
Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc-Moctezuma, Femsa's wholly-owned brewing arm. It will
have an option to acquire another 8 per cent over the next three years.
Femsa will retain a 51 per cent stake, and the remainder will be offered to
Mexican and international investors in a public offering.
Labatt will nominate five of Femsa Cerveza's 18 directors, while Mr Othon
Ruiz Montemayor, Femsa chief executive, will join Labatt's board. The deal
is expected to be finalised by the end of September.
Labatt is best known in the UK for its popular Rolling Rock beer and in
North America for its controlling stake in the Toronto Blue Jays baseball
team.
The two companies, which are of similar size, will also form a joint venture
in the US to distribute high-priced specialty beers, and plan a joint
assault on other Latin American markets.
They raised the possibility yesterday of either spinning off a minority
stake in the US company to the public or offering it to another foreign
brewer eager to expand in the huge US market.
The Labatt-Femsa partnership undercuts the 1992 acquisition by Philip
Morris, the US consumer goods group, of an 8 per cent equity stake in Femsa.
The investment was partly designed to lay a foundation for closer ties
between Femsa Cerveza and Miller Brewing, a wholly-owned Philip Morris
subsidiary.
Mr Ruiz said yesterday Femsa had considered an alliance with Miller, among
others, but that Labatt had proved to be the best fit. 'It's up to (Philip
Morris) to decide if they keep the shares, or sell the shares, or whatever,'
he said.
Femsa Cerveza, with projected 1994 sales of Dollars 1.56bn, has a 48 per
cent share of the Mexican beer market, down from more than 50 per cent a few
years ago.
Labatt's investment is by far the largest of any Canadian company in Mexico
since the implementation of the North American free trade agreement in
January 1994.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Trizec restructuring rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Junior debtholders of Trizec, the big North American property group,
yesterday voted against the company's CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.36bn)
financial restructuring plan.
Holders of 97 per cent of the CDollars 310m of junior debt outstanding were
represented at the Calgary meeting, and 66.7 per cent of those who voted
rejected the plan.
The rejection was widely expected since the junior debenture holders had
warned they would hold out for a richer settlement. Under the restructuring,
they were to get Trizec's shares plus CDollars 46m cash, but they argued
this was CDollars 25m short.
They may now appeal to an Alberta court to block the plan.
On Tuesday senior debtholders owed CDollars 1.2bn endorsed the
restructuring. They stand to get CDollars 917m cash plus Trizec shares.
Following the junior debtholders' vote they may go to court today to seek
permission to foreclose on their collateral.
Horsham, a holding company controlled by Toronto financier Mr Peter Munk,
and the US O'Connor property group would inject about CDollars 1bn cash into
Trizec and take 44 per cent and 24 per cent equity control respectively. Mr
Munk would be board chairman.
Trizec's preferred shareholders yesterday accepted the restructuring. Common
stockholders were voting later in the day.
Trizec has been operating under court protection since March 19 while the
restructuring was worked out and placed before debt and equity holders.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BZ Bank, the Zurich securities house controlled by Mr Martin Ebner, has
reported a 70 per cent slide in net income to SFr15.1m (Dollars 11m) for the
first half of 1994.
The decline was due mainly to write-downs on the value of securities,
reflecting the 7.4 per cent decline in the Swiss market during the period.
Write-offs and provisions jumped from SFr29.5m to SFr90.5m.
However, commission income doubled to SFr112.9m, indicating the bank's
ability to generate trading activity even in what it described as a 'rough
environment'.
Mr Ebner said trading activity had remained strong throughout the first half
until late June. The bank also gained commission income from substantial
new-issue activity and from a fast growing custody service.
At the end of June, it held SFr29bn worth of securities in custody, compared
with only SFr10bn at the end of 1992, he said.
Interest income at SFr13.1m exceeded interest charges of SFr10.9m for the
first time, reflecting the growth of short-term lending to clients for their
securities purchases.
Mr Ebner was optimistic about the second half, anticipating a recovery in
Swiss equity markets.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: ITT could take effective control
of Ciga next week
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, could take
effective control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, next week, in
spite of having a direct stake of only 17.4 per cent.
After Ciga's annual general meeting yesterday, the Italian company's
directors are to meet next Tuesday, when they are likely to agree a
reshuffle, allowing up to three ITT representatives on to the Ciga board.
But Italian fund managers made clear at the shareholder meeting that the US
company would not be able to ride roughshod over smaller investors'
interests.
Their strong stand could herald a new role for Italian funds, which have
mainly been passive investors in large Italian companies, unlike their
counterparts in the UK and US.
ITT built up its stake in Ciga, through its Sheraton International unit
after failing to acquire the company, previously controlled by the Aga Khan.
A rights issue in March was expected to be a failure, delivering Ciga into
the hands of its creditor banks, which would then sell a controlling stake
to ITT. But the rights issue was a success, raising L1,003bn (Dollars
625.7m) for Ciga to help reduce its heavy borrowings.
ITT's delegate at yesterday's assembly - Mr Francesco Gianni, a Milan lawyer
 -confirmed afterwards that ITT's stake was not a speculative investment. At
the meeting, he also voted on behalf of a fund, Arca, which owns 2.7 per
cent of Ciga, but he stressed those shares were owned separately.
Mr Gianni suggested that because of legal technicalities, ITT would not be
obliged to bid for a further 17.4 per cent of the company, as is usually
required by Italian rules when an investor gains effective control of a
company.
Consob, Italy's stock market watchdog, will have to decide what ITT's next
step should be.
The second largest individual shareholder in Ciga, Bankers Trust
International, with a 6.65 per cent stake, was not represented at the annual
meeting.
A group of funds holding some 15 per cent of the Ciga's shares voiced
support for ITT yesterday, but abstained from the formal vote on the 1993
balance sheet to show their autonomy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson-CSF, the French defence-based electronics company, yesterday
announced two joint ventures with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) in an attempt to
show that it had not been pushed off its expansionary course by losses from
the Credit Lyonnais bank that put it FFr2.3bn (Dollars 410m) in the red last
year.
The Thomson-CSF and Dasa joint companies are involved in 'smart' munitions
and missile propulsion. They would have a combined turnover of FFr1.9bn.
'We have not yet finished our expansion,' said Mr Alain Gomez, president,
noting that it was only external acquisitions over the past four years that
had enabled Thomson-CSF to keep its turnover steady last year at FFr34bn.
The French government this week confirmed its decision to renew Mr Gomez's
tenure as president of Thomson SA, the group holding company, as well as of
Thomson-CSF.
Thomson SA had an overall net loss last year of FFr3.03bn, largely due to
Thomson-CSF's FFr2.3bn net loss.

Total, the French oil group, said yesterday that it had sold a 20.2 per cent
stake in its Euridep paints subsidiary to a group of French and
international investors.
The proceeds, which are thought to be about FFr600m (Dollars 107.9m), will
finance Euridep's investment and acquisition plans, Total said.
Euridep comprises all Total's paint businesses, which generate sales of
about FFr3bn.
It is the largest paints company in France, and ranks number four in the UK,
following its acquisition of Manders earlier this year.
Societe Generale, the French bank, handled the sale of the 20.2 per cent
stake in Euridep stake, taking up some of the shares itself.
Other investors included banks, insurance companies and some private
investors, Total said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Viag forecasts surge in earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viag, the diversified metals packaging and trading group, said yesterday it
hoped to triple its profits to around DM900m (Dollars 569.6m) this year. The
upbeat forecast came as it prepared to become one of Germany's biggest
companies, with shareholders expected to approve its takeover of the utility
Bayernwerk.
Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, told the annual meeting the company
would significantly increase its dividend, which stayed unchanged at DM9
this year.
Viag, whose core activities extend from aluminium and metal packaging to
trading, had earnings last year of DM302m, down 19 per cent on the year
before. However, it recently said first-quarter 1994 profits had risen 33
per cent, and that figures for the first five months had also improved.
The purchase of 97 per cent of Bayernwerk, Germany's third-largest utility,
will increase Viag's turnover to around DM40bn from DM24bn in 1993, and make
it one of Germany's top 15 companies in terms of turnover. Senior
executives, however, still found themselves having to justify the DM5.515bn
purchase price.
Some analysts and shareholders have said Viag paid too much, and a Berlin
court recently upheld a complaint by a Viag shareholder that the company had
not properly informed investors about the the Bayernwerk takeover.
The company, however, insisted the takeover had been worthwhile. 'Bayernwerk
is a pearl which money cannot buy in Europe any more,' Mr Jochen Holzer,
chairman of the Viag supervisory board, told shareholders.
Bayernwerk had annual pre-tax profits of about DM1bn last year. It is
regarded as a particularly attractive asset because of the high liquidity of
the electricity generating business.
Viag, which has been progressively privatised since 1986, said recently it
would still consider acquisitions to supplement its chemicals business, but
that these would have to wait until the Bayernwerk takeover was complete.
The state of Bavaria will receive a 25.1 per cent stake in Viag in return
for the sale of the Bayernwerk equity.
Reuter adds: Viag plans to wind down its involvement in aluminium production
over the next few years.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gandois to step down from
Pechiney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of Pechiney, yesterday said he would step down
from the state-owned aluminium and packaging group and stand as a candidate
to head the Patronat, the French employers' federation.
The Pechiney chief said that since the company will not be privatised by the
time he reaches the age of 65, next May, it would be better to leave the job
and allow his replacement to prepare for the sale. Public-sector company
chairmen have an age limit of 65.
Mr Gandois is now set for a contest to succeed Mr Francois Perigot, the
current head of the Patronat, who will step down in December. Mr Jean-Louis
Giral, a former head of the Patronat's social committee, has already
announced he will stand, and other candidates may emerge before the autumn
vote which will determine Mr Perigot's successor.
The Patronat has traditionally played an important role in contributing to
the policy debate with the government in areas from labour market reform to
macroeconomic policy. It recently urged the government to implement
investment incentives and increase financial assistance for small and
medium-sized industry to support economic recovery.
In addition to his ambitions at the Patronat, Mr Gandois' decision to step
down partly reflects the timing of the privatisation of the aluminium group.
He has pushed for a rapid privatisation of the company, which is one of the
21 public-sector groups slated for sale by the centre-right government of
prime minister Edouard Balladur.
Losses at the group, however, and the complex negotiations surrounding an
alliance with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone (CNR), the hydroelectricity
producer, have prevented an early privatisation.
Pechiney, which has suffered from the fall in aluminium prices and the
increased supply from Russia and eastern Europe, suffered a net loss of
FFr980m (Dollars 176.3m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr203m in
1992.
Mr Gandois said yesterday that Pechiney should return to profit this year,
boosted by exceptional gains. He forecast that privatisation of the group
would be possible from 1996.
In an attempt to reduce the cyclical nature of its businesses and secure a
low-cost source of electricity, the French government has sought to form a
partnership between Pechiney and CNR. The plan has encountered opposition,
however, from local politicians and is complicated by the government's
desire to maintain the monopoly of Electricite de France, the state-owned
utility.

<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch has acquired a small stake in John Fairfax, the publisher
of three of Australia's leading daily papers in which Mr Kerry Packer and Mr
Conrad Black have substantial interests.
The 1.7 per cent stake was acquired last month by News Limited, the
Australian arm of New International. News said it had bought 12m ordinary
shares in Fairfax 'as a passive investment'.
Fairfax shares, which were trading at around ADollars 2.60 in mid-June,
closed three cents up at ADollars 2.70 yesterday. News Corp shares ended
five cents lower at ADollars 8.30.
News' disclosure comes at a delicate time for both Fairfax and the newspaper
industry generally. It immediately prompted speculation over Mr Murdoch's
motives.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media magnate, is close to the maximum 25 per
cent of Fairfax which he is permitted to hold under Australia's foreign
investment rules.
Earlier this year, in the course of a parliamentary inquiry into Fairfax and
media ownership rules, Mr Black made clear that he found this level
frustrating and would like it lifted.
Mr Black said that if he were allowed to hold 35 per cent of Fairfax, for
example, he would consider this 'an adequate position of security' from
which to expand Fairfax's operations into Asia.
Mr Packer, the Australian businessman, holds 15 per cent of Fairfax, but is
also pegged at this level by media cross-ownership rules.
Mr Black, through his ownership of the Telegraph group in London, is
currently locked in a newspaper price war in the UK with Mr Murdoch, who
publishes The Times and other titles.
As a result, various explanations were being put forward yesterday for Mr
Murdoch's purchase, ranging from a desire to capitalise on Australia's
strong domestic recovery, to a 'squeeze play' on Mr Black.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 178m public offer for the flotation of 3i, the venture capital
giant, closed yesterday with the sponsors saying they were 'pleased' with
the level of applications received by Lloyds, the registrar bank.
Because of the number of bulk orders handled by retail stockbrokers,
however, the final figures are unlikely to be released until tomorrow.
Brokers expect the issue to be fully subscribed, but they said that retail
investor response did not appear enthusiastic, despite a non-privatisation
record number of private investors registering for the 3i prospectus.
However, the Pounds 533m offer of shares to institutions, representing three
quarters of the Pounds 711m total share offer, was 1.7 times subscribed. Any
shares not taken up by the public will be absorbed by the institutional
funds.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Chase raises stakes in T&amp;N battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan, the US bank, has raised the stakes in its legal battle with
T&amp;N over asbestos contamination of its New York headquarters by appointing
one of the country's leading lawyers to prepare its case.
The bank said that Mr Arthur Liman, senior partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton &amp; Garrison, would head the legal team overseeing its Dollars 185m
damages case against T&amp;N, which as Turner &amp; Newall was formerly UK's leading
asbestos supplier.
Mr Liman, regarded as one of the country's most combative lawyers, acted
previously as chief counsel to the US senate committee investigating the
Iran-Contra affair. In that role he questioned former officials from the
Reagan administration including Col Oliver North and Mr Robert Mcfarlane. He
also represented Mr Michael Milken, the former head of the junk-bond
department at Drexel Burnham Lambert, who was jailed in 1990 for securities
fraud.
The T&amp;N case centres on allegations that the British company knew that
asbestos spray installed in Chase Manhattan's New York offices was
hazardous.
T&amp;N, which denies liability, declined to comment yesterday.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Competing on a level playing field -
British Vita has been lured into Poland by its low production costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western Poland, much of which was part of Germany before the second world
war and retains excellent road, rail and canal links to the west, is rapidly
becoming a preferred location for foreign investors.
Unusually, it has also attracted a growing number of British industrial
investors who, thus far, have generally been slow to invest in former
communist central Europe.
Significantly, the attention of one of the latest British investors, British
Vita, was attracted by executives at its German subsidiary.
If Mr Marek Krojcig, a mild-mannered Polish entrepreneur with a ready smile,
hadn't turned up to buy blocks of foam for cash five years ago at
Veenendaal, British Vita's German foam operation, the UK-based company might
conceivably not now be the proud owner of a brand new polyurethane foam
production facility at Brzeg Dolny in western Poland.
For it was Mr Krojcig's return visits, each time with a suitcase full of
D-Marks, which attracted the attention of Mr Joachim Gronebaum, the managing
director of Deutsche Vita.
Two years later, in December 1992, it led to the establishment of Krojcig
Mebel, a foam-cutting and marketing joint venture at Zielona Gora, also in
western Poland.
Mr Krojcig's success in selling the foam to Poland's furniture producers,
both large state-owned companies and small producers, pointed Vita in the
direction of building its own plant in Poland, duly opened last month.
'We saw that the furniture businesses we were supplying in Germany were
moving their production to Poland and decided to go with them,' says Mr Rod
Sellers, British Vita's chief executive. 'We also recognised Poland's
relative political stability and prospects for growth as well as
geographical location near to the Czech Republic and on the way to the
former Soviet Union,' he adds.
Others have followed this path. BOC owns a technical gases facility next
door to the Vita Polymers Poland plant at Brzeg, as part of its Dollars 90m
(Pounds 59m) investment plan in Poland. Paterson Zochonis of Manchester has
a Cussons Imperial Leather soap factory in nearby Wroclaw where Cadbury
Schweppes is building a chocolate plant. Coca Cola has sited one of its main
bottling plants at Sroda Slaska in the vicinity.
At Brzeg, Vita's 9,000 tonne annual capacity foam fabricating plant is
located just across the fence from the giant Rokita chemical works built
during the second world war by IG Farbenindustrie to produce poison gas.
Now Rokita not only pipes energy and nitrogen to Vita Polymers, but also
supplies polyol, one of the main raw materials for the foam. TDI, the other
raw material, comes from Zachem in Bydgoszcz in the north, a plant which
itself produces foam and is a direct competitor.
Mr Sellers cites the fact that the main raw materials for production are
present in the country as another reason for taking the decision to invest.
But Brzeg will also be looking to companies like Dow Chemical and Rhone
Poulenc to provide one third of supplies.
For all the confidence about the future, British Vita has been very careful
not to overspend on the project which has cost Dollars 8m to date, of which
Dollars 5m went on the construction of the 12,000 sq m plant.
This is roughly 25 per cent of what a similar plant would have cost in the
United Kingdom. The work was done by local contractors, with the machinery
coming mainly from Laader Berg in Norway. The small labour force of about 30
at Brzeg will also be earning about one eighth of the wages of their British
counterparts.
For the moment, however, all Vita's main competitors in Poland have similar
advantages in a Polish market estimated to be worth Dollars 75m a year.
Up to 30,000 tonnes a year of foam is now produced domestically, and a
further 4,000 tonnes is imported. The two existing Polish competitors are
Zachem in Bydgoszcz and Organika in Malbork. They are flanked by Polopren, a
German joint venture in Zgierz and Polymer Gdansk, an Australian venture.
But, in an interesting sign of the times, current producers are facing
another private sector challenge from Mr Stanislaw Kremona, an independent
Polish entrepreneur who farms in the lush, undulating countryside 12km from
Brzeg Dolny, and has now built his own foam factory.
The facility, which came on stream last year, has an annual capacity of
20,000 tonnes, but Mr Kremona is believed by his competitors to be producing
well below capacity.
For British Vita, Mr Kremona's plant represents no more than a small cloud
in an otherwise blue sky. But the fact that an individual Polish
entrepreneur is capable of putting up a plant of this size and
sophistication shows how far the Polish private sector has developed in the
five years since the fall of communism.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bespak blames problems in US for 38% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing difficulties in the US healthcare market were behind a 38 per
cent fall in profits at Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer.
Mr Peter Chambre, who took over as chief executive in May, described the
year as 'very poor'. While his objective was to return the company to
growth, the markets were not going to get a lot easier.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.1m for the year ended
April 29.
Sales increased from Pounds 61.8m to Pounds 64.9m. However, the latest
figure included a Pounds 3m contribution from Medix, the breathing equipment
manufacturer acquired in May last year, and a Pounds 3m currency gain.
The shares, which were over 500p this time last year, closed down 15p at
290p yesterday.
Operating profits in the US-based Tenax Corporation, the maker of plastic
medical components acquired in 1992, were down 75 per cent in spite of a
cost reduction programme and the loss of 50 jobs.
US sales were down 14 per cent to Dollars 45m, while sales to US Surgical,
the company's biggest US customer, fell 44 per cent on continued de-stocking
and increased competition.
Sales in the UK rose by 18 per cent, but operating income declined 2 per
cent and margins fell from 17.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent. This reflected a
change in the sales mix at Bespak UK, which makes pharmaceutical and
personal care dispensing equipment.
Sales of pumps and valves to the personal care market rose by 21 per cent to
Pounds 10m. However, the group was unable to meet overall demand for pumps,
and had to buy some in, hitting profitability.
Medix had not proved nearly as profitable as expected, and had had to take a
new nebuliser off the UK market because of technical problems.
Mr Chambre said the group was looking for growth from dispensers for
respiratory drugs in the form of dry powder, and from valves developed for
non-CFC propellants - areas which mainly accounted for Pounds 2.5m spent on
product development during the year.
He believed that sales were starting to improve in both the UK and the US.
While the pharmaceutical trading environment had changed for ever, Bespak
was in a strong position to benefit from any upturn.
Earnings per share fell from 31.9p to 19p. An unchanged final dividend of 6p
is proposed, taking the total for the year to 10.2p (10p).

</HEADLINE>

   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two non-executive directors of BDA Holdings are requisitioning an
extraordinary general meeting to oust Mr Brian Duker as chairman and chief
executive of the property investment and development group.
Mr Richard Wollenberg, BDA's non-executive deputy chairman and Mr Nigel
Jamieson together hold about 3.1 per cent of the company, while Mr
Wollenberg is also a director of Village Residential, which has a 13 per
cent stake.
Mr Wollenberg said BDA needed to expand its interests and he had 'lost
confidence in Mr Duker's ability to take the company forward'. He claimed
support from shareholders, including several large institutions, speaking
for 51.33 per cent of the votes.
Mr Duker, who controls about 24 per cent of BDA, said he had 'brought the
company back from the brink of disaster over the last few years'. He said he
would be writing to shareholders in due course.
In April, BDA reported a turnround from Pounds 1.16m losses to pre-tax
profits of Pounds 152,000 in the year to end January 1994, after a release
of property provisions of Pounds 100,000, compared with a Pounds 1.2m charge
before.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Waterhouse losses deepen to Pounds 0.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Further losses at its Midlands business helped push Waterhouse, the
USM-quoted office fitting company, further in to the red in the six months
to end-March giving a deficit for the period of Pounds 200,890 against
Pounds 51,114 previously.
The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.2m,
and at the operating level there was a loss of Pounds 147,357 (Pounds
25,123). The Midlands business was responsible for Pounds 126,759 (Pounds
91,228) of that deficit. Losses per share came out at 8p (2p).
However, as announced on June 7, the Midlands business is to be disposed of
by way of a management buy-out, the terms of which were revealed by
Waterhouse yesterday.
The value of the net assets being disposed of amounts to Pounds 64,948. The
proceeds of the sale, which is subject to shareholders' approval, will be
used to reduce indebtedness and to provide working capital.
The shares closed down 3p to 33p.

Surrey Group, the bookmaker, is seeking Pounds 2.1m to cut gearing and for
expansion. The USM-quoted company also announced reduced pre-tax losses for
the year to March 31 of Pounds 292,000, compared with Pounds 1.38m.
It is issuing 92.7m shares in a 1-for-2 rights issue and placing a further
85.7m shares, both at 1 1/4 p. Its shares were unchanged yesterday at 1 1/2
p.
Of the rights, commitments have been received to subscribe for 17.2m shares
and the balance underwritten by Ellis &amp; Partners.
The reduced loss was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds
35.5m as a result of the sale of 28 betting shops in early 1993.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Record year for Border Television
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Border Television, the Carlisle-based independent television company,
reported record profits for the first full year under the new franchise
arrangements with a 32 per cent increase in profit from Pounds 1.25m to
Pounds 1.64m.
Turnover for the USM-quoted company fell to Pounds 9.87m (Pounds 11m) as a
result of the loss of Channel Four airtime sales. Earnings per share came
out at 12p (8.3p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.4p makes an increased
total for the year of 4p (3.3p).
Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said that in the second quarter of this year the
company's share of ITV advertising had grown significantly and he looked
forward to a gradual improvement as the year progressed.
However the costs of setting up the two commercial radio stations in which
the company is involved, Central Scotland Radio and Radio North East, were
expected to have an impact on the results for the year.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Record Pounds 7bn raised by flotations in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record Pounds 7bn was raised by UK and Irish companies floating on the
London Stock Exchange in the first half of the year. The figure was three
times the amount raised during the same period last year and more than the
total of Pounds 5.9m for the whole of 1993.
The first half's 141 new entrants was only 39 short of 1993's record of 180.
Despite the turbulent market conditions, 25 companies joined the Official
List in June but there has been a slowdown of new issues in the pipeline.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listing at the Stock Exchange, said: 'With new
issuers becoming more cautious in the light of the current market
uncertainties, we may have to wait until conditions have settled before
seeing a resurgence.'
The strongest share price performance was from Utility Cable, which more
than tripled in the three months following its listing. Mithras Investment
Trust shares have risen 75 per cent and Trafficmaster by 42 per cent.
Flotations on the continent raised a total of Pounds 12.3bn in the first
five months of the year which included several large privatisations. But
only 32 new companies joined the large European Union exchanges in the
period, compared with 90 in London, excluding investment trusts.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GEC moves on manufacturing - Poorly
performing non-strategic companies likely to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC intends to rationalise its portfolio of general manufacturing companies
to improve its profitability and focus. Poorly performing companies which
are not part of GEC's strategic operations will be sold if their
profitability cannot be improved.
Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, said that in addition to its three
core businesses of telecommunications, electronics systems and power
systems, the company was setting up an industrial group to encompass the
rest of its operations.
Some businesses within that, notably the petrol pump manufacturer Gilbarco
and the ink-jet printer maker Videojet were doing extremely well and would
be developed further.
Others would either have to improve their profitability or be sold. 'It is
not enough to be a me-too manufacturer any more. We have to be in those
busineses where we have sufficient presence to make an acceptable return,'
he said.
The industrial group of businesses were responsible for some of the
difficulties which led to profits being only slightly ahead of last year at
Pounds 866m. However, the final dividend was increased to 8.01p (7.62p)
making a total of 10.82p (10.3p) for the year.
Profits were some Pounds 70m below the company's own earlier expectations
for a variety of reasons. A US-based semiconductor operation, GEC Plessey
Semiconductors, reported a small loss, some Pounds 17m below GEC's budgeted
level. Restructuring charges cost Pounds 8m in the power controls business
and poor market conditions hurt the cables and weighing operations. Currency
effects cost a further Pounds 10m.
Elsewhere, development costs of the in-flight entertainment system, which is
due to be supplied for the Boeing 777 aircraft, cost Pounds 20m more than
anticipated. To avoid the possibility of the system being late more staff
have been assigned to the project.
Of GEC's three main divisions, power systems saw operating profits fall by
Pounds 8m to Pounds 166m, on sales of Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 3.14bn), but the
profitability was distorted by pre-payments for power stations, which
reduced operating profits but increased interest income. Pre-payments
increased the GEC Alsthom's working capital by Pounds 511m to negative
Pounds 665m. The joint venture achieved record results and margins improved
to 7.6 per cent (7.1 per cent).
The electronics systems business, which includes the defence interests, saw
operating profits fall to Pounds 252m (Pounds 271m) on sales of Pounds
2.75bn (Pounds 2.72bn). Order intake was below the previous year and the
outstanding order book has fallen 7 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn. Margins were
squeezed because development costs are still at a high level on avionics
systems for the Eurofighter 2000 and the Boeing 777, while deliveries have
not yet started.
In telecommunications, GPT's operating profits rose more than 13 per cent to
Pounds 120m even though turnover only increased marginally to Pounds 1.05bn.
With business on the System X digital exchanges for BT running down, the
division has had to switch to other business ranging from switching
software, through the development of advanced telecoms transmission systems
in co-operation with Siemens, to the manufacture of payphones.

GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is to invest Pounds
50m in a joint venture with Fiat which will supply the Italian vehicle maker
with key driveline components from a new factory near Florence.
GKN will hold 85 per cent of GKN Component Firenze with Fiat Auto holding
the balance. It will initially take over an existing Fiat business making
constant velocity joints and driveshafts under GKN licence at Novoli in
Florence.
This site, which employs 700, will remain under Fiat's ownership. It will
stay in production until the new plant is brought on stream at the end of
next year at Campo Bisenzio, 15km west of Florence, to which most of the
work force is expected to transfer.
The new venture will supply components for Fiat's car plants in Italy and
eastern Europe, with the possibility of non-Fiat customers being added
later.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MPs condemn pay-out to former Severn Trent
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Labour MPs yesterday condemned a six-figure pay-out to the former
chairman of one of the regional water companies and urged Ofwat to act to
protect consumers from similar 'excesses'.
A total of 54 MPs headed by Mr Richard Burden, MP for Birmingham Northfield,
used a parliamentary early day motion to attack 'a half-million pound
pay-off' to Mr John Bellak, former chairman of Severn Trent.
The payment came to light in the company's annual accounts, which showed
that, on top of his salary package of Pounds 230,300, Mr Bellak was paid
Pounds 512,626 in compensation for early retirement. This latter figure
consisted of Pounds 404,829 for 'early termination of his service contract'
and Pounds 107,797 for future pension payments.
The motion deplored the payout before going on to note 'that during his term
in office, Mr Bellak ruthlessly promoted the privatisation of the water
industry despite evidence that the majority of the public he was supposed to
serve opposed the sell-off; further notes that Mr Bellak's remuneration
since privatisation was boosted by a series of salary rises and by share
option deals while water prices soared and public accountability diminished;
believes that it is a disgrace that the water companies should be making
multi-million pound profits and making large payoffs to top executives when
pensioners and low income families cannot afford to pay their water bills;
and demands that Ofwat take immediate action to protect consumers from the
excesses of the private water companies.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: How weird air provides the crunch - David
Blackwell examines Ricardo's drive into the North American automotive market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small engineering company in Detroit saved Kelloggs millions of dollars on
the cost of making cornflakes through computer studies of the airflow
through the cereal ovens.
Mr Robert Nelson, one of the founders of Airflow Sciences, recalled the US
multinational's reaction to modifications that lifted cornflake production
at Battle Creek, Michigan, from 80lbs to 200lbs a minute. 'They shut down
public tours of the plant - they felt they would be giving away too much.'
Airflow, which looks at fluid flow and heat transfer problems, was bought
last March by Ricardo, the UK consulting engineers, for Dollars 2.26m
(Pounds 1.48m). Mr Christopher Ross, Ricardo chief executive, described it
at the time as a company with few competitors, operating in a field that the
group already understood and could manage.
This fits well with the group's recent direction, as well as enhancing its
drive into North America - a market where it sees strong potential growth.
The North American automotive industry, which accounts for almost a third of
turnover at Airflow Sciences, is returning to growth after deep recession.
It is looking to improve what is known as the NVH (noise, vibration and
harshness) performance of its vehicles.
The big US manufacturers, which were a long way behind the Japanese on NVH,
are seeking out independent consultants rather than using in-house staff and
equipment. They can then benefit from the breadth of knowledge that gets
stored over the years. Mr Ross believes the group is now in a position to
offer a service on everything to do with a vehicle apart from designing the
body shell itself.
Earlier this month, Ricardo, which has experienced 25 per cent organic
growth in its automotive division over the last three years, continued its
drive into North America with a deal to pay Pounds 13.6m for FF
Developments, the company that built the transmissions for the Jaguar 220
and the factory-prepared Ford Escorts in the world rally championship.
FFD was founded in Coventry, England, in 1971 by Major Tony Rolt to apply
four-wheel drive systems and anti-lock braking systems, which the group
developed from the work of the pioneering Harry Ferguson. The FF of the name
stems from 'Ferguson Formula.'
But Mr Stuart Rolt, the major's son and current chief executive, set up a
division in Detroit in 1989 after Chrysler said it would not give the group
business unless it was in the US. The Detroit arm now employs 140 compared
with 90 in Coventry.
Realising that the interest in four-wheel drive had probably peaked, he took
the company into automatic transmission design and development and chassis
engineering. 'Most of our business is not four-wheel drive any more' he said
in Detroit.
The latest acquisition will substantially boost Ricardo's presence in the
US, where it had no physical presence until 18 months ago, although it
opened a consultancy in Detroit in 1992.
But its most significant move before the acquisitions was to invest Dollars
4m in an engine testing facility in Chicago.
The company had found the volume of business coming from North America
disappointingly low, considering there was obviously a large amount to be
had. However, North America is a myopic market. The US motor industry likes
to deal with people near home. 'Our presence on the ground greatly increases
their willingness to work with us,' said Mr John Needham, acting president
of Ricardo North America.
The test beds have been sited in Chicago rather than Detroit so that the
group can tap into both the Detroit automobile industry and the heavy duty
engine plants of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, where engines are
made for construction, agricultural and marine equipment and power
generation.
Two test beds are now running, and are fully booked until the end of
September. Ricardo is planning to have five running within the next five
years.
The amount of data collected by the test bed computer in one minute of
running a single engine is enough to fill 10 computer floppy discs. By the
time it is resolved into useful information, it can fill 50.
Mr Needham pointed out that the new facility was still earning its stripes,
but promises of repeat business were already appearing. 'The potential for
growth is quite exciting,' he said. 'We have the skill base, the technology
and the products.'
Airflow Sciences, aside from speeding up the flow of cornflakes through
Kelloggs' ovens, relies on the automotive industry for 30 per cent of sales.
Near the office where the latest computers work through complex mathematical
models is a building where the results are applied - a world of
disembowelled cars, where technologists modify with sticky tape and
cardboard parts such as the plastic ducting that demist windscreens.
The computer's answers to problems often raise eyebrows. Sometimes they are
greeted with disbelief, as happened when the company was asked by Bell
Helmets to look at the airflow over US racing drivers' crash helmets.
Three years ago, drivers in the open cockpit Indianopolis cars found that
they could not use full power as their heads were vibrating so violently
that they could not see. Mr Robert Gielow, Airflow founder and president,
ran some tests and suggested a tiny raised V should be built into the sides
of the helmets.
That worked well, but since then the company has developed a flat back
helmet that has dramatically reduced the 50lbs of lift which the airflow was
putting on ordinary helmets at top speed. Initial resistance to the strange
shape waned rapidly, and it is now used by many top names including Emmerson
Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr.
The attraction of the company to Ricardo was its ability to apply
computational fluid dynamics outside the automotive industry. It has done
work to improve the flight of golf balls and the decaffeination of coffee,
in the medical and cement industries, on the cold airflow inside
refrigerated trailers and the drag outside, and on the airflow of the
Channel Tunnel rail cars. But the main target is the US power industry,
where legislation on emissions is helping to provide good business.
At one power station the computer's suggested placement of baffles in an
exhaust flue reduced particulate emissions from more than 30 per cent to
such a low level that observers thought their measuring equipment had
broken.
'Just a little baffle - it seems so trivial,' said Mr Nelson. But the
dramatic result, which would have taken years to find through trial and
error, certainly justified his enduring belief that 'air is weird.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Trinity agrees Malaysian bus joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trinity Holdings, the UK's leading specialist vehicle manufacturer,
yesterday signed a Pounds 3.5m joint venture deal to supply and build buses
in Malaysia.
The company claimed that the agreement with the UMW manufacturing group
represented one of the first Anglo-Malaysian trade deals since the Kuala
Lumpar government imposed an embargo on offering government contracts to
British companies last February.
Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said Trinity would retain 35 per cent of a
joint venture company which aims to build 600 buses a year for the Malaysian
market.
The buses will be assembled from kits supplied by Trinity subsidiaries -
Dennis Specialist Vehicles and Duple Metsec.
In addition to payments for the kits, the company will receive Pounds
700,000 annually in transfer technology fees for five years and share in the
joint venture's profits.
Mr Hollyhead said total demand could exceed 30,000 vehicles.
A new plant will meet both local demand and serve markets elsewhere in the
Asia-Pacific region.

FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest boosts Taunton Cider to
Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply lower interest costs helped Taunton Cider report a 15 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits despite intense competition from
low-price brands in the take-home cider market which held back both turnover
and operating profits.
Taunton, which warned about the impact of the surge in economy brand sales
in March, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.3m in the year to April 30,
against Pounds 17.6m, on turnover marginally higher at Pounds 125.3m (Pounds
124.9m).
Interest payments fell from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 68,000. Interest receipts
slipped to Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 572,000) despite an increase in year-end
net cash which increased over th year from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 4.5m.
Adjusting for the flotation in July 1992, pro-forma pre-tax profits were 4
per cent higher at Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.5m.)
Earnings per share were up 7 per cent to 13.1p (12.2p) and the board is
recommending a 3.95p final divided which makes a total of 6.6p (6p).
Operating profits increased by 1.52 per cent reflecting a further increase
in sales volumes and the continued strong performance of the group's leading
brands which include the Dry Blackthorn, Autumn Gold and Diamond White
brands.
In the on-trade business, which accounts for about half the cider market,
Taunton boosted both volume and market share. Total pub volumes grew by 3
per cent with growth in draught sales offsetting a decline in packaged
volumes.
The group also increased sales of both its own brands and retailer and
economy brands in the take home market, but nevertheless lost market share
with its brands showing a 4 per cent volume gain compared with market growth
of 9 per cent.
Taunton believes economy brands have now peaked with about 10 per cent of
the market. It hit back at the start of the year cutting costs and lifting
promotional spending.
As a result Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman, said: 'Take home sales volumes in
the last three months of the year were significantly up on the previous year
and have continued strongly into the new financial year.'
COMMENT
Taunton has responded firmly, if a little tardily, to the threat posed by
cut-price cider in the take home market. Promotional spending has been
boosted by between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m a year and is being paid for by
cutting costs and boosting productivity. Over the next two years it believes
it can cut costs by another Pounds 5m to offset margin pressure. However the
years of strong domestic profit growth are probably over. Reflecting this
Taunton recently signed a promising distribution deal with Molson in the US.
In the meantime pre-tax profits should edge higher to about Pounds 20.7m
this year, producing earnings of 13.3p. The shares gained 12p yesterday to
close at 162p and look fairly priced.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Everton rights issue aims for Pounds 9.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everton, one of the great names of British football, has announced the
details of its first share issue for more than a century.
The Merseyside club is to raise Pounds 9.75m through a one-for-one rights
issue. There is just one catch - each shareholder has to stump up Pounds
4,000 per share.
Everton has, and needs, a loyal band of supporters who between them have
2,500 shares which change hands at more than Pounds 2,500 each. About 40 per
cent of the shares are held by the Moores family, which founded Littlewoods
football pools and formerly ran the club.
The remainder are largely owned by relatives of well-heeled fans who bought
one or two shares when they were first issued in 1892 for Pounds 1 apiece
and kept them as a gesture of faith rather than personal investment.
They are rarely traded. In the past six months, aside from executor sales,
fewer than 30 shares have changed hands.
One of those shares was bought by Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Food
Group and former chairman of Tranmere Rovers football club.
It was after the death in September of Sir John Moores, the Everton
chairman, that Mr Johnson beat off a rival consortium's attempt to gain
control of Everton. With the backing of the Moores family, Mr Johnson
overcame the bid of Mr Bill Kenwright, the theatrical producer and Everton
board member, and put himself forward as prospective chairman.
Mr Johnson hopes shareholders will baulk at the premium price being charged
for the equity allowing him, in his capacity as underwriter, to pick up the
new shares. The club justifies the price by saying it wants to raise as much
as it can to reverse its dwindling fortunes - Everton has not won the FA cup
for 10 years and last season it came close to relegation.
Mr Johnson expects to take up enough new shares to win the necessary 30 per
cent stake for a dominant interest - assuming the Moores let their rights
lapse and see their stake diluted to 20 per cent.
There will be an informal meeting for shareholders next Thursday at Everton
followed by an extraordinary general meeting on July 26 at Goodison Park,
Liverpool, to vote on the rights issue.

FT  07 JUL 94 / US frontiers blurred after railway merger: Stock swap may
lead to east meeting west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A railway that makes a profit has become a rarity since road transport
started to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative. But in the past
few years, US railways have been doing very nicely. Now two of them, the
Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe Pacific, plan to do even better by
merging their large networks in a Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) stock swap,
creating by far the biggest railway in the US: the Burlington Northern and
Santa Fe.
Unlike railways in most other countries, US railway companies - all of them
in the private sector - operate only freight trains. Passenger services are
operated over the private railways' tracks by the state-owned Amtrak, which
lost Dollars 730m last year.
Just 20 years ago, it was not too fanciful to imagine that US railways might
cease to exist. Federal government investment in the construction of an
interstate road system had encouraged rapid growth in the road haulage
industry, and the heavily regulated railways were unable to compete.
With many railways staring at bankruptcy, the industry went through a wave
of mergers in the late 1970s and early 1980s that cut the 17 big railway
companies to seven. Around the same time, the railways also began to see the
first glimmer of salvation with the passage of the Staggers Act in 1980,
which in effect deregulated the industry.
Once the merger mania was over, all the big railways started using their new
commercial freedom to set more competitive freight rates, drop unprofitable
traffic, dispose of loss-making lines and cut jobs. Gradually the red ink
turned to black.
While cost-cutting was the main theme of the 1980s, in the 1990s the
railways have started to win more traffic. Economic growth is one reason for
the increase; a shortage of drivers in the trucking industry has helped,
too. But more importantly, lower costs have enabled the railways to show
they are still capable of competing with road hauliers on price, at least on
long-distance trips.
One of their fastest-growing markets is for intermodal traffic - trailers
and containers that switch from road to rail for the long-distance part of
their journey.
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe say this is why they want to get together.
Although both railways lie to the west of the Mississippi, connecting the
Midwest with the Pacific coast, most of Burlington's network lies to the
north of Santa Fe's: so connecting the two would greatly increase the number
of long-distance destinations on offer to both railways' customers.
The merged railways would also get a substantial boost to competitiveness
because of the efficiency savings flowing from higher traffic densities and
reduced administrative costs.
The big question, however, is: will they get away with it? The Interstate
Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory agency, stood aside during the
wave of railway mergers in the 1970s and early 1980s. But in 1987 it
forcibly intervened in a deal between Santa Fe and another of the Big Seven
railways, Southern Pacific, telling them to unbundle a merger that had been
accomplished more than three years earlier.
Santa Fe hopes this deal will be different. The Santa Fe and Southern
networks, it says, were largely overlapping, and the Interstate Commerce
Commission had feared that a merger would reduce competition.
The Santa Fe and Burlington networks, by contrast, hardly overlap at all: it
would be an 'end-to-end' merger, increasing the options available to
customers and allowing the merged railways to compete more effectively with
Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi.
If the commission does allow the merger - and it could be the end of next
year before it reaches a decision - the result could be to encourage more
deals between US railways. But future mergers are likely to be different
from any seen before.
For years, the industry has speculated on the possibility that one of the
four big railways to the west of the Mississippi might merge with one of the
three big railways to the east - the Norfolk Southern, CSX and Conrail.
This would create a transcontinental railway network providing customers
with a seamless coast-to-coast freight transport service, without the costs
and delays associated with interchanging traffic from one operator to
another.
Analysts had speculated that any one merger would start a game of musical
chairs in which the other big railways would also scramble to form east-west
partnerships.
With four companies on one side of the Mississippi and three on the other,
it always looked as though one company west of the Mississippi would be left
in the cold.
A successful merger between Burlington and Santa Fe would send a signal to
the rest of the railway industry that end-to-end mergers were acceptable to
the commission, and conveniently even up the number of potential partners to
three on each side of the Mississippi. At that stage, the logic of a
transcontinental merger wave might become irresistible.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Salomon issues profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon yesterday revealed it would report a loss of about Dollars 200m
(Pounds 131.5m) in the second quarter because of a poor performance from its
securities brokerage unit, Salomon Brothers.
The loss shows how the rise in US and European interest rates and the slump
in international stock and bond markets have hurt Wall Street.
After an unprecedented three years of profits growth, securities industry
earnings have slowed in the past two quarters because of rising US interest
rates. Higher interest rates put up firms' cost of capital, cut demand for
securities underwriting services, and damp investor interest in financial
markets.
Salomon, which reported a steep fall in profits to Dollars 66m in the first
three months of 1994, is unlikely to be the only firm hurt by turmoil in the
markets.
Last week Charles Schwab, the discount securities brokerage firm, warned
that its earnings would be flat in the April to June period, and analysts
expect other big securities firms to report a decline in quarterly profits
in coming weeks.
In a brief statement yesterday Salomon attributed the second-quarter loss to
poor results from Salomon Brothers' client-driven business.
Typically, bond trading firms such as Salomon make money from their
client-driven business by profiting from the difference between the price at
which they buy bonds and the price at which they then sell those bonds. In
recent months, however, there have been more sellers of bonds than buyers,
and Salomon was left at the end of the quarter with a large inventory of
bonds which had declined in value.
The firm also suffered losses on its proprietary trading operations, where
it uses its own capital to trade in financial markets. Here, analysts said
Salomon probably made several wrong bets on the direction of interest rates
and securities prices.
Although Salomon said overall group results would have been worse but for an
improved performance from Phibro, its commodities trading business, news of
the profits warning hit Salomon's share price, which fell Dollars 2 to
Dollars 45 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Dixons slips but remains optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons, the UK's largest electricals retailer, yesterday provided further
evidence that consumer spending has picked up since the April tax increases.
'Over the last few weeks there have been more encouraging signs that
customers are coming back,' said Mr John Clare, group chief executive.
Dixons had a weak second half of the year to April but in the first nine
weeks of the current year sales are ahead 11 per cent with like for like
growth of 3 per cent. Last year sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.58bn.
Profits before tax and exceptional charges slipped from Pounds 76.7m to
Pounds 73.3m, in line with the company's warning in January following
disappointing Christmas sales.
The shares, which had been weak ahead of the figures, recovered 19p to 189p.
Earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, rose to 11.6p (9.8p) helped
by a lower tax charge and there is a final dividend of 4.9p for a total up
6.5 per cent to 6.6p.
After total exceptional charges of Pounds 238.5m the group recorded a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 165.2m. Most of the charge relates to goodwill
previously written off to reserves following the sale of its loss-making US
chain Silo to Fretter. There is also a Pounds 20m provision for closing more
high street stores in the Currys chain and Pounds 4.5m for the costs of
consolidating administrative functions.
Operating profits from UK retailing slid to Pounds 72.3m (Pounds 77.0m)
caused largely by a reduction in gross margins in Dixons and Currys. In
addition to the sharp fall in retail prices of computer games consoles
before Christmas there was aggressive competition and higher sterling
purchase costs. But the pressure on margins did ease towards the end of the
financial year.
Mr Clare said that Comet and some of the regional electricity companies in
particular had been chasing market share. But he added that early evidence
suggested the new warehouse clubs were having limited impact on the group's
local outlets.
Sales of extended warranties increased and Mr Clare said he was relaxed
about the Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the subject.
The Currys superstores again performed well with like for like sales up 7
per cent - compared with a 1 per cent decline in the high street shops - and
the shift towards cheaper out-of-town sites is being accelerated. There were
158 superstores at the end of the year, an increase of 27, and a further 35
are due to open this year. Since the year-end 74 high street Currys stores
have gone and a further 61 closures are planned by the end of this year,
largely completing the process.
In the Dixons chain like for like sales were down 3 per cent, reflecting the
steep fall in sales of computer games consoles and camcorders.
Mr Clare said that Dixons had seen strong growth in sales of mobile phones
'which has become a consumer market in the last few months'. He is
optimistic about the prospects for multimedia hardware and software
products.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Lufthansa returns to the black at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of cost-cutting and increased revenues helped Lufthansa make
pre-tax profits of DM100m (Pounds 40m) in the first half of 1994, the
airline said at the group's annual general meeting in Berlin.
This is the first time the airline has made a first-half profit in five
years. Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman, said the second half-year was
traditionally better than the first and he was confident the airline would
pay a dividend for 1994.
Ordinary shareholders last received a payout in 1989.
The chairman also spelt out details of the airline's privatisation plans,
saying Lufthansa hoped to hold the first tranche of a planned two-stage
rights issue this year, although the one-for-four issue of 7.6m new shares
could be postponed until next year if market conditions were unfavourable.
The second tranche is set to take place in the spring of next year.
The government, which holds a direct 51.4 per cent stake in Lufthansa, will
not take up its entitlement to new shares.
In a separate transaction, it will also sell off 2.3m shares. The effect of
these measures would be to reduce the government's stake in the airline to
about 35 per cent, analysts said.
The first stage of the rights issue is likely to be held at DM160 per share
or a discount of 20 per cent to the prevailing share price.
This will bring in DM1.2bn for the airline which repeated its complaint
yesterday about being poorly capitalised: after years of heavy losses, the
ratio of equity capital to debt stands at 17 per cent, less than half the
level at the end of the 1980s.
The DM100m pre-tax profit - reported by the Lufthansa parent company in the
first six months - compares with a loss of DM221m in the same period last
year, and follows a loss of DM82m in the first three months of the current
year.
Without giving any details, Mr Weber said the airline also broke even at the
operating level in the first six months of 1994, and that sales and capacity
utilisation had also increased.
The target for the year as a whole had been reached in the first six months,
he said.
The increase in profits reflects the airline's pre-privatisation
rationalisation which last year raised productivity by 15 per cent and
reduced costs by 10 per cent.
A second phase of rationalisation and restructuring, planned for next year,
is likely to improve Lufthansa's earnings by DM500m-DM700m a year, Mr Weber
stated.

FT  07 JUL 94 / G7 attacked for failing to cope with global monetary reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the global monetary system is urgently needed to reduce exchange
rate volatility, an independent group of experts headed by Mr Paul Volcker,
the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said yesterday.
The group criticised the consultative process of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries for failing to cope with the task and suggested that it
should be done instead by the International Monetary Fund with redefined
responsibilities.
The recommendations came in a report released yesterday by the Bretton Woods
Commission, which includes former senior ministers, central bankers and
private sector representatives. It urges sweeping reforms of the IMF and the
World Bank to reflect big changes in the financial environment.
The group said a long-term goal should be to establish 'a flexible system of
exchange rate bands' - or currency target zones - between the dollar, yen
and D-Mark.
However, a more stable exchange rate system would be feasible only if the
leading industrial countries reduced macroeconomic imbalances and achieved
greater economic convergence - for example, on inflation rates.
The experts said the costs of exchange rate misalignment and volatility were
high and had contributed to a halving of the long-term growth rate of
industrial countries to about 2.5 per cent a year from 5 per cent before the
collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in the early 1970s.
The alternative to reform was 'to continue the present non-system of loose
ad hoc co-operation, dominated by the G7 process'. That was unlikely to lead
to 'economic policies that are sound internationally as well as
domestically'.
While the impetus for reform had to come from the leading industrial
countries, the G7 process was not the best means to support the sustained
reform effort required. 'The G7 process is not an institution, a continuing
body, or an executive entity.' Its representation was narrow and it did not
even have a secretariat.
The experts said the task of devising and implementing a reform of the
global financial system should be entrusted to the IMF, which had 'much of
the necessary expertise'.
They said the IMF should concentrate on its global monetary responsibilities
and stop acting as a development agency - a role in which the World Bank had
a greater comparative advantage.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Customs to thwart reclaiming of VAT on leased cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government clamped down firmly yesterday on a tortuous tax avoidance
device which could cost it hundreds of millions of pounds a year in value
added tax refunds on company cars.
HM Customs &amp; Excise took the highly unusual step of circulating a warning to
businesses and their advisers that it would work with foreign tax
authorities to prevent the repayment of VAT on cars leased from other
European Union member states.
In a business briefing note, it said that a 'so-called tax planning scheme .
. . being promoted by some well-known firms of tax advisers . . . does not
succeed'.
The statement is an aggressive attempt to head off an effort to exploit
different tax laws across Europe, which the UK authority argues distort
competition.
In the UK, only a few industries such as cab companies and motor traders can
claim back VAT on the purchase of cars. The rest pay VAT - estimated at
Pounds 1.6bn in 1994. In other countries such as Germany the VAT is
refundable.
Price Waterhouse and several other large accountancy firms have spoken at
conferences and held discussions with clients recommending they take
long-term leases on cars with companies in countries where VAT on car sales
can be reclaimed.
To gain refunds, the cars would have to be leased by a non-UK company to a
UK client, imported to the UK and ultimately re-exported when the lease
expires.
'We are concerned that one or two firms are trying to drum up business,'
Customs said yesterday. 'The imagination of accountants is exceedingly
fertile. Our legal advice is that this won't work. This is a friendly note
to companies to reconsider their advice to save time, energy and money.'
Mr Nigel Cockburn, a tax partner with Price Waterhouse, said: 'I don't see
this as tax avoidance. All it is doing is taking advantage of the laws in
different countries, which is perfectly legal. Presumably, that's what the
single European market is about.'
Several UK clearing banks have already lodged appeals with the VAT tribunal
claiming that Customs' ability to forbid refunds of VAT on company cars is
incompatible with European law.
They have complained to the European Commission that the UK has failed
properly to implement the European sixth VAT directive, which would have
permitted refunds unless a specific exemption had been granted. The
commission is still waiting for an official response from the UK.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Water bills may rise to meet extra Pounds 520m in clean-up
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British householders could face even higher water bills next year as a way
of meeting additional environmental obligations handed to the water
companies yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
The government added another Pounds 522m to the bill water companies must
pay for treating sewage and cleaning up rivers over the next five years. Mr
Gummer told the industry regulator, Mr Ian Byatt, to take the additional
funding into account when fixing price limits for domestic bills.
The new money is equal to about Pounds 6 a year for each of Britain's 18m
households, but bills will rise more in some areas than in others.
Price formulas for Britain's 31 water companies are due to be announced on
July 28. They will already take into account a Pounds 14bn-Pounds 15bn
clean-up of waste water planned by the industry by 2000.
Mr Gummer's decision to add another Pounds 500m in environmental spending to
companies' obligations will inevitably lead to the charge that householders
will end up footing the bill. Water companies have increased their charges
to households by 67 per cent since privatisation in 1989.
'Consumers have been asked to pay a very large part of the burden of
investment and general upkeep of the system since privatisation,' said an
official at the National Consumers' Council. 'But there is no reason why the
cost of this environmental spending should be passed on.'
The consumers' council says the burden placed on householders is 'unfair'.
Companies should turn to other sources of finance such as the equity market
for investment capital. The council is to publish a report on water price
increases on Monday.
Companies hit hardest by the additional environmental spending will be North
West Water, which will be required to pay Pounds 130m for cleaning up the
Mersey basin, and Severn Trent Water, which will face an increase of Pounds
194m. The funds will be used to clean up sewage that is discharged into
rivers in particularly sensitive areas.
Mr Andrew Wheeler, a broker at NatWest Securities in London, said that the
additional spending would not make much difference to overall bills: 'When
you're looking at investment of Pounds 15bn, an extra Pounds 500m doesn't
seem that much,' he said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although its share price scarcely reflects it, Dixons has made great strides
in recent years. The company has done its best to extricate itself from
disastrous diversifications. More stringent management has been introduced
and some progress has even been made towards providing half-way decent
service in its shops. Dixons' accounts have been tidied up - despite it
slipping Pounds 5m of gilts sales through the interest receivables line. Yet
even these efforts may be insufficient to salvage its battered shares.
Dixons may have turned itself into a reasonable business. Unfortunately, its
main market seems to be turning against it.
Electrical retailing has always been a tricky game thanks to severe price
deflation. The added complication now is that too many others want to play.
Capacity is likely to increase sharply, making sales increases harder to
achieve. Dixons is itself accelerating its out-of-town opening programme.
Its chief rival, Comet, is doing the same. For some perverse reason,
cossetted regional electricity companies are also trying to become
rough-and-tumble shopkeepers. That suggests the industry's margin structure
will continue to be squeezed - especially now that warehouse clubs are
testing new price floors.
The only way to escape the capacity crunch would be to diversify. But given
Dixons' history, that might not be well received. Dixons' yield, which has
risen above the market average, offers some attractions. But it hardly
compensates for the risks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury will be pleased if measures to discourage short-selling -
backed yesterday by Mr Andrew Large, chairmen of the Securities and
Investments Board - are introduced before it sells its remaining stakes in
National Power and PowerGen. The government's last foray into the equity
market, the BT3 share offer, was blackened by allegations that the share
price had been driven down by short-sellers. Eurotunnel and Wellcome have
made similar complaints.
Since short-selling is an integral part of modern securities markets, an
outright ban would be a retrograde step. But the case for greater
transparency is strong. The hardline option would be to demand immediate
publication of all short sales going into a secondary offer. The
perpetrators could then be denied an allocation of shares. Yet publication
of the aggregate short position across the market might do just as well. The
market would then be able to see what lay behind a falling share price.
Speculative short-selling could not be used as a convenient scapegoat for a
badly-timed deal.
Such a publication requirement, perhaps combined with a US-style 'uptick
rule' which allowed short-selling only when the last movement in the shares
was up, would go a long way towards solving the problem. The move to
five-day rolling settlement planned for next year might also help by
allowing companies to see changes in their share register much faster than
the current system allows.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It almost looks as though leading industrial countries are willing the
dollar to drop. After German officials proclaimed the lack of need for a
rescue package at this weekend's Naples summit, the Federal Reserve
yesterday missed an opportunity to raise interest rates aggressively
following its Open Market Committee meeting. Yet this does not mean that
governments can get away with a course of benign neglect. The pressures
which have already produced two rounds of concerted intervention this summer
have not gone away. They will almost certainly intensify if the summit
ignores the currency issue.
Perhaps it would pay the authorities to wait until the market is short of
dollars. Intervention always works best when speculators are burnt. But the
strength of the D-Mark against other European currencies - yesterday the
French franc again fell below its old intervention floor - suggests Germany
cannot remain insouciant. Its European partners will soon complain about the
effect on their own bond markets of a strong D-Mark.
Ultimately the problem has more to do with bonds than absolute exchange
rates, which puts the US authorities in a quandary. Liquidity worries mean
that if they raise interest rates to stabilise the dollar, they risk
upsetting the bond market in the short term as much as if they do nothing.
But bond markets will not recover till the inflationary spectre is laid to
rest. Higher interest rates are thus inevitable despite the turbulence in
their train.

GEC is struggling to increase its earnings. Though the company warned last
December that profits would not advance substantially, yesterday's flat
full-year results took the market by surprise. There was no single factor
behind the disappointment apart from the competitive nature of most markets
in which GEC operates. Since that is not expected to change, the 8 per cent
dive in the company's share price looks appropriate.
If GEC can wisely invest its Pounds 2.8bn cash mountain, earnings would of
course move ahead strongly. But that is a big 'if'. Lord Weinstock, managing
director, has been casting around for the right deal since his 1989 Plessey
acquisition. Joint ventures with Italy's Finmeccanica and France's Thomson
are in the offing but neither will absorb much cash. Marconi may be
well-positioned for the much-heralded rationalisation of the European
defence industry but it could take a long time to materialise.
The scope for strategic moves in GEC's other businesses is limited. Given
that GPT's technology is intertwined with that of Siemens, it is hard to see
GEC taking independent action in telecommunications. GEC Alsthom may spend
some cash by taking equity stakes in power stations around the world but
again the sums will not be large. Equally, the promised rationalisation of
GEC's other businesses is welcome but may actually add to the cash pile.
Lord Weinstock is not inclined to take the alternative route of handing cash
back to shareholders. His appointment for another two years at GEC's helm
has put an end to that debate at present. But unless he can find the right
deal, his successor will be under pressure to switch tack.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Leading Article: New directions for the BBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's white paper on the British Broadcasting Corporation,
published yesterday, sets out two aims. The BBC should continue to be a
public service broadcaster 'serving the nation' and it should be equipped to
compete in the revolution under way in media industries worldwide.
These are appropriate, if ambitious, goals. The BBC is an institution of
great cultural and political significance; potentially, it is also a large
commercial asset. Prescriptions, however, are not easy. Technological
changes are eroding the barriers between television, telecommunications and
information-processing; there is no neat formula to spot or to nurture
winners.
Moreover, the government's record of media regulation has in recent years
been poor. Its piecemeal approach has spawned anomalies and unworkable
rules, notably the 1990 Broadcasting Act, intended to govern ITV's actions
for a decade, but already partly jettisoned. The patchy regulatory regime
governing satellite and cable television is also the subject of much
concern.
Given that history, the government is sensible to limit its main thoughts on
the BBC to a five-year horizon beyond 1996, when the current charter
expires. There will then be a further review about BBC funding, to take the
corporation to the end of a new 10-year charter in 2006.
Unaddressed problem
The main recommendation is that the BBC should keep the licence fee - a flat
rate payment by all owners of television sets - as the main source of
funding its public services, at least for the first five-year period. The
government has again concluded that the fee, although 'an oddity', is the
least bad way of hypothecating public funds to the BBC to enable it to make
and broadcast a mix of programmes distinct from those on offer from the
commercial channels.
The unaddressed problem is that the licence fee cannot last indefinitely; at
some point, a falling share of the audience will make such a universal tax
unsustainable. It may well be optimistic to imagine that it can be sustained
for the next seven years.
The second flange of the government's strategy is to urge the BBC to develop
alternative sources of income, especially in the rapidly growing world of
international broadcasting, but also to an unspecified extent in the
domestic cable and satellite market. The BBC, says the white paper, 'should
be able to evolve into an international multi-media enterprise'. The
government approves the corporation's recent spate of alliances with the
private sector and plans to repeal those parts of the 1990 Broadcasting Act
which tie it down.
Tricky questions
Those steps are the right ones for the BBC, but it is not clear that the
government has recognised just how many tricky questions they will raise.
Although the BBC is told that it must keep separate its commercial and its
publicly funded accounts and that it must trade fairly, it can only be a
matter of time before it is challenged by its private sector competitors for
unfairly cross-subsidising commercial services. At the same time, if the BBC
really wishes to exploit its newly sanctioned commercial freedoms, it will
bump regularly and hard against the government's borrowing limits, by which
it is still bound. Nor is it likely to be entrepreneurially fleet of foot,
in a world dominated by the likes of Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Ted Turner,
when every deal has to be approved in Whitehall.
The obvious question, ducked in the white paper, is why the BBC should not
be steered towards the private sector, there to engage freely in the
international marketplace, much as privatised British Airways has been able
to do.
The privatisation route is, of course, not without difficulties. There would
still be a need for public finance for truly non-commercial broadcasting and
problems exist in funding by both advertising and subscription, although
these are not insuperable.
What yesterday's white paper really does is to establish two BBCs in uneasy
harness with each other, one maintaining a familiar public service, the
other driving hard into global markets. Eventually a choice will have to be
made, but the government lacks the courage to make it now.

There is also, of course, Gaelic Football: a game for masochists played by

Who is the most popular world statesman in Poland today? Why, none other
than Bill Clinton, according to a poll conducted by CBOS, a leading Polish
pollster.
Rather odd really, when you consider Clinton is less than whole-heartedly
supportive of some Polish aspirations. The US president has declined to hold
a press conference in Warsaw today, thus saving himself the bother of
publicly repeating his 'yes - but not just yet' response to Poland's plea to
be allowed to join Nato.
The poll gives Clinton a 75 per cent approval rating - one point more than
Margaret Thatcher but significantly less than the 87 per cent George Bush
got in a similar poll in 1991.
Still, Clinton can bask in the glory of being more than twice as adored as
his host, president Lech Walesa; he gets a measly 35 per cent. Even Nelson
Mandela manages only 39 per cent; Boris Yeltsin gets 31 per cent.
And OK, polls lie - but they have their uses. This one at least can be waved
by John Major's supporters when they get tired of hearing scurrilous
suggestions of his greyness.
Major may not be popular in Poland - only 34 per cent of Poles like him -
but at least he's (relatively) big - only 42 per cent of Poles can't
identify him.
That's success: 62 per cent of the respondents are baffled when asked if
they know who Silvio Berlusconi is. A bit like Italy perhaps: 100 per cent
of Italians know Berlusconi is their prime minister - but how many know who
he is?

FT  07 JUL 94 / From abacus to automation: China is embarking on an
ambitious programme to overhaul its financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China has at last begun the tortuous process of reforming its unruly
financial sector with the referral of a new central bank law to the standing
committee of the country's parliament.
Among China's plethora of new laws and regulations guiding its economic
transformation, few items of legislation are more important. Not only does
the legislation seek to redefine and strengthen the People's Bank's
supervisory role over the banking system, it also makes clear that the
bank's primary responsibility is to lead the fight against inflation.
China, in its efforts to speed its integration with the world economy, is
seeking to build a central bank with the authority to match that of the
Federal Reserve of the US or Bank of Japan. At the same time, it intends to
reform its debt-burdened commercial banks along international lines.
That, at least, is the plan; but an enormous effort is required to convert
theory into practice in a financial system in many ways still rooted in the
age of the abacus. Among the most pressing tasks facing reformers is to end
the central bank's traditional role as milch cow for lossmaking state
enterprises. Mr Di Weiping, a deputy director of the bank, says that under
the new charter the People's Bank would be uncompromising in its fight
against inflation. 'We need a further tightening of money supply growth,' he
says. 'We are not going to compromise with state enterprises.'
Those fighting words reflect a newfound zeal among central bank officials
operating under new rules and with high-level political backing - senior
vice-premier Zhu Rongji is also People's Bank governor - but it is early in
the bank's transformation to a western-style central bank, and political
counter-pressures are certain to build.
As the state sector sinks further into the red in what is proving to be a
fairly brutal transformation from a state-controlled economy to a
market-driven system, so will demands intensify for an easing of credit.
Indeed, there have been indications in recent weeks of a loosening of the
purse strings, with funds being made available to keep faltering enterprises
afloat.
Since the Chinese Communist party's policymaking central committee gave
approval last November for sweeping changes to the financial system, China
has moved ahead fairly quickly on reforms aimed both at revolutionising the
People's Bank's role, and at removing responsibility for lending for
infrastructure projects from the four specialised commercial banks. These
institutions, which account for 90 per cent of the country's banking
business, include the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank,
People's Construction Bank and Bank of China.
Lending for China's vast infrastructure requirements, including such
projects as the UDollars 10bn Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze, will be
vested in the new State Development Bank and Agriculture Development Bank
(see accompanying article).
The wide-ranging banking reforms will also have profound implications for
western banks seeking to extend their reach in the China market but
frustrated by the difficulties of penetrating an archaic, inward-looking
system. At present, the 100 or so branches of foreign banks in China are
restricted to foreign currency business on behalf of joint ventures. But the
'commercialisation' of China's banking, allied with international pressure
on China to open its services sector - Beijing's desire to enter the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is being used as a lever by the US and others
 -will facilitate greater foreign involvement in the financial sector,
although progress will be slow.
Chinese officials acknowledge that their task is awesome, given that the
banking system has changed little in the more than four decades since the
Communists took over in 1949. At the People's Bank, for example, plans are
in hand to reorganise the bank from 'top to bottom'; it has 170,000
employees and 3,000 branches and sub-branches, many of which will be
redundant under the bank's new charter. The streamlining is intended to
enhance the bank's authority over monetary policy and its supervision of
financial institutions both at the centre and in the provinces.
Further evidence surfaced this week of the extraordinary difficulties facing
the central bank in imposing discipline on an unruly financial sector,
including, it seems, its own branches. According to the official Business
Weekly newspaper, the Shenzhen branch in southern China of the People's Bank
went ahead last year and approved the establishment of four investment funds
in defiance of regulations that only head office in Beijing had the right to
approve such funds.
People's Bank officials - who have been studying the German Bundesbank, Bank
of England, Singapore Monetary Authority, Bank of Japan and US Federal
Reserve, among others - plan to establish about a dozen regional centres
with increased responsibilities to impose much-needed discipline on local
financial institutions. In this respect, the Chinese central bank's evolving
structure will resemble that of the Federal Reserve - although the People's
Bank will have nowhere near the same degree of statutory independence as the
American model.
Independence was a key issue among Chinese leaders in their deliberations
about an appropriate relationship between the government and the central
bank. In the end, they decided that the People's Bank should be subordinate
to the state council (cabinet), but they also sought to define clearly the
bank's responsibilities to resist possible political interference.
Any dream of real independence for China's central bank may remain just
that. In the opaque Chinese system, where most important decisions are taken
far from the public gaze, the political clout of the top People's Bank
official will be the critical factor rather than the wording of the new
charter. The redoubtable Mr Zhu has made it clear that his role as central
bank governor is temporary. His successor, who will be appointed by the
state council, is unlikely to match his seniority.
For all the reservations of western economists and bankers about China's
ability to manage its way through a minefield of new financial reforms,
there are those who give Chinese reformists the benefit of the doubt in this
testing phase.
Mr Peter Bottelier, head of the World Bank's resident mission in Beijing,
praises measures already adopted this year. These included, principally,
unifying competing exchange rates, thus abolishing the managed official
rate, as a vital step towards full convertibility of the Chinese yuan by the
end of this century.
'I have not seen currency reform introduced so smoothly and with such
success,' said Mr Bottelier. 'They pitched it at the right rate (about
USDollars 1 = Yn8.7 compared with the previous official rate of Yn5.7), and
they kept monetary policy very tight, which is exactly what the currency
reforms needed.'
In turn, currency unification opened the way for the establishment of an
interbank market which began trading on April 1. The currency market in
Shanghai appears to be operating relatively smoothly, although foreign banks
were unhappy at being excluded for the time being.
Currency unification, an interbank currency market linked electronically
with some 20 cities nationwide, improvements under a World Bank-sponsored
programme to China's archaic payments clearing system, and eventually the
establishment of a short-term money market, are part of an effort to bring
the banking system into the 20th century.
But problems abound, including a singular lack of automation in the banking
system. Moreover, according to a 1992 report on China's banking system
prepared by Capital Intelligence, a Cyprus-based consultancy, 'modern
technology-based internal management programmes, such as asset and liability
monitoring, accounting and financial information systems, forecasting and
strategic planning are hardly available'.
The difficulties of transforming China's dominant four specialised banks are
thus immense, not least because these institutions are weighed down by a
huge burden of 'problem' loans. No reliable statistics are available for
what in the west would be described as 'non-performing' or 'doubtful' loans.
But a clue to the extent of the problem was given by China's State
Statistical Bureau, which reported that at the end of the March quarter
nearly 50 per cent of the country's 11,000 medium and large-sized state
enterprises were in the red.
Among China's myriad new laws and regulations is a new accounting law. It
aims to help establish new classifications for 'problem' loans which accord
with international standards. These would help banks to satisfy criteria
laid down for bad debt provision and ultimately open the way for much-needed
corporatisation - a Chinese half-way house to privatisation - of the
unwieldy banking system.
These and other gains could easily be squandered later under political
pressures if the government bows to demands from the state enterprise lobby
to maintain its access to cheap credit.
China's reformers know that financial sector reform, of which credit
controls are the key element, cannot succeed without strict discipline being
imposed. While they have made a respectable start, changes to the financial
sector have some way to go before they catch up with China's other market
reforms. At stake are China's considerable ambitions to integrate itself
with the international financial system.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Leader for the WTO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When almost 120 governments signed the Uruguay Round in April, they hailed
it as the most sweeping reform of the world trade system since the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was established 47 years ago. But the gains
promised by the round will be realised only if the impetus needed to agree
on the grand design is now applied with as much determination to its
execution.
Critical to the success of the endeavour will be the choice of a leader for
the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt early next
year. The WTO will have a formal institutional structure, clearer procedures
and stronger dispute settlement mechanisms. It will also enjoy a far wider
remit, embracing such issues as trade in services and intellectual property
rights.
However, the organisation's enhanced profile will be more than matched by
increased responsibilities. The most pressing is to implement the Uruguay
Round. As well as holding governments to their commitments to open trade in
heavily protected sectors such as agriculture and textiles, that will
involve developing a multilateral regulatory framework for areas such as
services and direct investment.
In tackling many of these questions, the WTO will inevitably find itself
encroaching on domestic policies, long regarded by governments as their
sovereign preserve. The potential for political frictions is clear. It will
almost certainly be heightened if the organisation yields to demands that it
plunge into contentious issues, such as the links between trade and labour
standards and environment policy.
Challenges ahead
These challenges must be addressed against a background of rapid change in
the world economic order. Many developing countries have overcome former
suspicions of the free market to embrace liberalisation. Meanwhile,
industrialised powers have grown defensive and equivocal in their commitment
to the multilateral trade system, of which they were once the main
proponents. The system's integrity is further threatened by the risk of
financial instability posed by capital flows and by the formation of
regional economic blocs, which may try to manipulate multilateral rules to
their advantage.
Much of the onus for charting a course through these turbulent
cross-currents will fall on the WTO and its head. What should be the
latter's priorities - and personal qualities? Obviously, the organisation
needs to be efficient and well-run. However, its head need not become deeply
immersed in its administrative and technical affairs, many of which can
safely be delegated. Nor should the boss be closely involved with the WTO's
disputes mechanisms, which will be judged largely on their impartiality and
independence.
Coherent leadership
By far the biggest task will be to give coherent direction and leadership to
world trade policy. That calls, first, for clear strategic vision and an
ability to set firm long-term objectives for enhancing global economic
welfare. Second, it requires the personal authority to persuade governments
that it is in their collective interest to put these goals above the narrow
pursuit of national advantage. The third prerequisite is political skills,
combining sensitivity to the differing domestic pressures on WTO members
with a flair for forging common ground between them.
The WTO leader must also command wide international confidence. For any
powerful member to try to impose a candidate would undermine that goal.
Above all, Europe, which has provided every Gatt director-general, should
not assume it has a special claim on the WTO post. Nor does Europe's current
introspection commend it as a recruiting ground.
Of the candidates declared so far, President Carlos Salinas of Mexico
appears to match up most closely to the requirements of the job. However, he
has still to say how he would tackle it, while others may yet enter the
race. If the WTO is to get the leadership it needs, it is important that the
choice of contenders be as wide as possible. They should also be encouraged
to state clearly the agenda they would follow and how they propose to put it
into effect.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Sturdy pillars of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yao Zhenyan, director of the new State Development Bank, feels that he is
carrying a 'heavy burden' in the bank's first months of operation.
The SDB, he says, in fulfilling its target of lending Yn80bn (Dollars 9.3bn)
this year for infrastructure projects, will be responsible for a significant
proportion of China's total credit plan. The bank, together with the Import
and Export Credit Bank and the Agriculture Development Bank, are pillars of
China's banking reforms. Their establishment is regarded by World Bank and
IMF officials as a crucial step in reorganising the banking sector.
Lending for infrastructure had long been a millstone around the necks of
China's specialised banks. The country's demand for capital to fund its
infrastructure requirements virtually dictated the new institutions'
formation.
Mr Yao said that the SDB, which is modelled on the Development Bank of
Japan, would concentrate lending in power generation, transport and
telecommunications - sectors where funding requirements are heaviest.
The Agriculture Development Bank, which is expected to begin operations
later this year, will shoulder a greater burden of lending for construction,
including of roads and railways, as well as support agriculture-related
projects such as water conservancy.
The SDB president said his bank would be run according to commercial
principles. He was adamant that it would not assume responsibility for the
non-performing 'policy loans' of the specialised banks. 'We say that old
problems should be solved through old channels. New problems should be dealt
with using new methods. If we took over the problem loans, our bank would go
bankrupt in three years.'
The establishment on July 1 of the Export and Import Bank of China is
another example of changes in the financial system. China, which is striving
for a niche among the world's top 10 trading nations, is signalling
determination to compete more aggressively.
Mr Tong Zhiguang, chairman and a former vice-minister of foreign trade, said
that the bank's activities would be 'critical to ensure that China's exports
sustain momentum'. He indicated that the bank's priorities would include
increasing exports of machinery and electronics, which presently account for
a quarter of China's average annual exports.
'In the long run,' Mr Tong said, 'our bank will facilitate China's
industrial restructuring that gives rise to more export-oriented
industries.' China's banks could hardly be accused of lacking direction.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: How 'Nimbies' will curb recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'Nimby', for the benefit of non-British readers, is someone who says 'not
in my backyard'. The word came into fashion in the 1980s to describe people
who were all in favour of economic growth and housing development in
general, but were fiercely opposed to it in their own vicinity.
It has often been justified by high-sounding references to preserving rural
England, maintaining local amenities and protecting areas of natural beauty.
But in practice the most important force behind it has been people's urge to
maintain and boost the value of their own property by suppressing new
building which could bring down values. An occasional subsidiary motive has
been a snobbish dislike of urban newcomers who might change the character of
semi-rural or outer suburban areas.
For the moment, Nimbyism is not a very live issue. Construction has lagged
well behind the rest of the economy in its recovery from recession. So have
house prices. After an initial small spurt at the beginning of 1994, house
prices are now no higher than a year ago.
This lack of a property boom so far is a good sign. Soaring domestic
property values have been an unhealthy development in each of the last few
booms. By giving rise to large paper gains in personal wealth, they
stimulated consumer borrowing and then left behind a legacy of debt which
prolonged the recession period. The property cycle is a magnified version of
the general boom and bust cycle, and accounts for much of the latter's
virulence.
But the effects are not only cyclical. In the period 1968-88 the prices of
new houses rose twice as fast as prices in general; and the price of housing
land rose on average twice as fast as house prices themselves. The
cumulative increase in the housing land price over the two decades was 350
per cent above inflation.
The resulting real increase in housing costs has discouraged workers from
moving to where the jobs are; it has increased the poverty of the less
skilled and discouraged them from taking low-paid work. Housing market
distortions are second only to labour market rigidities in causing
structural unemployment.
A sign of healthy and sustainable economic growth would be a long period in
which houses were bought as homes and not as a speculation, in which houses
became more affordable rather than less, and renting returned as a normal
form of house tenure, especially suitable for younger and more mobile
households.
In the short term, the housing stock is fairly stable and house prices
depend on demand. But the price of land has a big influence in the longer
term. For it determines the prices at which builders can profitably increase
the supply of dwellings to respond to rising demands. To the extent that
land is pure space, its price depends on the amount released for new
development.
A study*, commissioned by the Department of the Environment itself, gives
some estimates of the cost of Nimbyism. It rejects the extreme view that the
planning system puts a straitjacket on the amount of land available for
development.
There are three elements of elasticity in the supply of land for house
building. First, adjustments can be made to development plans at both the
structure and the local level. For instance, the Berkshire plan for
residential development was increased by the government in both 1983 and
1988 to allow for more housing.
There has been some modest streamlining of the planning system. As a result
of quicker decisions and improved organisation by house builders, the time
taken for the supply of land to respond to an increase in demand has fallen
from three years in the early 1970s to two years in 1990.
Unfortunately, however, successive secretaries of state for the environment
have become ever more restrictive in their willingness to release land for
development. 'One nation Toryism' has been identified more and more with the
interests of property holders in the shire counties and on the rural fringes
of the conurbations. Scrubland, which few people want to look at or use for
recreation, has been retained in green belts, along with areas such as the
South Downs and the Cotswolds.
A second element of elasticity is that additional housing land, known as
'windfall sites', can become available, even though they have not been
marked as such on the development plans. In Surrey, in the five years up to
1988, nearly four-fifths of the land used for new housing came from this
source.
Third, there are 'brownfield sites', which consist of land already used for
commercial or other urban purposes, but which becomes profitable to transfer
to residential use as housing land prices rise.
Nevertheless, the planning system has restricted the supply of building
land. The conclusion of the DoE study is that land supply controls of all
types have increased house prices in the south-east by 35 to 40 per cent,
and by lower but still substantial amounts in areas such as Yorkshire and
Humberside.
The table shows the way this has worked. In Reigate and Wokingham - two
semi-urban areas just outside London - plot values in 1990 were around half
those of corresponding house prices. Without planning restrictions, the land
would still have some value, which would be determined by what it would be
worth for uses outside housing. (The study identifies this with the
economists' idea of 'opportunity cost' - the value that the land has in its
next best use.)
It would be tempting to regard the next best use as being farming land,
where the value is often one-thirtieth or one-fortieth of what it is when
housebuilding is allowed. But the authors avoid this route because of the
cost of preparing land for housing purposes.
Instead, they estimate what a similar amount of land would cost in Barnsley,
where the scarcity premium is regarded as low. This establishes a
reservation price for what the land might fetch if there were no prospect of
planning permission for development or redevelopment. This reservation price
is subtracted from the actual price. The difference may be regarded as an
estimate of the effect of the scarcity of housing land on house prices. It
is put at 36 per cent for Reigate, 42 per cent for Wokingham - both just
outside London in the south-east - and 16 per cent even for Beverley in
eastern Yorkshire.
The planning system affects the form as well as the amount of new
developments. Because of the rising price of land, there has 'been a shift
away from the production of bungalows and semi-detached houses towards flats
and terraced houses'. Detached houses have also been designed to achieve
high densities. So far as the system discourages development such as the
cliff-top bungalows that disfigure the landscape east of Brighton, that is
to the good. But the overall effects on house and land prices are less
desirable.
The DoE study does not make policy recommendations. But it is clear that any
attempt at curbing future increases in land values would have to be at a
national level. Within even a large area, such as the south-east, there is a
great deal of substitution between different districts. For instance, an
increased release of land in Wokingham would do little to curb land prices
there, as new land would be snapped up by developers denied access
elsewhere. The extra land would have to be available throughout the
south-east.
Ministers have, in their reaction, over-emphasised the fact that land for
housing is physically available, which it always is for those willing to pay
the market price. The question is whether that price is unnecessarily
inflated by ill-conceived restrictions.

finance
</HEADLINE>

   From Dr KEITH HAMPSON MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Little noticed by the vast majority of UK exporters, a far-reaching
European Commission communication is in danger of slipping through this
summer which will put them at a severe disadvantage compared with their
European competitors.
The Commission understandably wants to eliminate distortion of trade within
Europe by cutting government involvement in that vital safeguard against bad
debts: short-term credit insurance. The effect of the competition
directorate's latest draft, however, will be to ban a large part of the
present arrangements whereby the UK government gives reinsurance support in
certain critical areas of short-term risk, helping to protect more than
Pounds 15bn UK exports each year, including luxury cars, textiles and
advanced electronic equipment.
At best the ban will mean extreme uncertainty for exporters while UK credit
insurers restructure their reinsurance. At worst it will mean they will have
a substantial part of their credit insurance support withdrawn altogether.
This will affect not only export orders but jobs.
It is not that the UK is again being difficult about its European
relationships. It is that our system of short-term credit insurance is
significantly different from theirs since the private market now provides
virtually all credit insurance support in the UK. Ironically, we have gone
further than anybody in removing government support; yet the Commission's
proposals will damage the remaining necessary government reinsurance in
certain areas while allowing the French and German governments to continue
to provide large-scale support for their monopoly state providers.
It is to be hoped that the British government will once again stand firm.

DAMAGE LIMITATION OR CRISIS? Russia and the Outside World
Edited by Robert D Blackwill and Sergei A Karaganov
Brasseys, Dollars 18.50, 352 pages
Amid the steady stream of books on the former Soviet Union, this one is
rare. It is concerned with a present, rather than a past, debate. Its
subject is one which consumes foreign offices worldwide: what place will the
states of the former Soviet Union, above all Russia, find for themselves in
the world? And, whatever that place is, will they find it peacefully?
Russia's actions are often seen, in the west, through the recently acquired
filter of 'neo imperialism'. This has been our over-correction to what was
on the Russian part an over-accommodation of western foreign policy goals
and strategies in the 12 to 18 months immediately after the August 1991 coup
and the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was a period which Sergei
Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe in Moscow and
co-editor of this book, calls 'the time of Mister Yes'.
The first signs that Russia's accommodation of the west could not be
sustained came in 1992, when President Boris Yeltsin abruptly cancelled a
visit to Tokyo because of pressure from increasingly powerful nationalist
politicians who thought he would return to the Japanese some or all four of
the Kurile Islands, which the Soviet Union seized after the second world
war.
By late 1993, Russia's leadership was obviously groping for an independent
position. A military doctrine was approved which legitimised intervention in
the 'near abroad' (former Soviet states) and allowed for a first nuclear
strike.
The world was told that Russia could no longer 'say yes' when the
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky began his extraordinary run in the December
1993 parliamentary elections. Both President Yeltsin and Andrei Kozyrev,
foreign minister, made watershed speeches. Early this year, Yeltsin said
that emphasis would be placed on 'the defence of Russia's national
interests, of the rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking populations
within the guidelines of international law and proceeding from the idea of
all-national solidarity'. These were phrases which, in their vagueness, were
the more threatening. Kozyrev, claiming that the 'main threats' to Russia
came from the near abroad, told senior Russian diplomats: 'I think that
raising the question about complete withdrawal and removal of any Russian
military presence from the countries of the near abroad is just an extreme,
if not extremist, suggestion'. These remarks, as reported by the official
news service, could have applied to troops in the Baltics, which Russia had
pledged to withdraw - but the interpretation was denied.
It is easy to show that these words have been fleshed out with actions and
thus used to construct a neo-imperialist scenario: Russian intervention in
Moldova, Georgia, the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Tajikistan; threats to
Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine (over Crimea); claims to primacy in all things
among members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Russian bear
would seem again aroused, sharp-clawed and snarling.
However, the basic message of the book - there are many disagreements within
it - is that this is not yet the case. It could, however, become so,
especially if the west assumed imperialist designs and reacted accordingly.
Russia will have to dominate the 'near abroad' but, argue most Russian
contributors, this is not imperialism because it is forced on her.
Says Karaganov: 'Russia must choose between (1) partial reintegration of
parts of the former Soviet Union in a confederative-like structure, along
with management of instability in the rest of the former Soviet states; and
(2) the creation of a system of dependent and dominated states with only
formal independence, along the model of US relations with central American
states. The second choice is bad but preferable to the first. This decision
will face Moscow whoever is in power.'
Igor Klyamkin, a Russian historian whose essay on democracy in Russia is one
of the best things in a good book, argues that the west should recognise
Russia as the hegemonic regional power in exchange for its commitments to
democratic development.
Andrei Kortunov, head of foreign policy at Moscow's Institute of USA and
Canadian Studies, observes accurately that 'off the record, (US) State
Department officials often talk in favour of a Russian sphere of influence
in Eurasia. But the toughening Russian policy towards the former republics
will force the White House to distance itself from the Kremlin's political
and military claims at least at the level of rhetoric . . . The former
Soviet republics might need resolute and firm western leadership more than
ever before, but the west is less prepared than ever to provide this
leadership.'
The Kremlin appears to have imbibed this message. We can thus expect a
Russian policy moderated by considerations of the western response only
insofar as that response touches vital Russian interests; and there is
disagreement in Moscow over how vital financial aid is considered to be.
Robert Blackwill, a Harvard academic and former diplomat, warns of the need
to 'get ready for a crisis generated by Ukrainian fragmentation'. But the
west - as Kortunov notes - does not want to be bothered with this. The
problem will thus, by default, be left to the Russians, who, since they
favour integration, will face opposition, possibly armed, from Ukrainian
nationalists.
'Historians,' conclude Blackwill and Karaganov, 'are unlikely to be kind to
western and Russian leaders who failed to take advantage of the
extraordinary opportunity that presented itself in the period immediately
following the Soviet collapse.' Damage Limitation or Crisis? leaves little
doubt that the main authors believe that this failure is well along the
road. If so, we are indeed in for trouble.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No virtue in a protectionist bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W A N JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly debases the whole discussion and damages his case by the
wholly unfounded accusation that Euro-sceptics (not the word he uses) wish
to erect 'a huge stone wall' between the UK and Europe ('The centre of
attraction', July 5). This is untrue and I challenge him to justify this
gross exaggeration.
What many of us are desperately worried about is that the UK should be part
of an increasingly protectionist bloc which resists change and which will
increasingly create unnecessary conflict with the inhabitants of other parts
of the world. The most fully developed policy of the EU is the Common
Agricultural Policy. This has wasted resources on a scale that would pass
belief if it had not occurred and its restrictive nature stultifies attempts
to rebuild economic relationships with the countries of eastern Europe and
with the states which until recently formed part of the Soviet Union.
There is logic and virtue in arrangements which would allow the citizens and
traders of the European Union to trade freely with their counterparts
overseas. There is no logic, nor virtue, in rules which give preference to a
few nations near one another in western Europe and which put the rest of the
world on the other side of the trade barrier - along that road lies future
conflict on a global scale.

outdated welfare system (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J M HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your thoughtful leader, 'The wages of inequality', did not go deep
enough.
The welfare system we have today was essentially the creation of the
distinguished economist Sir William Beveridge, later Lord Tuggal. His
report, signed by him alone, was published as a white paper in 1942. Its
main feature was a scheme of social insurance against 'interruption and
destruction of earning power and for special expenditure arising at birth,
marriage or death'.
Beveridge reflected the national mood of the time. The country was united by
war and determined to avoid a repetition of the enormous social damage done
by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The structure he conceived has
achieved its original purpose handsomely. It is a tribute to the underlying
thinking that it has lasted more than 50 years. But it is now out of date.
The mood and the environment of the 1990s are totally different. We have
four decades of boom/bust cycles behind us and yet another developing round
us. General levels of affluence and the expectations of beneficiaries are
two or three orders higher. We are learning the hard way the political and
economic limits to what modern society can and will support by way of
benefits; and at the same time that a significant degree of unemployment may
be endemic. The proportion of society which is past earning age and
therefore past contributing to the system has markedly increased. The
fundamentals and the objectives of social insurance require a complete
rethink.
We need another Beveridge, to design a system for the 21st century. Nothing
short of this will get us anywhere.

<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The decline in male employment since 1970 has been nothing like as
great as portrayed by your editorial, 'The wages of inequality' (July 5),
which used data on employees only - thereby ignoring the rapid growth in
self-employment as well as in those on training schemes.
Comparing 1970 and March 1994, the male workforce in employment declined
from 15.9m to 13.7m, while for women there was an increase from 8.8m to
11.6m. Comparing 1970 with 1990 - years more similar in relation to the
business cycle - the decline in male employment from 15.9m to 15.2m was
quite slight.
The prediction by Patricia Hewitt, of the Institute of Public Policy
Research, that 'by the end of this year women will already be half the
British workforce' is clearly faulty - and is likely to remain so unless
women completely forswear childcare in the home and men withdraw from
economic activity.
Even less persuasive is her advocacy of work-sharing as a solution to
unemployment - rather than putting the unemployed to work to satisfy unmet
needs for goods and services. Thus, the faster is productivity growth, the
greater is the scope for meeting unmet needs through utilising the UK labour
force more fully.
Work-sharing, except on a voluntary basis, is a counsel of despair and not a
politically attractive policy option.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: An eager throng for Lieder winner - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wigmore Hall was packed on Tuesday, for a young German baritone who has
never sung here and whose recordings have not reached Britain. The fact that
he was a winner in some important Lieder competitions four and five years
ago would hardly explain the eager throng. Rather, what drew them was the
Wigmore's advance brochure, with the vital information that Gorne has been
the chosen pupil of both Fischer-Dieskau and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,
master-artists who do not take on apprentices lightly.
Sure enough, he proved to be a marvel in late Schubert songs - the
Schwanengesang collection, amplified by other songs on Seidl verses. The
words were utterly limpid, and thoughtfully penetrated. The voice has a
potent individual appeal: essentially a high baritone, with lovely ascents
into head-voice but with the manly weight of a deeper instrument. (It was
only in 'Der Atlas', of which he made a very good fist, that we noticed his
toneless bass.) In detail, the joining of note to note was exquisite. There
was never a lapse in the stream of cultivated tone, nor any unconvincing
musical phrase, nor yet any German consonant fudged for the sake of
smoothness.
In short, Gorne was a rare pleasure to hear. Not exactly 'mature beyond his
years' as a performing artist - he never attempted the sharp dramatic
thrusts that lit up Schwarzkopf's and Dieskau's interpretations; but a
prodigy, beyond argument, of fluid musico-technical perfection. He was born
in Chemnitz, and trained originally in Leipzig; like his older compatriot
Olaf Baer, he is the product of a thorough, old-fashioned training which put
a premium on solid musicianship and still left a kind of innocence intact.
His sophisticated polish was surely acquired through his famous Western
teachers. At the moment, he seems temperamentally most at home with
Schubertian melancholy, as in 'Kriegers Ahnung', 'Ihr Bild' and 'Die Stadt'
 -winning performances, every one. His accompanist here was the veteran
Irwin Gage, intent upon leaving the young singer the spotlight and all the
room he wanted. Lighter and brighter songs were a bit tame: the pigeon
go-between in 'Die Taubenpost' was plainly ambling, not flying. All in all,
however, Gorne sets an extraordinary standard which very few young Lieder
singers now can hope to match.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: Jansons and the LSO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This concert was part of the City of London Festival, though there was
little to alert the audience to the fact. There was no mention of the
festival in the evening's programme and if the Barbican has any City of
London Festival leaflets on display, I did not find them.
On the festival's side this is hard to explain. It is hardly plausible that
it would want to hide any connection with a concert by the London Symphony
Orchestra under Mariss Jansons, when the Corporation of London itself funds
the Barbican Centre and is the principal sponsor of the orchestra. The
standard achieved by these performers on Tuesday was also predictably high.
Neither Jansons nor the violinist Midori has been particularly associated
with Brahms in the past, so a performance by them of the Violin Concerto was
likely to view the work from an unusual slant. In the event, Midori played
the notes with exemplary cut-glass precision, fired with plenty of
spontaneity, but the result was still brittle. There is a warm contentment
at the heart of this music (Anne-Sophie Mutter's deep-seated relaxation as a
performer homes in on it naturally) whereas Midori is always looking for
tension. The rosy glow of Brahmsian colours does not feature on her tonal
palette.
The sturdy, rich texture of Brahms's orchestra is not second nature to
Jansons either, but his ability to render an orchestra's sound crystal clear
is so remarkable that complaining is out of the question. Given that he has
never before shown ambitions as a Wagnerian (has he ever conducted any of
the operas?) a selection of orchestral numbers from Wagner's operatic output
was quite a novelty.
The key item here was the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde.
Cultured, perfectly balanced, onwardly flowing, flamboyant in the most
exquisitely judged way, the performance shared characteristics with one of
the most highly-regarded Wagnerians of the day: Carlos Kleiber, whose
Tristan has passed into legend, not least because he never conducts it any
more. The Funeral March from Gotterdammerung followed, then the Ride of the
Valkyries - pure Jansons this number, bringing in the big tune on the
trombones like the arrival of the heavy squad, then whipping up the pace to
the end. The LSO responded to him with splendid playing.
Perhaps an opera-house somewhere might take the plunge and give Jansons a
whole Wagner opera. Admirers of this exciting conductor in London, however,
will in future have to cross the river to see him with the London
Philharmonic, for whom he is now principal guest conductor. They had better
use his talents to the full.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: A Collier's Friday Night - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DH Lawrence was a very good playwright. A Collier's Friday Night was written
around 1906 when Lawrence was 21 and, in the author's own words, 'before I'd
done almost anything.' He described it as 'most horribly green'.
The text was not published until 1934 and according to the record books,
which may of course be wrong, the piece went unproduced until 1965 when it
was performed without decor at the Royal Court. The Court put on a season of
Lawrence plays, including Friday Night, three years later. The edition of
the play in my local library had not been taken out since August 1975.
John Dove, the director at the Hampstead Theatre, is something of a
specialist in Lawrence drama, and it shows. Every loving detail of the
collier's house is there: the huge kettle on the hob, the home-baked bread,
the lamps, the way of washing without baths. But it is not only the detail
that scores. As a play, Friday Night is not remotely green; it is quite
remarkably mature.
One may ponder the date of writing. Around 1906 European theatre was at one
of its all-time highs. Lawrence, the student, must have read Ibsen, Shaw,
Wilde and the rest of them, even if he had not seen their plays. Friday
Night is up with the best of that other contemporary writer, Harley
Granville Barker.
Some will enjoy the play for what it foreshadows of Lawrence's later novels,
notably Sons and Lovers. It is closely autobiographical: educated son of a
miner, but whose mother is much more middle class. There is also the
mother's jealousy of the son's girl-friend.
Yet the play stands it is own right. The nearest analogy currently on the
London stage is Githa Sowerby's Rutherford &amp; Son, written in 1912 and
showing at the Cottesloe. Both depend heavily on a mixture of social realism
and feeling. Both are surprisingly sympathetic to the main male figure:
superficially a tyrant, but not to be wholly condemned.
In Rutherford &amp; Son the man is a factory-owner. In Friday Night he goes down
the pit. Played by Edward Peel, he is a strong handsome figure, especially
when the grime is off. One can see why his wife (the everlasting Barbara
Jefford) fell for him in the first place. He is not a stereotype; as he
points out, he has allowed his son a college education, despite the son's
resentment of his father's manners. Moreover, practically all the members of
the family have moments of brutality resembling their father's. This is a
family study.
It is not all quarrelling. There is a lovely line when the son reads in the
Derby newspaper of the death of Swinburne and a superb vignette as the
miners discover the workings of the newly invented fountain pen: 'It works
just like a pump'. Indeed Dove's triumph as director lies in not overdoing
the intensity.
Ernest, the earnest son, is played by Dominic Rowan who rightly lets the
role develop as the play goes on. He may be educated, but he is not
tolerant. The design by Robert Jones and the lighting by Mark Henderson
belong to the top of the first division in any theatre.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: Several herrings short of a catch - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STAGGERED (15) Martin Clunes
NEEDFUL THINGS (15)Fraser C. Heston
WILD TARGET (15) Pierre Salvadori
THE SAINT OF FORT WASHINGTON (15) Tim Hunter
GO FISH (18)Rose Troche
To be a filmgoer is to be caught in an eternal duel for your attention
between two weapons: the exclamation point and the question mark. You hope
the first will triumph, and that you will be painlessly lanced by delight,
hilarity or amazement. More often the second prevails. Queries lodge in your
head like fish-hooks. You cannot enjoy the movie because you keep asking:
Why would such-and-such happen to So-and-So, and what on earth is the logic
of Whatsisname doing whateveritis.
Take Staggered, a British comedy. In three days, toy demonstrator Neil
(Martin Clunes) is to marry pretty Hilary (Sarah Winman). But on stag night
his prospective best man Gary (Michael Praed) drugs him and helicopters him
off to a remote Scottish island.
So far, so logical. Gary is enamoured of ex-flame Hilary and wants to push
Neil out of the picture. It is after our hero awakes naked on his shingle
that the film starts to look several herrings short of a full catch.
First Neil, finding the only phone booth for miles around, makes a
reverse-charge call to Gary, whom we see answer it without any 'Will you
accept the call?' preliminaries from the operator. Then when Neil is
directed by Gary to an Aberdeen Airport locker where he will find proper
clothes (he hitches a lift from a passing supply plane), we watch him
embarrassedly change into the clothes right there in front of two cleaners.
Why? It is a minor point - but why not use the airport loo?
Shortly after that Neil is arrested on touchdown at Newcastle Airport by the
local Chief Inspector (John Forgeham), who speaks with a Birmingham accent.
Why? Then we learn that it is apparently the habit in Newcastle for a busy
Inspector to stay handcuffed all night to his captive as the latter lies in
bed. Why? Then when the captive wants to make a vital telephone call in a
hospital, the only available phone is in the morgue. Why? So that plot
wheels can turn and Neil can meet his girlfriend-to-be, a vampiric
pathologist called Carmen (Anna Chancellor).
And so on. I looked at my scribbled notes after the film and each one began
with 'Why?' Comedy is lost without logic, for it is the art of taking that
logic and tickling it until it unbends into chaos. If you begin with an
illogical premise - let alone an army of them - what 'undoing' is there to
laugh at? Faced with a senseless world, what is funny about additional
senselessness? Persons to blame: writers Simon Braithwaite and Paul
Alexander. Person to pity: Martin Clunes, who as well as acting was drafted
in late to direct.
Then there is the horror side of question-mark cinema. In Needful Things,
directed by Fraser C. Heston (Charlton's son) from Stephen King's novel, why
does the promising plot about the Devil visiting a small New England town,
in the guise of antiquarian Max Von Sydow, go so remorselessly to pieces?
Von Sydow sells each townsperson the object of their dreams in exchange for
a diabolical favour. So a strongish cast - Amanda Plummer, Ed Harris, Bonnie
Bedelia - spends its time maiming, murdering or tormenting their fellows.
Mr Von Satan, you see, wants to set the town on its ears. By pricking
everyone into acts of motiveless spite - as in Strangers On A Train person A
does person B's dirty work and so on - he ignites dormant grudges into a
conflagration of hate.
But wait. Why, as soon as the townspeople twig to the disproportion between
the gratification of their modest wishes and the heinous crimes required of
them, do they not boot the old devil out of town? Why does it take two hours
of screen-time to finger Old Max as Old Nick? Answer: because none of these
townspeople is a living character, merely a pawn in King's plot. What is
more, the plot is an old one. It was done before not just by
Highsmith/Hitchcock, but by novelist Dashiell Hammett in Red Harvest. And
done much much better.
We must not be dogmatically 'either-or' about the question mark/exclamation
mark issue. Some films mix the two together. From France Pierre Salvadori's
comedy Wild Target is nearly all exclamation: with its sweetly logical plot
about a fussy hit-man (Jean Rochefort), his stumbling apprentice (Guillaume
Depardieu) and the pretty girl they turn from quarry into protegee (Marie
Trintignant).
The parrot jokes are excellent. Rochefort's Victor Meynard - part Clouseau,
part Phileas Fogg - is impeccably developed. And some lines get a roar.
'Medium height, medium build, medium moustache' bumbles the villain's
henchman to his boss, trying to describe the unknown assassin he has just
glimpsed. 'Victor Meynard]' declaims the instantly enlightened boss. Only a
brief outbreak of over-contriving in mid-movie turns our smiles into frowns.
(How could those Spanish guitarists have got to that car crash scene?)
As for The Saint Of Fort Washington, an initial flurry of where-are-we's -
as Matt Dillon is demoted to down-and-out status in dingiest New York and no
less precipitately becomes soul-buddy with black street-sleeper Danny Glover
 -compose themselves into a movie that leavens social-realist sentimentality
with moments that more sharply expose NY's welfare system and geography. The
last-scene visit to the city's dumping ground for the homeless dead, in a
mass unmarked grave on a neighbour island, is chillingly moving.
But the best film of the week is Go Fish: all exclamation points and no
queries. We may be unfamiliar with lesbian life in 1990s Chicago, but not
after this. A comedy of counter-culture manners directed by Rose Troche and
co-written by her and the film's star Genevieve Turner - she plays the kooky
girl with the back-to-front baseball cap - it is very funny and
discombobulatingly frank. Are there any Sapphic courting rites you do not
know about? Or any female body parts you do not know gay women's favourite
nickname for? Again: not after this.
The film was made with what must have been someone's loose change after a
wild night at the disco. Grainy black-and-white rules. The sound recording
is basic. And the camera clambers over rough-lit faces and bodies and
furnishing items, like a house guest trying to find his or her sleeping bag.
But after the doggerel of the week's commercial film-making, this is free
verse by a genius. The offhand-funny dialogue is a delight. It mixes spoof
gusts of agitprop correctness - 'She doesn't seem to be interested in her
own oppression' - with a raunchy wit and candour that male chauvinists
(straight or gay) will be shocked to discover is not their exclusive
preserve.
At the centre: a love affair between the pretty Max (Ms Turner) and the
pikestaff-plain Ely (VS Brodie). This begins by defying probability -
especially when beaky Ely increases her mirror-cracking potential by shaving
her long hair into a punk cut - but ends by totally charming and persuading
us.
Around the amorous knot-tiers gather such exotics as Kia, Evy and Daria,
swapping one-liners or lying in heads-together truth-game sessions under the
one flashlight that seems to serve for the film's lighting equipment. By
rights this film should have been an amateurish, doctrinaire chunk of
sexual-minority special pleading. Instead it is the best film of the season
and could well be the most charming film of the year.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Technology: Revved up for a simple shift in gear - John
Griffiths reports on the race to perfect a new transmission system that will
revolutionise vehicle manufacture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rivalry is developing between two groups, Dutch and British, over
innovations that could make conventional gearboxes redundant. Continuously
variable transmission (CVT) systems are claimed to be more efficient and
easier to use than the usual manual or automatic gearboxes.
The claim is made by Van Doorne's Transmissie of the Netherlands and the
British Technology Group, whose transmission systems have been developed
separately and work on different principles.
Although sales of the CVT systems that have appeared on the market and which
have been confined to small cars are relatively disappointing, the rivals'
activities are assuming significance for the world's car makers for two
reasons.
First, Van Doorne, whose CVT technology is the only one used in cars on
public sale, appears to have overcome engineering and other hurdles which
have so far confined its system's commercial application to low-powered
small cars. It has undergone trials successfully in Chrysler's Voyager
multipurpose vehicle and a prototype has survived the 700-plus horsepower
punishment provided by a Williams-Renault racing car in a three-year
development programme.
Second, BTG has signed Ford as the first licensee for its Torotrak
subsidiary's 'infinitely variable' transmission. Ford is considering
Torotrak for fitting to the successor to its Mondeo/Contour medium-sized
'world' car at the end of the decade.
BTG says several other licensing agreements are about to be signed after
more than three decades of development work on the transmission. It
maintains the Torotrak IVT will cost no more to produce than a conventional
four-speed automatic, while offering significant performance, flexibility
and fuel economy advantages.
According to BTG's development engineers, it has shown fuel consumption
savings of at least 15 per cent compared with a manual gearbox and a
reduction in exhaust emissions of around 30 per cent. Unlike all other forms
of transmission, including Van Doorne's, it requires no clutch to begin
moving and it is claimed to be simpler and cheaper to produce than other
systems.
Torotrak could be BTG's biggest commercial coup. Production could run to
millions of units a year if the IVT provides a more efficient and adaptable
transmission for vehicles from mechanical diggers to buses and racing cars.
The IVT has been under development, under various owners, since 1960. It is
the variator mechanism, a few inches square, that lies at the heart of the
Torotrak system and which, BTG insists, makes it a viable proposition for
almost any type of vehicle. BTG believes that this holds the key to
resolving the awkward compromise represented by current engine/gearbox
systems.
An engine needs to rev fairly fast to produce its available power and has
relatively low torque, or pulling power, at tickover. A clutch and a range
of gears are, therefore, required to allow the car to pull away from
standstill and move progressively to highway speeds. During much of this
sequence, the engine is operating outside the fairly narrow range at which
it is most power- and fuel-efficient.
A conventional automatic gearbox replaces the manual clutch with a hydraulic
torque converter. This has a similar function to the clutch but saps
considerable amounts of energy, increasing fuel consumption. It, too,
usually has only four gears so it also only rarely allows the engine to
operate at maximum efficiency. The pursuit of greater flexibility is
encouraging some transmission makers to build in five speeds, but this
increases cost and complexity.
The current small crop of CVTs in everyday use, all using Van Doorne's
technology, is manufactured by Ford for itself and Fiat; Volvo (also used by
Rover), Subaru and Nissan are also using it. They allow the engine to
operate at its optimum speed for fuel economy or power, depending on how the
accelerator is used. However, they are relatively costly.
Torotrak offers the same ability to select the correct drive ratio for any
combination of speed and load.
But it requires no clutch and has no similar mechanisms to the expandable
pulley system that makes the Van Doorne concept work.
The variator contains two power input discs which are driven, via a
torsional damper, by the engine. Between them are two inner discs from which
power is transmitted. Crucial to the concept is that the working face of
each disc is curved. Between each set of inner and outer discs are three
rollers. The angle of these rollers equates to the input/output ratio.
Because the rollers can take up any angle within the spacial limits of each
cavity, these ratios are effectively infinite.
Forces are transmitted between the discs and the rollers by a traction
fluid, which under increasing loads becomes semi-solid and thus capable of
transferring power through a shearing action. The system requires only a
simple forward/reverse lever and if fitted to a powerful car could provide a
motorway cruising ratio of up to 60 miles per hour per 1,000 rpm.
An electronic engine management system translates driver commands conveyed
through the accelerator pedal into optimum engine performance, for maximum
acceleration or cruising economy. However, because it is the powertrain's
torque that is being directly controlled, not gear ratios, all kinds of
characteristics can be built in through the controlling computer.
It would be easy, for example, to program six or seven distinct ratios for
drivers who wanted the feel of a sports car, says Maurice Martin, one of the
BTG executives in charge of Torotrak. The Torotrak system is not confined to
vehicles and could be used to optimise the rotation of
electricity-generating windmills.
Several other big advantages are claimed: the transmission has far fewer
parts than a conventional system and requires no complex machining and no
high-performance materials. Also, the traction fluid separates working
surfaces so the transmission should last longer than a conventional unit.
BTG has invested Pounds 6m in the system since 1988. It has been working
with Ford for several years, beginning with a prototype transmission in an
Orion saloon. Ten Mondeos are to be fitted with the transmissions by early
next year and will be evaluated by high-mileage users such as the police.
Ford remains cautious about whether it might eventually take out a
full-scale manufacturing licence. 'This represents one of the many efforts
within Ford to study technologies that could improve customer satisfaction
while being environmentally friendly,' says Adam Mirren, Ford's powertrain
research manager.
Van Doorne has no doubt its initiative is a front runner. Its
newly-developed, 'second generation' lightweight steel compression belts
used to drive the expandable pulleys of its system provide the basis for
transmissions usable 'across a manufacturer's complete range', it says.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Technology: From socialism to free enterprise - Clive
Cookson on the forthcoming flotation of the British Technology Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Technology Group, whose roots lie in socialism and state
intervention, is set to take the final step towards free enterprise:
flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
Its business - managing intellectual property rights through the licensing
of patents and know-how - is unlike any other quoted company. The BTG
portfolio includes 1,400 individual technologies and 10,000 patents and
patent applications, ranging from drugs to plastic processing, from crop
protection to magnetic resonance imaging.
BTG is a direct descendant of the National Research Development Corporation
and the National Enterprise Board, founded by Labour governments in 1949 and
1974 respectively to support the commercialisation of British research in
the UK. It was privatised in 1992, in the face of opposition from some
university scientists who feared that as a private company BTG would neglect
their long-term interests in the search for profits.
The government decided then, on the advice of its advisers Price Waterhouse,
that flotation was not the right way to privatise BTG. One reason, according
to a recent National Audit Office report, was that 'the company's
specialised activities, combined with a declining performance and
unpredictable environment, meant the sale would not have a wide appeal'.
BTG was sold instead to a management-led consortium of staff, financial
institutions and universities, for Pounds 27.8m.
Now the management, led by Ian Harvey, chief executive since 1985, and Jack
Leonard, who became chairman last year, has decided that the group's
progress over the two years since privatisation justifies a share sale 'as
soon as market conditions improve'. That could be late this year or - more
likely - next year. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, has been appointed
to advise on the flotation.
The main reason for floating, according to Rusi Kathoke, BTG finance
director, is that high interest rates at the time of privatisation left the
company with an unhealthily narrow capital base. The company aims to raise
Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m, primarily to help fund greater international
exploitation of its
portfolio.
Valuing BTG will be difficult because there are no comparable quoted
companies in the UK or elsewhere and BTG's financial record is patchy. The
most recent results, for the year to 31 March 1994, show pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.16m on turnover of Pounds 29m, following losses of Pounds 3.89m in
1992-93 and Pounds 3.11m in 1991-92. However the 1994-95 results will be
less good because the last of BTG's money-spinning patents for pyrethrin
insecticides expires this year.
Discounted cash flow analysis, applying different risk factors to BTG's
various income streams, suggests a market valuation in the region of Pounds
50m.
BTG has been adjusting to the expiry of the patents on cephalosporin
antibiotics and pyrethrins, which were its main sources of revenue in the
past. That leaves magnetic resonance imaging as the biggest single income
source; all sales of MRI scanners anywhere in the world will yield royalty
income until 2002.
Since privatisation BTG has become more focused, Harvey says. 'Our business
is the management of intellectual property. We are not a venture capital
company and we are not consultants. We look for and acquire technology with
commercial potential; if necessary we put our own funds into developing it.
We then patent it in world markets and grant non-exclusive licences for its
exploitation,' he says.
UK universities and research establishments are the group's traditional
source of technology. Until 1986 they were obliged to put the exploitation
of publicly funded research in BTG's hands, and many continue to do so
voluntarily.
Since losing its monopoly hold on UK state-funded research, BTG has
developed new technology sources: companies, particularly in the US, such as
ITT and Johnson &amp; Johnson; and overseas universities including Amsterdam and
Princeton. Harvey insists that BTG's global expansion will leave it better
placed to serve the long-term interests of UK academic researchers.
BTG has identified a 'top 12' from the 1,400 individual technologies in its
portfolio, which it expects to provide the best commercial returns over the
next 15 years. One is Torotrak. Others include natural pesticides to follow
up the pyrethrins, anti-cancer drugs, a plastic injection moulding technique
called Scortec, non-woven textiles and dental cements.

Musical chairs at Mills &amp; Allen, one of the UK's leading outdoor media -
poster - groups, a subsidiary of the French advertising and media group
Avenir Havas Media.
Philippe Santini (right), 44, currently Mills &amp; Allen's chief executive for
the past four years, is off to become directeur general of Avenir France, a
company with a FFr 1bn annual turnover, some three times larger than Mills &amp;
Allen.
There Santini will be in charge of a staff of 900, who operate 49,000 poster
sites across France. Colm OCuilleanain will be moving after 11 years as
managing director of David Allen, another AHM subsidiary and one of
Ireland's leading outdoor specialists, to take over from Santini.
Santini will be remaining chief executive and chairman of Sky Sites, the
international airports advertising group within the AHM orbit. Santini has
been with the group since 1980, when he joined Avenir-AHM as a product
manager, later becoming head of research.
OCuilleanain, 38, first worked for Burroughs Computers (now Unisys) as a
trainee sales and marketing executive, joining David Allen in 1982, and
becoming its managing director in 1983.
He is replaced at David Allen by Roisin O'Boyle, 34, who after university
first worked for Ireland's Industrial Development Authority. She later moved
to Foir Teoranta, an Irish state bank set up to subsidise ailing private
sector companies. She joined David Allen in 1992 as sales and marketing
director.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Design Council's day
of judgment - If bidders are not found by next week, some services will
disappear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatise or die: that is the ultimatum which a big chunk of the UK
government-funded Design Council faces over the next week. Wednesday is the
deadline for bids from outside organisations wanting to take over the
council's range of industrial services. Before the end of the month these
services are likely to have new owners, or be set to disappear.
The privatisation is part of a wholesale shake-up of the Design Council
which began last September. Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister, made
it clear that the existing body, which had provided design advice to British
industry for nearly 50 years, was to be largely dismantled. In its place was
to be reborn a much smaller, more highly-focused advisory body, which would
not, itself, get involved in the direct delivery of services to industry and
the design profession.
Its staff of about 200 was to be reduced by three-quarters, its annual
Pounds 7.5m grant substantially cut, and its Haymarket, central London,
offices vacated. Many of its industrial functions were to be transferred to
the new national network of one-stop business service centres, called
Business Links, which was being set up by the government.
The announcement caused less of an outcry than might have been expected, for
over the years the council had lost much of its public profile. There was
widespread criticism that the council had moved away from educating
consumers and promoting to industry the styling aspects, for example, of
design, while becoming increasingly pre-occupied with engineering issues.
John Sorrell, the newly-appointed chairman of the Design Council, himself a
designer and a former chairman of the Design Business Association, began an
intensive four-month review of the objectives and structure of the body. At
the same time, the serving director general, Ivor Owen, stepped down and a
career civil servant, Evelyn Ryle, moved in on a short-term assignment to
shed or redeploy staff, and to dispose of the council's industrial services.
These services include:
Materials information service, which provides enquirers with free
information on the properties, sourcing and application of materials. The
service is provided under contract to the Department of Trade and Industry.
Innovation noticeboard, which helps to put inventors in touch with companies
which could produce and market their ideas. Companies request to be included
on the innovation database and projects are screened by panels of new
product development specialists. Design advisory service, a subscription
service which offers the help of design advisers to companies wanting to
prepare specifications for design consultancy work, as well as recommending
suitable design practices from a consultancy register.
Consultancy register, which vets designers and includes them, for a fee, on
a register. Disciplines on the register include graphics, interior,
engineering, textiles and human factors design.
Enterprise Initiative design consultancy scheme, which is operated under
contract to the DTI and enables companies to use a specialist design
consultancy for projects for up to 15 days, with at least a third of the
cost paid by the DTI.
Industrial training and marketing, which organises new product development
seminars under contract to the DTI. This unit also markets the council's
range of industrial services. A central research unit also supports these
services.
The original intention was to keep all of the components of the industrial
services together and to invite 'integrated' bids from interested parties.
Says Ryle: 'The services together are bigger than the sum of the parts. No
one person can be an expert in all the areas of design. The services we have
feed off one another. We and the DTI started off by saying that, because of
the synergy of the components, an integrated bid was a better solution if we
could achieve it.'
By the time the May 31 deadline for bids was reached, though, it was clear
that the integrated option would not work. In spite of four full bids, Ryle
was forced to write in a memo to staff two weeks ago: 'I am sorry to have to
tell you that, in the end, the financial contributions which the various
parties were seeking from the government fell well outside what DTI would
have considered acceptable, and therefore all the integrated bids failed.'
In other words, all four bidders - their identities have not been disclosed
 -wanted to be assured of government grants to cover the less commercial
parts of the operation. As Ryle admits: 'Quite a lot of our work in these
areas is subsidised by the Design Council's grant in aid. The Design Council
never was, and was never intended to be, a fully commercial operation.'
A further worry to bidders must have been the operation of the Business
Links. It is still unclear exactly what their role will be in relation to
design, and how much money they will have to spend on it. It is expected
that the DTI will be reluctant to tie the hands of the Business Links by
specifying that they must buy in the former Design Council industrial
services.
Meanwhile, the 'integrated' option has been jettisoned by Ryle and fresh
bids for a piecemeal disposal have been invited. According to DesignWeek,
interested bodies include the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the
Chartered Society of Designers, the Design Business Association and the
Design Museum.
It is likely that some synergy will be lost, says Ryle: 'The amount lost
will depend on how many of the individual bits we succeed in privatising and
how prepared their new owners are to allow them to work co-operatively in
the future.' And what of those that fail the privatisation test? 'If we
don't have bidders for individual services, then it is unlikely that they
have a future,' she concludes.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Feast your eyes on
an Asian opportunity - American-style fast food is catching on in a region
hungry for western tastes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenny Rogers, the US country and western crooner, rode into Kuala Lumpur
recently. He wasn't playing his guitar or singing a tear-jerking song. He
was cooking chickens.
Kenny Rogers Roasters boasts of being the fastest-growing fast-food chain in
the US, with more than 1,000 restaurants opened or about to start operations
across the country. In May the first Roasters store in Asia opened in the
Malaysian capital.
The crowds who wait in line in Kuala Lumpur for one of Rogers' chickens,
marinaded in a special herb sauce and cooked on a wood-fired rotisserie
('It's wood that makes it good') testify to one of the marketing phenomena
of Asia: American-style fast food is catching on as fast as it can be
cooked.
The Florida-based Roasters chain was founded three years ago by Rogers and
John Y. Brown Junior, a former Kentucky governor. Earlier this year Berjaya,
a Malaysia-based conglomerate, bought a 24 per cent stake in Roasters for
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m). Berjaya paid Dollars 10m for a 50 per cent stake
in the chain's Asia Pacific operations.
'We've only been open a few weeks and already we are selling far more
chickens per day - about 1,400 each Saturday and Sunday - than stores in the
US,' says Syed Ghazali, general manager of Roasters in Kuala Lumpur. 'We
plan to open eight more stores in Malaysia this year with further openings
in Singapore and the Philippines. South Korea and Indonesia will follow
after.'
It's the same story all over Asia. At one time the sceptics said that Asians
would never give up their diet for the blander tastes of American fast food.
But the traditional corner coffee shop selling chicken, rice and noodles is
disappearing and being replaced by McDonald's, Pizza Hut or Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
The taste of the food is only one element in the success story. 'Our
marketing people tell us that people here love the American way. People come
to the stores not only for the food but to enjoy American style and American
service,' says Syed.
The region's economic success has brought about the rise of an increasingly
affluent middle class. A plate of chicken and rice might only cost MDollars
2.50 (95 cents) in Kuala Lumpur. But more and more city dwellers have the
money to pay twice or three times as much for a Roasters meal.
Karl Faux runs the south-east Asia operations of Tony Roma's, a Texas-based
chain specialising in ribs. The chain's 140-seat restaurant in Singapore
serves up to 800 meals per day. 'Anything that's American sells well.
Business is better than we ever dreamt it would be,' he says.
Faux, an Austrian hotelier who manages Tony Roma's regional operations on
behalf of Indonesian franchise holders, says a vital ingredient in the
attractiveness of US-style fast food is that it caters for the family.
'Asians like eating as a family. It's a very important part of the
business.'
Fast-food chains make some adjustments to local conditions. Kenny Rogers
Roasters cost about half as much in Malaysia as in the US. Some chains use
local sauces and ingredients. Others insist that all supplies come from the
US. Tony Roma's has expanded into Indonesia. It now ships a container of US
pork ribs each month into the world's largest Moslem country.
McDonald's opened one of its first outlets in Asia in Singapore in 1979.
Now, eight of its 10 best-selling restaurants in the world are in Asia:
seven of them are in Hong Kong while the recently opened outlet in Beijing
is the company's top performer.
In Malaysia, where the fast food industry is growing at an estimated 10 to
15 per cent each year, Kentucky Fried Chicken outsells McDonald's. Chicken
is the one mass consumption meat that all Malaysians - whether Malay,

Saunders will be smiling over 150 branches throughout Malaysia.
Not everyone is happy about the US invasion of Asia's high streets. There
are suspicions that along with the food, US values are being imported.
Asia's leaders worry about a directionless, undisciplined younger generation

Perhaps the tourists will be the most disappointed. If Asia continues on its

FT  07 JUL 94 / Accountancy Column: A freedom too far in the regulated
industries - Anthony Carey and Martin Cave consider weaknesses in accounting
standards setting and recommend how best to improve them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CAREY and MARTIN CAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are among the largest companies in the UK, they enjoy some monopoly
rights, and virtually all of us are their customers. Yet accounting
standards setters seem hardly to have noticed the existence of the regulated
industries.
The accounting practices of the privatised utilities in the
telecommunications, gas, electricity and water industries, as well as BAA
(formerly British Airports Authority), are the subject of a new study* which
calls for substantial reforms.
The absence of a structured accounting framework dealing with issues of
substantial importance to regulated companies, coupled with the regulators'
lack of disclosure about how allowable price rises are determined, means
that companies have wide discretion over the financial information that they
place in the public domain.
Some of the changes that have been made since or at the time of
privatisation have had the objective of bringing the accounting practices of
privatised utilities more in line with those of the private sector.
For example, in preparation for privatisation, BT ceased to capitalise
several types of expenditure and eliminated a supplementary replacement cost
depreciation charge from their accounts. British Gas increased the life of
many of its assets. BAA has capitalised interest costs incurred in the
construction of fixed assets, reclassified some freehold properties as
investment properties and extended its airport terminal and runway lives.
The various regulated companies have had to cope with two potentially
conflicting sets of demands: to show their performance in a positive light
to the capital markets, without at the same time giving their regulators the
impression that profits are too high.
In the case of BAA, which is less in the public eye than the other
privatised utilities, it seems clear that the main focus has been on market
perceptions. This also seems to be the case for BT, although it has followed
fairly constant accounting policies since privatisation.
For the more recently privatised water and electricity companies, regulatory
considerations would appear to have had a bigger impact on the way in which
they have presented accounting information.
Ofwat, the water regulator, has taken a significant degree of interest in
accounting matters and - unlike other regulators - has published guidelines
on Accounting for Current Costs which deals with the form, content and
principles of current cost accounts for the water industry.
Large price increases have been permitted in the water industry because of
the heavy capital expenditure programme currently under way. It would be
helpful to know whether the regulator plans to 'claw back' any of these
increases in the future: in other words, whether any of the revenue was
'advanced' to the companies to generate the necessary cash flows. If so, the
most appropriate accounting treatment would probably be to treat the element
advanced as deferred income in the accounts to be spread over future years.
Making profit forecasts at the time of privatisation was very difficult for
the regional electricity companies. The challenges included uncertainties
created by the reorganisation of the industry, the introduction of new
management, and the difficulties in forecasting future energy prices due to
the Gulf crisis and the unpredicted severity of the winter that followed
privatisation.
Managers and their advisers were, as a result, understandably cautious in
estimating future profits. But many of the potential problems did not
materialise, and so many electricity companies exceeded forecasts
substantially.
In these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that they seem to have
adopted a conservative approach to the recognition of profits, such as
establishing pension and other provisions and in not anticipating
under-recoveries of income.
A thorny issue requiring resolution is the current cost carrying amount of
assets acquired at privatisation. In the water, gas and electricity
industries, these were sold at a substantial discount to their replacement
cost. It is unlikely regulators will allow a cumulative return equal to this
figure.
If the regulators provided information on the return they were willing to
permit on these assets, the figures could be included in the accounts at
their recoverable amount rather than, as at present, at a replacement cost
in excess of this number.
We believe that the public interest would be best served if the terms of the
implicit regulatory contract that exists between the company and the
regulator were more explicitly stated. As much as possible of the accounting
information used to determine the price-setting formula for regulated
companies should also be made publicly available.
Specifying the terms of the regulatory contract would ensure that the role
of the accounts as the public memory of the regulatory system would be
enhanced.
It would then be less easy for regulators to overturn the commitments of
their predecessors.
The regulatory contract should be separately formulated for each industry
but deal with the following issues:
'Tilting' (advancing) of revenues. The regulators should indicate the amount
involved in individual cases, the period over which the advances are to be
made and the length of the subsequent claw-back period.
Valuation of assets held at privatisation. Each regulator should indicate
the return that the regulated companies will be allowed, and their valuation
should reflect how the discount on assets at privatisation should be
treated.
Treatment of efficiency gains. Regulators should indicate how such gains are
to be measured, the proportion of the surplus profits the companies will be
allowed to retain, and the period over which they will be allowed to retain
them.
In addition to developing more transparent regulatory contracts, the quality
of regulatory accounting information should be further improved by the
introduction of new standards.
The core information for regulatory decision-making should be that published
in audited regulatory accounts. The accounts should be prepared on a current
cost basis applying financial capital maintenance principles, which provide
the best information on the real returns being earned by shareholders.
Individual industries should be required to justify any special accounting
treatments unique to them by reference to their identifiable circumstances.
Standards should deal with topics that include accounting for fixed assets,
revenue advances, and the need to provide a reconciliation from the figures
in the regulatory accounts to those in the statutory accounts.
Regulatory standards should be issued by a body under the joint auspices of
the Accounting Standards Board and the industry regulators or by a body
established by the latter. Regulatory accounts should be brought within the
aegis of the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
These proposals should ensure that a clear and more useful set of
information would exist in the public domain on the special features of
accounting for regulated industries.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Call for tobacco events on TV to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons national heritage committee yesterday called for the phasing-out
of all broadcasting of events sponsored by tobacco companies on terrestrial
television.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the committee chairman, noted that the ITV companies and
Channel 4 had decided not to broadcast events sponsored by tobacco companies
and that it was 'quite extraordinary' that the BBC continued to do so.
The corporation has said it will not enter into any contracts for new events
with tobacco sponsors.
The committee recommended that no UK sporting events sponsored by tobacco
companies be broadcast by any terrestrial channel once existing contracts
run out.
It called on the government to hold discussions at European and
international levels on satellite television coverage 'to seek to end
indirect advertising of tobacco products through programme or event
sponsorship on satellite television'.
The committee sought to give greater protection to the televising of events
such as the FA Cup Final, the Grand National horse race and the Olympics to
make sure that they continue to be available to all viewers.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act decreed that the rights to such events could be
bought exclusively by a subscription sports channel such as Sky Sports, but
could not be broadcast on a pay-per-view basis.
The committee said it wanted the ban extended to subscription services,
inferring that listed events - which also include the World Cup finals and
the finals weekend at Wimbledon - should be shown on the main channels, be
it the BBC, ITV or Channel 4.

FT  07 JUL 94 / BMA attacks drive for performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Medical Association yesterday angrily opposed government
proposals to introduce locally-based performance-related pay in the National
Health Service next year.
Delegates to the BMA annual conference in Birmingham backed the existing pay
structure and supported a motion saying that they would not tolerate
performance-related pay for salaried doctors.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA's hospital consultants' committee,
warned of retaliation if the government persisted with its plans. He said
senior doctors gave an average of 30 per cent of their time beyond official
hours for nothing, saving the NHS Pounds 300m. 'I have to say to the
government that they will not continue to give it for nothing,' he said.
Ministers want arrangements for moving towards performance-related pay and
local bargaining to be in place for the 1995 salary awards early next year.
The salary review bodies that make recommendations on doctors and nurses
will start gathering evidence in September. Department of Health negotiators
are putting pressure on the BMA and health service unions to agree an
enabling clause opening the way to local pay bargaining before then.
Negotiations resume next week.
Mr Chawner said that performance-related pay and local bargaining would
'strike at the heart of the NHS and the heart of our work as professionals'.
He said hospital trusts in financial difficulty would pay nothing at local
level. In others surgeons who performed many operations would receive pay
awards while psychiatrists and other specialists who did work that could not
be measured by such criteria would do less well.
'Doctors will seek to work in places and in specialities where they are
better paid. In this sense it does herald the end of the NHS as we know it,'
he said.
Mr Chawner said the BMA had told ministers it was not against the legitimate
measurement of good performance but would not go along with the 'Mickey
Mouse schemes' that had been proposed.
The BMA will follow yesterday's conference decision by writing to the prime
minister emphasising its concern. But it will face difficult choices if the
government refuses to shift.
The salary review bodies are likely to recommend only a modest national
increase next year, releasing as much cash as possible for the switch to
local bargaining. Most NHS unions and professional associations are unlikely
to object as strongly to performance-related pay as the BMA.
In these circumstances the BMA is likely to use the negotiations to explore
whether there is scope for agreeing a version of performance-related pay
more acceptable to its membership.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Heritage secretary receives praise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, yesterday received a wide measure of
praise for the long-awaited white paper as well a few jeers from unrepentant
privatisers who greeted the announcement with cries of 'shame', 'rubbish'
and 'cop-out'.
Mr Tim Renton, a former broadcasting minister, congratulated Mr Brooke for
resisting the temptation to go for too much change.
At a time when there was a vast increase in the number of television and
radio channels in the UK people 'actually welcome the BBC as a sort of
friendly 'rock of ages',' he said.
Mr David Mellor, former heritage secretary, emphasised that the present
outcome had been possible only because of radical changes introduced at the
corporation.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, welcomed the government's
endorsement of the licence fee but said she was concerned because there was
no commitment to index it to retail prices.
Mr Robert Maclennan, for the Liberal Democrats, welcomed the renewal of the
royal charter and licence fee but called for an independent regulator for
all television.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the Commons heritage committee, said the BBC
should consider creating links with telecommunications organisations.
He told Mr Brooke: 'What the BBC has to do is either dwindle into a
low-audience public service broadcast service or become what you have
rightly said it should become, an international multimedia enterprise.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Britvic censured over TV advert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission, the commercial television watchdog,
yesterday strongly criticised a publicity stunt by Britvic Soft Drinks which
was judged to 'abuse the authority of the television medium and trespass on
public confidence'.
The television advertisement in May, for a drink called Still Tango,
featured Tango's marketing director in a spoof warning to the public that
the product was unauthorised. Viewers were urged to ring a freephone number
to report stockists.
When viewers called - and the company says 30,000 people responded on the
first night - they were told that they had been tricked and were offered a
voucher for the drink.
Coincidentally, Britvic had to recall all bottles of the new drink a week
later because of 'a small number of cases of fermentation' which were said
not to pose a health hazard but had caused distorted packaging and a musty
smell. To get the recall taken seriously, the company was forced in press
advertisements to distance itself from the spoof TV warnings.
The ITC said that 63 viewers had complained that 'it was not appropriate to
use television advertising to play practical jokes on viewers'. Some also
said 'they had been alarmed because they thought that a health hazard was
being implied'.
The ITC, which ruled that such advertisements should not be shown in future,
concluded: 'If this was not quite setting off the fire alarm for a laugh it
was certainly ringing door bells and running away.'
Britvic said yesterday that the company was sorry if it had caused offence.
'The target market is young adults who are very much 'advertising aware' and
enjoy our tongue-in-cheek approach,' it added.
Separately, the ITC yesterday published its 1993 annual report which covers
the first year of operation of the 16 new Channel 3 licensees.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Minister backs Northolt growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is stepping up its efforts to allow business aircraft to use
the Royal Air Force airfield of Northolt, west London, to relieve increasing
pressures on business aviation at Heathrow.
The Department of Transport and the Ministry of Defence yesterday issued a
consultation paper seeking the views of industry and business aircraft users
on the potential for developing a civil enclave dedicated to small business
aircraft on the airfield.
The move was signalled in May's competitiveness white paper in view of
increasing pressure on facilities for general and business aviation in
south-east England.
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, aviation minister, said yesterday: 'Business
aviation is not just a rich man's plaything. Many serious companies are
dependent on small aircraft and it is important for UK plc to get in and out
of London with ease.'
One attraction of Northolt is its proximity to Heathrow - many corporate jet
users want to connect with long-distance scheduled services from Heathrow,
the world's biggest international airport.
Shell, the integrated oil group which operates its own corporate jet fleet,
welcomed the government's initiative.
Northolt handles royal, VIP and military traffic. It handles about 4,000
movements - either a take-off or landing - by civil aircraft each year and
has capacity for a further 3,000 movements.
The government wants to see this spare capacity used.
Security will be a significant issue in view of the use of the airport by
royal and VIP flights. There are proposals to transfer the Queen's flight
from RAF Benson in Oxfordshire to Northolt.
Lord MacKay said flight operations would remain the responsibility of the
MoD, while ground operations, including aircraft and passenger handling,
would be the responsibility of the operator of the proposed new business
aircraft centre.
The consultation process is expected to be completed by the second half of
next month.
The plan is expected to spark fierce local opposition on environmental
grounds.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Regulator calls for rules on short selling of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New rules are needed to govern short selling of a company's shares just
before a secondary offering of those shares hits the market, London's chief
regulator said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, was
outlining the preliminary conclusions from a review of wider market issues
which the regulatory body launched in February.
Short selling is the practice of selling shares one does not already own in
the hope of buying them more cheaply by the time it is necessary to deliver
them to the buyer. A secondary offering of the same company's shares could,
in theory, allow an investor the opportunity to buy those shares more
cheaply than he or she had sold them and use the cheaper shares to cover a
short position.
Mr Large ruled out significant changes to rules which allow those who commit
their own capital to provide liquidity for share dealing to hide some of
their deals from competitors for a period.
Speaking at a Financial Times conference on international equity markets, he
said: 'Few, I think, question the need for requiring less than full
transparency where people oblige themselves to put up their capital to
deliver liquidity.'
But he suggested that in some instances rules allowed dealing to be opaque
for much longer than was necessary.
Mr Large said SIB had received considerable comment from market participants
on the issue of short selling. 'From a regulatory viewpoint, the priority
seems to me to be the search for better procedures to cover short selling
during secondary offering periods,' he said.
He noted that the London Stock Exchange had been examining the issue and
said that solutions were 'a matter of urgency'.
The question of short selling and outright selling before a secondary
offering came to a head last summer before the government's sale of its
final stake in British Telecommunications. SG Warburg, the merchant bank
advising the government, asked the Stock Exchange to adopt rules for trading
in BT shares designed to make short sales or outright sales difficult.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Quality of teacher training under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quality of teacher training provided by universities is to be subjected
to new checks by the government, Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
announced in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes.
In a move likely to arouse fresh controversy over political interference
with academic freedom he said grants made to universities for teacher
training courses would be conditional on access being given to members of
the government's schools inspectorate.
Mr Patten said: 'The bottom line will be no inspection, no funding.'
He stressed that by attaching the requirement for inspection to the grant it
would not be necessary to seek statutory authority in the education bill.
Justifying the new approach, Mr Patten referred to a recent report that said
almost half of newly appointed primary school teachers felt ill-equipped to
teach English.
The bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 35
(284-249),and now returns to the Lords.

FT  07 JUL 94 / BBC role and funding reinforced by review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC yesterday emerged virtually unscathed from three years of intense
government scrutiny. Its structure and its financing by universal licence
fee were left intact and its public-service purpose underpinned.
The white paper that will form the heart of a new royal charter to run for
10 years from the beginning of 1997 is entitled The Future of the BBC -
Serving the Nation, Competing Worldwide.
The title sets out explicitly a dual future for the BBC. It is the role the
corporation was asking to be allowed to play - as the UK's main
public-service broadcaster developing commercial services in the UK and
overseas.
Although the government believes that the corporation's primary role should
remain as a public-service broadcaster to the UK, it equally clearly hopes
it will be able 'to evolve into an international multimedia enterprise'.
The BBC will retain all its radio and television services although the
government wants to see clear objectives set for what those services should
be. The corporation can then be assessed on how successfully the objectives
have been met.
The white paper says: 'The government agrees that the BBC should continue to
broadcast a wide range of television and radio programmes which will appeal
to all tastes and interests and to people of different ages and backgrounds
and living in all parts of the country.'
While programmes aimed at minorities were an important part of the BBC's
role, the public wanted it to continue producing popular programmes capable
of attracting audiences of 10m to 20m and a wide range of radio programmes
including popular music.
The government would like to see more programmes featuring science and
engineering, more programmes reflecting life in the regions of the UK and
greater sensitivity in terms of what audiences find acceptable in matters of
taste and decency.
Until the end of next year - when the current charter runs out - the BBC
will be funded by a licence fee linked to the retail prices index. The
licence fee will continue at least until the year 2001, when it will be
reviewed in the light of changing technology and other developments. To set
the licence fee from 1997 to 2001 the government will consider a link with
the retail prices index.
The government even suggested yesterday that the licence fee could rise in
real terms if the BBC could demonstrate that costs over which it had little
control - such as sports rights and talent - were rising particularly
rapidly.
The main barb for the BBC in the white paper was over its transmitters. The
government is clearly linking the BBC's hopes of entering the world of
digital television - which could greatly increase the number of television
channels using terrestrial transmitters - with introducing an element of
private finance.
The white paper says: 'The government is exploring with the BBC options for
the future of its transmission services, taking account of the development
of its plans for digital broadcasting.' A study is due to be completed this
year and privatisation of the whole or part of the BBC transmitter services
will be options.
The most remarkable part of the white paper is the high degree of
encouragement the government is giving to the BBC to develop commercial
television and radio services around the world, using its expertise in World
Service Radio and the developing Worldwide Television services.
As long as there is no cross-subsidy from the licence fee or the grant that
funds the World Service, and as long as there is transparent accounting and
fair pricing, the BBC has been liberated to compete in broadcasting markets
around the world and in the UK.
The new commercial activities should, however, be underpinned by the BBC's
longer-term objectives and its values as a public-service broadcaster. To
help the process the government plans to repeal legislation preventing the
Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority from 'licensing
commercial services which are owned or partly owned by the BBC'.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said the measure was an
enabling one and declined to say whether the BBC would be able to be
involved in applying for commercial broadcasting licences in the UK. At the
very least the policy should mean that the BBC will be able to aim satellite
services at the UK as well as the international market.
Because the next 10 years will almost certainly see a period of significant
change in demand for media services, the government wants the BBC to keep
its options open for further development by building up its commercial
activities and expertise, and widening its sources of income.
The white paper says: 'It can do this by increasing its international
activities, maintaining its capacity for programme-making and contributing
to improving the UK's competitiveness in the audio-visual sector in the
years ahead.'
The white paper also wants a clearer separation of the role of the BBC
governors and management. 'The governor's role is to look after the public's
interest in the BBC not to manage it,' it says.
The government said yesterday that it planned to merge the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Council, but rejected
calls for one authority for all British broadcasting.
With the exception of the section on transmitters and some complaints about
the BBC's lack of responsiveness to its audience, the degree of consensus is
so great that the BBC could almost have written the document itself.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to serve the nation and compete worldwide
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - BBC should split public service and commercial activities and evolve
into a multimedia enterprise, using opportunites created by new
technologies.
 - Programmes sales should be expanded, and international services
developed in co-operation with private sector
 - Public services should remain distinct, financed by the licence fee
 - Clear objectives for each service should be published and audience
consulted on changes
 - Broadcasting Complaints Commission and Broadcasting Standards
Council should merge
 - Privatisation to be considered among options for injecting private
finance into transmission services

FT  07 JUL 94 / Greenpeace warns of disease threat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Global warming brings with it the risk of an increase in parasitic diseases
such as malaria in the UK, says Greenpeace.
Quoting a government report, which it claims was suppressed for two years,
the environmental group lists Leishmaniasis, Rickettsiosis, and bubonic
plague as the diseases which could arrive with warmer weather. These would
find a population without natural immunity to resist them.
Greenpeace says the government should combat these risks with a commitment
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said to cause global warming, by 20 per
cent by the year 2005.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Authority to oppose BAe airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace's con-troversial attempt to develop its Filton airfield
near Bristol as a commercial airport is to be opposed by the local planning
authority, Roland Adburgham writes.
A public inquiry into the scheme is to be held after BAe appealed to the
environment secretary. This followed the delay by Northavon district council
in deciding on the application, which was submitted last September.
Northavon council yesterday unanimously decided that, had it still been in a
position to decide on the application, it would have refused it because of
the airport's adverse environmental impact, especially on noise levels. The
council's officers had recommended refusal.
BAe wants to have scheduled services to make more use of its Filton runway.
It believes this would help to safeguard the future of its adjacent plant,
where 5,000 people are employed. Although the plans are supported by many in
the region's business community there is vociferous opposition from local
residents.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Output up 1.3% in quarter: Pharmaceuticals and furniture
rise while footwear declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production of cars, pharmaceuticals, plastic packaging and furniture rose in
May, while footwear and ship-building dipped slightly, official figures
showed yesterday.
Overall, industrial output showed a healthy 1.3 per cent growth in the three
months to May compared with the three months to February, and a 4.6 per cent
growth over the same period a year ago, the Central Statistical Office said.
On a monthly basis output rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between
April and May.
This growth rate was slower than in April, when output unexpectedly surged
1.6 per cent on the month.
The figure was in line with City expectations, however, and analysts
yesterday welcomed it as evidence of a healthily steady industrial recovery.
They pointed out that, if April's surge had been repeated in May, this might
have prompted fears that the industrial recovery was overheating and
fuelling inflationary pressures.
Within the quarterly figures, manufacturing rose 1.2 per cent in the three
months to May compared with the previous three months.
Meanwhile oil and gas continued to boost the production figures, as a
collection of new North Sea fields came on stream in recent months. Although
oil and gas production dipped slightly in May because of an accident on the
Piper Alpha field it is now running 39.6 per cent higher than in the same
period a year ago.
Across other sectors the manufacturing rise was fairly broadly based,
suggesting that the recovery is feeding through to all stages in the
industrial supply chain.
The output of the investment goods industry rose 1.5 per cent in the three
months to May, compared with the previous three months, while consumer goods
output rose 1 per cent. Intermediate goods industries, which supply
manufacturers with their energy, components and raw materials, rose 1.4 per
cent in the same period.
Pharmaceuticals performed particularly well, rising 3 per cent, quarter on
quarter. The plastics packaging business - often a key to signs of recovery
in other manufacturing areas - rose 4 per cent in the same period.
Furniture and car production also showed healthy rises, while electrical and
optical equipment manufacturers were the best performing engineering sector,
rising 3.3 per cent in the three months to May compared with the previous
quarter.
The CSO said this growth had been boosted by particularly strong output in
the computer, telephone and electrical goods industry.
Footwear production, however, fell 5 per cent in the quarter. The
shipbuilding and aerospace industries continued to report a slowdown, with
the output of both categories running 10 per cent lower than in the previous
year.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Heseltine 'regrets' on Rover takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that, as
a 'warm-blooded' British citizen, he 'regretted' that there had been no
viable UK bidder for the Rover car company when it was acquired by BMW of
Germany this year.
'I would have loved to see it (a UK takeover), but it was difficult to
envisage any solution beyond that which we saw,' he told the Commons trade
and industry committee at its inquiry into manufacturing competitiveness.
He told Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, that the
government had been concerned when British Aerospace, the previous owner of
Rover, had announced the sale to BMW. But he felt that the proposed
management buy-out would not have been viable, and added that there had been
general satisfaction with the outcome of the sale to BMW.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders published
yesterday showed an 18.3 per cent rise in new-car registrations last month
to 134,748. This compared with the 113,919 recorded in June last year.
The unexpectedly sharp surge last month has raised the prospect of a 2m-plus
market in new cars this year, for the first time since 1990.
The June surge brought registrations for the year's first half to 956,263 -
a 13.7 per cent rise on the 839,035 in the first half of last year.
The SMMT is continuing to be cautious in its forecasts, suggesting that the
total market 'might' top 1.9m this year. It is also predicting about 445,000
registrations in August, by far the biggest sales month because of the
introduction of the yearly registration prefix.
However, this represents an increase of only about 1 per cent on last year's
August sales of 440,206.
The top 10 sellers in the first half of the year were: 1. Ford Escort
71,683; 2. Ford Mondeo 68,137; 3. Ford Fiesta 59,764; 4. Vauxhall Cavalier
53,012; 5. Vauxhall Astra 52,727; 6. Vauxhall Corsa 42,715; 7. Rover 200
39,533; 8. Rover Metro 28,739; 9. Peugeot 306 24,297; 10. Renault Clio
24,293.

The prospect of a 2m-plus new-car market this year, for the first time since
1990, has been raised by an unexpectedly sharp surge in registrations last
month.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders published
yesterday showed an 18.3 per cent rise in registrations last month to
134,748. This compared with the 113,919 recorded in June last year.
The June surge brought registrations for the year's first half to 956,263 -
a 13.7 per cent rise on the 839,035 in the first half of last year.
The SMMT is continuing to be cautious in its forecasts, suggesting that the
total market 'might' top 1.9m this year. It is also predicting about 445,000
registrations in August, by far the biggest sales month because of the
introduction of the yearly registration prefix.
This represents an increase of only about 1 per cent on last year's August
sales of 440,206, however, whereas the market has increased by double
figures in percentage terms every month of this year except April, when tax
increases were introduced.
The SMMT said prospective buyers could benefit from 'some of the best
showroom deals ever seen as manufacturers offer an unprecedented number and
variety of promotional schemes' linked to the introduction of this year's M
prefix.
June's total was the highest for that month since 1990. Importers took a
substantially increased share of the market - 57.8 per cent compared with
54.5 per cent in the same month last year. For the first half as a whole
imports accounted for 56.2 per cent, up from 54.1 per cent in the equivalent
period last year.
Ford maintained its position as market leader last month, although its 19.5
per cent share was slightly down from a year ago.
The top 10 sellers in the first half of the year were: 1. Ford Escort
71,683; 2. Ford Mondeo 68,137; 3. Ford Fiesta 59,764; 4. Vauxhall Cavalier
53,012; 5. Vauxhall Astra 52,727; 6. Vauxhall Corsa 42,715; 7. Rover 200
39,533; 8. Rover Metro 28,739; 9. Peugeot 306 24,297; 10. Renault Clio
24,293.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel to appeal over ferry duty-frees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, which runs trains through the Channel tunnel, is to challenge a
European Union decision allowing ferry companies and airlines to continue
making duty-free sales until 1999, Charles Batchelor writes.
The company intends to seek leave in the next few days to apply for a
judicial review in the autumn of the European decision. It believes that
duty-free sales are worth Pounds 125m a year to its rivals and abolition of
the duty-free concession would boost its turnover by about Pounds 170m up to
1999.
Eurotunnel said: 'This is a subsidy to the ferries and the airlines and we
see it as discrimination against us.'
If duty-free sales were abolished, the ferry companies would have to
increase ticket prices and travellers might be persuaded to transfer to the
tunnel.
Eurotunnel planned its services on the assumption that duty-free sales would
be abolished when the single European market was created in January 1993.
But the government lobbied for an extension of the concession and won a
six-year reprieve.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Bar backs system of picking QCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bar has come down in favour of retaining the present system for
appointing Queen's Counsel in spite of criticism from barristers that the
system is secretive and open to abuse.
A working party chaired by Mr Michael Kalisher QC says in a report published
today that the present system of appointment by the Queen on the advice of
the Lord Chancellor is preferable to alternatives such as appointment by an
independent commission, or by the Bar itself.
The Bar favours retaining the rank of QC because it helps the public and
solicitors identify barristers of a recognised high standard. But it
recognises that changes would have to be made to the present system to meet
the concerns of many barristers.
The report recommends publication of formal criteria for getting silk,
including outstanding ability as an advocate, experience and knowledge of
the law, professional integrity and an extensive practice. The report says
appointments should be solely on merit, with no positive discrimination in
favour of women or ethnic minorities. The number of appointments should
remain low to underline the importance of the rank but numbers should not be
artificially restricted.
Applications have risen from 204 in 1985, when 34 were appointed, to 539 in
1994, when 77 were appointed. The barristers say the high number of
applicants threatens the efficacy of the system as the judges and senior
barristers who are consulted on appointments cannot give every application
the consideration it requires.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Blair argues case for stronger EU links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the Labour leadership, yesterday cast
himself in the role of the discriminating pro-European by calling for a
different but positive vision of the European Union's future.
In his first detailed statement on an issue likely to dominate politics in
the approach to the next general election, Mr Blair said the economic and
political case for enhanced European co-operation had become stronger, not
weaker.
His comments came as the shadow cabinet decided not to oppose or seek to
amend legislation due next week to provide for the entry into the EU of
Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. Party officials said there was no
question of the party joining with Tory Euro-sceptics in any attempt to
wreck the bill.
In a speech to the Foreign Press Association Mr Blair rejected the 'false
choice between a sort of bureaucratic federalism and a retreat into
isolation'. Accusing the government of a 'minority mentality' which had left
Britain participating in Europe without influence, he said the country
needed a new self-confidence about its role.
The alternative to isolationism was not a headlong rush into a pan-European
state but 'a movement towards greater European co-operation, measured by
what is practically sensible and publicly acceptable but where public
opinion is led as well as followed'.

Ninety-four campaigners protesting at the TGWU general union's dismissal of
one of its Merseyside officers yes-terday occupied the union's Pounds 4m
national computer centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, Chris Tighe writes.
The day-long occupation in support of Mr John Farrell, the union's former
north-west region trade group secretary for general workers, seriously
disrupted the computer system's functions including pension payments.
The campaigners, including Mr Farrell, left late in the afternoon but warned
of further direct action. They said the occupation had been to publicise
their claim that Mr Bill Morris, the union's general secretary, had acted as
'judge, jury and executioner' in dismissing Mr Farrell.
Mr Farrell was dismissed last month on various conduct-related grounds. The
union said yesterday these included abuse of dispute benefit payments.
He took High Court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his
dismissal.
Mr Farrell said he had been dismissed because of his criticism of Mr Morris.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Railtrack to clarify pay package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack is to clarify and may revise its productivity pay package for
signalling staff, the company said yesterday as it claimed that nearly 20
per cent of Britain's 10,000-mile rail network was open on the fourth
one-day signallers' strike.
It said the move was in response to suggestions from staff who have
responded to the company's 'hearts and minds' campaign launched last
weekend.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said the
support for the strike yesterday indicated that the men had 'given
Railtrack's latest offer the thumbs-down'.
Support for yesterday's strike - the fourth on consecutive Wednesdays -
appeared to be solid.
Further one-day strikes are scheduled for the next two Wednesdays, with the
threat of two-day a week strikes after July 24.
The company seems to believe that it can go over the heads of the RMT and
convince staff that the tentative offer on the bargaining table can meet
their grievances.
A Railtrack official said: 'If we cannot negotiate with their union, at
least we can negotiate direct with the signalling staff.'
The company is keen, in particular, to reassure signalling staff who face
cuts in pre-tax pay as a result of efficiency savings that they will receive
substantial compensation payments.
In response to public pressure from MPs on the cross-party Commons
employment committee, Railtrack's chairman Mr Robert Horton met Mr Knapp
yesterday.
In a joint statement after their two-hour meeting in London the two men said
they had 'exchanged views and agreed to reflect on what was said'.
British Rail yesterday ran a more comprehensive service than on any of the
previous strike days, with between 1,700 and 1,750 trains in operation.
Private companies ran significant freight services for the first time with
trains moving aggregates between the Mendips and London.
Passenger services operated for the first time from London Victoria and
Waterloo stations.
Traffic into London and other large cities was light, as motorists staggered
journeys to avoid congestion.
West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority is likely to withhold Pounds 2m
from Regional Railways Central - 40 per cent of the subsidy to the train
operating company for running services during the quarter to June.
Centro, the authority's operating arm, said that since the break-up of the
industry on April 1 'only 60.5 per cent of Centro subsidised services on
seven local lines ran to within three minutes of timetable'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Water bills face 'green' costs rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British householders could face even higher water bills next year as a way
of meeting additional environmental obligations handed to the water
companies yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
The government added another Pounds 522m to the bill water companies must
pay for treating sewage and cleaning up rivers in the next five years. Mr
Gummer told the industry regulator, Mr Ian Byatt, to take the extra funding
into account when fixing price limits for domestic bills.
The new money is equal to about Pounds 6 a year for each of Britain's 18m
households, but bills will rise more in some areas than in others.
Price formulas for Britain's 31 water companies are due to be announced on
July 28. They will already take into account a Pounds 14bn to Pounds 15bn
clean-up of waste water planned by the industry by the year 2000.
Mr Gummer's decision to add another Pounds 500m in environmental spending to
companies' obligations will inevitably lead to the charge that householders
will end up footing the bill. Water companies have increased their charges
to households by 67 per cent since privatisation in 1989.
An official at the National Consumers' Council said: 'Consumers have been
asked to pay a very large part of the burden of investment and general
upkeep of the system since privatisation. But there is no reason why the
cost of this environmental spending should be passed on.'
The consumers' council said companies should turn to other sources of
finance, such as the equity market, for investment capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Ireland is seeking 'the closest possible links between a
Northern Ireland administration and the Irish government', but this would
not amount to joint administration with London, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, said yesterday.
Speaking in Dublin to businessmen from both sides of the border, his
comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in
Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two
governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority.
Mr Spring said that a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's
agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It
would be 'realistic' to double current cross-border trade of IPounds 1.3bn
(Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn.
In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest
the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' said Mr
Spring.
The Irish government wanted 'strong, meaningful and dynamic' cross-border
structures to promote this goal and the two governments were looking at the
prospects for co-operation in transport, health, energy, trade and tourism
'and other areas'.
He said the continuing violence imposed a 'huge burden' on both the UK and
Irish economies and impeded progress in economic co-operation. It was
imperative 'that those who engage in violence on both sides should cease to
inflict this intolerable burden on their fellow citizens'.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has meanwhile been pouring cold
water on growing expectations of an extended IRA ceasefire in the summer or
autumn.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said: 'The present intense speculation
. . . is unhelpful and misinformed'.
He added: 'Peace is not simply an IRA ceasefire. The peace process must
address all of the issues which lie at the heart of the conflict.'
These included a lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, an end to
'economic inequalities' for Roman Catholics and 'the speedy release' of all
long-term IRA prisoners.
Sinn Fein is due to give its definitive response to the Downing Street
declaration within the next two to three weeks.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Blair spells out case for stronger EU
</HEADLINE>

Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the Labour leadership, yesterday cast
himself in the role of the discriminating pro-European by calling for a
different but positive vision of the European Union's future.
In his first detailed statement on an issue likely to dominate politics in
the run up to the next general election, Mr Blair said the economic and
political case for enhanced European co-operation had become stronger, not
weaker.
His comments came as the shadow cabinet decided not to oppose or seek to
amend legislation due next week to provide for the entry into the EU of
Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. Party officials said there was no
question of the party joining with Tory Euro-sceptics in any attempt to

In a speech to the Foreign Press Association, Mr Blair flatly rejected the
'false choice between a sort of bureaucratic federalism and a retreat into
isolation'.
Accusing the government of a 'minority mentality' which had left Britain
participating in Europe without influence, he said the country needed a new
self-confidence about its role.
The alternative to isolationism was not a headlong rush into a pan-European
state but 'a movement towards greater European co-operation, measured by
what is practically sensible and publicly acceptable but where public
opinion is led as well as followed'.
Mr Blair acknowledged the pre-occupations of the Maastricht treaty had been
overtaken by events - above all by the collapse of communism in eastern
Europe and the resultant prospect of an EU of 20 or more states rather than
12 or 16.
Britain should treat the intergovernmental conference in 1996 as an
opportunity to move beyond Maastricht and 'shape and re-state the basic
economic, social and strategic purposes of Europe'.
But political and economic forces continued to point in the direction of a
closer not looser association. 'The change in Europe as a result of the
liberation of eastern Europe may alter the shape of European co-operation
but it does not alter the reason for it.'
Turning to the party's position on a single European currency, Mr Blair said
that Britain must keep its options open to avoid the risk of exclusion from
economic and monetary union.
The timetable should be driven by economics and not by an artificial
political timetable. While exclusion would damage Britain's long-term
economic strength, the price of joining without genuine economic convergence
might be too high.
Britain should seek also to widen the focus of the economic policy debate in
the EU to other leading issues such as employment, infrastructure,
technology and education and training. The challenges to Europe's economic
future had to be faced collectively as well as individually.

The Bar has come down in favour of retaining the present system for

A limit on the number of applications should be considered and barristers

The report says there is no justification for any part of the process to
remain secret. Guidance notes should set out precisely how the system works
and identify all those consulted. Applicants should be told in general terms
what has been said about them and what impact this has had.
Unsuccessful applicants should be told broadly why they have failed and that
they are entitled to seek an interview at the Lord Chancellor's Department
to be told in more detail why they have been unsuccessful.

FT  07 JUL 94 / TGWU computers disrupted by 'ambush'

<TEXT>
Ninety-four campaigners protesting at the TGWU general union's dismissal of
one of its Merseyside officers yesterday occupied the union's Pounds 4m
national computer centre in Newcastle.
The day-long occupation in support of Mr John Farrell, the union's former
north-west region trade group secretary for general workers, seriously

The campaigners, including Mr Farrell, left late in the afternoon but warned
of further direct action. They said the occupation had been to publicise
their claim that Mr Bill Morris, the union's general secretary, had acted as
'judge, jury and executioner' in dismissing Mr Farrell.
Mr Morris, who flew to Newcastle to reassure the building's staff of his
full support, condemned the action of Mr Farrell and his supporters as
'Chicago-style gangsterism'.
Mr Morris said the protesters 'ambushed' the clerk who arrived to open the
offices and demanded the keys with threats. Mr Farrell's supporters, who
travelled overnight from the north-west, loaded with enough food for an
occupation lasting weeks, insisted that their entry to the building had been
peaceful.
Mr Farrell was dismissed last month on various conduct-related grounds. The
union said yesterday these included abuse of dispute benefit payments. He
took High Court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his dismissal.
Mr Farrell said yesterday he had been dismissed because of his outspoken
criticism of Mr Morris. Under Mr Morris - who had become a 'vicious
rightwinger' - the union had no recruitment strategy to stem declining
membership.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Assyrian antiquity sold for Pounds 7.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Headmaster John Lever of Canford School, Dorset, alongside a 3,000-year-old
Assyrian bas-relief discovered in his school's tuck shop. The piece was sold
at Christie's yesterday for Pounds 7.7m, a world record for an antiquity,
well exceeding the Pounds 2.2m paid for a Greek vase last year.
It was excavated by Sir Henry Layard between 1845 and 1851 and given to his
friend Sir John Guest, who owned Canford Manor. It was built into the wall
of a special Assyrian-style building which became a tuck shop after Canford
Manor was turned into an independent school in 1923. The sculpture was
forgotten as it became covered by layers of whitewash until identified by a
US expert last year.
The relief shows a eunuch royal attendant carrying a bow and quiver being
anointed by a genie. It went to an anonymous buyer who was in the saleroom.
The school intends to spend half the Pounds 6m it will receive on a new
theatre and sports hall.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Power companies accused over databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some electricity distribution companies are breaking the law by using
customer databases to promote services other than electricity, the Data
Protection Registrar said yesterday in a statement which has implications
for all privatised utilities.
Mr Eric Howe, the registrar, also raised the prospect of conflict between
the data protection office and the financial services industry over the
confidentiality of personal financial information. He said in his annual
report that he believed a number of current and planned uses of customer
data information by regional electricity companies in England and Wales were
in contravention of data protection law.
He said that under the Electricity and Data Protection Acts it was illegal
for companies either to use their customer mailings as 'host' for
non-electricity promotions or to pass names and addresses to commercial
third parties. 'There may be implications for the activities or proposed
activities of other utilities,' he said.
Mr Howe intends to write to the electricity companies and to consult the
utility regulators on the issue.
But he 'anticipated' that his successor as registrar, who takes office in
September, would issue formal guidance in the next year.
But the registrar's office left the legal position ambivalent by adding that
it might be possible for the electricity companies to use personal data in
some cases provided they offered customers a chance to opt out. At present
few utilities use their databases for more than customer-client
administration, but many are believed to be considering doing so as a means
of generating new earnings.
Eastern Electricity said Mr Howe's statement 'added to existing legal
ambiguity' over the use of customer data and that it would approach the
Department of Trade and Industry for clarifi-cation.
Mr Howe said legal action between the financial services industry and the
data protection office could take place in months following a paper
circulated by the registrar earlier this year over the disclosure of
information about customers.
The paper said that disclosure of personal financial information could only
follow specific consent from the individuals concerned, and that such
consent might in any case be insufficient under a European Union directive
set to be enshrined in UK law.
The paper has met a hostile reaction from the financial services industry,
including one claim that it amounted to a 'fraudsters' charter'.
Mr Howe said a response from the government appeared to support his legal
view.
Mr Howe said he was 'not unsympathetic' to arguments that defaulters on
loans should lose some rights to confidentiality.
He remained convinced, however, that 'those who do service debts properly
should have control over whether their financial affairs should be revealed
to others'.
Mr Howe also raised concerns about the introduction of national
identification through policies such as driving licences with photos, social
security 'swipe' cards and the use of national insurance and national health
service numbers for new purposes.
He said: 'The issue is too fundamental for the UK to allow itself simply to
slip into having a de facto national identification system without the
necessary safeguards and restrictions.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Political Notebook: Time to make common cause on pay and
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let us get one or two things clear. The debate about the relationship
between jobs, pay and benefits will not go away. Politicians cannot ignore
the structural shifts in the economy which are driving down the wages and
the employment opportunities of the unskilled. But sound-bite politics and
complex economics make uneasy bedfellows.
The debate will become a serious one only when politicians recognise that
neither the market nor government alone offers simple solutions, and when
they address the electorate in terms which illuminate rather than obscure
the arguments.
Take the fashionable phrase of the moment. When Labour leadership contender
Mr Tony Blair or chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke say they are committed to full
employment they are deliberately not speaking the language of the average
voter.
Of course both would likely the sort of economic revival that delivered a
job to everyone who wanted one. But all they are promising is the
formulation of the 1944 white paper - a high and stable level of employment.
Whatever that is.
Next the minimum wage. The government insists that any interference in the
rates of pay set by the market is anathema. Depending on what day of the
week it is, ministers proclaim a minimum wage would price hundreds of
thousands or even millions out of work.
They omit to add that the government already imposes a floor on wages - or
more accurately a series of floors - through the benefit system.
In-work benefits have removed the 100 per cent marginal tax rates which used
to apply to those on the bottom end of the income scale. But if an
individual is guaranteed, say, Pounds 120 a week in income support, housing
benefit and council tax rebate he or she is hardly like to jump at a job
paying Pounds 100 a week.
Then there is Mr Blair's commitment to a minimum wage. The pledge apparently
is inviolable. But he will not put a figure on it and certain groups - young
people being the most obvious one - are to be excluded.
Mr Clarke is promising to square one of the circles. He is looking in his
November Budget to an expansion of in-work benefits such as family credit.
His reasons are partly political - the government needs a carrot to put
alongside the stick of tougher rules for unemployed claimants when the new
Job-seekers' Allowance is introduced.
But in the chancellor's mind benefit supplements for those on low wages
allow the government to meet its social obligations without destroying jobs
by re-regulating the labour market. He calls it combining US-style economics
with European-style social policy.
Of course, it is not as simple as that. Just as the benefit level blunts
market forces, so too do income supplements.
Family credit allows employers to maximise profits by keeping wages below
the level the market would otherwise force them to pay. In some cases
in-work benefits simply prolong the life of uneconomic businesses. Taxpayers
employed by more efficient companies provide the subsidy.
But perhaps we should be glad that Mr Clarke's faith in the free market
falls short of his public pronouncements - and, incidentally, that Mr Blair
sees the role of the welfare system as providing a path out of dependency.
The political priority of both parties should be to get many more of the
unskilled unemployed back into work. A few ideological inconsistencies are a
small price to pay.
An extension of in-work benefits from parents to single people and a more
gradual tapering of the rate at which the support is withdrawn as recipients
move up the income scale will provide some but not all the answers.
There are other perversities in the tax and benefit system which make a
mockery of incentives by subjecting the low-paid to effective tax rates of
70 per cent or 80 per cent or by preventing them from taking part-time work.
Remedying that will be expensive in the short-term and will lead to
predictable howls from the Tory right about the numbers of people on
benefit.
More fundamentally, the economy needs a better-educated workforce and a
higher level of productive investment to provide the capacity for a faster
growth rate. Finding the right mix of market forces and government action to
achieve that ambition remains the subject of serious and legitimate
disagreement between the two main parties.
But there should be common cause about the need to do more now to provide an
escape from dependency for the present generation of under-educated,
unskilled workers. Mr Blair and Mr Clarke should tell us for once they
agree.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Pensions appeal sent to Lords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A man yesterday won permission to challenge in the House of Lords a court
decision giving his divorced wife a right to a share in his pension as a
'post-nuptial settlement'.
In a two-to-one majority ruling in May the Court of Appeal ruled that the
wife was entitled to a share of the self-administered pension scheme set up
by the husband, who had a controlling interest in a company where his wife
worked as secretary. Because of the importance of the case the three appeal
judges took the rare step of granting leave for it to go straight to the
House of Lords.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Full-time worker numbers reduced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 38 per cent of Britain's workers are no longer in full-time
permanent employment according to figures released today.
About 9.7m people are either part-timers, in temporary jobs, self-employed,
on a government training scheme or an unpaid family worker, a rise of 1.25m
since 1986, says the government's Employment Gazette.
The proportion of men in employment who are part of the flexible workforce
has risen to 3.7m - 27 per cent from 18 per cent eight years ago. Among
women it has remained stable at about 50 per cent, or 5.9m.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Welsh fears on mines sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners of Welsh private coal mines are threatening to complain to the
European Commission in Brussels about the proposed terms for the sale of
British Coal.
The owners are worried that the government will sell British Coal cheaply,
in effect subsidising new competitors.
Mr Rhys Jeffrey, chairman of the South Wales Small Mines Association, a
trade group representing 60 companies, said his members calculated that it
cost Pounds 15 a tonne to gain access to coal. But one-off pit-leasing deals
implied a cost of only Pounds 5 a tonne.
The Department of Trade and Industry stressed that the sales process was
competitive. It said: 'The market will determine the true value of the
business to be sold.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / MPs told of threat to police fight on laundering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ability of police to react efficiently to information on money
laundering is being hampered by lack of resources, Mr Albert Pacey,
director-general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, told the
Commons home affairs committee yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes.
He said police had been 'inundated' with requests for information about
money laundering following recent legislation aimed at curbing the growth of
organised crime. Mr Pacey told the cross-party committee that the police
would like to help more in tackling money laundering but did not have the
staff to deal with the workload.
Under the new legislation police and other enforcement agencies have
increased powers to investigate bank accounts and businesses suspected of
generating or transacting money as a result of criminal or terrorist
activities.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Income of Crown Estate set to soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Crown Estate, which owns large tracts of London's West End, including
all of Regent Street, will see its income rise sharply in the next decade as
many of its long-running fixed-rent leases expire.
The estate, which yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in net rents, said
prospects for income growth in Regent Street, one of the world's premier
shopping streets, were excellent.
Mr Christopher Howes, chief executive, said ground leases on about a quarter
of the 123 Regent Street properties fell due between now and 2005.
The properties represent the bulk of 42 buildings let in the street during
the 1920s on long leases and fixed rents which are now very low. Mr Howes
said: 'They account for about 28 per cent of Regent Street's capital value
of Pounds 305m, but produce only 4 per cent of its rents.'
The estate is part of the hereditary possessions of the sovereign, managed
under the provisions of the Crown Estate Act 1961 by the Crown Estate. The
net surplus, after deductions for management expenses, is paid to the
Exchequer. The organisation's role dates back to 1760, when King George III
handed over profits from the Crown's estates to parliament in exchange for
the provision of the Civil List. Under new Civil List arrangements the Queen
will receive Pounds 7.9m this year.
The revenue surplus to be handed to parliament increased 6.2 per cent last
year to Pounds 78.9m.
More than two thirds of income and 77 per cent of capital value was
generated from urban property, four-fifths in central London.
The value of the estate's property portfolio also rose in 1993-94 - for the
first time in four years - increasing by 17.5 per cent to Pounds 1.95bn. In
1990, however, the value of the estate's property portfolio was almost
Pounds 2.4bn.
The surplus on rents, however, has risen throughout the recession,
increasing by 80 per cent since 1988-89. This was due mainly to a decision
in 1989 to curtail all new development.
More recently the estate has increased investments outside the capital in
business parks in Cambridge and Guildford, offices in St Albans and a retail
park in Leamington Spa.
The estate is responsible for managing 55 per cent of Britain's foreshore,
almost all of the seabed out to 12 miles, as well as large tracts of
farmland and forests. Agricultural income last year increased by 9.6 per
cent to Pounds 9.13m while income from marine activities rose by 10.5 per
cent to Pounds 14.7m.
The estate expects to increase its total revenue surplus to about Pounds 81m
in the current financial year.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Council workers reject 3.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authority employers yesterday increased their pay offer from 3.2 per
cent to 3.9 per cent but it was rejected by unions representing the 1.5m
employees.
Privately, both sides say industrial conflict is highly unlikely. The
employers hinted that a slightly improved final offer will be made on July
21, saying they were 'close to' their limit.
The employers said the offer, which would be paid in two stages and last
until April 1996, would increase the Pounds 14bn pay bill by more than
Pounds 500m.
As the government - which directly funds 85 per cent of local government
spending - is assuming the same pay bill as last year, that means cutting
jobs and services to finance the pay increase.
Mr Charles Nolda, spokesman for the employers, said: 'The government has a
pay bill freeze but it is not policing this pay negotiation in any way. We
are free to do exactly what we want.'
Last year the local authority pay bill did not rise - in spite of a 1.5 per
cent pay increase - thanks to the departure of 50,000 employees. This year,
however, Mr Nolda expects a smaller reduction in staff which means more
services are likely to be cut.
At the next negotiations on July 21 the employers may make further
improvements to the non-pay elements of the deal. Already this year they
have agreed to extend maternity leave arrangements to low-paid part-time
staff, partly as a result of European Court rulings, and agreed five days
paternity leave. The current offer would mean both blue-collar and
white-collar workers receiving an average rise of 2.1 per cent this year and
a further 1.8 per cent from August 1995. This means a 21-month settlement
for white-collar staff and a 19-month offer for manual workers.
Mr Mick Graham of the GMB general union said the deal would mean a pay cut
for workers this year.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Delay likely in reaching Ulster accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has virtually given up hope of agreeing with Dublin the
framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland in
time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month.
With only about two weeks to go before the date pencilled in for this
meeting, it emerged at Westminster last night that significant differences
remain over at least two crucial issues.
Recent contacts between officials working on the agreement are understood to
have made little progress. September is now regarded as a more realistic
target date for the document's completion.
The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to
Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance
cross-border co-operation.
London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's
territorial claim is not resolved.
But it sees little point in granting concessions on north-south relations
that would be rejected out of hand by unionists.
It is understood, in particular, that Britain has rejected any suggestion
that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the
province.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, last week hinted that his
party would take a hard line on the issue by telling MPs that any form of
joint authority must 'terminate in British Isles unity for there is no
halfway house'.
London and Dublin are also divided on whether the framework document should
simply provide a starting point for new political talks, in line with
London's wishes, or set out a specific blueprint for the province's future.
London has consistently avoided setting a firm deadline for completion of
the document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border
co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland. The
Republic of Ireland is seeking 'the closest possible links between a
Northern Ireland administration and the Irish government', but this would
not amount to joint administration with London, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, said yesterday, Tim Coone writes.
Speaking in Dublin to business people from both sides of the border, his
comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in
Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two
governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority.
Mr Spring said a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'.
Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be
'realistic' to lift cross-border trade from IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a
year to IPounds 3bn.
In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest
the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' Mr Spring
said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Abolition of two more county authorities urged: Warwickshire
and Wiltshire residents to be consulted - Unitary local authority urged for
Swindon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swindon will be given a self-governing unitary authority under plans
announced yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England, but the
two-tier status quo of counties and districts remains on the table for both
Warwickshire and Wiltshire.
The commission yesterday suggested that both counties should be split into
unitary authorities - bringing the number of county councils recommended for
abolition since the beginning of June to 12. But in both cases it said it
would consult local people.
The recommendations are:
Warwickshire: The commission cautiously proposed the abolition of
Warwickshire County Council and the county's five district councils, and
their replacement by two unitary authorities.
The commission said: 'There are strong arguments both for retaining the
present two-tier structure and for moving to a unitary system. At this
stage, the conclusion is that on balance the county would benefit from a
change to unitary local government.'
But Mr Brian Hill, in charge of the review of the county, said: 'There
doesn't appear to be any tremendous groundswell for change.'
In the next 11 weeks the commission will gauge views in Warwickshire on
splitting it into north and south unitary authorities, or leaving local
government as it is.
North Warwickshire - which includes Nuneaton and Bedworth, and Rugby
districts - would be a string of small industrial centres wrapped around the
eastern side of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. South Warwickshire
 -Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick - would be more rural. The cost of setting
up the two authorities is estimated at up to Pounds 20m, with annual savings
of up to Pounds 7m a year.
Wiltshire: The commission is proposing two alternatives, both of which
involve giving unitary status to Thamesdown borough, centred on Swindon.
This has been supported by both the borough council and the county council,
and is unlikely to provoke opposition.
The commission's first preference for the rest of Wiltshire is to split it
into two unitaries - Mid-Wiltshire, consisting of the present North
Wiltshire district plus most of Kennet and West Wiltshire districts, and
South Wiltshire, which would merge Salisbury with the Warminster and
Tidworth areas of Kennet and West Wiltshire. This structure would 'recognise
the natural divide of Salisbury Plain', the commission said, at a start-up
cost of Pounds 12m to Pounds 14m.
Alternatively, the two-tier structure of counties and districts would remain
intact outside Swindon.
Delays caused by legal action mean that the county of Cleveland will not be
split into four unitary authorities until April 1996, Mr David Curry, the
local government minister, said yesterday.
The government had planned to implement the change in April next year, with
elections for the new authorities the following month. Delays caused by the
county's appeal for judicial review of the decision, which the High Court
rejected last week, made this timetable harder to implement.
Labour had also objected to the plan to create new authorities before the
areas had held democratic elections.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Council reforms clear last hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill to reform local government in Wales - replacing the eight county
councils and 37 district councils with 22 unitary authorities - has received
royal assent.
Under the Local Government (Wales) Act, shadow elections to the single-tier
councils will be held next May and the new bodies will take over on April 1
1996, a year later than envisaged by a white paper published in March 1993.
The only substantial changes made to the bill during its passage through
parliament were an increase in the number of unitary councils from 21 to 22,
and a government amendment to allow decentralised area committees in
geographically-large authorities such as Powys.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority is likely to withhold Pounds 2m
from Regional Railways Central - 40 per cent of the subsidy to the train
operating company for running services during the quarter to June, Paul
Cheeseright writes.
Centro, the authority's operating arm, said that since the break-up of the
industry on April 1 'only 60.5 per cent of Centro subsidised services on
seven local lines ran to within three minutes of timetable'.
Centro acknowledged that there were infrastructure problems but 'a
significant amount of chaos has been directly attributable to staff
shortages which should have been avoided.' No comment was available from
Regional Railways Central.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Yen's rise lifts imports of vehicles to
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's ability to defy gravity has been a boon to vehicle imports to
Japan, which rose by 40.3 per cent to a record 137,966 units in the first
half of this year, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Sales of imported vehicles climbed by 42.9 per cent last month from a year
earlier, as Japanese consumers took advantage of the falling yen price of
foreign cars.
Overseas plants of Japanese producers have also benefited. Imports of
foreign-made Japanese vehicles nearly doubled last month to just under 9,000
(30 per cent of all imports).
Reuter adds from Washington: The US and Japan broke off trade talks
yesterday and officials said the negotiators had failed to strike any deals
for the Group of Seven summit in Italy this weekend.
The two sides plan to resume talks after the summit, once seen as a deadline
for a deal. But, said a US official, 'we had no expectations (for a G7 deal)
and we have met them.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Trinidad and Chile 'top list for US links'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chile and Trinidad and Tobago are the countries best prepared to take on
free trade and investment agreements with the US, according to a report
released yesterday by the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics.
Of the countries seeking trade pacts with the US, Chile and Trinidad and
Tobago head a list which includes Barbados, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia.
The US administration has stressed that Chile is at the head of the queue
for free trade agreements, although Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados are
also considered excellent candidates.
Policymakers have yet to decide whether the trade agreements should be
entered on a bilateral basis or through accession to the North America Free
Trade Agreement.
The report 'strongly' recommends the Nafta route. With bilateral talks, the
authors say, there is the risk that Nafta members would feel they were being
played off against potential new US partners, it says.
The report, by Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott, is the IIE's
contribution to the current debate in the Clinton administration. Economic
integration in the hemisphere is now a goal to which the administration has
gradually committed itself; the best means to achieve it are under
discussion in the US and between US officials and their Latin American
counterparts.
The authors say integration within the Americas will proceed more slowly
than it has in Europe and without the transfer of funds - or cohesion -
between the rich EU countries and their poorer brethren. As the US debate
over Nafta showed, labour and environmental standards will be more
contentious than in Europe.
'When income disparities and social conditions between trade partners are
great, the trauma of economic integration is bound to be large,' the report
says. 'The economic playing field looks distinctly slanted and, for
different reasons, each country feels threatened by the economic standing of
its partners.'
To measure a country's readiness for free trade, the authors have devised a
set of indicators based on price stability, budget discipline, external
debt, currency stability, market-oriented policies, reliance on trade taxes,
and functioning democracy.
Strong commitment to economic liberalisation policies is preparing many
countries for the shock of freer trade. Thus the potential of Argentina,
which now stands at only 2.6 on the Hufbauer-Schott scale of 5.0, is
considered greater than it seems because 'its low scores on price stability
and external debt will jump sharply if the reforms are maintained.'
Brazil, which is pushing economic integration within South America, scores
only 2.3. Chile and Trinidad and Tobago are put at 4.4. Just before it
joined Nafta, Mexico was at 3.9.
In preparation for the Summit of the Americas, to be held in Miami in
December, the US administration has been consulting its Latin partners and
eyeing various roads to regional integration. All of such partners would
gain by freer trade and investment ties throughout the hemisphere, says the
report. US exports could gain by about Dollars 36bn (Pounds 23bn) in 2002;
its imports would be about Dollars 28bn.
'Our emphasis will be on 'building blocks' of various types, in advance of
free trade agreements,' said Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, recently
in Buenos Aires. 'These can include intellectual property agreements,
bilateral investment treaties, understanding on disciplines that we
recognise are broadly supported by the private sector. . . The Nafta's
disciplines will serve as a model in many respects.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Gatt joins battle for right to protect -
Frances Williams on differences with Wipo over intellectual property
jurisdiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no trade secret that relations between the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and its near-neighbour in Geneva, the World Intellectual
Property Organisation, have been strained in recent years.
Wipo, a UN agency which administers 16 international intellectual property
treaties, lost with bad grace a crucial turf battle to Gatt when
intellectual property protection went on the agenda of the Uruguay Round of
global trade talks in 1986.
After years struggling unsuccessfully to negotiate new and revised treaties
for the protection of patents, copyrights and trademarks, Wipo watched Gatt
members put together, in record time, the biggest and most comprehensive
intellectual property agreement this century.
The Gatt accord on trade-related aspects of intellectual property (Trips),
which will operate under the aegis of the new World Trade Organisation from
next year, plugs some gaping holes in the existing system.
It lays down minimum standards of protection and enforcement for all types
of intellectual property - for example, unlike Wipo's 1883 Paris Convention
on patents, it defines what is patentable and sets a minimum patent term of
20 years.
The rules will be binding on all WTO members, though developing countries
have been given a five-year transition period (11 years for the poorest) to
adopt new legislation. Thus India, the most notable absentee from the Paris
Convention, will have to provide basic patent protection.
Most important, the accord's obligations will be enforced through the WTO's
revamped disputes settlement mechanism, which will require offending
countries to mend their ways or face retaliation from trading partners. Wipo
has no enforcement powers.
Trade experts are predicting a rush of disputes once the new system comes
into force, as governments test the ability of the Trips agreement to
resolve current disagreements. It also provides the first opportunity to
test divergent national interpretations of the Paris Convention and the
equally venerable 1886 Berne Convention on copyright, whose substantive
provisions are incorporated in the WTO accord.
With negotiation and interpretation of international rules on intellectual
property now apparently annexed by the WTO, Wipo's influence is being
questioned.
Wipo's main activity, which occupies two-thirds of its 450 staff, is in any
case not negotiation but registration of patents, trademarks, industrial
designs and appellations of origin. Registration earns Wipo almost SFr90m
(Pounds 43m) a year, three-quarters of its SFr115m 1994 budget income. And
business is booming.
Nearly 29,000 international patent applications were filed in 1993 under the
Patent Co-operation Treaty which enables inventors to apply for registration
in several countries with a single application. This is five times the
number a decade ago, while the average number of designated countries per
application has jumped from 10 to 31.
The UN agency's other important focus is giving advice to developing
countries on such matters as running patent offices or drafting intellectual
property legislation.
Wipo's technical co-operation and registration activities are, if anything,
likely to receive a fillip from the Trips accord by encouraging developing
countries to upgrade intellectual property protection.
In a separate move, Wipo has established a mediation and arbitration centre
to handle disputes between private parties which is due to begin operations
this October.
Nor is it a foregone conclusion that Wipo's negotiating role has ended.
Washington railroaded intellectual property rights on to the Uruguay Round
agenda because developing countries were blocking negotiations in Wipo. They
eventually accepted a Trips agreement in return for benefits in other areas
of the round, including textiles and farm trade.
But, with no further all-embracing trade round in prospect, trade-offs
between sectors may be less important than in the past. Developing countries
have mostly come round to the benefits of intellectual property protection
and within the WTO, the initial emphasis is expected to be on implementing
the new agreement, which is virgin trade territory. Though the Trips accord
provides for a review after five years, trade officials do not envisage big
changes early on.
This leaves the way clear for Wipo, which already has several negotiating
projects on the stocks. These include two new treaties to supplement the
Paris Convention, a Patent Law Treaty and a Trademark Law Treaty which aim
to harmonise national norms. Wipo is also considering a protocol to the
Berne Convention to deal with new media and information technologies.
Wipo officials admit that these are proving difficult negotiations. Talks on
the Patent Law Treaty, which have been going on for 10 years, are stalled
because Washington refuses to drop its first-to-invent filing system (the
rest of the world uses a first-to-file system). But 'no one is saying the
issues should go to Gatt,' notes Mr Francois Curchod, Wipo's deputy director
general.
The future of a draft treaty on dispute settlement (though without any
sanctions provisions) will be discussed by Wipo's 147-member general
assembly in September in the light of the Uruguay Round deal. Wipo officials
point out that, outside those specific provisions of the Paris and Berne
Conventions embraced by the Trips accord, Wipo agreements are not
enforceable by the WTO.
Still undecided is what role Wipo should have in the WTO's disputes
procedure. Gatt members have so far shown a strong disinclination to boost
substantially the number of staff working on Trips from the present one and
a half. Paradoxically, to make the new procedure work, the WTO may need all
the outside help it can get.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Ford in Poland car talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and the Polish government have begun negotiations on a project to
assemble the Ford Escort car from kits for the Polish and bordering markets,
John Griffiths reports.
This could involve the assembly of about 10,000 cars a year and has been put
to Warsaw as a substitute for a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32m) project to produce
car interior trim in Poland. Ford has abandoned that.
The negotiations, understood to have been going on for some months, are
still some way from conclusion, according to indications by Ford of Europe
executives this week.
Ford announced in the middle of last year its intention to set up a Polish
greenfield operation to make seat covers for export to its own car plants
and other European vehicle producers.
Ford then said the plant, at Plonsk, some 60 miles north-west of Warsaw,
would come on stream late this year and would employ up to 1,000 people.
Since then, however, Ford embarked on a major restructuring under its new
chairman, Mr Alex Trotman. The Plonsk venture became a casualty of that.
Ford no longer regards the manufacture of car interior trim as a core
business and is placing it with outside suppliers.
Even so, Plonsk is believed not to have been ruled out as a possible
location for the car assembly project.
That would be the third manufacturing venture undertaken by Ford in central
Europe since mid-1992.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Reynolds in CIS aluminium project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group, has signed a
technology transfer and technical assistance agreement that is to help
convert a substantial portion of an aluminium defence and aerospace plant in
the former Soviet Union into a manufacturer of aluminium sheet for beverage
cans.
Mr Randy Reynolds, vice-chairman of Reynolds, suggested the agreement was
the first step towards the launch of aluminium beverage cans in Russia,
which would mean the Commonwealth of Independent States consuming more of
the aluminium it produces.
'By sharing our technology, we expect Sameco (Samara Metallurgical Company)
to become the first to produce can stock in the CIS,' Mr Reynolds said.
The former Soviet aluminium industry was set up primarily to supply material
for defence and aerospace applications. The collapse of the Soviet Union
left industry with huge surplus capacity. It has turned to exporting on a
much larger scale.
Exports to the west surged from 250,000 tonnes in 1989 to more than 2m
tonnes last year, which forced down world prices to their lowest level in
real terms.
The Samara-based company, to which Reynolds will provide assistance, has
shut down most of its plant, which once produced hard-alloy aluminium sheet,
plate, forgings and extrusions mainly for the defence and aerospace
industries. Sameco hopes to begin producing can stock by the end of 1995.
Reynolds, the world's third-largest manufacturer of aluminium beverage cans,
has joint ventures for aluminium beverage cans in Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Reynolds and its affiliates have 20 plants
world-wide with the capacity to produce 21bn cans a year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, TUNIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli and Palestinian leaders yesterday agreed to invite Egypt and Jordan
to join them in a conference on Palestinian refugees and to create joint
committees to discuss unresolved issues on the Gaza-Jericho accord and the
transfer of civilian responsibilities to Palestinians in the rest of the
West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign
minister, met Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, in Paris yesterday.
After their first meeting since their May 4 agreement in Cairo on
self-government for Gaza and Jericho, they were due last night to resume
their discussions in the French capital.
The two sides remain in disagreement over the number of Palestinian refugees
displaced by the 1967 war, with Israel apparently putting the number at
200,000; the PLO estimates the number at 860,000.
Mr Arafat said his meeting with Israeli leaders had been 'positive and
fruitful'. But he called on Mr Rabin to show 'more co-ordination and
comprehension' to reinforce the peace agreements, first signed last
September in Washington.
He said he had raised the issue of Israel's detention of Palestinians and
its 'isolation of Jerusalem' from the peace process.
Reuter adds from Tunis: A member of the Palestinian authority set up to run
the Gaza Strip and Jericho will attend a business meeting in East Jerusalem
on July 20, he said yesterday.
Mr Ahmed Korei, better known as Abu Ala, who is in charge of economy and
trade in the Palestinian authority, said he had accepted an invitation to
address a meeting expected to be attended by 500 Palestinian businessmen
from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Last month, one of his colleagues, Mr
Nabil Shaath, in charge of international co-operation, gave up a planned
visit to Jerusalem after protests by Israeli radicals.
King Hussein of Jordan began talks in Cairo with Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak on Amman's accelerated peace process with Israel, due to pick up
later in July. Jordanian officials said King Hussein wanted to strengthen
his country's ties with Egypt ahead of the first Jordanian-Israeli
negotiations later this month.
An Israeli army officer was killed by guerrilla shelling on an Israeli
position in south Lebanon yesterday, an army spokeswoman said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Liebenberg, tough player who delivers the goods: Mark Suzman
looks at the career and prospects of South Africa's future finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At another time in South Africa's history the appointment of Mr Christo
Liebenberg as finance minister would probably have been greeted with
approval and relief. He is a respected banker with strong private-sector
credentials, a sound understanding of the economy, and a tough, conservative
attitude to fiscal discipline: all ample qualifications for the job.
Unfortunately for Mr Liebenberg, credentials are not enough. Although
perhaps the worst that can be said of him is that he is not Mr Derek Keys,
the widely admired incumbent who on Tuesday announced his decision to step
down in October, it is at present almost the only thing being said of him in
the Johannesburg business community.
So profound has been the influence of Mr Keys during his two years at South
Africa's economic tiller, and so deep the dismay at his departure, that
relatively little attention has so far been focused on Mr Liebenberg and
what he is likely to do with the job.
None the less, as replacements go, Mr Liebenberg is among the most credible.
He retired in February as chief executive of Nedcor, South Africa's fourth
largest banking and financial services group, where he had built a solid
reputation as a dedicated and hard-working executive.
Born in 1934 in the small town of Touwsrivier in the Western Cape, he was
educated at Worcester Boys' High School, where he matriculated in 1951. He
started work in the mail room of a Nedbank branch a year later and worked
his way up the ranks while moving around the country with Nedbank and taking
a short stint with Morgan Guaranty in New York. En route, he picked up
qualifications from the Institute of Bankers, Insead and Harvard.
Under his leadership, Nedcor became increasingly involved in social policy.
The Perm, its mortgage arm, is the biggest provider in the black home loan
market, and his appointment has met with the approval of both President
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and Mr F W de Klerk's National
party.
With no previous political experience, it is business credentials rather
than political skills that Mr Liebenberg will be expected to bring to his
new post.
'He's a very good backroom man,' says one businessman who has worked with
him. 'He understands the issues, works through them carefully and delivers
the goods.' Another banker agrees: 'Liebenberg's a journeyman executive.
He's capable and will work hard at the job.'
Affable and good-humoured, Mr Liebenberg is seen as unlikely to diverge much
from the cautious fiscal policy framework set out by Mr Keys over the past
two years. But he is both less charismatic and less cerebral than the
ebullient Mr Keys, and will find it harder to win people over to his point
of view.
He also has a much lower international profile than his predecessor, which
may be a handicap in dealings with the global banking community. 'He's not
as persuasive or influential as Keys and will probably have difficulties in
the cut-and-thrust of politics,' says another businessman.
As a businessman Mr Liebenberg was regarded as an opponent of the
maintenance of South Africa's two-tier currency and exchange controls, but
is seen as a strong ally of Mr Chris Stals, the Reserve Bank governor, who
is known to be reluctant to alter the present system until economic
fundamentals improve. As a result, most observers expect little alteration
to existing policy in the immediate future.
One probable result of Mr Liebenberg's appointment will be a shift of
influence within the government's economic policy team. Whereas Mr Keys was
the dominant figure in the troika he made up along with the ANC's Mr Alec
Erwin, his deputy, and Mr Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, the new
arrangement will probably be more of a gathering of equals.
While Mr Keys has made Mr Liebenberg's job easier by giving his successor an
economy in much better shape than the one he inherited, he has made it much
harder by having set such a capable example.
'Keys was so good at the job, many people seemed to feel he could walk on
water if he had to,' said one grudging admirer. 'Mr Liebenberg, however,
will have to learn to swim.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / France deeper in Rwanda morass: Leslie Crawford reports that
neutrality is becoming harder to maintain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's decision to create civilian safe havens in Rwanda has set the stage
for another foreign military entanglement in Africa of unknown duration and
unpredictable results.
The plan, backed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, but not
yet endorsed by an increasingly uneasy Security Council, lays France open to
charges that its humanitarian intervention was a thinly veiled disguise to
prop up the collapsing regime of a former military client.
After the capture this week of the capital Kigali and Butare, Rwanda's
second-largest town, by rebel forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF),
most government soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilians have taken
refuge behind French lines in south-western Rwanda.
It is becoming increasingly difficult for France to maintain the pretence of
neutrality. The French have drawn a 10km cordon sanitaire around Gikongoro,
the next big town to the west of Butare, which the RPF will not be allowed
to cross.
Commandos have taken up position on hilltops around the town, picking out
sites for heavy mortars, machine guns and anti-tank missiles. Some 300
Foreign Legionnaires are already dug in to halt a further advance of
guerrillas less than 20km away.
The French have not disarmed Rwandan government soldiers at Gikongoro; many
can be seen at barricades set up by French marines and paratroops. France's
'humanitarian' mission has blurred two issues: the genocide against the
Tutsi minority, which French forces arrived too late to prevent, and a civil
war which began in 1990.
From the start of Operation Turquoise a fortnight ago, French forces have
tried to equate the suffering of the few thousand Tutsis who escaped mass
slaughter with the plight of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who have fled
the rebel advance. Central to their argument for setting up civilian
protection zones is the belief that Hutus would also be slaughtered if the
RPF were allowed to overrun government-held territory.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says few incidents of revenge
killings have occurred in the two-thirds of the country controlled by the
RPF. But in the Hutu refugee camps sprouting around Gikongoro, most people
believe reports of blood-curdling rebel atrocities broadcast on government
radio stations, but when questioned, no one has witnessed such events.
'The Tutsi have dug wells 60 metres deep to hide the Hutus they have
killed,' a young Hutu militiaman manning a road block near Gikongoro says.
'That is how they have concealed the evidence of their crimes.'
Such propaganda played a big role in inciting Hutus to slaughter their Tutsi
neighbours in the weeks after President Juvenal Habyarimana's death in an
air crash in April. Government radio accused the Tutsi-led RPF of shooting
down the president's aircraft.
In a letter to the UN secretary-general, the RPF calls the French protection
zones 'a safe haven for the authors and perpetrators of the genocide. We
have always believed and still maintain that the real motive behind the
unilateral French intervention in Rwanda is to prop up the discredited
regime (and) preserve a role for these murderers in the future politics of
Rwanda,' the letter says.
While the Security Council awaits the report of a special UN rapporteur on
the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda, human rights groups are urging France to
arrest those individuals responsible for directing the attrocities.
Not only are the French unlikely to do so, they will be hard-pressed to find
Hutu leaders acceptable to the RPF to negotiate an end to the conflict. Most
moderate Hutu community leaders have been murdered by Hutu extremists.
But some of the most ardent supporters of a negotiated settlement are to be
found among the Tutsi survivors, now herded in French-guarded refugee camps
in government-held territory. 'If the RPF really wants to save Tutsi lives,'
says a Tutsi priest, 'they should bring this war to an end.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Mandela tries to re-establish confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela yesterday sought to re-establish confidence in
South Africa's economic management following the sudden resignation of Mr
Derek Keys as finance minister on Tuesday.
He stressed that Mr Christo Liebenberg, named as Mr Keys's successor, would
follow the government's existing commitments on economic and fiscal policy.
'There is no necessity for concern that the policies followed by Derek Keys
will be abandoned,' he said, after a meeting with the Japanese ambassador
about a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 866m) financial aid package Japan is pledging
to South Africa.
Mr Mandela also emphasised that Mr Liebenberg's mandate would be to pursue
macroeconomic stability and strive to reduce the budget deficit while
promoting the government's reconstruction and development programme.
Further reassurance came from Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, who
said the move would not result in a change of policy and that Mr Liebenberg
would shortly be brought into finance ministry decisions. 'We will be
briefing him as soon as possible,' he said, stressing that Mr Keys would
actively contribute to policy decisions until his departure, due in October.
In a statement to be published in today's edition of the Johannesburg
newspaper Business Day, Mr Erwin sought to reinforce the notion that a
cautious fiscal policy was central to the ANC's economic strategy. 'Fiscal
and monetary policy are essential to the reconstruction and development
programme. They are not expedients to encourage people to lend us money.'
However, neither Mr Liebenberg nor Mr Keys issued any statement yesterday,
and uncertainty over the reasons given for Mr Keys's resignation partially
undermined the effect of Mr Mandela's assurances. There was also widespread
criticism of the manner and handling of the move, which leaked out on
Tuesday ahead of the formal announcement. Business and union leaders
insisted on a more comprehensive government explanation of the 'personal
reasons' which lay behind Mr Keys' decision.
Markets remained jittery, and the overall stock exchange index finished down
47 points at 5,404. Bond yields rose further, although the currency market
was relatively stable. 'Until we know the full reason for the move, new
rumours will keep flying around, destabilising the market,' said one
disgruntled dealer.
Mr Mandela said that the government had consulted business leaders on Mr
Keys' resignation before selecting Mr Liebenberg as a successor. 'In
everything we do we keep very close to business,' he said. 'We made it a
point to call on the captains of business.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / North Yemeni forces seize Aden suburbs: South faces defeat
as civil war rivals are reported to be negotiating surrender terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yemen's civil war foes were reported last night to be negotiating the
surrender of the remaining southern strongholds in Aden, after northern
troops yesterday seized two outlying suburbs.
Surrender of Aden would mark defeat for the South Yemeni leaders' two-month
battle to secede from the unified state forged with North Yemen four years
ago.
Southern officials told Reuter's news agency the negotiations could lead to
an agreement for southern leaders to flee or to stay on with unspecified
guarantees.
Officials in Sanaa, the North Yemen capital, confirmed there were direct
contacts between north and south.
After several days of fierce fighting, forces loyal to the Sanaa government
of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have now secured the south's second city of
Mukallah and its al-Rayan airport, which had been critical to the southern
air force. They also seized the south's sole oil producing operations at
Masilah, east of Aden.
Witnesses quoted by news agencies in Aden said northern troops had captured
the heavily populated suburbs of Sheikh Othman and Mansoura, 8km north of
the rocky peninsula which houses the beleaguered port and city centre.
Residents said dozens of people were killed or wounded. But as soon as
fighting stopped, northern trucks distributed water, fruit juice and food to
the hungry and parched people of the suburbs. The northerners let southern
troops go free after seizing weapons and army vehicles, the residents said.
South Yemeni leader Ali Salem al-Baidh was reported to have fled Mukallah,
probably for the isolated desert area between the city and the Omani border.
The self-declared South Yemeni government yesterday lost any hope of
immediate formal recognition by its neighbours. A meeting of the
Gulf-Co-operation Council, as well as Egypt and Syria, called for a
ceasefire but shied from supporting southern secession.
Arab League officials are due to fly to Sanaa today to urge enforcement of
UN ceasefire resolutions, but diplomats said they thought President Saleh
was determined to see the war through to victory.
The International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva said humanitarian
conditions in Aden continued to worsen, and fighting was so intense local
Red Cross workers had been unable to repair damaged water wells, vital to
the city of 450,000 now more than three weeks without fresh water.
An official said two Red Cross-supplied vessels off Aden remained offshore,
unable to dock and unload medical and sanitation equipment for want of
security guarantees. He said hospitals were overcrowded in Aden, Mukallah
and Taiz.
Canadian Occidental said its Masilah operation - which produces 160,000
barrels a day - had resumed pumping after a brief overnight closure between
Monday and Tuesday 'to test our shutdown mechanisms' and production
continued 'without any problem at all'. The company said the Masilah area
had come under northern control in the past two days.
Diplomats in Sanaa were also quoted by Reuter as saying output was back on
stream from the north's main Marib oilfield, which Yemeni officials said at
the weekend had been halted by a southern air raid last week. The Dallas
headquarters of Hunt Oil, which operates the 190,000 b/d operation, refused
to comment.

North Yemeni forces yesterday seized two northern suburbs of the beleaguered
city of Aden as their strangulation of the secessionist south appeared close
to delivering outright victory in the two-month civil war.
Forces loyal to the Sanaa government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have
now secured, after several days of fierce fighting, the south's second city
of Mukallah, its al-Rayan airport which had been critical to the southern
airforce, and the south's sole oil producing operations at Masilah, east of
Aden.
The self-declared southern government also lost immediate hope of formal
recognition by its more powerful neighbours yesterday, when a meeting in
Kuwait of the Gulf-Co-operation Council (comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar) as well as Egypt and Syria
concluded with a statement condemning the fighting and calling for a
ceasefire, but shied away from supporting the south's secession.
However, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Kuwait's foreign minister, said
later that if fighting in Aden descended into 'a tragedy', then 'we will
have to take our measures, and those are possibly recognition of the
(southern) republic' - though the course of fighting threatens to leave less
to be recognised.
Arab League officials are due to fly this morning to Sanaa in a further
attempt to urge enforcement of United Nations ceasefire resolutions, but
diplomats said they thought President Saleh was determined to see the war
through to victory. 'As Saleh makes more and more ground, he's less and less
likely to want to stop,' said one western official.
Witnesses quoted by news agencies in Aden yesterday said northern troops had
won control of the heavily populated suburbs of Sheikh Othman and Mansoura,
around 8km north of the rocky peninsula which houses both the port and city
centre. Fighting was continuing at the airport, which lies between northern
forces and the city centre.
The International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva said humanitarian
conditions continued to worsen, and fighting was so intense that local Red
Cross workers had been unable to repair damaged water wells, vital to the
city of 450,000 now more than three weeks without fresh water.
An official said two Red Cross-supplied vessels off Aden remained offshore,
unable to dock and unload medical and sanitation equipment for want of
security guarantees from officials either in the south or north. He said
hospitals were overcrowded in Aden, Mukhalla and Taiz, all in south Yemen,
but said there were no accurate estimates of casualties after the past few
days' heavy bombardment of Aden.
Canadian Occidental said in the group's Calgary base that its Masilah
operation - which produces 160,000 barrels a day - had resumed pumping after
a brief overnight closure between Monday and Tuesday 'to test our shutdown
mechanisms' and production continued 'without any problem at all'. The
company said the Masilah area had come under northern control in the past

Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will press for full implementation of
the Trinidad Terms which provide relief of debt owed to western governments
by the poorest developing nations when he meets fellow leaders at the Naples
economic summit later this week, writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor.
UK officials said the prime minister wanted all Group of Seven countries to
agree to write off at least 50 per cent of debtor countries' official debts
and apply the terms to the whole stock of debt rather than selected
maturities under the present workings of the Paris Club of industrialised
creditor countries. Mr Major devised the Trinidad Terms in 1990 when
chancellor of the Exchequer.

<TEXT>
India's industrial growth is likely to register an increase of 4.5 per cent
in 1994-95, falling short of the government target of 6 to 7 per cent
despite a sharp rise in exports, according to a report yesterday by a
Bombay-based research centre, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. This is
still an improvement on last year's figure of 3.5 per cent.
The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent research
organisation, said in its half-year economic outlook that real gross
domestic product growth would improve marginally to 4.2 per cent against the
government's estimate of 5 per cent. It estimated GDP growth in the year
toMarch 1994 as 3.5 per cent compared with the official estimate of 3.8 per
cent.
Farm output growth is expected to increase to 3 per cent, compared with last
year's 1.8 per cent, because of a good monsoon season. Inflation would be
contained at less than 10 per cent from the recent 11 per cent high. Exports
are expected to grow 15 per cent this year, down from last year's 18 per
cent.

Human rights workers around the world are falling victim to the kind of
torture, ill-treatment and other violations they are trying to prevent, the
human rights group Amnesty International says today, in its annual report
for 1993, Reuter reports from London.
Police beatings, arrests and executions without trial and mass killings have
been reported, despite a climate that increasingly highlights the importance
of human rights, the report says.
'Human rights defenders often became the first victims of governments trying
to build a good human rights image abroad and fearful of the damage human
rights activists can do to that image.'
The report, covering 151 countries, found that prisoners of conscience were
held in 63 countries, more than 100,000 political prisoners were held
without charge or trial in 53, more than 112 governments tortured or
ill-treated prisoners, and political killings by the state took place in 61
nations. Some 2,000 people were executed in 32 countries last year.
'We are also trying to draw attention to the fact that these things are not
inevitable. . . they are not flukes,' Mr Derek Evans, head of Amnesty's Asia
and Pacific research division, said. 'They are implemented as policy by
governments.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / Economic policy restated in wake of Keys' departure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is the edited text of an open letter from Mr Alec Erwin,
deputy finance minister, to be published today by the Johannesburg-based
Business Day newspaper. It sets out the economic policy position of South
Africa's government of national unity under President Nelson Mandela
following the decision of Mr Derek Keys to step down as finance minister.
'Mr Derek Keys has the full support of the president, his cabinet colleagues
and those who work with him in the decision he has taken. He was prepared to
enter the government of national unity to help it on its way. There can be
very little doubt that he has done this magnificently. He will be in
government for a few more vital months as we draft the white paper on the
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), work on the 1995-96 budget,
prepare to enter international markets and set in motion the wide-ranging
work programme of the new government. We will benefit from his surgical
insights, knowledge and deep understanding. . .
'Speaking from the ranks of the ANC there is no doubt a sense of
disappointment that such a capable minister needs to withdraw. But President
Mandela has also set a humane precedent that even in these historic times
the individual lives of leaders are deserving of respect. . .
'What is remarkable in our circumstances is how quickly a common strategy on
the key socio-economic area has emerged. . . This rapid progress has been
possible because an elegant and fiscally and administratively sound
mechanism was developed to implement the RDP. This arose out of an important
cross-fertilisation of ideas in which Mr Keys provided catalytic insights
and understanding. A clear strategy is emerging. . . broadly supported by
all parties in the national assembly.
'The essential features of this strategy are:
An overall programme that addresses basic needs, human resources, viable
economic growth and democraticisation of society.
The mobilisation of resources in all areas, not only in government.
. . .reordering expenditure priorities of government to facilitate
implementation, rather than an increase in the level of government
expenditure.
Rising inflation and balance of payments bottlenecks would destroy the RDP,
hence fiscal and monetary discipline are integral to the RDP. They are not
just expedients to encourage people to lend us money. . .
'Three things flow from this. First, the RDP Fund acts as an incentive to
effect savings in government expenditure that are then applied to immediate
needs. . . It focuses on organising delivery efficiently rather than
throwing money at problems.
'Second, we are not going on a borrowing spree to fund. . . the RDP. Our
borrowing strategy will focus on containment of the deficit, lowering costs
of borrowing, establishing a favourable strategic position in international
markets and developing links between finance, technology, expertise and
markets.
'Third, Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio with responsibility for the
RDP, will be working to co-ordinate and channel a wide range of resources in
the private sector, parastatals and non-governmental organisations towards
the RDP.
'The strategy and mechanism are coherent, bold and touched with the Keys
magic. They are fully supported by the government of national unity. Markets
understandably respond to events but countries reshape their destiny by
determination and the combined efforts of their people. We have started well
and will continue on this path.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / China bans child labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday published a labour law aimed at protecting workers' rights,
including the outlawing of the employment of children under 16.
The law, which comes into effect next January 1, appeared to be aimed partly
at answering international criticism of China's employment practices, which
have been attacked by human rights groups.
Chinese workers were also promised an eight-hour working day and a minimum
wage, but these conditions are certain to be difficult to enforce given
widely differing work practices across the country.
The new law, which lays down penalties for the mistreatment of workers,
follows criticism of exploitation of workers by foreign employers. China's
press has highlighted recently a number of workers' complaints about harsh
conditions imposed by foreign businessmen.
The labour law, which was published in the People's Daily, the Communist
party newspaper, reinforced regulations passed earlier this year specifying
an eight-hour day and a maximum 44-hour week.
Workers are also guaranteed one day off a week under the new law. Women are
not required to work beyond their seventh month of pregnancy and are
entitled to a 90-day maternity leave. They are also relieved from working in
hardship locations such as mines.
Employers are required to negotiate contracts with employees that lay down
conditions of work, including pay and the nature of work to be done.
Termination arrangements should also be specified.
The law also calls for establishment of disputes committees in work places
to include employers and workers.
In China, trade unionists are invariably members of the Communist party and
do not have a record of militancy in defence of workers' rights.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration was expected
yesterday to greet the reforms with some enthusiasm. With France, it has
linked labour rights to trade, only to be stigmatised for their efforts as
protectionists. The reforms will help garner US support for China's
candidacy in the World Trade Organisation, although there will still be
concerns about enforcement of the new legislation.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Baby Bells open legal campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Four of America's 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies yesterday launched a
legal battle aimed at freeing them from a 10-year ban on competing in the
long-distance telecommunications market and from manufacturing
telecommunications equipment.
The campaign ran into strong opposition from consumer groups and
long-distance telephone companies, arguing that the ban should not be lifted
because the Baby Bells remained local monopolies.
Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex and Southwestern Bell filed a motion asking
Judge Harold Greene of the federal district court in Washington, DC, to give
up the powers he wields over the seven Baby Bells under the Modified Final
Judgement
This is the legal settlement of an anti-trust case which led in 1984 to the
spin-off of the Baby Bells from AT&amp;T, which was left with its long-distance
operations and equipment manufacturing. Because of their local monopolies,
the Baby Bells were banned from these markets.
The Bells said changed telecommunications market conditions made the MFJ
contrary to the public interest. They produced evidence from 47 prominent
economists who argued that lifting the judgment would increase price
competition in the long-distance market and promote the invention of better
telecommunications equipment. They also claimed that they faced local
competition from other telecommunications companies.
However, opponents of the Bells' entry into the long-distance market pointed
out that they still account for some 98 per cent of telecommunications
traffic in their local regions.
The Bells said the court case was a parallel initiative to their push for
favourable congressional legislation.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Clinton's policy options shrinking on Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new US approach on refugees and the dispatch of a Navy amphibious assault
group may have bought some time for the Clinton administration over Haiti,
but critics charge that it is quickly sinking into a policy crisis.
Haitians have gone to sea in record numbers since May when President Bill
Clinton reversed a standing policy - begun under the Bush administration -
of returning all Haitians picked up at sea to Haiti for US processing.
Asylum hearings started on naval ships stationed near Jamaica and on the
Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting reports that the floating processing
centre near Jamaica was granting asylum at three times the rate of the
processing in Haiti.
In an attempt to stem the tide of sea-borne refugees prompted by such
reports, the administration switched policy again. The US now will no longer
offer boat people asylum but will provide up to 10,000 of them safe haven in
Panama, under a six-month bilateral agreement. Other safe-haven agreements
are being arranged with the Caribbean states of Dominica and Antigua.
Mr William Gray, Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, defends the new
policy as a continuation of Mr Clinton's decision not to return all Haitians
to a country where they face possible persecution. The new policy was
necessary, he says, to prevent more drownings at sea, while providing safety
for those fleeing the Caribbean state.
Mr Gray has also said the dispatch of more warships to the region was
necessary to safeguard the lives of US citizens and dual nationals - 4,000
of whom are still in Haiti - as well as the lives of 2,700 other foreigners,
including UN officials.
Mr Gray is confident that the administration will be able to restore exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, either by diplomacy or by force.
He said yesterday that Haiti's military regime would not be in power six
months from now.
For the Clinton administration, the clock is ticking and the number of
policy options is shrinking. The safe havens being set up under the new US
policy are only temporary. Amnesty International and other groups have
documented an increasing number of human rights violations - including the
use of rape to intimidate Aristide supporters - and there are varying
reports on the effectiveness of sanctions against the regime of Lt-Gen Raoul
Cedras.
Many observers believe Gen Cedras's links to Colombian drug cartels - which
shipped by some estimates Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) to Dollars 500m worth
of cocaine through Haiti last year - and to the government in the
neighbouring Dominican Republic will enable him to hang on indefinitely,
raising the spectre of US military intervention.
The Pentagon's decision to send four amphibious assault ships carrying 2,000
Marines to the region is an attempt to put pressure on Gen Cedras, whose
army consists of no more than 7,000 ill-trained and ill-equipped men, to
step down. The US is reported to have offered him and other leading members
of the military regime money and promises of amnesty if they leave Haiti.
But there is a risk that the military junta will call Mr Clinton's bluff,
forcing US military action.
Experts warn that Haiti is fast becoming a defining issue for Mr Clinton. As
the Marines sail for Haiti and the state department scrabbles for a
diplomatic solution, the next few weeks will determine if US policy on Haiti
sinks or swims.

FT  07 JUL 94 / IMF and World Bank 'must adapt to new global financial
landscape': Review calls for clearer roles after 50 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping reform of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank is needed
if these institutions are to remain relevant after radical changes in the
global financial landscape since their creation 50 years ago at Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire, an independent commission says.
The IMF should concentrate on managing the global monetary system and play
less of a role as a development agency. The Bank should focus on promoting
growth of the private sector in third world countries and improve its
overall efficiency by rationalising activities and sharply cutting staff.
The recommendations for far-reaching changes in the goals and organisation
of the IMF and Bank were released yesterday in a report by the Bretton Woods
Commission, an independent group led by Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman
of the US Federal Reserve, and containing former senior ministers, central
bankers, academics and private-sector financial experts.
The commission also proposes radical reforms of the international monetary
system to reduce exchange rate volatility and improve the prospects for
sustained economic growth. The long-term goal should be the creation of
'flexible exchange rate bands' - or target ranges - for the dollar, D-Mark
and yen.
However, the commission says, a managed system of currency zones would not
be feasible immediately. The leading economies must first strengthen their
macroeconomic policies, for example by cutting budget deficits, and achieve
greater economic convergence on key variables such as inflation.
The report says the IMF should be given the central role in co-ordinating
macroeconomic policies and in developing and implementing the proposed new
system of flexible exchange rate bands. The commission believes such a task
can be undertaken only by an institution such as the IMF; it cannot be
achieved through ad hoc consultation among Group of Seven finance ministers
 -an unrepresentative group that lacks even a permanent secretariat.
The quid quo pro for a larger role in global monetary management - the task
for which the IMF was designed - is that the Fund should withdraw from much
of its work in developing countries and the formerly centrally planned
economies. It should 'avoid duplicating functions' of the Bank, which ought
to have the principal responsibility for promoting long-term economic
development.
In a staff review attached to the main report, the commission argues that a
clear division of labour between the IMF and Bank will be achieved only if
the IMF stops pursuing independent programmes in the poorest developing
countries and instead confines itself to providing macroeconomic input to
programmes run by the Bank. This would entail a big change in present policy
as the IMF has recently expanded its concessional lending programmes for the
poorest countries.
Where an overlap in functions is unavoidable, the commission urges more
effective co-operation between the two institutions, including sharing of
'data, training and research'. At present both have large research
departments.
The commission says criticism of the IMF for imposing 'harsh or
inappropriate' conditions on loans is generally invalid. However, the IMF
should 'explain itself better and be less secretive about its operations'.
It needs to seek broader public support for economic reforms by conducting
negotiations more openly and by publishing more of its analysis.
The commission also notes a disturbing decline in the quality of executive
directors to the IMF and Bank in recent years and argues that both
institutions need to create formal mechanisms whereby they can receive
advice from outsiders. One option would be to set up external advisory
committees of senior individuals from the private sector.
The commission considered arguments for the abolition of the Bank but
concluded it has an important role to play in promoting development, despite
the greatly increased availability of private-sector equity and bond
finance. However, it argues that sweeping changes are needed in both the
Bank's goals and internal organisation.
The report says the Bank still focuses too heavily on promoting
public-sector development projects. It should, but does not, operate on the
maxim that 'development assistance should be directed only at what the
private sector cannot or will not do'.
The Bank does too little to speed the transformation from state to market
and still supports 'too many state-owned enterprises'. It has failed to
adapt to 'a world that has turned from public sector dominance towards
private enterprise and free markets'.
The commission indicates that the Bank's Articles, which do not allow it to
lend to the private sector except with a government guarantee, are no longer
appropriate. But rather than change the Articles, it says, the Bank should
expand affiliates such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga) that are not so constrained.
It should also 'revitalise its co-financing programmes' with private
lenders.
The report stresses that the IFC's ability to promote private sector
development is seriously hampered by its limited capital. The Bank should
assign the IFC 'additional resources of people and finance'. The IFC could
then help stimulate larger volumes of private financing, for example for
infrastructure projects, allowing a shrinkage of the Bank proper.
The commission says the Bank should work harder to 'concentrate its
assistance in those countries where the need is greatest'. In the staff
review attached to the main report it says the Bank should apply a 'market
access', as well as an income, test when considering offering support.
Countries that are able to borrow at reasonable rates from international
capital markets should cease to qualify for Bank loans, even if they are
poor.
However, the Bank's main shareholders should continue to fund the
International Development Agency (IDA), the Bank affiliate that makes soft
loans to the poorest countries. But the Bank should lower the threshold
income level at which soft loans are available and impose stiffer
'graduation requirements' - in other words stop giving IDA loans to
countries that do not need concessional assistance.
The report says the Bank could play a valuable role in co-ordinating and
directing the development assistance presently offered on an ad hoc basis by
numerous other agencies and governments. It should also co-operate more
closely with the regional development banks and try not to duplicate their
work.
The commission is critical of the Bank's internal organisation and says
steps to improve its efficiency and effectiveness should be an urgent
priority.
'There is scope for the Bank to shed staff significantly as it becomes more
efficient and for both the Bank and the regional banks to consolidate as
they rationalise their responsibilities.'
In the staff review, the commission notes that 'as little as 7 per cent of
the time of a task manager - a front- line officer responsible for relations
with clients - is spent in actual contact with the country on which he or
she works.' This suggests there is 'extraordinary scope' for the Bank 'to
reduce the time staff spend talking and writing to one another'.

Brazil's car production last month was 6.8 per cent higher than a year
earlier, but 8.2 per cent down on May. The fall was due to time lost

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican and Syrian referees who came under heavy criticism for their
handling of Tuesday's second-round matches were yesterday left off the list
of officials who will handle the rest of the tournament.
Fifa left out Mexican Arturo Pablo Brizio, who sent off Italy's Gianfranco
Zola for an innocuous tackle in the match with Nigeria, and Jamal al-Sharif
of Syria, who showed red cards to a Bulgarian and a Mexican in the day's
other game.
Zola was given an automatic two-match suspension and fined 5,000 Swiss
francs. Fifa dismissed a protest from Bulgaria against the expulsion of
defender Emil Kremenliev and banned him for the quarter-final against
Germany on Sunday.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilian star Leonardo banned for four games
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian mid-fielder Leonardo was yesterday suspended for four matches
after being sent off for elbowing the USA's Tab Ramos during Monday's World
Cup second-round clash in San Francisco, which Brazil won 1-0.
Leonardo will miss the rest of the tournament and was fined 10,000 Swiss
francs (about Pounds 5,000) for the touch line offence, which left Ramos
with a fractured skull.
The four-match suspension is the heaviest handed out by Fifa at the finals.
Fifa general secretary Sepp Blatter described the incident as the most
aggressive foul of the tournament. 'It was a revenge foul,' he said.
The Brazilian football confederation has three days to appeal, but can
protest against only half the ban, because Fifa's disciplinary committee can
impose a two-match suspension without the right of appeal.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Paraguay seeks Dollars 4bn for dam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paraguayan government is seeking private participation in the country's
third giant hydro-electric project, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said
yesterday.
The 4,000MW Corpus Cristi dam would lie between two huge existing
hydro-electric dams, Yacyreta and Itaipu. According to initial engineering
projections, the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Corpus dam would be more
efficient than either and yield an internal rate of return on investment of
27 per cent.
If built, it would be by far the largest electrical project in the world
financed by the private sector. Mr Wasmosy has agreed with President Carlos
Menem of Argentina to privatise the Yacyreta dam, on the
Argentine-Paraguayan frontier.
Speaking in London, Mr Wasmosy said the government also intended to move
ahead with its privatisation plans. It wants, through joint ventures or
privatisation, to divest itself of five enterprises: the steel and cement
plants, the merchant fleet, an alcohol and spirits plant, the railway system
and the national airline.
According to ministers travelling with the president, bidding for the
money-losing airline, which has ceased operations, will open on July 8.
A draft law now before Congress would give workers and suppliers 10 per cent
each of the privatised companies at concessional terms. Telephone, water,
electricity utilities and some other companies would remain in government
hands.
Mr Wasmosy said a summit of heads of state of Mercosur, the trade group
which includes Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, will take place on August 5 to
finalise details of a common external tariff. He was confident this would
take effect at the beginning of next year.
Yesterday he met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, signing accords on investment protection and on
co-operation against drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
Organisers of the biggest demonstration held against Argentine President
Carlos Menem's free-market policies yesterday called for a general strike on
August 2 as they rallied in the capital, Buenos Aires.
About 60,000 civil servants, students, farmers and political activists
gathered in the Plaza de Mayo facing the presidential palace for the climax
of the so-called Federal March - a three-day protest bringing busloads of
workers from throughout the country.
Organisers had hoped that the rally, which went off peacefully, would
attract 100,000 protesters.
The protest was called by public sector unions and it attracted both the
hard left and the ultra-nationalist right. It was intended as an attack on
the belt-tightening policies which derailed several provincial
administrations earlier this year, sparking off riots.
President Menem, whose sights are set on re-election next year, criticised
the protest as 'senseless' and said it was 'a direct blow to the country,
not the government'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / US opens up energy contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US energy department yesterday unveiled plans to put out to competition
a cluster of contracts worth up to Dollars 27bn at its nuclear and other
sites in a radical change from its previous business practice.
It is also seeking to renegotiate a further Dollars 13.5bn of existing
contracts to secure better value for money.
The department is the federal government's biggest civilian user of
contractors, employing companies or universities to run its national
laboratories, undertake research and - until the cold war ended - design and
produce nuclear weapons. Now it is more concerned with cleaning up the
environment at its nuclear bomb-making plants.
However, under practices that go back to the Manhattan Project, which built
the first US atomic weapon, site contracts were rarely competed for. In the
few cases where competition occurred, the existing contractor was usually
selected.
In the past, management and operating contracts were awarded at nuclear
sites covering every aspect of their running. Now, smaller management
contracts will be awarded at some sites, with as many tasks as possible
monitored for performance, and use made of subcontractors.
Much work was previously awarded on a cost-reimbursement basis, whereby the
contractor presented the government with a bill on completion. In future,
the department will seek to award more work on a fixed price basis. 'In some
cases cost-reimbursement is just like handing a contractor a blank cheque,'
a department official said.
In the first test of the new policy, the department will issue a proposal
for a new-style management contract at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
complex in Colorado later this month. The plant is currently managed by
EG&amp;G, a Massachusetts-based scientific and technical services company, under
a Dollars 6.4bn five-year contract.
Other areas where competition is planned, as management contracts totalling
Dollars 27bn expire over the next 2-3 years, include the Nevada nuclear test
site and the Idaho national engineering laboratory.
'Most of our contractors are fully supportive of our reform goals,' Mrs
Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary, said. However, she warned that where
renegotiation of contracts did not produce satisfactory results, the
department would not hesitate to put orders out to competition. In
environmental clean-ups the spectre of competition has produced offers from
contractors to cut costs by 15-20 per cent, officials said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Menem condemns 'senseless' union protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of demonstrators yesterday converged on Buenos Aires, the
Argentine capital, for a rally against the government's economic policies as
President Carlos Menem criticised the nationwide protest by public sector
unions as 'senseless'.
The president said that the so-called Federal March, the largest protest
against his free-market reforms since he took office in mid-1989, was 'a
direct blow to the country, not the government'.
'It's a senseless and aimless march,' Mr Menem said. 'They will achieve
absolutely nothing.'
The streets of Buenos Aires were nearly empty early yesterday as police
cordoned off access routes to guarantee security during the rally, which
drew thousands of disgruntled civil servants, students and a handful of
farmers.
The march, backed by trade unions and political parties ranging from the
hard left to the ultra-nationalist right, set off from Argentina's northern
and southern tips on Monday. By noon yesterday, some 16,000 protesters had
reached the capital and the count was expected to hit 40,000 as four huge
convoys of buses wound their way into the city.
Worried about the possibility of riots, similar to the outbreaks that rocked
several provinces earlier this year, the government sent 20,000 policemen
into the streets of the city.
Mr Menem, whose sights are set on re-election next year, dismissed the
possibility of popular endorsement of the march, arguing that his
fellow-citizens would not spurn a programme which had brought inflation down
to its lowest levels in four decades.
'Argentines are not going to shoot themselves in the foot,' he said.
He also appealed for support from employers, urging them to punish workers
by docking pay for days spent absent at protests.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like shot starlings, Italy's dailies changed tune after Italy's classy
extra-time defeat of Nigeria on Tuesday, which put them into the
quarter-finals against Spain. For more than a fortnight the Italian press
has rubbished the team, the coach and especially star Roberto Baggio. But
Baggio scored with two minutes to go against Nigeria, then banged in an
extra-time penalty.
La Gazzetta dello Sport's banner headline said: 'Italia: Baggiooooo]' while
Il Manifesto managed: 'Forza Buddha' (Let's Go Buddha) referring to Baggio's
religion.
Celebrations were marred in Naples where Salvatore Oliva, 7, was
accidentally killed when his 15-year-old cousin fired his father's pistol to
celebrate, news reports said. The cousin was charged with manslaughter.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilian star faces Fifa ruling on
suspension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Leonardo, the Brazilian defender who faces suspension for
cracking the skull of the USA's Tab Ramos in the World Cup's second round,
was being decided yesterday by Fifa.
Soccer's governing body is trying to combat thuggery and has already
suspended one player for three games after a foul that did less damage than
Leonardo's blow.
The Brazilian will certainly miss Saturday's quarter-final against Holland,
and may be banned for the rest of the tournament.
In the US-Brazil game, Ramos and Leonardo tangled for the ball near
mid-field. Ramos was spun round and struck on the left side of the face; he
lost consciousness for several moments and was taken to hospital for
observation.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Caracas fixes single rate against dollar: Bolivar pegged in
new foreign exchange controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government announced a single exchange rate of 170 bolivars
to the US dollar late on Tuesday, following more than a week of
deliberations on new foreign exchange controls.
On June 23, the last day of trading, the bolivar stood at about 200:Dollars
1, down from 106 at the end of 1993.
The imposition of exchange controls came after months of heavy pressure on
Venezuela's international reserves, caused by a crisis in the banking
system, much rumour and a marked deterioration in the economy.
Announcing the controls, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said he hoped they
would be temporary. They would be accompanied by a series of macroeconomic
measures aimed to balance the 1994 and 1995 budgets, he said, giving no
details.
The government had rejected the idea of a parallel free market in foreign
exchange, he said, because it feared 'destabilising agents' would create an
unacceptable gap between the official rate and the parallel rate. Any
foreign exchange trading outside the official system would be illegal and
subject to penalties, he warned.
The controls will cover imports, expenses of Venezuelan students abroad,
external debt payments for the public and the private sector, spending by
travellers, and 'small remittances' by foreigners in Venezuela to relatives
abroad.
Officials stressed that the government would meet all international
commitments and provide foreign exchange to international investors, to
allow for profit remittances. Mr Sosa also argued that the new exchange rate
would help international investors, by removing the penalty of the
'speculative' exchange rates seen in recent months.
He said the system of assigning foreign exchange would be 'highly automated
and transparent', and would be set up with the help of PDVSA, Venezuela's
national oil company.
However, foreign exchange trading at the new rate was not to resume
yesterday, as planned, due to 'technical questions' at the central bank.
Commercial banks said yesterday that they expected trading to resume on
Monday.
The new programme is Venezuela's fourth foreign exchange system since
President Rafael Caldera took office in February. The first was a
crawling-peg system used by the central bank until its president, Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy, resigned at the end of April over disagreements with the Caldera
administration. This was followed briefly by a limited auction system at the
central bank, then by a modified version of a Dutch auction, in effect until
June 23.
Mr Sosa stressed that the government has enough monetary reserves to meet
Venezuela's import and foreign debt obligations, but not enough to finance
capital flight. Officials estimate 'normal' foreign exchange sales to be
about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m) each business day. PDVSA supplies the
central bank with about Dollars 40m a day from oil exports.
The central bank has not issued figures on monetary reserves since April,
when the bolivar began to slip, but a Caracas daily, citing figures from the
government planning office, reported that gross international reserves at
the end of May stood at Dollars 9.9bn, down 21 per cent from Dollars 12.6bn
at the end of 1993.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Where dribbling is child's play - Peter
Berlin in New York on the next generation of soccer fans and the star
players they idolise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soccer in the US is the world's largest child-minding service. The US Soccer
Federation claims 16m registered players - more than any other Fifa member -
of whom most are children.
At World Cup games, middle-aged middle Americans are a common sight. Almost
always they are being led through colourful crowds by an excited child
wearing a T-shirt commemorating his or her participation in some age-group
soccer tournament.
Fifa and the World Cup organisers have played the child card ruthlessly. The
ceremonies at each stadium consist largely of poorly-drilled hordes of
children, clad in youth-league kit, parading round the ground holding flags
and balloons.
Before each game, half-a-dozen children carry the yellow 'Fair Play Please'
banner on to the field to the tune of the Fifa anthem. There is calculated
naivety in this, as anyone who can recall their childhood soccer - or who
has watched children playing unsupervised - will know.
Park or playground 'rules' are highly negotiable. Touchlines and goal-lines
are elastic. Goalkeepers change without warning. Games often end in heated,
perhaps violent debate over some foul.
Yet one thing children rarely do is kick each other. And suddenly the
professionals are kicking each other much less often, too - not in the
interests of fair play but because referees have been punishing them.
The World Cup record for yellow cards, 163, set in Italy four years ago, was
broken last Saturday, the mid-way point. By Tuesday the total was 198 after
44 matches. Sendings-off are rising - five in the last three second-round
games - leaving matches with the unbalanced look of park games, where sides
always seem to be picked from an odd number of players.
There is another influence at work. The heat has sapped the professionals'
stamina. Last Saturday's game between Saudi Arabia and Sweden, in blazing
afternoon Dallas, resembled a three-hour game between 11-year-olds in a hot
summer park.
The impression that this was a children's game was heightened by the way the
Saudis play. The Swedes are typical products of western European
professional soccer - scouted by clubs in their teens or earlier; coached
from an early age; accustomed from youth to playing in organised leagues.
They have been taught to forget what every child knows about soccer. With
the exception of Tomas Brolin and, once, Kennet Andersson, the Swedes knew
better than to dribble the ball past opponents. They know that if they
dribble they will be kicked, or might lose the ball - the cardinal sin - and
have no-one to blame. How much easier not to take chances.
But the Saudis took risks. Time and again Saeed Owairan tried to unpick the
Swedish defence, as he had Belgium's, with mazy dribbling. Hamzah Falatah
tormented the full-backs with feints and dummies. Finally, Fahad
Al-Ghashiyan scored the goal his team deserved with a move straight from the
park.
Where most European pros, wide by the goal-line and confronted by a
defender, have turned and rolled the ball back down the wing to a supporting
player, Fahad Al-Ghashiyan did what any child unworried by failure,
unwilling to surrender the precious ball, eager to show off, would have
tried. He ran at his man, beat him and banged home a goal.
This childlike quality, not to be confused with innocence or
under-development, has not been totally expunged from European soccer. Jason
McAteer, at 24 one of the babes of the Irish squad, started the season
unsure of a regular place at Bolton Wanderers, a lowly English first
division team. He ended it by playing in the World Cup, chasing Franco
Baresi round Giants Stadium. McAteer was a breath of fresh air, trying to
dribble at Paolo Maldini or flick the ball over Frank Rijkaard's head.
The Saudis do not just dribble. They also take evident pleasure in the feel
of the ball. Each pass was delivered with an unnecessary but attractive
flourish; each pass received with a little juggle of joy.
One of the delights of this tournament has been the reminder that the range
of soccer possibilities is a wide one. The Asian and African teams, Brazil,
Mexico and Colombia, have all solved the simple problems of soccer in
distinct ways.
They kick and trap the ball differently. Their formations are different. In
familiar situations they produce unfamiliar passes, or dribble when they
should not. But dribbling takes courage, flamboyance and close-ball skills.
Children in playgrounds and parks all over Europe will try to emulate them,
just as they always try to emulate players who bring the most childlike
qualities into play. This is why Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's child-faced
dribbler, is the hottest commercial property in English soccer.
It is why the most interesting players in this World Cup are those who
remain recognisably children playing a children's game, such as baby-faced
Gary Kelly, the Irish full-back, who insisted on dribbling out of defence,
risking all for a chance to display his pace and skill. There is Marc
Overmars, the tiny Dutch winger, one of several examples of the success of
the Dutch system in nurturing a youngster's love of the dribble.
There is pudgy Tomas Brolin of Sweden and Sergi, the dribbling Spaniard.
Nigeria fielded an entire team composed of players barely out of their
teens.
There is Romario of Brazil, refusing to pass to team-mates in better
positions, abandoning his position to drop back to mid-field because he
wants more of the ball, refusing to acknowledge team-mates who create
scoring chances for him, yet somehow much more interesting than the equally
talented, nicer, more mature Bebeto.
There was always a Gheorghe Hagi in the parks of my childhood. Hagi is the
best boy on the field, and knows it. He often expects the other Romanians to
do the things he does not like: running, defending, tackling. His effort in
the second half against Switzerland was that of a sulking child. For all his
talent he is simply too unappealing to inspire imitators.
And then there is the greatest child-genius of all: Diego Maradona, who
carried the hopes of Argentina from his early teens, a player deprived of a
childhood, except that his whole life has been a childhood. After his
drugs-bust he blamed other people - adults - for his downfall.
Children, as adults often forget, can be clear-eyed and forgiving in judging
fallen heroes. If you go down to the park today, among the children
imitating Saeed Owairan's dribbles, Martin Dahlin's flying headers,
Romario's shooting and the Cameroonian goal wiggle, there will be others
trying to emulate Maradona's goal against Greece and his screaming,
eye-bulging, celebratory run at the camera afterwards.
Maradona. A child playing a child's game without a child-minder. It
shouldn't have been allowed.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Competition brings hard times for Portugal's farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Competition within the European single market is cruelly exposing the
backwardness of Portuguese agriculture. Red Cross workers began delivering
food parcels this week to the destitute families of unemployed farm workers
in the Alentejo, the southern grain, wine and olive-growing region.
Angry fishermen in the northern port of Matosinhos yesterday attacked two
Spanish lorries, tipping into the street the fish that Spanish companies
manage to truck into Portugal faster and cheaper than local fishermen can
land their catches.
The Trade Ministry yesterday announced an inquiry into commercial practices
in the dairy sector after bitter complaints by Portuguese co-operatives that
an Italian company was using unreasonably aggressive tactics to win a share
of the Portuguese milk market.
Farming and fishing have been central to the Portuguese economy for
centuries and strong emotions are being aroused by an increasingly visible
withering of the sector. The numbers of agricultural workers has fallen from
20 per cent of the total workforce in 1986, when Portugal joined the
European Union, to 10 per cent today.
In particular, the plight of farm workers in the Alentejo, once the
heartland of Portuguese agriculture, is aggravating tensions between the
centre-right government and its critics. Meagre state subsidies are not
enough to support the families of unemployed labourers in a region where the
jobless rate is almost double the Portuguese average and the suicide rate is
the highest in Europe.
Mr Antonio Campos, agriculture spokesman for the opposition Socialist party,
says agricultural earnings in Portugal have fallen 45 per cent over the past
three years and the value of farmland has been halved in two years. The
country produces only a quarter of what it eats, compared with 50 per cent
in 1986, he says.
This, he claims, is a result more of inadequate government policies, than of
competition in the single market. He says the earnings of Spanish farmers
have increased 22 per cent since 1991 and Spain has not only conquered the
horticultural market in Portugal but also won 30 and 15 per cent of French
and German markets respectively.
Mr Campos and other critics say the Es1,000bn (Pounds 3.95bn) in EU funds
Portugal has invested in agriculture since 1986 have been spent unwisely and
are equivalent to less than half the loss in earnings farmers have suffered
over the same period. An independent study shows that the bank debts of
Portuguese farmers last year totalled Es380bn, almost equal to the Es400bn
earned by the sector, and that a third of debts are likely to be
irrecoverable.
But Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, yesterday hit back at critics
of his agricultural policies and denounced those clamouring to protect the
sector from European competition. In a state-of-the nation address to
parliament, he said that although the agricultural workforce had been halved
over the past eight years, the value of agricultural production was the
same.
'It is pure illusion to think that the way forward for our agriculture lies
in closing our frontiers or keeping a large workforce on the land,' he said.
'We have to be realistic and face the facts.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / A poll about the state they're in: Ukraine's president has
turned voters' minds to nationality and away from the devastated economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The square outside Kiev's central cathedral is dominated by a statue which
captures the ambivalence at the heart of Ukraine. The towering figure of
Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the leader of a cossack rebellion against the Poles in
the 17th century, astride a leaping stallion would appear to be a potent
national symbol. But after overthrowing the Poles, Khmelnytsky made an
alliance with Moscow which began more than three centuries of Russian
domination.
When they go to the polls this Sunday in the second round to elect a new
president, Ukrainians will still be contemplating Khmelnytsky's mixed legacy
of a fleeting independence and an enduring dependence on Russia.
President Leonid Kravchuk, whose disastrous economic record led many
observers to predict inevitable electoral defeat, is trying to orchestrate a
political resurrection. His method, which most western and Ukrainian
observers predict will bring him a slim victory in the poll on Sunday, has
been to shift the campaign from economic issues to the question of Ukraine's
continued existence as a separate state.
'This is a second referendum on independence,' says Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, a
leading figure in the national democratic opposition, turned ardent Kravchuk
supporter. 'That is why it is so crucial for Kravchuk to win.'
To position himself as the only leader who can guarantee Ukraine's continued
existence, Mr Kravchuk has launched a campaign to portray his opponent,
former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, as Russia's candidate. Despite Mr
Kuchma's best efforts - he has begun to speak a slightly hesitant Ukrainian
and insist on his patriotism - the efficacy of Mr Kravchuk's strategy has
been evident on the campaign trail and in the first round of voting, held
nearly two weeks ago.
Even in central Ukraine, never a hot-bed of national sentiment, Mr Kuchma
has been faced with voters who ask: 'Would you prefer to be the governor of
Little Russia (the tsarist term for Ukraine) or president of an independent
state?'
In the first round Mr Kravchuk drew 38 per cent of the vote, mostly in
central and fiercely nationalist western Ukraine. Mr Kuchma won 31 per cent,
largely in the more Russified eastern and southern regions, where many
people would prefer closer links with Russia.
The real reformers on the Ukrainian political scene are furiously, but
impotently, resentful of Mr Kravchuk's apparently successful attempt to
elude responsibility for the country's economic devastation by playing the
national card.
'Ukrainians can't eat their national flag and Ukraine can't survive on
national symbols alone,' says Mr Serhii Holovatyi, an MP of the free-market
'Reform' faction in parliament. 'I think that Kravchuk will win and his
victory will mean that the idea of statehood has not died entirely, but that
doesn't mean that the idea of statehood doesn't hang by a mere thread.'
Part of the problem is that, although Mr Kuchma's image as a Russian pawn
owes less to his real convictions than to Mr Kravchuk's political skill, he
has failed to live up to his supporters' hopes that he would offer a clear
economic alternative to the administration.
Mr Kuchma has promised to alter Ukraine's punitive taxation policies, its
fixed exchange-rate system which discourages exports and to speed up
privatisation. So has Mr Kravchuk.
To further muddy the waters the Communist party was this week widely
reported to be backing Mr Kuchma. Western diplomats at first felt that this
might swing the election in Mr Kuchma's favour, but some Ukrainian insiders
have suggested that the Kravchuk-controlled Ukrainian media are
intentionally exaggerating the strength of communist support for Mr Kuchma,
in an effort to undermine his reformist credentials.
Nowhere is Mr Kuchma's failure to position himself as the candidate of
economic reforms more evident than in his natural constituency in eastern
Ukraine. While his populist promises of swift prosperity through closer
economic relations with Russia are likely again to win him a majority of the
vote in the east, the business community in Mr Kuchma's own bailiwick is
reluctantly turning to the incumbent.
'I support Mr Kravchuk,' said Mr Alexander Bulianda, of general manager of
Azovstal, Ukraine's largest steel-mill and one of the few state enterprises
in the country which is beginning to reform. 'Mr Kuchma is from the old,
privileged military-industrial complex and he sees the old system through
rose-coloured glasses. At least if Mr Kravchuk is re-elected we can hope
that he will allow the cabinet of ministers to run the economy and concern
himself with politics.'
A growing number of Ukrainians are putting their faith instead in Mr Vitalii
Masol, the new prime minister. His past as a Communist party functionary
would appear to disqualify him from acting as an agent of market reforms,
but progressive cabinet ministers and industrialists throughout the country
have begun to say that Mr Masol, like his Russian counterpart, Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, has undergone a political conversion to the market.
There was some evidence of this yesterday when Ukraine's minister of
finance, Mr Hryhori Pyatachenko, who was widely seen as inept, was replaced
by Mr Petro Hermanchuk, who speaks for the sorts of reform the International
Monetary Fund would like to see.
If Mr Masol does begin market reforms, he will have to contend with the
hard-line left who make up the largest bloc in parliament, led by the
socialist speaker, Mr Oleksandr Moroz. But outside the central government, a
constituency for reform is slowly growing.
Reform-minded politicians have done well in municipal and local elections.
Reformist mayors stand a good chance of winning on Sunday in Kiev and Odessa
and reformers have done well on a local level even in eastern Ukraine, where
the communists made their strongest showing in parliamentary elections in
April.
When Ukrainians elected their first president in 1991 they went to the polls
with the festive spirit of a nation ridding itself of centuries of Russian
domination and decades of communist rule. Their government's lacklustre
performance over the past three years has made them more cynical. No matter
who they elect on Sunday, few Ukrainians have much hope that their next
president will be the source of real, desperately needed, change.

FT  07 JUL 94 / EU court ruling upsets Cyprus peace hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A European Court of Justice ruling which in effect bans imports from
Turkish-controlled Cyprus has increased the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot
community and injected a new, unpredictable element into UN-backed peace
efforts on the divided island.
The court order - that local export licences issued by the Turkish Cypriot
authorities were not valid on the grounds that the EU recognised only the
Greek Cypriot government - was condemned yesterday by Mr Rauf Denktash,
Turkish Cypriot leader,
'This kind of decision obtained by the Greek Cypriots from international
forums will only push the two communities to absolute and permanent
separation,' said Mr Denktash.
But a senior Greek Cypriot official in Brussels described last Tuesday's
ruling as far-reaching since it weakened the Turkish Cypriot community's
claim to be treated as a separate legal entity. 'It is the most important
development on the Cyprus issue in the past 20 years.'
The ban on potatoes and citrus products is a blow for the 160,000 Turkish
Cypriots who formed a breakaway state after Turkish forces invaded the
island in 1974. Growers depend heavily on the export market, though in
practice they may simply reroute their products through Turkey.
Diplomats were trying to assess the impact of the ruling on UN efforts to
broker an agreement on confidence-building measures between the Greek and
Turkish communities, including the re-opening of the Turkish-held resort of
Verosha and Nicosia international airport under UN control.
According to Greek Cypriot officials, Mr Denktash was told last month that
re-opening Nicosia airport would have allowed Turkish Cypriot exporters to
obtain licences from the Greek authorities. 'But Denktash was too greedy, he
turned the offer down,' said one official.
In the short term, the ban could lead Mr Denktash to stiffen resistance to a
settlement, or to ask Turkey for more economic and political support, EU
diplomats said.
But Greek Cypriots said the rejection of the Turkish Cypriot community's
legal status could increase pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise.
They pointed to the European Commission's recent move to review Cyprus's
application for EU membership in early 1995 in the context of progress in
resolving the dispute between the Greek and Turkish communities. This
formulation was widely seen as a pressure tactic against the Turkish
Cypriots.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Brussels clears first of three airline aid cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A big injection of government capital into TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned
carrier, will not contravene European rules on state aid provided the
airline restructures itself, the European Commission ruled yesterday. The
decision has cleared the way for the beleaguered Portuguese airline to
benefit from up to Es180bn (Pounds 711m) in borrowing guarantees and tax
exemption which will finance a 'genuine' restructuring of the company.
Yesterday's news comes as a foretaste of the much more controversial
decision on state aid to Air France to be taken at the end of this month.
The French case will be more closely examined by competitors who argue that
government assistance to the French carrier discriminates against them.
Many in the Commission believe that the end of July deadline for the
decision on Air France is too ambitious. Brussels will be exceptionally
cautious in what it demands of the French for fear that competitors, such as
British Airways, will take the case to the European Court once a decision
has been made.
The decision on TAP also raises the prospect that the Commission will find
in favour of Greek government aid to Olympic Airlines, in another impending
state-aid case. The Greek aid package amounts to Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.54bn), to
be split into two parts, with Ecu1.1bn absorbing Olympic's previous debts
and Ecu9m earmarked for future capital projects.
The conditions attached to the decision on TAP stipulate that the tax
exemption in favour of the airline be abolished by the end of the
restructuring period; TAP will also not be allowed to increase its European
market share; and the Portuguese government will have to submit an annual
report on the restructuring to Brussels four weeks before the date of the
aid payments.
Furthermore, TAP will not be allowed to acquire additional shareholdings in
other carriers and no more aid can now be granted. This last condition is
understood to have been insisted on by commissioners Sir Leon Brittan and Mr
Karel Van Miert.
Portugal told the Commission earlier this year of its plans to increase
TAP's capital. It said it intended to take over part of the company's debts
and guarantee loans made to the airline, as part of an overall package to
reduce its workforce and cut most of its transatlantic routes.
The Commission added yesterday that aid used to plug the deficits run up by
TAP in flying to the islands of the Azores and Madeira were compatible with
European rules. The remoteness of the islands meant the government had to
find some way of meeting its public service obligations.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Mannesmann chief forgoes new post
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, yesterday
acknowledged growing suggestions of impropriety by Mr Werner Dieter, the
outgoing chief executive, and decided not to elect him chairman of the
company's supervisory board.
The company said Mr Dieter, who will step down as chief executive at the
annual meeting tomorrow, will become an ordinary member of the supervisory
board and not chairman as originally planned.
The decision comes days after the Dusseldorf state prosecutor began
investigating alleged fraud by Mr Dieter, who is said to have forced
Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy hydraulic accessories at inflated
prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by Mr Dieter's family.
The engineering conglomerate has already ordered an internal enquiry but
this found no evidence against Mr Dieter, 64, who has been chief executive
since 1985.
'The examination of the Mannesmann audit reports to date has not
substantiated any of the charges against Mr Dieter,' the company said. 'For
the sake of a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter the
supervisory board has decided to commission an external audit by the C&amp;L
Treuarbeit AG.'
The company said Mr Dieter would not seek to become chairman of the
Mannesmann supervisory board, a non-executive board which oversees the
company's management, until the external audit had been completed. Mr
Friedrich Christians, a former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, will stay
on as chairman.
The board also recommended that approval of Mr Dieter's activities as chief
executive - in effect a vote of confidence by shareholders - be postponed
until next year's annual meeting, the earliest date at which he could take
over as chairman.
Mr Dieter recently told the Financial Times the relationship between Rexroth
and Hydac had existed for 31 years and had been openly discussed when he
took over as chief executive in 1985.
He said the companies were 'entirely competitive' and internal company
documents had been leaked in an attempt to wreck his chances of becoming
supervisory board chairman.
Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, first published the allegations against
Mr Dieter a month ago when the company's shares stood at DM446 (Pounds 180).
The shares fell to DM397 last week on news of the state prosecutor's
investigation but picked up DM2 yesterday to DM414.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Minister criticises Alitalia managers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wildcat strikes by Alitalia cabin staff seriously disrupted flights for a
second consecutive day yesterday. Staff are opposing radical restructuring
plans for the loss-making national airline.
Further disruptions are likely through the weekend and a strike by all the
airline's staff is scheduled for July 11. However, an air traffic
controllers' strike planned for today and tomorrow has been postponed for
two weeks.
Mr Publio Fiori, transport minister, unexpectedly announced an inquiry into
the failure of the management to foresee the strike action and avoid
inconvenience to the public.
His criticism of management for ignoring the union behind the strikes risks
undermining the tough proposals in the restructuring plan.
The union yesterday claimed 75 per cent of the domestic and international
flights were cancelled. Alitalia said the figure was 323 flights out of 606.
The union was formed last year by cabin staff who felt the regular unions
did not represent their interests. As it has no more than 300 members out of
the 18,000 Alitalia staff the management excluded it from restructuring
discussion last month. However, the strike has been backed by other unions,
making the impact far greater.
The Alitalia management is discussing with the unions a plan to cut 4,000
jobs and completely rewrite existing work contracts (the pay packets of
cabin crew are calculated on 504 different elements). This is seen as the
first big test of the Berlusconi government's desire to cut restrictive
practices, introduce labour flexibility and reduce the padding in
state-owned groups.
But the labour problems at Alitalia contrasted sharply with a breakthrough
in industrial relations over a new wage and work conditions agreement just
concluded between the employers and the 1.5m members of the engineering
workers' unions. The agreement, reached for the first time without any
strikes, is likely to become the benchmark for all other wage deals -
including key public sector pay talks in the autumn.
The agreement is evidence that union leaders and Confindustria, the
industrialists' confederation, are prepared to adopt a more consensual
approach in the light of last July's labour accord ending indexed wages.
Under the engineering unions' agreement, wages to the end of 1996 will rise
only in line with the official inflation index. There was no attempt to
recover the loss in earning power during the past two years of recessions.
But workers will be entitled to year-end productivity/profitability bonuses.
The average working week will be 39 hours.

Mrs Pauline Green, a former British policewoman, was yesterday elected
leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the dominant bloc
in the increasingly powerful assembly. Leadership of the group has been the
most influential position in the parliament, which was re-elected last
month. Under the Maastricht treaty, the Parliament now has powers to veto
laws passed by EU governments in the council of ministers, and can reject
the new European Commission the Twelve are struggling to find a president
for, in succession to Mr Jacques Delors. Mrs Green, who previously led the
UK Labour group (with 62 members now the largest national group), said last
week that the parliament's approval would depend on the new Commission
president's attitude towards Europe's jobs crisis. Yesterday she received
overwhelming backing from Socialist MEPs, who number 199 out of 567. She won
169 votes out of 175 ballots cast.

<TEXT>
The Paris appeal court yesterday jailed Mr Alain Boublil, former chief aide
to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the late Socialist prime minister, after finding him
guilty of insider trading in the 'Pechiney affair'. He was sentenced to two
years, one of them suspended. Last September, Mr Boublil was acquitted by a
lower court which fined seven other men up to FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) and
confiscated FFr30m in illicit profits made from buying shares at Dollars 10
in late 1988 in Triangle, a US company, just before the state-controlled
Pechiney made a bid of Dollars 56 a share. The court heard that Mr Boublil
tipped off the late Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, a friend of President Francois
Mitterrand, about Pechiney's plan to bid for a subsidiary of Triangle, a US
company. The court upheld a two-year suspended sentence and FFr2.5m fine
imposed on another defendant, Mr Max Theret. He admitted Mr Pelat had tipped
him off 'in a vague way' about the bid. The verdict reflects the French
judiciary's tougher attitude to white-collar crime.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission said it had begun proceedings against Eko Stahl, the
loss-making German steelmaker, into the legality of state aid to the
company. The case increases pressure on the German government to find a way
of saving the plant in former east Germany. A rescue plan collapsed two
months ago. It assumed that Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, would buy
the company, modernise it and cut the workforce from 3,000. Riva's
withdrawal means that loans and guarantees paid to Eko Stahl fall foul of
Commission guidelines. The chances of a buyer being found, however, appear
slim at a time of confusion in the industry over how best to make capacity
cuts. The Commission said yesterday that since early May, the Treuhand
privatisation agency had provided loans of at least DM15.6m (Pounds 6.4m) to
Eko Stahl, and had guaranteed DM149m in bank loans. Brussels also announced
yesterday that it would investigate the granting of loans by the
Hamburgische Landesbank to another steel plant, the Neue Hamburger
Stahlwerke, which may again contravene EU guidelines on state aid. It was
also looking closely at a third steelmaker, Saarstahl, which refused
Commission officials access this week to investigate a DM120m loan to
modernise one of its plants.

<TEXT>
Palermo magistrates are pressing for more serious charges to be brought
against Mr Giulio Andreotti, former Italian prime minister, over his alleged
links to the Mafia, in an attempt to retain control over the highly
sensitive investigation into the ageing Christian Democrat politician. The
original charge against Mr Andreotti claimed he had links with the Mafia.
Palermo magistrates are now understood to want to change this to an
allegation that, by providing political proection for Cosa Nostra, the
umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia, he was in effect part of the
criminal organisation.
Mr Andreotti has denied the charge and through his lawyers is fighting to
have the case removed from Palermo to Rome, his home base, where he believes
he will obtain a more sympathetic hearing. However, the more serious crime
is alleged to have taken place in Palermo and thus comes under that city's
jurisdiction. 'The important thing is that I have nothing to do with the
Mafia and on this point no public prosectutor or law court could prove the
contrary,' the 73-year-old Mr Andreotti said yesterday. Former Mafia members
now co-operating with the authorities under witness protection allege that
Mr Andreotti provided political cover for Cosa Nostra and that several of
his key political lieutenants in Sicily were members of the Mafia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   RIGA, LATVIA, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday promised US support for new efforts to
bring about the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania, but warned the citizens of the newly independent Baltic
states that they must show greater tolerance to the ethnic Russian
minorities in their populations.
'Never deny to others the justice and equality you fought so hard for and
earned for yourselves. Freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled,' Mr
Clinton said in a speech to thousands of Latvians gathered in Riga's Freedom
Square.
Mr Clinton, who later flew to Poland, expressed confidence that Russia could
resolve its disagreements with Estonia, the only country with which it has
not agreed a troop withdrawal plan, if both sides showed flexibility. 'I
think the differences are narrow,' he said.
Russian troops have already pulled out of Lithuania and are due to quit
Latvia by August 31. Negotiations with Estonia, however, are bedevilled by
the status of ethnic Russians, including military pensioners.
Although Mr Clinton insisted there was no link between the citizenship
rights of Russians living in Estonia - an issue he discussed with President
Boris Yeltsin by telephone before the Riga meeting - and the withdrawal of
Russian troops, his strong call for tolerance was seen as a gesture to Mr
Yeltsin's concerns.
The status of the Russian minority is fiercely debated in all three Baltic
countries, and is at the centre of heated discussion over a new citizenship
law in Latvia. However, Estonia's President Lennart Meri recalled sharply
that the Russian government itself had set the August 31 deadline.
In an effort to smooth the way, Mr Clinton yesterday chipped in extra US
money to resolve some of the outstanding issues. Besides promising Dollars
10m (Pounds 6.5m) for a three-nation Baltic peacekeeping battalion, he
doubled the money available to help Latvia dismantle an unfinished early
warning radar station at Skrunda.
More than cash, however, Mr Clinton brought a symbolic promise of US
support. 'The chain that binds our nations is unbreakable,' he told a
cheering crowd. 'We will be partners so your nations will be forever free.'
Lionel Barber adds from Brussels: The European Commission said yesterday it
had completed negotiations for a free trade agreement with Estonia, paving
the way for a free trade area for industrial goods with all three Baltic
republics from next year. The deal, subject to council of ministers
approval, involves the EU dismantling tariffs and quotas on goods by January
1. Estonia will remove its barriers by the same date, while Latvia and
Lithuania will benefit from transition periods of four and six years
respectively on sensitive products such as textiles.
The other provisions of the agreements are modelled on pacts concluded with
the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.

Improved liquidity among companies was an important factor behind the rapid
rise in Finland's M1 and M3 money aggregates, a central bank official said
yesterday. This reflected better profitability and a return to profit by
many companies last year. On the other hand, bank deposits in the household
sector had grown much less. M1 rose 11.8 per cent year-on-year in May after
a rise of 11 per cent in April, while M3 rose 10.1 per cent after rising 8.9
per cent in April. State debt rose to FM289.1bn (Pounds 35.3bn) in June, up
FM13.3bn from May.
The cost of living in Poland has grown by 12.5 per cent since the beginning
of the year, more slowly than in the first half last year when prices rose
16 per cent. Average prices in June were up by 32.5 per cent on the same
month in 1993.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Bonn threatens action on petrol pollutant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's environment minister, warned yesterday that his
country would take its own steps to reduce the level of benzene in petrol
unless the European Union could find a solution. Benzene makes up around 2.5
per cent of petrol and has been identified as a cancer-causing compound. It
also creates low-level ozone, better known as summer smog, which causes
coughing, eye irritation and lung damage. Mr Topfer's remarks, only days
after Germany took over the EU presidency, are further evidence of Bonn's
determination to take unilateral action where it feels other Union members
are dragging their feet.
The Bundesrat, the upper chamber of parliament, will decide tomorrow whether
to approve an import ban on British beef, a measure Mr Horst Seehofer,
health minister, has been campaigning for on the grounds that British
imports may be contaminated with BSE or mad cow disease.
Although the European Commission this week approved a draft directive
designed to reduce the number of air pollutants, repeated German attempts to
start a European initiative to reduce benzene levels have come to nothing,
Ms Marlene Muhe of the environment ministry said.
Ms Muhe said reducing benzene to around 1 per cent of petrol would reduce
exhaust pipe emissions of the chemical by up to 40 per cent, a measure
supported by the Netherlands and Denmark. 'If we want to fight the summer
smog we have to do battle with the substances that create it,' she said.
Unlike lead, benzene is not added to petrol but is created during the
refining process. The environment ministry said German refineries had the
technology to reduce levels to create 'cleaner' petrol.
Ms Muhe said that if Germany opted for unilateral action the European
Commission would be informed of the reduced levels but this would not
require engines to be modified. According to Mr Topfer, the refining changes
would add up to two pfennigs to the cost of petrol.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Unemployment down in Germany: First fall in west for almost
three years suggests faster recovery in labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in west Germany fell by 3,000 in June. It
was the first drop since autumn 1991, suggesting a more rapid recovery than
expected in the German labour market.
The actual decline in Germany as a whole was 70,900, to 3.59m, with the
largest fall in the east, where the total dropped by 42,800 to under 1.12m.
The rate in the west was 8 per cent, down from 8.1 per cent; and in the
east, 14.8 per cent, compared with 15.4 per cent in June.
The figures were immediately welcomed by the government as proof that
economic recovery is well under way. Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a
conference of industrialists and trade unionists that he expected the
economy to grow more quickly than the 1.5 per cent officially forecast at
the start of the year.
However, the relatively slow pace of economic recovery overall was confirmed
by weaker industrial order figures in west Germany in May, and a downwards
revision of the figures for April.
What the figures do suggest is that domestic economic activity is beginning
to recover, taking over from export demand.
The provisional figures for industrial orders in May showed a fractional 0.1
per cent decline compared with April, which in turn was down 0.5 per cent
against March, after the adjustment. Year-on-year, the May orders were up
8.1 per cent, nevertheless.
The sharpest decrease month-on-month was in export orders, down 1.5 per
cent, whereas domestic orders improved by 0.5 per cent, the federal
statistics office said.
Foreign orders have now been performing less well than domestic orders for
the past two months, and capital goods, in particular, showed a clear
improvement. On the other hand, the year-on-year figures still show a growth
in export orders of 9.4 per cent, compared with just 2.1 per cent for
domestic ones.
In another clear sign that last year's very sharp recession has finished,
the Ifo economic research institute published its forecast of investment
plans, suggesting a marginal 1 per cent fall this year, compared with 20 per
cent last year.
The 1993 investment collapse was actually the sharpest recorded by the
Munich-based institute since it began its investment survey of German
industry in 1955. The researchers blamed it on the combination of an
inflated investment level coinciding with German unification, and the switch
by western enterprises to investing in the east since then.
At the economic conference in Mr Kohl's office, the chancellor warned
against any over-hasty satisfaction with the evidence of recovery, stressing
in particular the problem of structural unemployment. He urged both
employers and unions to concentrate on all possible means of job creation.
The evidence of a real recovery in unemployment will certainly be welcomed
by the governing coalition as useful ammunition for the general election in
October. On the other hand, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, is rumoured to
be planning further change in unemployment benefit - restricting eligibility
to just two years before jobless workers have to switch to a lower level of
subsistence-related benefit. He refused to confirm or deny the plan
yesterday, but the opposition Social Democrats are seeking to make maximum
political mileage out of any such cuts which may emerge when the government
publishes its draft 1995 budget next week.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Bonn condemns US policies for dollar weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday blamed a lack of
consistency in US government policy as an important factor behind the
dollar's recent weakness, and stressed that his government did not want to
participate in concerted market intervention.
Mr Rexrodt's sharp criticism comes just before the Group of Seven summit in
Naples, and President Bill Clinton's subsequent visit to Bonn. He also
condemned US policy towards Japan, which he said had been inconsistent and
not conducted 'particularly cleverly'.
The dollar fell to a 14-month low against the D-Mark in late European
trading yesterday as markets reacted to Mr Rexrodt's comments and awaited
news from a meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, which
ended without announcing a change in short-term interest rates.
Fed governors and regional presidents had debated whether a further increase
in short-term interest rates was needed to prevent still-robust US economic
growth putting upward pressure on inflation. US policymakers have been
unsettled by the dollar's fragility in recent days, but traditionally put
relatively little weight on currency fluctuations when setting monetary
policy.
Markets had interpreted the Fed's adding of reserves to the banking system
overnight as a signal that it would not raise interest rates immediately.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5685, down from DM1.5826, and dipped
close to its post-war lows around Y97.70 but rallied to finish at Y98.125
from Y98.825.
In New York it recovered further, rising to DM1.5788 and Y98.9. In Tokyo
this morning the dollar opened at Y98.98 against yesterday's close of Y98.3.
In an interview published by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Mr Rexrodt claimed
that the Bundesbank had opposed the last concerted central bank intervention
to defend the dollar. He argued that the dollar rate was influenced above
all by the sharp outflow of long-term capital from the US, and in particular
by the outflow of Japanese capital. The US was dependent on inflows of
capital, because of its low domestic savings ratio, which was 'a deep-seated
structural problem'.
Mr Rexrodt, in criticising the US conduct of trade negotiations with Japan,
said the US had initially aroused the impression that it wanted to compel
the Japanese to accept a rising yen exchange rate, and then had argued
against the sharp drop in the dollar. 'The German view that intervention
cannot succeed against the market trend was once again proved correct.'
In the US, analysts are divided over the domestic merits of raising rates
for a fifth time this year. Some argue that past increases, taking the key
federal funds rate from 3 per cent to 4.25 per cent, are sufficient given
tentative signs that economic growth is moderating.
Other analysts say further action is needed to prevent the economy
overheating.

FT  07 JUL 94 / BBC urged to boost its international broadcasting role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday urged the BBC to expand its commercial role in the
UK and around the world and to transform itself into an international
multi-media organisation.
The encouragement for the BBC to become more of an international
broadcaster, with the help of private partnerships and private capital, came
in a white paper that also endorsed its existing role as the UK's main
public service broadcaster.
The government policy document argues that the BBC:
can continue all its existing broadcasting services including two national
television channels and five national radio services including Radio One;
should have a new 10-year Royal Charter running from January 1 1997; and
should be funded by a universal licence fee at least until the year 2001,
followed by a review in the light of technical developments then. A review
will decide whether the post-1996 licence fee will be linked to the retail
price index - as it is now - or set at RPI minus a percentage figure.
The BBC welcomed the broad thrust of the paper and described it as a vote of
confidence.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday: 'What this
(white paper) is about from our point of view is evolution not revolution: a
two-pronged approach that maintains the BBC's public services with a sharp
focus and developing its commercial activities to compete worldwide.'
To help the BBC develop more commercial activities in the hope of
supplementing the licence fee, the government plans to allow the Independent
Television Commission and the Radio Authority, the regulator of commercial
radio services, to license commercial services owned or partly owned by the
BBC. At present, this is forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The
implication is that the BBC would be able to become involved in satellite
and possibly other commercial broadcasting services in the UK, although Mr
Brooke declined to be specific.
The government, which is insisting on a complete separation of the BBC's
public service and commercial activities, also emphasised that BBC governors
would ensure the aims of BBC Worldwide, the new international division,
remained consistent with the corporation's objectives.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association, said the BBC should not use
programmes funded by licence fees in risk ventures in the UK.
The main uncertainty now facing the BBC is over its transmitter system. The
government and the BBC are to explore options, including full or partial
privatisation, designed to inject private finance into the corporation's
transmission services.
The move could help to finance an early entry by the BBC into digital
terrestrial television, technology that could enable many more television
channels to be created. The BBC is looking at the possibility of launching
the first digital channels as early as 1997 if they can be funded.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Output rise adds to recovery hopes: Modest gain in May -
Healthy growth in manufacturing / New vehicle registrations surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence that the UK industrial recovery is becoming broadly based
without overheating emerged yesterday after official figures showed that
output expanded modestly in May.
Car manufacturers also received a boost after new vehicle registrations
surged in June, suggesting that car sales will rise to 2m this year for the
first time in four years.
The figures provided a favourable background to yesterday's monthly meeting
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of
the Bank of England, which was thought to have decided against a change in
bank base rates from their current level of 5.25 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office said that overall UK industrial output grew
by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May compared with April, and rose
to its highest level for almost four years. This monthly growth was lower
than in April, when output surged by 1.6 per cent compared with March. But
the data was in line with City forecasts, and analysts welcomed it as a sign
that the recovery was proceeding steadily without expanding so fast that it
threatened to fuel inflation.
Measured on a three-monthly basis, overall industrial output rose by 1.3 per
cent in the three months to May, compared with the three months to February.
Although this rise was boosted by a strong performance from the North Sea
oil and gas sector, manufacturing also showed a healthy 1.2 per cent growth,
quarter on quarter. As a result the CSO said yesterday it believed that
manufacturing was growing at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, up from its
earlier trend estimate of 4 per cent.
The Treasury welcomed the figures as 'confirmation of the broad-based
recovery in manufacturing we have been seeing this year'.
The most encouraging aspect of the data, analysts said, was that they showed
that investment goods such as plant and machinery and intermediate products
such as raw materials and components were playing an increasingly important
role in recovery. Although the UK recovery last year was largely consumer
led, last quarter's data showed that the output of investment and
intermediate industries rose faster than in the consumer product industries.
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist with James Capel, the stockbrokers, said: 'The
more demand gets balanced between investment away from consumption, the more
sustainable a recovery we have.'
One concrete example of this manufacturing recovery came from statistics
released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday. They
showed a year-on-year jump of 18.3 per cent in new car registrations in June
and of more than 24 per cent in commercial vehicle registrations.
These figures have taken the UK car and commercial vehicle industry by
surprise. Heavy truck sales have made a strong recovery from the market
collapse of 1990, supporting the manufacturers' view that activity is
picking up across a broad spectrum of the economy.
However, the country's main car dealers' association warned that the
recovery was mostly fuelled by corporate sales and did not yet appear to be
extending to private motorists.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Weinstock to keep job at GEC for another two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC, the British defence and electronics group, yesterday said Lord
Weinstock, its long-serving managing director who will shortly turn 70,
would stay in that job for another two years.
But the company appointed the managing directors of its three central
businesses to the board to help secure the succession to Lord Weinstock, who
has dominated the company for more than three decades.
Lord Weinstock, managing director since 1963, said he expected GEC's
management would become more collegiate and that he had been taking less of
a leading role for some time.
GEC yesterday also announced profits of Pounds 866m for the year to March
31, only Pounds 3m higher than in the previous year and below City
expectations. GEC's shares fell by more than 8 per cent, closing 24p lower
at 270p.
The new directors are Mr Roy Gardner, 48, managing director of GEC-Marconi,
the electronics and defence subsidiary; Mr James Cronin, 56, managing
director of GEC Alsthom, the power engineering joint venture; and Mr Peter
Gershon, 47, managing director of GPT, the telecommunications operation.
Lord Weinstock's eventual successor is likely to be chosen from an inside
group comprising the three new board members, Mr David Newlands, 47, GEC's
finance director, and Mr Simon Weinstock, 42, Lord Weinstock's son, who is
commercial director. Some City observers favour Mr Gershon at this stage
because of his successful handling of GPT.
Lord Weinstock said his role with GEC would be determined by his ability to
continue doing his job. He hinted that when the new management team was up
and running he would give it significant latitude, restricting himself to
pointing up opportunities and warning of the dangers of certain courses of
action.
Announcing the results, he said: 'We ought to have made some more money this
year, but the markets are still very tough. In many areas recession has not
yet gone away.'
GEC now has Pounds 1.35bn in cash within the company, as well as a further
Pounds 1.47bn in joint ventures. It sees opportunities for linking power
station construction contracts in Asia to equity stakes in the operating
companies involved. Add-on acquisitions in electronics and defence are also
being considered.
GEC, however, has not found a large acquisition which would meet its
requirements and has ruled out an aggressive bid for British Aerospace. It
said it had been interested in putting both companies' defence interests
into a joint venture, but that BAe had cooled on the idea.

Hoechst, the German chemicals group, is to set up a pharmaceuticals joint
venture with the North China Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Reuter reports
from Frankfurt.
Hoechst said it would own 50 per cent of the venture which would have total
capital of DM38m (Dollars 23.3m).
NCPC is one of China's largest pharmaceuticals producers. The venture will
involve distribution and sale of medicines.
Hoechst said NCPC would market selected Hoechst products until the joint
venture's projected drug production facilities come on line at the beginning
of 1996.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gomez to be reconfirmed as
Thomson president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday in effect reconfirmed Mr Alain Gomez as
president of Thomson, the electronics group, making him the longest-serving
current head of a French state-owned company.
However, Mr Gomez will have to accept Thomson-CSF's share in the operating
losses and bad-debt provisions of Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled
bank.
Thomson-CSF, the group's defence electronics arm, has a 21 per cent stake in
the bank.
Mr Gomez is due to announce Thomson-CSF's 1993 results today. These have
been delayed because Thomson-CSF has had to take its FFr1.4bn (Dollars
250bn) share of Credit Lyonnais losses and assess what provisions to make to
cover possible losses on the bank's property loans.
The latter have been hived off into a special company, with possible losses
up to FFr12.3bn to be covered by the state, and thereafter by Thomson-CSF up
to FFr1.8bn.
According to some reports yesterday, Thomson-CSF is to provide for its
entire FFr1.8bn liability in its 1993 accounts.
This would increase its loss to FFr2.3bn and Thomson's group loss to FFr3bn.
Mr Gomez's willingness to let Thomson stand guarantee for Credit Lyonnais's
bad debts as well as to help absorb its loss is said to have induced Prime
Minster Edouard Balladur to keep him on.
Mr Gomez has headed Thomson since 1982. To clarify the legal doubt over
whether he could serve any longer, the government is passing a parliamentary
amendment.
Yesterday the government renominated Mr Gomez to the Thomson board, and is
expected shortly to make a Cabinet announcement extending his term as
company president.
However, the industry and defence ministers want Mr Gomez, a socialist
appointee, replaced, and may yet get their way if the group is privatised
next year.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Ex-Pact states in tank talks with Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Krauss-Maffei, makers of the Leopard II battle tank, are in 'growing
discussions' about delivering tank technology to members of the former
Warsaw Pact in central Europe.
Such deals are still forbidden under laws which prevent Germany from
exporting to countries with which it is not allied, but there have been
indications that restrictions on exports to central Europe will be lifted
much sooner than similar bans on exports to sensitive areas in the Middle
East.
'These talks are taking place not only at the defence ministry but also at
company level,' Mr Gerhard Haas, the head of Krauss-Maffei's military
hardware division, said in a recent interview.
Such agreements would include exchange of information about all aspects of
tank manufacture, including electronics and armour, the company said.
The new Leopard II is now the main battle tank in Germany, Switzerland and
the Netherlands, while Sweden is shortly expected to sign a DM1bn (Dollars
628m) contract to buy 120 tanks with the possible purchase of a further 80
in the future.
While about 75 per cent of Germany's arms building programmes are already
undertaken in co-operation with several Nato allies, the closer links with
Sweden are the first such initiative with a non-Nato member.
The German defence ministry, however, said it had no knowledge about deals
to deliver technology. A spokesman said there were several agreements with
Poland, Hungary and other central European states to co-operate on education
and other contacts designed to develop greater confidence between armies
which faced each other, fully armed, for over 40 years.
Military production in the former Warsaw Pact countries has been in steep
decline since the 1989 collapse of communism, further exacerbated by the
loss of markets and lack of funds to restructure or convert outmoded
military hardware factories.
Mr Burkhard Wollschlager, chief executive, said Krauss Maffei was also
working with Mercedes-Benz and the French companies Giat and Panhard on a
medium-sized armoured vehicle due for development in 1996.
Krauss-Maffei, which is 71 per cent owned by the industrial conglomerate
Mannesmann, has not produced any new tanks since April 1993 but is presently
upgrading 225 Leopards for the German army and will begin work on another
180 for the Dutch armed forces.

FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals group Courtaulds benefited from a market reappraisal as one
analyst saw it as a switch opportunity.
Smith New Court has put flesh on the bones of its recent forecast upgrades
with a piece of research pointing out the extent of the global recovery
within the industry. Analyst Mr Charles Lambert said: 'We think the stock
looks temporarily oversold and we would see a 10 per cent upside. It is a
buy on its own merits but BOC looks well up with events, and investors who
do not want to commit further funds to the sector might want to switch.' The
shares ended 12 up at 497p and BOC eased 3 to 702p.
BZW, the investment bank, was largely responsible for the strong
outperformance of the merchant banks against the market, telling its clients
that the sector had been oversold.
Hambros and Kleinwort Benson were the two best individual performers, the
latter closing 8 higher at 442p, after 447p, and the former 5 better at
276p, after 283p. BZW said Hambros was substantially oversold,
underperforming by 13 per cent over one month and 25 per cent over the past
quarter.
The investment bank also pointed out that Hambros traded at a 10 per cent
discount to its 300p a share asset valuation, and offered an attractive
yield of 7.5 per cent and price/ earnings ratio of 9 times. Kleinwort, BZW
said, offered good dividend cover and looked cheap on a price/earnings
basis.
SG Warburg, whose shares have been unsettled by Enterprise Oil's failure in
its attempt to takeover Lasmo - Warburg advised Enterprise - edged up to
699p early in the session but later slipped back to close only a penny ahead
at 694p.
The insurance sectors burst into life, with Commercial Union following
Monday's 11 gain with a rise of 18 to 536p amid strong suggestions that it
is about to withdraw from or reduce the terms of its acquisition of Groupe
Victoire, the French insurance group, from Compagnie de Suez, Victoire's
parent.
Dealers also said that there had been a split order in CU shares yesterday,
which had pushed the stock price sharply higher. Elsewhere in composites,
Sun Alliance held up well, closing only a penny off at 306p, with stories
still circulating that a bid in the sector may not be too far away.
HSBC eased 5 to 689p, with the market beginning to focus on the possibility
that the bank could be lining up a sizeable overseas acquisition. There have
been strong rumours that HSBC has taken a hard look at ANZ Bank. Another
story suggested that HSBC was considering taking a sizeable stake in Nedcor,
the South African bank.
RMC was again the pacemaker in a building sector continuing to respond to
Monday's good news from the Builders Merchants Federation.
The stock was also given a strong push by James Capel, the leading UK agency
broker, which increased its earnings forecast. For the current year Capel is
going for Pounds 235m, up from Pounds 208m, and for 1995 for Pounds 275m,
against Pounds 245m. RMC shares closed 15 higher at 878p.
Builders merchants were featured by Meyer International, up 13 at 417p,
after 419p, with BZW recommending the stock.
CAMAS, the construction materials business demerged from English China Clays
on June 1, rose 5 to 77p, helped by a broker's recommendation.
Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle was buffeted by differing opinions following
Monday's figures. Two UK houses were advising clients to sell and one US
investment bank was advising a switch into Bass, which rose 6 to 520p.
Meanwhile, one of the City's leading securities houses took the opportunity
to pick up 400,000 'special ex' shares for its own pension fund, and the
support for a thinly traded stock saw Scottish rebound from its low of 492p
to close 2 off at 499p.
Unilever added 3 at 971p as one of its subsidiaries announced a disposal and
SGST reiterated its long term buy stance.
A stock overhang weakened several motor dealers. Cowie relinquished 10 to
249p, while Lex Service eased 8 to 421p. A squeeze boosted engineering group
GKN, leaving the shares 5 ahead at 571p. A clutch of broker's
recommendations helped components group T&amp;N gain 7 at 231p.
News that GEC has reopened talks on buying Thorn EMI's defence businesses
boosted trading in both stocks. GEC, which reports figures tomorrow, closed
3 ahead at 294p, while Thorn put on 2 to 1001p after trade of 1.2m.
The honour of being the day's best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 went to
British Airways, whose shares jumped 12 to 392p on volume of 6.6m, after it
released better than anticipated traffic figures for the month of June.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty ahead of full year figures from Dixons, the high street retail
group, and speculation of an investigation into trading practices saw the
shares dip 5 to 170p.
Dixons is forecast to announce a profit of between Pounds 70m and Pounds
82m, up from Pounds 35m last time, but the provisions could be quite high,
especially in relation to the recent sale of 100 of its Curry's elect-rical
stores. The write-down for Curry's is forecast at around Pounds 20m but some
analysts feel it could be substantially higher.
Also, there was a rumour that the Office of Fair Trading was planning an
inquiry into the pricing of white goods such as fridges and washing
machines.

FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome finds US support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US buying was the motor behind a sharp rise in the price of Wellcome, and
some dealers suggested that the pharmaceuticals group was only the most
publicised of a number of UK stocks attracting US attention recently. 'The
US led the market down, and now that they are worried about their own
interest rates they could be ready to put money back in,' said one senior
international marketmaker.
Dealers said US buyers of Wellcome were active in the London markets for
American Depositary Receipts and underlying shares as well as the New York
ADRs. The interest was fuelled by chart-based analysts at BNP Securities
seeing the stock bounce to 700p if a short term resistance at 618p is
cleared. The shares rose 16 to 608p but the volume of 7.9m was flattered by
the second half of a tax-related bed and breakfast deal - 6.8m shares dealt
at 560p.
SmithKline Beecham's position as the most heavily traded stock in London
(26m dealt) was also indicative of bed and breakfast dealing.

FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed well ahead of the day's lows after a firm Wall
Street steadied a nervous London market awaiting news on US interest rates,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening level of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was at
2,984, below expectations, and it seemed to set the tone for the next few
hours.
With little in the way of UK economic data on which to focus, dealers once
again chose to focus on the decline in the European bond markets which sent
the contract drifting lower. A US investment bank was said to have been one
of the big sellers during the morning, as were several other US houses, as
the market waited for news from the US.
Having fallen to a low of 2,935 after lunch, the upward direction of US
bonds and the firm opening on Wall Street which followed helped to steady
nerves in London, leading to a bounce in the contract. It ended at 2,959,
down 28 from its previous close, at a discount to cash and around 9 points
below its estimated fair value premium to cash of 5 points. Volume was low
at 14,101.
Turnover in traded options improved from Monday's poor levels to reach
24,819. Most of the activity was in index options, the FT-SE 100 seeing
10,534 lots dealt and the Euro FT-SE 4,724. Lasmo was the most active stock
option with a total of 2,566 trades.

FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally at the close of a nervous
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nervous day which had been spent waiting for the US Federal Open Market
Committee to meet closed with a good rally in UK equities as early losses in
British government bonds were reduced. A firm opening on Wall Street as US
markets returned from the Independence Day holiday helped sentiment but
London remained nervous that the Federal Reserve might raise its key
interest rates without waiting for this weekend's meeting of G7 ministers.
A fall of more than 25 points on the FT-SE 100 Index at mid-afternoon was
reduced significantly in later trading. At the close the index stood at
2,965 for a loss of only 5.4 on the day. At the high of the session it
reached 2,978.2 but the stock market was then undermined by weakness in UK
gilt-edged securities. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to the
derivatives markets, finished 5.4 up at 3,435.8.
Uncertainty ahead of the G7 meeting was fuelled by reports that the German
Finance Ministry would not propose the dollar exchange rate for discussion
at Naples. The market's next hurdle is on Thursday when the Bundesbank
meets.
The final picture was somewhat mixed, with evidence of selective buying
interest in several sectors of the market. However, there was little
immediate response to comments on the domestic outlook from Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Late firmness in the Dow
Industrial Average, which was 20 points up in UK hours, showed chiefly in a
firm oil share sector.
It was a slack day for data on the UK economy but analysts commented that
today's UK industrial production statistics for May will be keenly examined
for signs of further expansion in the core manufacturing sectors. The April
production figures sparked a firmer trend in UK equities.
Trading volume, as measured by the Stock Exchange Seaq electronic network,
remained low, with the day's share trading at 481.5m shares, against 483.3m
in the previous session. On Monday, retail, or genuine customer, business
was worth only Pounds 991m, an unexciting total by comparison with this
year's average figures.
The strategy team at Nikko, the Japanese based securities house, commented
that markets are currently being dominated by futures instruments and
featured by high volatility on low volume. It echoes other market firms in
stating that equities offer 'good value' at present levels but that any
solid rally is unlikely until the British government bond market can stage a
genuine recovery.
Strauss Turnbull warns against undue pessimism over the implications of
dollar weakness on UK equities. The firm says that British equities are now
around 12 per cent lower in dollar terms this year, while the rest of Europe
is only some 2 per cent down. This situation, says Strauss, has in the
recent past been a trigger for overseas, and especially US, investors to
regard the UK stock market as undervalued.
Although UK stocks have been marking time while waiting for the Federal
Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank and the G7 countries to resolve
the dollar's problems, the undertone in the equity market appears to have
held firm. Some traders believe this would provide the base for a good
advance in share prices if the US currency and the bond markets can be
settled down.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fed concern holds Dow to
narrow gain

Wall Street
US share prices ended flat to lower in thin trading yesterday as traders and
investors nervously awaited the outcome of the two-day meeting of the
Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.83 at 3,652.48, well
off a high for the day of 3,667.70. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 ended just 0.17 firmer at 446.37, while the American Stock Exchange
composite lost 1.02 at 423.70 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 3.26 to
703.59. Trading volume on the New York SE was 195.4m shares.
Share prices opened weaker across the board, with the Dow falling 10 points
in early trading as investor concern surfaced that the FOMC, which was due
to start its meeting in the afternoon, might vote to raise interest rates to
protect the dollar. In recent days the US currency has fallen to new
post-1945 lows against the Japanese yen.
The initial equity market decline, however, was not sustained, and prices
quickly moved into positive territory, aided by the stability of the dollar,
which held its own against the yen.
Stock market sentiment was also buoyed by a modest firming in bond prices,
and by a growing feeling among economists that the FOMC would not push up
interest rates just to protect the ailing dollar.
Economists said that the Fed would be more likely to raise rates if there
were fresh evidence of an overheating economy. The fact that this evidence
may come on Friday, when the June employment report is published, ensured
that yesterday's gains in stock prices were short-lived. In fact, demand was
so spotty that secondary indices such as the Russell 2000 small-cap index,
and the Amex and the Nasdaq composites, remained lower for most of the day.
Among individual stocks, Texaco stood out, rising almost Dollars 2 before
ending Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 60 7/8 in busy trading after the oil group
announced a significant restructuring that will include the sale of more
than half of its US oilfields and a reduction in its worldwide workforce of
about 2,500 within a year.
The strength in Texaco shares provided the rest of the oil sector with a
lift. Mobil rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 , Phillips Petroleum
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 33, Amoco Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 and
Chevron Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 7/8 . The exception was Exxon, which
eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 7/8 .
Constituents of the Dow were mixed, with some struggling to hold on to early
gains. IBM, which rose Dollars  5/8 at one point, ended Dollars 3/4 down at
Dollars 56 1/4 , but General Electric finished Dollars  5/8 up at Dollars 47
and Philip Morris Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 52 3/8 , all in heavy
trading.
Sony climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 62 7/8 on news that because of strong
demand the UK manufacturing arm of the Japanese electronics and
entertainment group will be raising production of cathode ray tubes by 50
per cent later this year.
On the Nasdaq market, news of a merger between two computer networking
groups - WellFleet Communications and SynOptics Communications - did not go
down well with investors. WellFleet fell Dollars 5 3/16 to Dollars 20 1/16
and SynOptics lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 5/8 .
Canada
The Toronto market ended with no clear trend after cautious trade as players
awaited news on the direction of US interest rates.
The Bank of Canada's bank rate fell a greater than expected 30 basis points
to 6.62 per cent in its weekly setting, but the Canadian dollar closed only
modestly lower at 72.10 US cents from Monday's 72.17 US cents.
The TSE 300 composite index showed no change on the day at 4,053.6, while
falls narrowly led rises by 393 to 333 after light volume of 45.1m shares
valued at CDollars 505m.
Eight of the 14 sub-groups were lower, led by golds, off 1.7 per cent as the
bullion price slipped USDollars 1 an ounce to USDollars 385.95 in New York.
The transportation sector showed a gain of 1.0 per cent. Financial services,
mining and energy also finished higher.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian brokers worry over exchange
rate policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo recovered most of a mid-morning fall of 2.4 per cent, the Bovespa
index closing 166, or 0.46 per cent, off in local currency terms at 35,643.
Volume was thin, and brokers said that concern over the government's
exchange rate policy was keeping foreigners out of the market. They said
that foreign investment in Brazilian markets came to an abrupt halt this
week as the central bank implemented a new exchange rate policy which was
clearly designed to inhibit foreign capital inflows.
A trader said: 'There were almost no foreigners buying because of the
exchange rate, and some Brazilian investors are selling to invest in
fixed-income.' But brokers said the tone was stable due to the expected
success of the government's anti-inflation plan.
Mexico
Equities were traded cautiously awaiting the result of the FOMC meeting in
Washington, the IPC index gaining a mere 8.5 points at 2,276.1. Brokers were
conscious that uncertainty would continue ahead of the G7 meeting at the
weekend, and the country's elections on August 21.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Easier yen and consumer
spending hopes lift Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The retreat in the yen lifted sentiment, and hopes of strong consumer
spending due to the hot summer weather focused hopes on consumer electronic
stocks as the Nikkei 225 average rose on buying by financial institutions,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index put on 202.44 at 20,834.37 after opening at the day's low of
20,650.03 and peaking at 20,907.58 in the afternoon. Arbitrage selling late
in the session eroded some of the afternoon gains.
Volume totalled 393m shares, against Monday's 248m. Foreign investors were
absent ahead of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the
German Bundesbank council meeting and the Group of Seven meetings in Naples
later in the week.
Some domestic investors remained cautious over currency fluctuations and the
waning prospect of a co-ordinated move on interest rates by the US, Japan
and Germany. However, brokers said investor confidence seemed to be
returning slowly, following reports of rising sales of clothing and air
conditioners thanks to the hot weather, and of spending prompted by the cut
in income tax.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 10.76 at 1,683.49 and the
Nikkei 300 was up 2.28 at 306.28, while advances outscored declines by 686
to 338, with 164 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
forward 2.37 to 1,371.83.
High-technology shares rose on the yen's decline to the Y99 level to the
dollar. Oki Electric climbed Y22 to Y817, Toshiba Y18 to Y830, Sharp Y30 to
a year's high of Y1,890 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y30 to Y1,850.
Brokers bought prospective beneficiaries of the country's heat wave. The air
conditioner retailer Hitachi Sales advanced Y35 to Y748 and Best Denki Y50
to Y1,920. Brewers were also stronger, Kirin Brewery rising Y40 to Y1,220
and Sapporo Lion, a beer hall operator, Y40 to Y1,530.
Hopes of a sales increase supported department stores and supermarkets,
Marui appreciating Y60 to Y1,960 and Daiei Y20 to Y1,780.
Terumo, a medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y103 to Y1,020
on reports of its development of a three dimensional television.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had gained on the telecommunication
theme, dipped Y1,000 to Y871,000 on profit-taking. East Japan Railway lost
Y1,000 at Y509,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 213.19 to 23,343.37 in volume of 33.7m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim trading was cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting later in the day.
SYDNEY was helped higher by bullish statements from leading companies and
firmer futures. The All Ordinaries index closed 16.3 stronger at 2,003.4,
above 2,000 for the first time in more than a week.
BHP, which said it was eager to make a major acquisition, added 20 cents at
ADollars 18.28. Nine Network slipped 4 cents to ADollars 4.16 and Australian
Consolidated Press gained 4 cents at ADollars 4.34 after news that they
planned to merge into a single listed entity.
The All Industrials index rose 19.8 to 2,942.6 and the All Resources climbed
14.0 to 1,297.3. National turnover was 129.5m shares worth a modest ADollars
279.7m.
SEOUL was spurred ahead for the third straight day by institutional demand
for companies expected to produce higher profits. The composite stock index
put on 9.26 at 960.49. Posco and Samsung Electronics went limit up for a
second day, adding Won2,000 and Won2,500 at Won71,000 and Won92,000
respectively.
HONG KONG was unable to make progress after another day of thin, narrow
trade. The Hang Seng index ended 5.09 easier at 8,623.19, near the bottom of
the day's 45-point range. Turnover edged up to a preliminary HKDollars
1.56bn from Monday's adjusted HKDollars 1.31bn, which was an 18-month low.
Hong Kong Ferry provided the day's sole spark, jumping HKDollars 1.55 to
HKDollars 14.55 after the government announced the start of final
negotiations on the company's pier and commercial development plans.
TAIPEI reversed early gains after late profit-taking in fin-ancials. The
weighted index, which moved in a 79-point range, ended 2.68 off at 6,064.95.
Turnover came to TDollars 63.98bn.
MANILA's composite index fell below the 2,600 psychological support level as
the market continued to worry about the outlook for US interest rates. The
index lost 49.97 at 2,595.16 in turnover of 674.2m pesos, against a previous
582.2m pesos.
The newly listed SM Prime closed at 5.50 pesos, up from the 5.35 pesos offer
price but lower than the off-market price of 5.70 prior to listing.
BOMBAY made a mild recovery from a subdued opening on buying by state-owned
financial institutions.
The BSE 30-share index ended 6.86 ahead at 4,102.06.
SINGAPORE closed mixed as technical-led buying dried up late in the
afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index was off 3.21 at 2,187.95 after
a day's high of 2,195.56.
KUALA LUMPUR edged ahead in cautious trade, the composite index adding 4.50
at 1,004.06 in volume down to 81m shares from Monday's 89m.
Speculative stocks were in demand. Idris rose to a high of MDollars 4.56
before closing 8 cents up on the day at MDollars 4.46.
BANGKOK finished at the day's peak on buying of blue chip stocks. The SET
index rose throughout the day, gaining 20.73, or 1.63 per cent, at 1,295.64
in moderate turnover of Bt4.99bn, double Monday's total of Bt2.39bn.
WELLINGTON finished a dull day slightly lower, the NZSE-40 capital index
receding 12.46 to 1,997.32. Volume was a light NZDollars 22.8m.
Weakness in selected second line shares was the main feature of the day. The
NZSE Smaller Companies index retreated 23.91 to 4,339.16.
SHENZHEN trading was suspended for the day after a malfunction of the main
Gilat satellite earth station, which transmits and receives the market's
trading data.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses wary ahead of FOMC
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preoccupied with currency and interest rate considerations, bourses were not
disposed to react to the mid-morning bounce on Wall Street, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried for another rise in the pre-bourse, where the Dax index hit
a day's high of 2,068.36. However, professionals were conscious that it was
only two weeks ago that the index was testing 1,950; and that there will be
a number of events to test it over the next few days.
The Dax subsided on the session to close 21.71 lower at 2,032.69,
understandable, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, in view
of the scope for profit-taking, the sense that a short consolidation would
make, and the prospect of high level economic meetings: the FOMC, in
Washington, yesterday afternoon and today; the Bundesbank, tomorrow; and G7,
on Friday.
In the post-bourse, the Ibis indicated Dax stood relatively still, although
the September bund future fell by a full percentage point from its day's
high of 92.42 before it recovered late to 91.60. Ms Altmann thought that the
equity market had already discounted a rate rise in the US.
Turnover rose from DM4.4bn to DM5.7bn. There was little acknowledgement of
the Chinese high level mission to Germany, and the billion-D-Mark industrial
contracts for German companies expected to result. Siemens, which rose
DM7.50 on Monday, dropped DM9 to DM653.50, although it seemed likely to be
the biggest single beneficiary.
PARIS saw a hefty rebound in Alcatel Alsthom, although Mr Pierre Suard, its
chairman, was placed under investigation formally just after midnight on
Tuesday for corruption and misuse of public funds for work carried out at
his home.
Traders said the feared US sales of Alcatel shares had not materialised. The
stock rose FFr31, or 5.7 per cent, to FFr572 in 1.27m shares traded, the
heaviest volume of the day, as the CAC-40 index recovered 12.55 to 1,878.73.
Overall, turnover was still thin at FFr2.89bn. Generale des Eaux, caught in
the Alcatel backlash on Monday, recovered FFr16 to FFr531. Meanwhile,
Schneider, the electrical group whose chairman was arrested in Belgium at
the end of May, continued its slow return to engineering favour, rising
FFr11.30 to FFr363.30 after a 1994 low towards the end of June.
MILAN picked up amid renewed domestic demand for blue chip stocks, although
many investors remained hesitant, awaiting the broad outline of government
measures to cut the budget deficit which will be released tomorrow.
The Comit index added 4.40 at 691.24, news of a pay deal affecting 1.7m
metalworkers helping the mood. The agreement, which traditionally sets the
trend for other sectors, provides for staggered wage rises over the next two
years in line with expected inflation.
Among the blue chips, Fiat rose L190, or 2.9 per cent, to L6,640, Olivetti
put on L60, or 2.5 per cent, at L2,470 and Pirelli added L70 at L2,575.
Ciga, the luxury hotels group in which ITT Sheraton, of the US, is expected
to try to gain effective control, strengthened L20 to L1,125 ahead of
today's shareholders meeting.
ZURICH was unable to maintain Monday's momentum and the SMI index gave back
26.7 to 2,609 in thin volume, with the market taking its direction from
easier bond futures. Roche certificates fell SFr85 to SFr6,330 and UBS
bearers SFr8 to SFr1,169. Against the trend, Georg Fischer picked up SFr20
to SFr1,470, still benefiting from its chief financial officer's upbeat
forecast of profits for this year.
MADRID built on the uncertainties elsewhere, the general index falling 5.65,
or 1.9 per cent, to 295.11 in Pta28bn turnover. Bankinter reversed a
recently positive response to brokers' recommendations, leading banks down
with a fall of Pta470, or 4.2 per cent, to Pta10,600.
HELSINKI continued to show up well in spite of a 2.5 per cent drop in the
Finnish banking and finance house index. The Hex index climbed 6.5 per cent
to 1,704.8, driven up again by gains in Nokia, which capped a long period of
outperformance; the electronics and industrial conglomerate closed another
FM9 higher at FM460 after a FM24 gain on Monday, following its admission to
quotation in the US.
AMSTERDAM received a late fillip from Wall Street's early strength and the
AEX index finished 1.70 higher at 389.70.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging company, put on 20 cents at Fl 43.50 as it
said it was studying various options to finance the growth of its office
products group, including a US listing.
Begemann, the troubled engineering group, dropped Fl 3, or 10 per cent, to
Fl 29.50, a new low for the year, although analysts said they knew of no new
development to account for the decline.
TEL AVIV rebounded from Monday's low in heavy trading, the Mishtanim index
rising 5.02, or 3.4 per cent, to 153.03 in turnover of Shk179m. Traders were
unable to determine if this was a recovery, or simply a reaction after two
weeks of heavy declines.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa slips on Keys report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was unsettled by early reports that Mr Derek Keys, the minister
of finance, was to resign. Industrials slipped in late trade as golds held
on to most of their earlier gains, writes Michael Morgan.
In subsequent London trading on Seaq International, South African equities
were marked sharply lower as the market awaited clarification of the reasons
for Mr Keys' departure. Among mining issues, Anglo American was 4.6 per cent
down, De Beers dropped 3.9 per cent and Vaal Reefs fell 3.1 per cent. Sappi,
South Africa's biggest pulp and paper company, retreated 3.1 per cent.
Last night, Mr Charles Kernot at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London said Mr
Keys' confirmation that he was leaving for personal reasons would be less of
a body blow for the market than if there had been policy differences. Much
would now depend on who was named as his successor.
In Johannesburg trading, the overall index finished 3 softer at 5,451,
industrials lost 20 at 6,267 and golds showed an advance of 9 at 2,172.
De Beers added 25 cents at R108, Anglos fell R2 to R228 and Vaal Reefs was
R3 higher at R418. Sappi rose 25 cents to R46.25 following the chairman's
bullish annual review.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar vigil continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US currency weakened by more than a pfennig yesterday as markets
continued their dollar vigil amid a raft of key policy meetings culminating
in the weekend G7 summit in Naples, writes Philip Gawith.
The growing consensus in the market that no dollar support package is likely
to emerge weakened the US currency, which closed in London at DM1.5826 from
DM1.5965 and against the yen at Y98.825 from Y98.9. In New York it finished
at DM1.5802 and Y98.925.
Elsewhere in Europe the high-yielding currencies - particularly the Italian
lira, Belgian franc and Swedish krona - were under pressure as markets
focused on their large budget deficits.
Sterling closed at DM2.438, a nine-month low, as the weak dollar dragged it
down against the German currency.
The South African financial rand - the foreign investment currency - ended
at R4.845 against the dollar from R4.725 after it emerged that Mr Derek
Keys, the country's influential finance minister, would be resigning later
this year.
As the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed,
started its meeting, markets were increasingly sceptical of the prospect of
any supportive rate moves either in the US or Germany.
The Bundesbank council meets tomorrow, and dollar bulls were hoping that
lower German rates, in tandem with a tightening of US policy, might bolster
the currency.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said the
market was starting to get short of dollars. He said comments from senior
financial officials, downplaying the prospect of concerted intervention, had
encouraged the markets to sell dollars.
Mr Theo Waigel, for example, the German finance minister, said Germany would
not propose the dollar's exchange rate as a subject for discussion at the
Naples summit.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the market
was, if anything, faced with a yen crisis, not a dollar crisis. He noted
that the dollar was actually stronger against the currencies of its two main
trading partners - Canada and Mexico.
The dollar is also in the middle of its recent trading range against the
D-Mark, between the all-time low of around DM1.40, and the high this year of
DM1.77.
Mr MacKinnon said that inasmuch as central banks were concerned with the
dollar, it was because of 'perceived adverse affects on global financial
markets'. He noted, however, that there are numerous fundamental reasons
why, for example, US bond yields should have risen this year. These include
fears about future inflation, a global capital shortage and the role of
leveraged investors.
The Citibank analyst said, therefore, that he was 'not convinced that
intervention and higher interest rates will strengthen the dollar - and even
if they do, that a stronger dollar will undo the damage that we have seen in
the bond markets'.
Although the dollar is trending weaker, Mr Hawkins said the market was wary
about selling it aggressively short for fear of being caught in a bear trap,
where concerted central bank intervention would move the currency sharply
higher.
The Swedish krona slipped sharply after comments from the finance minister
downgrading the GDP forecast, and raising the budget deficit forecast from
SKr150bn to SKr160bn.
These bad economic numbers come against a complicated political backdrop,
with general elections scheduled in September and the country facing a
potentially difficult referendum on joining the European Union.
The krona closed at SKr4.955 from SKr4.890 against the D-Mark. Mr MacKinnon
of Citibank said it was certainly possible that the krona would again slip
to the low of SKr5.05 that it touched last year.
Two other European countries with large budget deficits, Italy and Belgium,
also saw their currencies weaken. The lira fell back to L993.8 per D-Mark
from L990.6 while the Belgian franc dipped to BFr20.63 from BFr20.61.
Analysts said the move in the Belgian franc was large considering the tight
trading range the currency normally occupies.
The financial rand ended at R4.845 against the dollar, from R4.725 on
Monday, but traders noted that the currency had bounced off a low of
R4.95-8, with some investors sensing value at these lower levels.
The focus of the market now is on who will succeed Mr Keys. Market
speculation favours Mr Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group,
whose appointment would probably calm market nerves.
Activity in the futures markets remained fairly subdued, with trading ranges
narrow at the short end of the market. The December Eurosterling contract
finished unchanged at 93.73, while the December Euromark contract closed at
94.95 from 94.97.
The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 540m to UK money
markets after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Earlier the Bank had
provided Pounds 187m liquidity to the market.

London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices clawed back modest gains in a
listless afternoon session that saw most players reluctant to move
decisively pending more news on crop damage and weather trends in Brazil.
The September futures price, which had ranged between Dollars 3,030 and
Dollars 3,095 a tonne, closed at Dollars 3,074, up Dollars 21.
COCOA futures followed the New York trend to end at the day's lows.
London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices showed little reaction to news of a
big cut in warehouse stocks.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chemical group puts organic
farming on trial - Alison Maitland reports on Rhone-Poulenc's 10-year
experiment in producing crops without chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Rhone-Poulenc, one of Europe's largest agrochemicals groups, started an
experiment in organic farming at its research base in Essex, the public
response was understandably sceptical. Alongside laboratories testing 10,000
herbicide components a year was a project designed to demonstrate
scientifically whether farming without chemicals could be profitable,
effective and good for the environment.
Five years into the experiment, Mr Lister Noble, manager of the 57-hectare
Boarded Barns Farm, is as conscious as ever of the need for credibility as
he unveils the first detailed conclusions of the 10-year comparison with
conventionally-grown cereal crops.
'If I haven't got my heart in it, then there's no comparison. I do really
want to make the organic side pay,' he says.
Driving round the site, Rhone-Poulenc's only commercial farm, Mr Noble
bubbles with enthusiasm at the progress of the organic wheat and oats. The
land had to be left uncultivated for two years before organic cropping could
begin, to remove all traces of chemicals. So this year's grain harvest will
be only the third, even though the project began in 1989.
'This year is the first year that we're starting to see trends and drawing
observations,' he says.
The organic crops appear less regimented and slightly less robust than their
conventional rivals in five neighbouring fields on the farm, which has a
predominantly chalky boulder clay soil topped by a medium-heavy loam.
However, Mr Noble says weeds have not been as big a problem as he feared.
Organic wheat production, although well below the conventional yield of
about eight tonnes a hectare, was better than he expected. 'I thought the
first organic crop was going to be really weedy but it wasn't. It yielded
over five tonnes a hectare, which is rated with some of the best organic
yields in the UK.'
Second year yields were almost as good, but the protein level was too low to
qualify the wheat for bread making. Mr Noble attributes this to a lack of
nitrogen in the soil. H used pelleted chicken feather manure and seaweed
extract to fertilise the soil in the first year but abandoned that in the
second on the advice of some organic experts. Now he is considering using it
again to improve the quality - and saleability - of the wheat.
Since one of the biggest difficulties with organic farming is low soil
fertility, he is particularly pleased that new regulations from Brussels
allow organic farmers to grow clover - a rich soil nutrient - on land they
are paid to set aside from arable production. This will prove an economical
way of increasing nitrogen levels during rotations between cereal crops.
Every aspect of the project is being monitored by outside experts, ranging
from university research departments to Adas, the government's farm advisory
service, and the British Trust for Ornithology.
To demonstrate impartiality, Mr Noble asked Elm Farm, the research arm of
the Soil Association, Britain's leading organic campaign body, to choose the
five fields for the organic experiment.
Independent experts have analysed and tasted bread made from the two types
of wheat. They found no differences in the calorific value of the breads,
although the organic wholemeal loaves did not rise as well and textures and
flavours differed. As far as environmental effects are concerned, different
species of spider have been found in the organic fields and more bird
species on the farm generally, but it is too early to draw clear
conclusions.
That is not the case when it comes to profitability. The average annual cost
of producing organic wheat at Boarded Barns Farm has been nearly Pounds 17
higher a tonne than for the conventional wheat over the past five years.
The project involved start-up costs for separate machinery such as a Pounds
14,000 sprayer to ensure no chemicals are sprayed by accident on to the
organic crops. In addition, loss of young crops to pests, disease and
weeding machinery means that organic seed must be applied at 250kg a
hectare, compared with 180kg on conventional fields.
However, the variable costs of the organic wheat crop in 1992 and 1993, such
as seed, fertiliser, machinery and hired labour, proved lower than those of
the conventional crop. The really costly problem is having to leave fields
uncropped during conversion to organic methods and again between crops, to
restore soil fertility. Mr Noble converted the fields gradually, keeping
some under conventional crops for the first two years to boost gross
margins. 'The organic side would have looked pretty sick (financially) if we
hadn't included the conventional crops,' he says.
Even so, the organic side of the farm has produced a cumulative gross margin
 -the value of output less variable costs - of only Pounds 2,557 a hectare
since 1989 compared with Pounds 5,487 from the conventional side.
'There's got to be a massive subsidy to make this farm pay, growing organic
crops,' Mr Noble concludes. Britain, unlike other European countries such as
Germany, does not pay state subsidies to existing organic farmers, although
the government is implementing a Pounds 1.5m-a-year scheme in August to
encourage conventional farmers to convert to organic.
Mr Noble himself favours 'taking the best of both (organic and conventional)
systems.' He believes lessons can be learned by conventional farmers from
the organic experiment, such as its use of a weeding machine which acts like
a giant rake, lifting young weeds out of the soil before they have a chance
to root firmly. This aerates the soil and loosens the surface, helping to
release plant nutrients. 'On a conventional farm, they could use this if
there's not a high weed population. If it doesn't work, they could then use
a herbicide.'
The experiment may continue beyond 10 years, Mr Noble says. 'We might find
there's mileage in it.' Rhone-Poulenc has clearly seen which way the wind is
blowing. It is developing agrochemicals with low active ingredients and
pesticides that attack specific targets. Another idea being pursued is for a
protective dressing to be applied to seeds so that the crop they produce
does not need to be sprayed.
The group is also making diagnostic kits to help farmers decide the precise
timing and levels of spray in environmentally sensitive areas. According to
Mr Noble: 'If the farmer wants to use fewer inputs, he will need quite a lot
of advice and help.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Boffins aim to clean up with
oilseed rape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists at the Scottish Agricultural College are working with Calgene,
the Californian biotechnology group, to develop an oilseed rape variety for
use in detergents such as washing powder for the European market.
The work, unveiled at this week's Royal Show, England's biggest agricultural
event, involves genetic engineering of rape varieties to change the mixture
of oils they contain.
If the research results in commercial production it could reduce dependence
on imports of coconut and palm oil for detergent manufacture. Britain
imports 400,000 tonnes of these oils a year.
'We're to all intents and purposes growing palm trees at Aberdeen,' said Mr
Kerr Walker, an agronomist with the college's Agro-Industrial Research
Services unit in north-east Scotland.
Oilseed rape is one of the most important crops grown in the UK for
industrial purposes, which means it can be cultivated on land that farmers
are paid to take out of food production. Last year, 500,000 hectares of
arable land were set aside in the UK, a figure that could double by 2000.
At present only erucic acid is available from rapeseed. This is used in
specialised industrial detergents, but is becoming better known as an agent
for making polythene wrapping malleable.
Calgene, which developed the non-rotting 'Flavr Savr' tomato, has asked the
Scottish researchers to investigate varieties with high lauric acid content,
which produces oils similar to coconut and palm oil.
'There's interest from other companies,' said Mr Walker. 'They really would
like to get their hands on these materials. But the varieties are very
definitely Calgene's property and have been patented.' He said the oils
could be on the market in North America next year, according to the American
Oil Chemists Society. Their commercial development in Britain depends on the
gradual relaxation of Department of Environment regulations on the release
of genetically engineered organisms.
It also requires public acceptance that stringent precautions have been
taken to ensure such releases are safe.
The genetic engineering involves slotting a small piece of genetic
information into the plant cell, which then produces a different oil type.
Mr Walker said: 'It's absolutely vital the public are kept informed about
this and that it's done slowly and sensitively'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper rally runs into
resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's price rally continued at the London Metal Exchange yesterday but
ran into resistance short of the 21-month peaks reached late last month.
Twice the three months position spiked above Dollars 2,490 a tonne, but both
times the move was reversed by dealer selling and profit-taking. At the
close the price stood at Dollars 2,486.50 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on the day
and Dollars 110 above the low reached in the sell-off that ended a week ago.
In after hours trading it was trimmed further Dollars 13.
Dealers told Reuter that yesterday afternoon's retreat was all part of a
consolidation process following a week of gains. The rise had been
encouraged by news that Chile's Chuquicamata mine would lose 40,000 tonnes
of output this year because of a furnace closure to comply with pollution
controls.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slightly firmer ahead of Fed
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were slightly firmer in light trading yesterday as
dealers and investors waited on the sidelines for the results of the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up
5/32 at 84 5/16 , yielding 7.585 per cent. The two-year note up  3/32 at 99
25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent.
The market reopened after the July 4 holiday with all eyes on the Fed. The
recent fall in the dollar has put pressure on the central bank to protect
the currency, and some analysts were predicting the FOMC would decide to
raise interest rates.
Nervousness about such an outcome was behind an early retreat in bond
prices, but the losses were modest and by the end of the morning Treasuries
had returned to positive territory. The stability of the dollar also helped
the recovery.
The consensus on Wall Street remains that the FOMC will not change its
stance on monetary policy just because of the dollar. If, however, the June
employment report, due to be released on Friday, shows further strengthening
in the economy, analysts say the Fed might decide to raise rates again to
slow the pace of growth.
European government bond markets fell back yesterday in thin, nervous trade
as investors waited for the outcome of the FOMC meeting.
Remarks by officials that there would be no move by the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations to support the weak US dollar at their weekend
meeting also put downward pressure on markets.
'Most investors are sidelined, looking for some reassurance that US rates
are not moving upwards too far and too quickly and that rates in Europe are
still on a downward course,' said Mr Neil Williams of UBS. 'If no signal has
come by Monday, after the G7 summit, then there is likely to be a short-term
correction downwards,' he said.
Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg, said: 'The markets
are lower on the prospect of renewed turbulence in the currency markets, if
the G7 do nothing to solve the dollar's problems.'
UK gilts recovered most of their earlier losses yesterday, largely in relief
that no policy statement on interest rates had emerged from the US.
Gilts had fallen sharply in early trade in line with the rest of Europe.
They were unaffected by data showing a rise in house prices in June
following two months of decline. They also shrugged off comments from Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, made at a parliamentary select
committee hearing on the Treasury's summer forecast.
'Mr Clarke saying that there was no specific growth figure which would cause
him to raise rates could have steepened the yield curve, but had little
effect with nervousness about the US dominating,' said Mr Mark Reckless,
economist at SG Warburg.
The September long gilt future on Liffe was unchanged on the day at 100 9/32
in late trading.
Attention today will be focused on the setting of rates for the Bundesbank's
securities repurchase tender tomorrow.
'Anything less than a four to five basis point cut in the repo rate will be
a disappointment and will indicate a slowing in the pace of rate cuts,' said
one analyst.
The German September government bond contract on Liffe was down 0.23 points
at 91.90 in late trading. The September notional French bond futures
contract on Matif closed at 114.2, down 0.9 points on the day.
Follow-through buying in the wake of Monday's successful bond auction caused
a short-lived rally yesterday in Swedish government bonds.
But prices fell back after the meeting between Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance
minister, and Mr Goran Persson, economic spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrat party, ended without any concrete proposals or agreements on
limiting the growth of public sector debt.
'Underlying sentiment in the bond market remains fragile,' said Mr Kokko.
Analysts said one of the main reasons why the auction was so successful was
that foreign investors were attracted by the weakness of the Swedish krona
and the high bond yields. They doubted how long these investors would remain
in the Swedish market.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand acts to tighten
rules on share offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced new rules
governing initial public offerings of stock, in an attempt to broaden share
ownership and end corrupt deals involving underpriced shares in newly-listed
companies.
The new regulations, which come into effect on Friday, require companies
making IPOs to offer at least 30 per cent of the new stock to small
investors; in the event of oversubscription, these shares must be allocated
randomly by computer.
Underwriters are allowed to allocate a further 60 per cent of the offer to
their clients and other buyers, provided that the method of distribution has
been disclosed in the prospectus.
The SEC said owners and managers of the company cannot receive allocations
from this tranche, but ordinary employees can.
The company itself can allocate the remaining 10 per cent of the stock on
offer, but again the owners and managers are excluded.
Foreign stockbrokers generally welcomed the new SEC regulations. 'If they
can enforce it, it will be really quite useful,' said one Bangkok-based
broker.
Until now, there have been no rules in Thailand about the distribution of
shares from IPOs. It has been common practice for company executives to
enrich themselves and buy favours from politicians and civil servants by
allocating shares at low prices.
'They would price it at a huge discount, only sell a very small part of the
company and then make sure it all went to themselves and their friends,' the
broker said.
After an IPO of a Thai company, a few shareholders would often control the
market in the shares and force the price up before selling their holdings at
a large profit.
'There have been a great deal of complaints that small investors can't get
their hands on IPOs,' Mr Rapee Sucharitakul, SEC spokesman, said yesterday.
'The real objective (of the new rules) is to have a fairer distribution of
shares,' he added.
The two-year-old Thai SEC suffered a setback last month when a court
acquitted Mr Song Watcharasriroj - known as Sia ('tycoon') Song - and 11
others of acting in concert to ramp the share price of Bangkok Bank of
Commerce, but it is continuing its efforts to improve regulation of the
lively Thai stock exchange.
The SEC said yesterday that it was drawing up rules similar to those
governing the banking sector to ensure that securities companies had
sufficient net capital to do business safely.
Sahaviriya Steel Industry is likely to be the first IPO to be affected,
AP-DJ adds from Bangkok. The company, a subsidiary of the Sahaviriya group,
is due to issue shares around July 18.
To meet the definition of 'small-scale' under the rules, investors cannot
buy more than Bt500,000 worth of an IPO with a total value of Bt1bn.
For issues worth up to Bt2bn, the limit is Bt1m and for issues larger than
Bt2bn, the limit is Bt2m, the SEC said.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Activity dominated by clutch of
dollar-denominated issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clutch of dollar bond offerings dominated market activity yesterday. Two
short-dated offerings, for Sweden and Rabobank, were mainly aimed at retail
investors. Dealers said the short end of the market was beginning to suffer
under the heavy weight of recent supply.
The Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 300m offering of 6 1/4 per cent two-year
bonds, via Nomura and Swiss Bank Corporation, met the better reception of
the two deals.
The issue appeared unaffected by concerns which hit the Swedish government
bond market at the end of last week, when Skandia, the Swedish insurance
company, said it would boycott government bonds because of concern about the
handling of the country's debt problems.
The deal was launched at 15 1/2 basis points over the comparable Treasury
and, by the end of the day, was bid at 17 basis points over the curve.
The deal for Rabobank, despite its triple-A rating and the strong attraction
of the name in the Benelux region, is likely to take longer to sell, dealers
said. The pricing of 8 basis points over the three-year Treasury yield was
considered aggressive.
However, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation pointed out that Rabobank deals
launched earlier this year are yielding substantially less than US
Treasuries.
In the sterling market, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group launched a
Pounds 200m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, via UBS. Although
there have been a number of floating-rate mortgage-backed securities in the
market recently, there has been little bank FRN paper on offer in the
sterling market.
The deal was priced to offer a discounted margin of 15 basis points over
Libor. The bank had considered issuing in dollars, but switched to sterling
due to the heavy competition in the dollar sector, with Italy's global due
next week.
Also in the sterling market, NatWest Capital Markets arranged a repackaging
of existing housing association debentures, issued last year in the domestic
market. The Pounds 104m issue, for Guaranteed Enhanced Secured Bonds, was
guaranteed by Ambac Indemnity Corporation, the US monoline insurer.
National Grid has exercised its pre-emption rights to repurchase the two
bond issues included in the sale of UK privatised companies' debt by the
government, due to take place on July 18, Salomon Brothers announced
yesterday.
The two bonds are National Grid's Pounds 150m issue of 12.958 per cent bonds
due 1997 and its Pounds 150m issue of 11.437 per cent bonds due 2008.
Total proceeds to be received by the UK Treasury are Pounds 343.42m.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gencor announcement on Shell
deal delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gencor, the South African mining and metals group, has postponed the
announcement, planned for yesterday, of details of its long-awaited
USDollars 1bn deal to buy the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and metals
operations.
However, Mr Bernard Smith, Gencor's new business director who has been
leading the team negotiating with Shell, was quick to assure the market that
the talks were still on course. 'We still have some issues to settle but
none is substantive at this state. The heart of the deal is concluded.'
Mr Smith insisted an announcement was only days away.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Gencor had raised about USDollars 200m
towards the deal from the sale of its stin Transatlantic Holdings, the
London-listed life insurance and property group owned by Liberty Life of
South Africa. Gencor owned 8.4 per cent of Transatlantic, including its
holding of convertible shares.
The South African group has arranged to raise more money for the acquisition
from a consortium of European banks.
Gencor shed its non-mining and metals businesses in South Africa when it
unbundled its assets there last November. The deal with Shell, to buy assets
mostly under the Billiton banner, is intended to make Gencor an important
force in international mining.
Gencor originally intended to acquire the Billiton assets - which, when the
deal was first proposed a year ago, were worth about USDollars 1.8bn - and
merge them with its own operations outside South Africa as well as its
R1.5bn (Dollars 417m), 50 per cent stake in Richards Bay Minerals in South
Africa. The combined group would then have been floated in London. Gencor
was considering partners to help finance the deal.
In the past year, Shell has decided to sell some of its mining operations
separately - which will reduce the value of the deal. There were suggestions
yesterday that Shell might retain a minority stake in Billiton.
However, difficulties have apparently arisen over the transfer of the
Richards Bay stake from South Africa to the new company.

Optus, the Australian telecoms group which was set up as a competitor to the
government-owned Telecom, has confirmed that it plans to float on the
Australian Stock Exchange next year.
The company has appointed County NatWest Corporate Finance to act as its
financial adviser on the flotation, and the two joint lead managers are
County NatWest Securities and Potter Warburg/ABN Amro Hoare Govett.
Optus, licensed as the second telecoms carrier in 1992, is owned by a
consortium of international investors, including BellSouth of the US and
Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK. Australia's Mayne Nickless and several
Australian institutions also have stakes.

<TEXT>
John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, is expected to
announce today that it is buying a stake in the brewing arm of Femsa,
Mexico's biggest beverage company. The deal is understood to be valued at
about CDollars 1bn (Dollars 714m).
Labatt declined to comment yesterday after trading in its shares was halted
on the Toronto Stock Exchange but the two companies have scheduled press
conferences today.
Labatt, best known in the UK for its Rolling Rock beer and in North America
for its part-ownership of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, has
restructured to focus on beer and broadcasting.
It has been seeking another international investment to complement its
brewing interests in the US, UK and Italy.
Last month, Labatt unveiled plans to spin off its sport and live
entertainment businesses. The Toronto branch of the Bronfman family held a
controlling stake in Labatt until early last year, when its shares were sold
to the public.
Femsa's brewing arm, Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, has just under half of
Mexico's beer market, worth about USDollars 3bn a year.
Philip Morris, the US consumer products group which controls Miller Brewing,
acquired 8 per cent of Femsa's stock in 1992. Femsa held talks with Miller
about an investment in the brewing division, but these have apparently been
unsuccessful.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alcoa, Western Mining to join
forces in alumina
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, and Western Mining, the Australian
minerals group, have announced plans to combine their alumina and
alumina-based chemicals operations in a worldwide partnership. In 1993, the
operations had combined revenues of USDollars 2.7bn.
The proposed merged business would account for about one-quarter of the
world's alumina production, Western Mining said.
The business would be 60 per cent owned by Alcoa and 40 per cent by Western
Mining. Alcoa would receive a Dollars 360m payment from Western Mining.
The two companies have been shareholders in Alcoa of Australia since its
formation in 1960, with Alcoa holding a 51 per cent stake and Western Mining
building up a 48.25 per cent holding.
Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said the new arrangement would allow the
two companies to 'explore all opportunities in alumina and chemicals without
regard to differing ownership positions around the world.
'We believe this global alliance will enhance our flexibility to take
advantage of our current low cost positions in alumina and chemicals and
accelerate future growth in both of these key markets.'
Under the agreement, Alcoa will have overall management responsibility for
the enterprise, which will be under the direction of a five-member strategic
council appointed by the two companies. Three members would come from Alcoa.
Operations likely to be included in the enterprise are Alcoa of Australia;
Alcoa's interests in bauxite and alumina operations in Texas, Suriname,
Guinea, Brazil and Jamaica; Alcoa's industrial chemicals businesses in the
US, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, India and
possibly Brazil; and Alcoa Steamship.
In connection with the deal, Melbourne-based Western Mining announced
yesterday that it plans to make a ADollars 720m (USDollars 522m) rights
issue. The new shares will be issued on a one-for-eight basis at ADollars
5.80 a share. Western Mining shares had closed at ADollars 7.42.
The deal and fund-raising follow a period of controversy for the Australian
group, which has been forced to settle a number of lawsuits on
disadvantageous terms. Most notably, it was obliged to relinquish the rich
Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit in Queensland, after its exploration team
trespassed on the lease area.
Western Mining's interest in Alcoa of Australia, however, underpinned the
group's recent profit improvements: in the half-year to end-December,
after-tax profits rose 25 per cent to ADollars 66.3m, with the Alcoa of
Australia investment contributing almost ADollars 90m, compared with
ADollars 56.5m a year earlier.
However, Western Mining has warned that Alcoa's contribution would turn down
sharply in 1994.

<TEXT>
Newcrest Mining, the Australian goldminer, has decided not to launch an
appeal against a decision in the Western Australian courts, which declared
that it did not have pre-emptive rights over shares in the Boddington gold
mine.
The question had arisen because Reynolds Metals wished to sell its 40 per
cent interest in the mine to Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de
Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group.
Newcrest, which holds a 20 per cent interest in the mine, said that it
believed 'there are reasonable prospects that the decision may have been
overturned on appeal', but that 'such a result is not beyond doubt'. It said
that the decision not to appeal was 'the reasonable and pragmatic decision
to take in light of all the circumstances'.
Newcrest's decision was welcomed by PosGold, which said that the Reynolds
purchase would be completed soon.

Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), a Malaysian conglomerate involved mainly in
the property, media, and power sectors, has been given the go-ahead to
develop the country's Brickfield's Central Station Project, an investment
thought to be worth about USDollars 1bn.
The deal will give MRCB rights to develop land, currently state-owned, in an
undeveloped area of Kuala Lumpur. The project will include a railway
terminal, airport shuttle services, a terminal for light rail transit, and
bus and taxi connections. Offices, retail space and hotels are also planned.
Financial details are subject to further negotiation between the government
and MRCB, which has close ties with Malaysia's deputy prime minister and
finance minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim.
Analysts were pleased to see progress in the government's privatisation
programme.
They said that privatisations have been delayed by two to three months by
infighting between Mr Anwar and his influential predecessor, Tun Daim
Zainuddin.
However, some were concerned about the lack of any publicly available
blueprint for the capital's transport system, and questioned whether there
was any co-ordination among the private transport projects.
Shares in MRCB, which has a market capitalisation of MDollars 2.4bn, closed
the day 8 cents higher at MDollars 4.80 in moderate trading.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Wine industry with growing pains
 -One of Australia's top export sectors is coming of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Draw up a list of high-growth businesses in Australia, and the country's
wine export industry would be close to the top. But anyone who imagines that
this results in unfurrowed brows and bucolic relaxation in prime
wine-growing districts, such as South Australia's Barrossa Valley or New
South Wales's Hunter region, would be mistaken.
The industry is young - at least in international terms - and beset with
growing pains. It has ambitious growth targets, most notably a tripling of
export sales to about ADollars 1bn (USDollars 735m) by the turn of the
century.
But if the industry is to meet these objectives, it needs to achieve a sharp
expansion in grape supply and processing capacity, which requires investment
dollars.
This, in turn, has prompted a restructuring. On the one hand, several
Australian wine companies have headed to the stock market, bolstering their
capital through share issues and flotations. In just two years, a meaningful
quoted wine sector has been created, comprising nine companies and with a
total capitalisation (including Southcorp, which also has non-wine
interests) of ADollars 2bn.
On the other hand, there has been steady concentration within the industry
and a large amount of foreign investment. France's Pernod-Ricard, for
example, controls the Orlando Wyndham group, and Moet has a winery in
Victoria.
Few analysts think that these trends will abate.
'We foresee winery ownership and control of output . . . becoming
increasingly concentrated,' commented Ms Kiera Grant, at Hambros Equities,
in a recent industry review.
'A majority of the existing, small inefficient wineries will struggle to
return to a profit (and) will be replaced by larger, highly capitalised,
strongly integrated and highly technical companies, whose commercial focus
will be evenly divided between domestic and overseas markets,' the review
concluded.
This coming-of-age process can be traced back to the mid-1980s. Wine-growing
in Australia is almost as old as European settlement - the first grapevines
were planted in in 1788 - but it was only a decade ago that the industry
discovered the export market.
This happened almost by chance, at a time when Australian wineries were
looking to overload surplus stocks. The quality of the Australian produce,
its relative value (due in part to the then-sickly Australian dollar), and
some perceived problems within the European wineries, caused exports to
markets such as Scandinavia and the UK to take off - and they have increased
ever since. In 1985-86, Australian wine exports totalled 10.8m litres. By
1992-93, they had risen ten-fold, to 102.8m litres.
This sharp overseas growth has helped to offset a flat domestic market. Back
home, wine sales struggled to reach 312m litres in 1992-93, a slight
reduction on the 325m litres seen seven years earlier.
The downturn, more marked in per capita terms, has generally been attributed
to heightened drink-driving concerns and rising health awareness. A tendency
among Australian consumers to move upmarket, buying smaller quantities of
higher-quality wines, may have exacerbated the trend.
The bullish point for the wine companies is that this expansion in
non-domestic sales shows little sign of flattening out. In 1993, exports
increased 42 per cent in volume terms, to 124.8m litres, and by 36.5 per
cent in value, to ADollars 357.1m.
The UK and New Zealand were the strongest contributors to this growth,
although sales to the US and Canada also rose markedly. Japan, by contrast,
remains far less satisfactory: Australian wines are still dogged by an image
problem and the industry is rethinking its marketing approach.
Some wine makers warn that the disappointing 1993 vintage may lead to a
temporary dip in exports later this year, but say that the current year's
healthy results should then put the industry back on track.
If the ADollars 1bn export target is met, strong sales in the UK and North
America will probably need to be augmented by increased demand from
continental Europe.
That may be helped by a deal between Brussels and Canberra earlier this
year, in which Australia agreed to stop using European wine names - such as
Champagne or Chablis - provided the European Union recognised Australian
wine techniques.
However, even in the most promising markets, managing this growth looks
likely to be a delicate task. Australian wines tend to sell strongly in
lower price categories, as a good-value, workaday product.
This leaves the industry vulnerable to new competition and price pressures -
for example, too much appreciation in the Australian dollar.
That will make it doubly difficult to ensure that supply balances demand. It
has been estimated that if the ADollars 1bn export target is to be met by
the turn of the century, Australian wineries will have to produce an
additional 186m litres.
This would require about 250,000 tonnes of premium grapes, or about 14,000
hectares of additional planted land. Those plantings would need to occur in
the next three years, to ensure continuity of supply by 2000.
No one is complacent: 'I'm not relaxed, and there is a debate going on, but
it doesn't look too bad at the moment,' says Mr Paul Van Der Lee, at the
Winemakers Federation of Australia.
He points to recent statistics which show that the leading industry players
plan to plant more than 2,000 hectares in 1994, and almost 1,900 hectares in
1995.
Mr Van Der Lee also makes the point that if Australian wines can manage 'an
evolution towards the higher price segment', the ADollars 1bn target could
be met by an increase in export values, not just volume.
At least some of Australia's larger wine companies are in the throes of
heavy investment programmes which are partly designed to ensure that
reliance on grape supply contracts - that is, buying in the grapes from
independent growers - does not increase.
Mildura Blass, for example, is spending about ADollars 30m on new vineyard
development. Southcorp, which takes in the Penfolds and Lindemans labels and
sources about 40 per cent of its grape supply internally, has allocated
ADollars 100m over about four years to fund expansion. About ADollars 60m
will go on vineyards and the remainder on augmenting production facilities.
With plans like these, it seems that access to investors' funds can only
become more important - and that the quoted wine sector, like the industry,
is set to grow.

in the first half of this year raised a record amount, in spite of the slump
in US and international stock markets.
According to statistics compiled by the Bank of New York, 68 non-US
companies raised Dollars 8.6bn between January and June through offerings of
ADRs and GDRs, the dollar-denominated baskets of foreign company shares
which are held on deposit at US banks and sold to US investors. That
compares with the 27 issuers which raised Dollars 4.9bn in the first six
months of 1993.
European companies were leading issuers of depositary receipts with 23
offerings raising Dollars 4bn. Latin American companies raised Dollars
2.2bn, and Indian companies accounted for most of the Dollars 1.9bn raised
by Asian companies.
The Bank of New York, the leading US sponsor of foreign companies'
depositary receipt programmes, also said the volume of ADR and GDR trading
reached a record level in the first half of the year at 3.6bn shares.
The growth in the ADR market indicates that foreign companies do not believe
that this year's slump in stock markets worldwide has diminished US
investors appetite for foreign stocks. If anything, it is likely that the
poor performance of US share prices - this year the Dow Jones Industrial
Average registered consecutive quarterly declines for the first time since
1984 - persuaded more US investors unhappy with the returns on their
domestic holdings to buy foreign stocks.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital Equipment may sell
assets to Quantum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the struggling US computer company, is discussing the
sale of much of its storage business to Quantum, a fast-growing disk-drive
maker, as part of a radical restructuring Digital is expected to unveil
shortly.
Analysts said the sale, which might raise Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m,
could be just the first of several disposals by Digital as the company sheds
peripheral assets in an attempt to return to profitability.
Digital said yesterday that it was discussing the sale to Quantum of its
magnetic disk, DLT tape drive, solid-state disk drive and thin film heads
businesses. Its storage sub-systems and video and interactive information
services businesses were not part of the discussions.
The company does not have a large presence in disk drives, but it is a force
in the high capacity end of the market, while Quantum, based in Milpitas,
California, is a leading supplier of storage products at the low capacity,
personal computer segment.
Digital, which is based in Maynard, Massachusetts, made an unexpected
Dollars 183m loss in its latest quarter. It is expected shortly to announce
a restructuring plan involving the loss of up to 20,000 jobs, plant closures
and other asset sales.
Mr Robert Palmer, its chief executive, said yesterday that the Quantum
negotiations were part of its overall plan to return the company to
profitability as quickly as possible.
'This effort includes stringent cost controls, focus on those areas where we
can add unique value to our customers and continued staff and facility
reductions.'
He said the company was closely examining which businesses and areas of
technology it needed to supply directly to customers and which areas it made
sense to supply through strategic partners.
Analysts speculated that other assets up for sale could include the
company's software products and its consulting business.

Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to regain financial strength
after emerging from bankruptcy protection last November, yesterday announced
that its vice-chairman had quit.
Mr Robin Wilson, 57, is the second vice-chairman - and the fifth top
executive - to leave TWA this year.
An earlier one, Mr Glenn Zander, resigned in January, shortly after TWA had
announced that speculation about his departure was unfounded.
TWA has also lost a chairman, Mr William Howard, who lasted only a few
months before stepping aside; a senior vice-president for marketing, Mr
Robert Cozzi; and a chief financial officer, Mr Richard Shuyler, who quit
unexpectedly last month to join a small cargo airline without waiting for a
replacement to be named.
TWA last night said it had appointed Mr Mark Coleman, vice-president and
general manager of Avis Wizcom International, as its new senior
vice-president for marketing.
Mr Jeffrey Erickson, who joined TWA as president and chief operating officer
in April, said: 'We're pleased that the TWA team is coming together, and
we're getting the people we need to build TWA's future.'
Last week Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded its
rating on TWA's debt to triple-C, and revised its rating outlook from
developing to negative. It cited weaker-than-expected revenue generation and
the prospect of a risk to liquidity this winter.

Wellfleet Communications, the second-largest US manufacturer of computer
network routers, yesterday announced an agreed Dollars 1bn stock swap
takeover of SynOptics Communications, a leading supplier of intelligent
network hubs and switching systems. The deal is the latest example of
consolidation in the US networking industry.
Routers connects networks of computers, while a hub connects desktop
computers to a network.
The two described the deal as a 'merger of equals' between companies sharing
a common vision of open, standards-based network solutions. They claimed it
would position them to move customers to a new generation of
high-performance networks.
However, Wall Street took a mixed view, and Wellfleet's shares closed down
Dollars 5 3/16 at Dollars 20 1/16 . SynOptics, which rose an
unusually-strong 15.6 per cent on Friday, dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
14 5/8 .
Analysts questioned how easy it would be for the smaller, but fast-growing,
New England-based Wellfleet to combine with SynOptics, a California-based
former industry leader which has had several quarters of uninspiring
results.
Several of Wellfleet's rivals, including industry leader Cisco Systems, have
recently acquired switching and hub technology companies. However, the
businesses they bought were significantly smaller than them.
Under the deal, which the two companies hope to complete in October,
SynOptics shareholders will receive 0.725 of a share of Wellfleet stock for
each SynOptics share held. At yesterday's share prices, the deal values
SynOptics at around Dollars 1bn.
Mr Paul Severino, president of Wellfleet, will become chairman of the
combined group. Mr Andrew Ludwick, president and chief executive of
Syn-Optics, will take on the same titles at the new business. There will be
four additional members of the board, two from each company.
Mr Ludwick said the two companies had complementary technologies and
products, while their manufacturing, service and support systems, customer
base and channels were also compatible.
The companies said they intended to develop an end-to-end standards-based
architecture. The key to this would be jointly-developed new products which
combined both routing and switching technologies.

<TEXT>
Mercer International, a diversified Vancouver-based group, has bought
Germany's Zellstoff und Papierfabrik Rosenthal (ZPR), whose main asset is a
large pulp mill in Thuringia, eastern Germany.
The mill, upgraded in 1992 to produce chlorine-free sulphite pulp, has a
capacity of 160,000 tons a year. ZPR's sales were USDollars 54m last year.
Mercer will pay the Treuhand, the agency in charge of privatising businesses
in eastern Germany, a nominal price. It will provide a Dollars 12m loan to
ZPR, which has agreed to employ at least 350 people and spend Dollars 45m on
capital improvements over the next five years.
The outlays will be financed mainly by German government incentive
programmes.
As part of the privatisation agreement, the Treuhand and other German
agencies will also forgive ZPR's Dollars 76m debt, provide cash grants of
Dollars 43.7m, and pay Dollars 12m to indemnify the company from
environmental liabilities.
Mercer late last year bought six paper recycling plants in the Dresden area
from the Treuhand. The plants augment its used paper supplies with pulp from
the ZPR mill.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cimpor float raises Es39.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A public offering of 20 per cent of Cimpor, Portugal's largest cement
producer, was 4.8 per cent oversubscribed, officials said yesterday. The
privatisation on the Lisbon stock exchange raised Es39.61bn (Dollars 241m).
Employees and small savers bought 33 per cent of the 14m shares on offer, at
discounted prices of Es2,600 and Es2,700 respectively. The fixed price for
other investors was Es2,900. Foreign investors purchased 32 per cent of the
offer.
'The operation was a success for the government, considering the depressed
condition of the market,' said a Lisbon stockbroker. 'But an
oversubscription of only 4.8 per cent is not enough to create an active
after market in Cimpor shares.'
Lisbon market analysts said the interest from foreign investors was below
expectations. They attributed this partly to the gloomy climate of world
stock markets, and to the early pricing of the Cimpor offer.
'Since the price of the Cimpor operation was fixed two months ago, the
Portuguese market has fallen 15 per cent,' said a Lisbon dealer. 'Pricing
the offer two or three days before the sale would have ensured that the
price reflected market conditions.'
However, the government was successful in attracting small investors to the
first offering to embody its recently-revived policy of advancing 'popular
capitalism'. Its aim is to disperse the capital of privatised companies and
stimulate stock market activity.
Cimpor now has 14,138 private shareholders, of which 246 are foreign.
Employees own 0.94 per cent of the company's total capital, while small
investors hold 5.66 per cent.
A further 20 to 25 per cent is to be sold on foreign stock exchanges later
this year, followed by the privatisation of another 20 to 30 per cent in
Portugal in 1995.

<TEXT>
The value of new Canadian equity issued in North American markets in the
first half of this year was CDollars 12.37bn (USDollars 8.92bn), down 12.5
per cent from CDollars 13.95bn a year earlier, in spite of a surge in
initial public offers early in the year.
The decline was blamed mainly on the sharp fall-off in new preferred stock
issues, which dropped to CDollars 723m from CDollars 1.83bn a year earlier.
New equity issues reached a record CDollars 25.4bn in 1993, and 1994 started
out strongly, said the Financial Post DataGroup.
The first-quarter total was CDollars 7.5bn, but rising interest rates and a
faltering stock market led to a setback in the second quarter, for which the
total was CDollars 5.33bn.
IPOs were again the big factor during the first half of this year, led by a
CDollars 750m issue by Falconbridge, the nickel producer.
New issue activity is likely to remain slow until September, said Mr Fred
Ketchen, director of equity trading at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto.
'More volatile stock markets and higher interest rates tend to push
investors towards fixed-income investments, and we expect the second half to
trail the first half,' said Ms Rocca d'Angelo, economist with the Investment
Dealers' Association of Canada.

for bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In another blow to Japan's fragile banking sector, Nippon Mortgage, one of
the country's largest property-backed lenders, is to file for bankruptcy,
according to company sources.
It will be the third largest corporate collapse in Japanese post-war
history.
The company, whose largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Corporation, said yesterday it had endorsed the planned liquidation, has
been in difficulties since October 1991.
It has debts estimated at Y473bn (Dollars 4.78bn) in short and long-term
borrowings. A formal announcement of the lender's decision is expected by
the end of the week and the directors will file for voluntary liquidation by
September.
The company owes an estimated Y120.1bn to Sumitomo Trust, Y27.1bn to the
Industrial Bank of Japan, and Y25.3bn to the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
At March 31 it had assets of Y454.7bn, and liabilities of Y518.4bn. Some
estimates put its non-performing loans at 90 per cent of its total loan
book.
The bankruptcy is certain to send alarm bells ringing in the Japanese
banking system, already struggling with mounting bad debts. Nippon Mortgage
was set up by Sumitomo Trust and two property companies in 1982 to
specialise in property-related lending, an activity from which banks were
largely excluded by government regulations.
Many banks established similar mortgage companies in the 1980s to take
advantage of the surge in the country's property prices. Following the
collapse of the so-called 'bubble economy' at the end of the decade, most of
them have been left with enormous portfolios of non-performing loans.
Banks have been criticised for failing to write off or make sufficient
provisions for bad debts. In the year ended March, Sumitomo Trust made
provisions for bad loans of just Y80bn. Industry sources put its likely
write-off of loans to Nippon Mortgage at about Y90bn.
The Ministry of Finance said the company's performance had been carefully
monitored because of the high proportion of its loans that were known to be
non-performing. But Mr Atsushi Nagano, deputy director-general of the
ministry's banking bureau denied that the collapse would precipitate a
financial crisis since there were no individuals among its creditors.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mandarin Oriental may quit HK SE
 -The group will keep its Asian commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the Mandarin Oriental hotel group is likely this autumn to
decide to stop trading its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
In May, the group took over the management of the Ritz in London, its first
foray into Europe, and it is looking for other European hotels.
Mr Robert Riley, Mandarin Oriental managing director, insists that neither
of these moves suggested the group was planning to reduce its commitment to
Asia before China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997.
Mandarin Oriental's headquarters will remain in Hong Kong after 1997, he
says. While the group wants to expand in Europe and elsewhere, it expects
the bulk of its business to remain in Asia. Mr Riley says he is looking for
opportunities in China.
If, as seems probable, the group does delist its Hong Kong shares, it will
merely be following the lead of Jardine Matheson, which owns 51.5 per cent
of Mandarin Oriental.
Jardine announced in March it would cease trading its shares in Hong Kong at
the end of this year. It had been unable to persuade the Hong Kong
Securities and Futures Commission to give up its regulatory control, and
allow Jardine to be supervised by the authorities in Bermuda, where it is
incorporated.
Mandarin Oriental is also incorporated in Bermuda, and, like Jardine, has
its primary stock exchange listing in London.
Mr Riley says: 'Jardine's statement said that they are familiar with the
legislative process and tradition of Great Britain. We will have similar
considerations. That doesn't have any impact on our commitment to Hong Kong,
China and Asia.'
Nevertheless, the group, founded in Hong Kong in 1963, is energetically
expanding beyond its Asian base. It runs 10 hotels in Asia and one in San
Francisco; it will operate a luxury hotel being developed in Mexico City;
and the group would like other hotels in western European cities to
complement the Ritz.
Mr Riley says, however, that there are limits to how much the group wants to
expand outside Asia. It is not keen, for example, to run hotels in eastern
Europe, because these would be too difficult to manage from Hong Kong.
He says: 'We can tackle the emerging markets in Asia with more confidence
than those in eastern Europe.'
The group last year signed an agreement to help restore the Majapahit hotel,
a historic property in Surabaya, Indonesia, which it will run when it
reopens in 1995. It has also taken a 25 per cent interest in a new Mandarin
Oriental in Kuala Lumpur, which is expected to open in 1997.
Despite its experience of the region, however, the Asian market, apart from
Hong Kong, has not proved easy for Mandarin Oriental over the past few
years. Group pre-tax profits last year were USDollars 48m, slightly lower
than the 1992 figure of Dollars 48.1m and well down on the Dollars 61.4m the
group earned in 1989.
Hong Kong, where the group runs the Mandarin Oriental and the Excelsior,
enjoyed an increase in room rates and occupancy. The group's performance in
Hong Kong was boosted by an increase in visitors to the territory, while the
supply of rooms remained static.
But strong competition elsewhere in Asia resulted in occupancy falling in
Manila and Bangkok and although occupancy rose in Jakarta and Singapore,
room rates fell.
Mr Riley says that there are signs of European and Japanese visitors coming
back to Bangkok, although business has not returned to the level of four
years ago.
The market in Singapore also appears to have stabilised and visitor numbers
and likely to boosted by a new convention centre, which is due to opened
there next year.
In Jakarta and Manila, however, the group still faces stiff competition, he
says.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCH set to cut petrol unit stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) may sell 18 per cent of Cepsa, Spain's
second-ranked petrol refiner and distributor, as a means of underpinning
flagging banking profits.
BCH has hired J. P. Morgan, the US bank, as adviser to the sale which could
raise between Pta40bn and Pta45bn (Dollars 340m) in what would be the bank's
largest disposal so far of its wide spread of industrial interests.
As part of the deal, which would reduce BCH's shareholding in Cepsa to 20
per cent, the bank is seeking to retain the voting rights of the shares it
is selling in order to remain a controlling shareholder in Cepsa.
Cepsa, which has a 25 per cent share of the domestic petrol market, has
traditionally been the most important single element in BCH's industrial
portfolio.
BCH said yesterday that three options were under consideration:
to issue Cepsa warrants to outside investors;
to create a portfolio company, controlled by BCH, which would buy 18 per
cent of Cepsa from the bank;
to enlist an investor group, willing to waive its voting rights, as a large
Cepsa shareholder.
The disposal under any of the three procedures would be conducted with the
approval of Elf Aquitaine, the French energy group which has a 30 per cent
stake in Cepsa and a 2 per cent holding in BCH. It is understood that Elf
does not want to increase its equity in Cepsa.
BCH's initiative will be welcomed by analysts in Madrid who have
consistently called on the bank to switch funds away from industrial assets
and into mainstream banking to improve bank profit margins.
This year BCH reduced its stake in Aumar, a toll motorway operator, from
more than 60 per cent to 51 per cent via a global share offering.
If BCH succeeds in disposing of part of its Cepsa stake while retaining
control over the refiner, it is likely that the bank will move on to
consider further equity sales, notably at Vallehermoso, a property company;
Dragados, a construction group; and at Azucarera, a sugar company.
BCH's chief concern is the disappointing performance of its banking
operations where greater liquidity is required in order to lift earn-ings.
The bank recently appointed a new chief executive, Mr Angel Corcostegui. Mr
Corcostegui was a former top executive at rival bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Universale-Bau, the troubled Austrian construction group, has reported a
Sch607m (Dollars 54.07m) loss for 1993 as a result of heavy losses by
operations in eastern Germany and Hungary.
No dividend is being paid in respect of 1993, compared with a 20 per cent
payment for 1992.
The loss, which compares with a profit of Sch55m in 1992, was largely
covered by liquidating reserves of Sch605m. Revenues rose to Sch7.4bn from
Sch7.1bn.
Universale, 64 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein, sacked its chief
executive, Mr Josef Vlcek, and two other directors in January following the
deterioration of its activities in eastern Germany and Hungary.
Operating profits fell last year to Sch15m from Sch103m in 1992. Mr Reinhold
Sussenbacher, the new chief executive, said activities in Austria made a
small operating profit.
Mr Sussenbacher has forecast that the group would break even in the current
year, although the Hungarian and German operations would remain in loss. He
said the group could see a turnround in these operations and would not
withdraw.

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Topdanmark, the Danish insurance and finance services group, expects to slip
back into the red this year with a loss approaching DKr200m (Dollars
31.93m). It returned to profit in 1993 following two years of losses.
The latest loss has been caused by provisions totalling DKr253 made by a new
management team brought in last spring.
The provisions cover losses at Aktivbank, the group's German banking
subsidiary, and property losses in the US, said Mr Kaj G. Schou, chief
executive.
The group has also suffered this year from falling bond and share prices. Mr
Schou said the group would make a profit in the second half - of between
DKr75m and DKr125m - but there would be loss of almost DKr200m for the full
year.
Topdanmark made a profit of DKr53m in 1993. Its losses in 1992 were DKr107m.
Topdanmark is part of Eureko, the European insurance alliance including
Friends Provident of the UK, AVCB of the Netherlands, Wasa of Sweden and
Ocidental of Portugal. Eureko holds a 32 per cent stake in Topdanmark.
The group's poor performance for several years dates back to the acquisition
of Aktivbanken, a Danish regional bank, in 1989. The main Danish assets of
Aktivbanken were sold to Sydbanken in May.
The acquisition cost Topdanmark DKr1.4bn, and the bank then went on to lose
DKr581m in the next four years. This has left the group with a funding
problem. It has some DKr1.5bn in loans which have to be renewed in 1995 and
1996.

FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Success for Italian investors in
Ina sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All 418,000 Italian private investors who applied for shares in Ina, the
former state-owned insurance company, will receive some or all of the shares
they asked for, making it the first Italian privatisation not to leave at
least some prospective small shareholders empty-handed.
The shares will begin trading today in Milan, London and New York, and the
scale of market activity - and whether the shares rise to a premium over the
L2,400 offer price - is likely to be taken as a gauge of the success of the
issue.
The sale is the largest Italian privatisation to date, and one of the
biggest in Europe in the past three years.
Advisers yesterday played down the fact that the offer was not as heavily
subscribed as previous Italian privatisations. They pointed out that it was
the second most popular Italian sell-off in terms of the number of public
applications, and was much bigger than previous sales of stakes in financial
institutions Credito Italiano, Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and IMI.
If the Italian treasury, which formerly owned 100 per cent of Ina, later
decides to release 260m additional shares held in reserve to meet additional
demand, then the sale will raise more than L5,000bn to help reduce Italy's
public debt. The sale of these shares to underwriters would bring to 53.5
per cent the stake sold by the government, against the 51 per cent
originally promised to the market.
Public demand for the Ina shares was probably affected by the treasury's
rash declarations at the end of the first day of last week's offer that the
issue was 'sold out', a move which is thought to have deterred applicants.
Recent stock market turbulence may also have helped to dampen demand.
BCI, privatised earlier this year, was particularly popular, with nearly 1m
applications from the public, of which less than 200,000 were rewarded with
shares.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sims Food Group saw its shares leap 13p to 84p yesterday after the Milton
Keynes-based integrated meat group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds
103,000 for the year to March 31.
This compared with a Pounds 586,000 loss last time, which was after
exceptional charges of Pounds 6.6m, of which Pounds 3.1m related to asset
write-downs and Pounds 3.5m to restructuring provisions, largely in the
retail division.
In line with its strategy to reduce its involvement in the commodity
wholesale side of the industry, turnover fell by 2 per cent to Pounds
306.4m. After adjusting for the timing of acquisitions, which contributed
Pounds 18.4m, and disposals, which accounted for Pounds 34.4m (Pounds
39.4m), the underlying fall was 6 per cent.
The recommended final dividend of 5.5p makes an unchanged total of 7.5p,
which is uncovered and payable from reserves. There were nil earnings per
share, against 5p losses.

<TEXT>
Associated Nursing Services' nil-paid rights shares fell 1 1/2 p to a low of
3 1/2 p yesterday as the nursing homes operator announced figures for the
year to March 31, writes David Wighton.
Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.58m), slightly ahead of
the estimate that accompanied the Pounds 10m rights issue last month.
Turnover rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.9m).
The existing shares have fallen back to the rights issue price of 255p and
were unchanged on the figures.
The issue, which closes on July 19, was fully underwritten by Henry
Ansbacher.
Dr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said occupancy rates recovered quickly
from the disruption caused by the implementation of Care in the Community
with owned homes averaging 93 per cent last year and now running at 94 per
cent.
The joint venture homes, where a number of extensions were built during the
year, averaged 90 per cent.
The homes division increased operating profits by 17 per cent to Pounds
3.95m with average fees rising by 3.5 per cent.
A final dividend of 1.5p is recommended, making a total of 2p (1p), payable
from earnings of 17.5p (14.3p) per share.
The rights issue cash will be used to fund the group's continued expansion
beyond this year although it intends that most of its new homes will be
developed with existing and new joint venture partners.
The group plans to move from the USM to the main market later this month.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: UK side behind Vibroplant advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helped by improved UK trading conditions in the first half which were
sustained in the second six months, Vibroplant, the specialist plant hire
group, lifted pre-tax profits by 47 per cent from a depressed Pounds 1.9m to
Pounds 2.8m in the year to March 31.
Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, pointed out that with turnover only
marginally ahead at Pounds 71.1m (Pounds 69.9m), the result was achieved
through better utilisation of a smaller rental fleet.
On the basis of the improved performance and with the prospect of further
progress this year, the recommended final dividend is restored to the 1992
level of 2.38p (1.28p) making a total of 3.6p (2.5p). Earnings per share
were 3.78p (2.66p).
In the UK, pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 1.29m) on turnover
up 3 per cent to Pounds 35.8m. The most marked improvement came in the
second half where revenues grew by more than 7 per cent.
Mr Pilkington said that while future prospects depended on the resumption of
real growth in construction output, 'the outlook is now more encouraging
than it has been for several years'.
The US, however, remained a problematic market for the group and pre-tax
profits fell to Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 608,000) after making a Pounds 200,000
provision this time to cover the possible outcome of a lawsuit. Translated
turnover was unchanged at Pounds 35.1m, but dollar revenues declined by 10
per cent to Dollars 52.8m because of both reduced machine sales activity and
a reduction in the size of the rental fleet.
However, Mr Pilkington predicted that with the benefit of a growing US
economy 'we can look forward to a period of steady improvement in the
performance of our US operations'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Riding along on the crest of the waves -
Charles Batchelor on Stena Sealink's investment in Pounds 63m high speed
catamarans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British holidaymakers gearing up for their trips abroad are being offered
two main choices by the marketing men: a fast no-frills journey through the
Channel tunnel - when it opens for passenger traffic - or a slower, more
relaxing crossing by ferry.
There are other, less heavily promoted, options: hovercraft, which have
never caught on because of the noise and spray, or small Hoverspeed
catamarans popular with day trippers.
Next year, travellers will have another choice, with the arrival of large
high speed catamarans - twin or triple hulled vessels which can travel twice
as fast as conventional ferries - on short sea routes around the UK.
Earlier this month Stena Sealink announced it had commissioned three
catamarans, each capable of carrying 1,500 passengers and 375 cars - five
times the capacity of the largest 'cat' currently in service.
The new Pounds 63m vessels, which are being built in Finland, are longer
than a football pitch and nearly as wide.
Sea Containers, owner of Hoverspeed and the largest operator of catamarans,
has also ordered a new generation of Super SeaCats more than twice the size
of its existing vessels.
The new SeaCats, which are due to come into service in 1995, will be able to
carry 600 passengers and 180 cars.
Catamarans have been in commercial service in British waters since the late
1980s, but the early vessels were unstable in choppy seas and made
travellers sea-sick.
These problems have diminished as the cats have grown larger and the
designers have developed techniques for stabilising them in rough seas.
The limited capacity of the earlier vessels restricted the routes on which
they could be used, although their ability to travel at up to 40 knots
(46mph) meant they could make more frequent journeys.
The rapid expansion of demand for cross-Channel sailings during the late
1980s and early 1990s persuaded the ferry operators that they needed to
increase capacity.
They were faced with a choice between ordering superferries capable of
carrying up to 1,800 passengers or the relatively small catamarans then
available.
The ferry companies were not convinced that speed was a sufficiently strong
selling point to justify the higher prices they would have to charge.
P&amp;O European Ferries, which claims the largest share of the cross-Channel
market, has yet to be persuaded of the advantages of catamarans. The company
has had study teams looking at them for many years, but remains unconvinced
about their reliability.
The opening of the Channel tunnel, which is being marketed primarily on the
speed of its service, finally persuaded the ferry operators that they should
consider cats seriously.
Stena Sealink concluded that the only advantage the tunnel could claim was
speed; supercats, it decided, could match it for speed but still offer all
the facilities of a superferry.
Unlike the ferries, catamarans provide an airline style service with
guaranteed seats arranged in rows in a single main cabin. The height of the
vessel and the the distance of the passenger cabin from the engines provides
a smooth ride, in stark contrast to the noise and spray which limited the
popularity of the hovercraft.
The first catamarans to come into service were passenger only, but they have
been superseded by car-carrying vessels.
'We decided the future lay in car-carriers rather than passenger-only
vessels,' said Mr Sam Spindlow, marketing manager of Condor, which operates
a catamaran service between the Channel Islands and the mainland.
The next stage for catamarans is to progress from carrying cars to carrying
trucks and coaches.
When the first of Stena Sealink's new supercats comes into service on the
Holyhead-Dun Laoghaire route across the Irish Sea in the spring of 1995 it
will be capable of carrying up to 50 trucks, trailers or coaches as well as
cars and their passengers.
Carrying freight means the operator can earn a steady revenue from his
vessels all year round instead of just being dependent on the tourist
traffic in the peak summer months.
Unlike Stena Sealink, Sea Containers has no plans to carry freight on its
catamarans. The company is still waiting for proof that the freight market
will pay a premium to make fairly small time savings on the short sea
routes. Unloading trucks and trailers also makes for longer turn-round times
in port. Sea Containers operates its small Hoverspeed catamarans on the
Folkestone-Boulogne route, popular with day trippers; between Belfast and
Stranraer; and, on charter, between the Isle of Man and the mainland.
Outside the UK it operates catamarans between Gothenburg and Frederikshavn
and across the River Plate between Argentina and Uruguay. It recently
chartered a vessel for use in the Arabian Gulf.
Demand for catamarans around the world exceeds supply, said Mr James
Sherwood, chairman of Sea Containers. The company is looking at several new
routes, including one between mainland Venezuela and the holiday destination
Isla Margarita.
The initial response of the operators of traditional ferries to the
introduction of catamarans was to cut their prices sharply, said Mr
Sherwood. He expects that as the catamarans become more established this
fierce price competition should ease.
With the Channel tunnel gradually building up its capacity this may prove a
forlorn hope on the cross-Channel routes. But whatever the outcome the high
speed catamaran is here to stay.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: PhoneLink in red as product costs bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PhoneLink, the USM-quoted electronic information company, yesterday blamed
start-up costs of its Tel-Me network for pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.76m in
the year to March 31.
The company said the losses - against a Pounds 30,000 profit last time  -
were less than expected for a system which, it claims, will deliver
on-screen information more rapidly than any other on the market.
Mr John Lyon, chief operating officer, expressed confidence that Tel-Me
would emerge as the company's flagship product and overtake profits
generated by DataCare, its telephone directory service for database users.
Although DataCare generated gross profits of Pounds 746,000 (Pounds 608,000)
and underpinned a 35 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds
922,000), Mr Lyon said PhoneLink was concentrating its efforts on marketing
Tel-Me to some 400,000 small businesses.
The system, launched in May following a 2 1/2 year development, offers a
wide range of on-screen information. 'Tel-Me is now in place and we've moved
from being a technology company to being a service supplier,' said Mr Lyon.
The service has been sold to a number of large corporations including South
Western Electricity and Guardian, the insurance group, and some 60 computer
dealers have agreed to sell the system. The company has also persuaded IBM
to install the necessary software in its personal computer products and help
market it.
Costs, meanwhile, have been contained by the decision to shelve plans to
relocate from its Prenton plant near Liverpool, saving more than Pounds 1m.
Mr Lyon warned, however, that developments costs were likely to exceed
Pounds 3m before the system began to generate profits.
Until then, the company said it would continue to draw on cash reserves of
Pounds 7.3m left over from its flotation in May last year.
Losses per share came out at 5p, against earnings of 0.1p.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: St James Beach rises to Pounds 1.67m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first set of results since gaining a full listing in April, St James
Beach Hotels, which operates in the Caribbean, beat its prospectus with a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.67m for the year to March 31, against a forecast
Pounds 1.64m.
The company, which has changed its year end from September 30, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.92m for the six months to March 31. The annual
profit for the year to September 30 1993 was Pounds 254,000.
Earnings per share came out at 12.11p (2.15p) or 8.22p fully diluted, also
ahead of forecast.
Turnover rose to Pounds 8.85m (Pounds 7.51m), with room occupancy rates 18.2
per cent ahead on the comparable 12 month period. In the last three months
of the financial year occupancy rates rose to 79 per cent (53 per cent).
The company has completed the Pounds 2.6m acquisition of the Barbados Beach
Village hotel since the year end. This has been renamed the Crystal Cove and
closed for refurbishment, in a programme which will add Pounds 2m to the
company's capital expenditure for next year.
Negotiations are in progress for the purchase of a warehouse and office in
Barbados for Pounds 1.1m to provide the company with a new headquarters.
In line with the dividend policy stated in the prospectus, the group is
planning a first interim in respect of the period to September 30 1994.
The shares closed down 2p at 126p against an initial placing price of 120p.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Second quarter lift helps Torex recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Torex Hire jumped 5p to 54p yesterday after the USM-quoted group
said that improved trading in the second quarter helped produce a turnround
from a Pounds 139,000 loss to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 123,000 for the six
months to April 30.
Turnover of the group, which hires out tools, small plant and catering
equipment, increased from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.48m. Earnings per share
were 0.9p (0.99p losses) and an interim dividend of of 0.3p (nil) is
declared.
Mr Benjamin Longrigg, chairman, said the group's diversification into other
activities had proved successful. Results for the first two months of the
second half were ahead of last year and continued growth was expected for
the full year.
Mr Longrigg said Torex saw a definite improvement in all aspects of
construction activity from last year's 'very low levels.' Turnover in the
division rose 28 per cent to Pounds 1.8m.
Catering activities grew steadily throughout the recession and this growth
had accelerated with better conditions, he added.
The temporary toilet service had expanded rapidly while the fire protection
business continued to grow.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Court Cavendish shows advance to
Pounds 3.09m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator which came to the market last
July, saw pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 194,000 to Pounds 3.09m during in
the year to April 30 before exceptional costs of Pounds 600,000.
Operating profits from existing homes were down 16 per cent at Pounds 2.33m
due largely to a fall in occupancy following the introduction of the
Community Care Act.
But Dr Chai Patel, executive chairman, said this was only a temporary
effect. 'Occupancy was down a bit to 91 per cent in the first half but
picked up to 93.6 per cent in the second and for the first two months of
this year is well over 94 per cent.' He believes it is sustainable at this
level, which is above the company's historic average.
Some other nursing home operators believe that Community Care will mean
permanently lower occupancy for them. But Dr Patel said Court Cavendish has
been less affected because almost 60 per cent of its customers are self-pay
and its local authority work is biased towards specialist care which
commands premium prices.
Its average fee rates from continuing operations increased by 4.5 per cent
with private care fees up 6.3 per cent. Existing homes showed a 2.4 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 13.9m with homes acquired during the year
contributing Pounds 2.85m. The contribution to operating profit from
acquisitions was Pounds 876,000, increasing the group total to Pounds 3.21m
(Pounds 2.78m).
The group spent Pounds 13.5m buying further homes in the year increasing the
number of owned beds from 658 to 1,200. Dr Patel said the group was on
course to add a similar number this year.
The flotation proceeds of Pounds 38.6m cut the interest bill from Pounds
2.63m to Pounds 144,000.
Earnings, excluding exceptional items, rose from 4.2p to 15p; a final
dividend of 2.65p brings the total to 4p.
The shares added 1p to 215p, compared with the flotation price of 225p.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Thorn poised to offload defence side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI, the music and electronics rental company, is discussing the sale
of its remaining defence businesses with potential buyers.
Racal Electronics is thought to be the most likely buyer, but GEC has also
recently re-entered discussions. GEC withdrew from talks last year after due
diligence enquires had been conducted because a mutually acceptable price
could not be negotiated.
The businesses primarily manufacture radar, electronic warfare and
electronic command systems. Turnover last year was about Pounds 115m. Most
of the operations are based at Crawley, West Sussex.
GEC is thought to be interested because there is a good fit between Thorn's
business and its own electronic warfare operations.
The Ministry of Defence may be concerned about the threat to national
security if the business were sold overseas, though Thorn said it had no
reason to believe that the MoD had placed unusual constraints on the sale.
The current talks follow Thorn's agreement in principle to sell its defence
electro-optical and missile-fusing interests to Thomson of France at the end
of last month. Those businesses have turnover of about Pounds 80m.

Group Development Capital Trust has received alternative proposals for its
winding-down.
In May, the directors announced plans for shareholders to 'realise their
investment for a sum approximating to asset value' through a repayment of
capital and the sale of certain unquoted investments.
New proposals, which could, according to the directors, 'provide a more
attractive alternative' include arrangements for holders to dispose of their
investment on an adjusted formula asset value basis giving a value in line
with the current share price.

Schroders has raised Pounds 125m with its new Japanese investment trust.
Late applications for larger numbers of shares in the public offer are to be
scaled back, as the offer was oversubscribed by Pounds 2.8m, writes Bethan
Hutton.
Of the total, Pounds 88m was raised from an institutional placing, while
applications for Pounds 39.8m were received in the public offer.
Mr Philip Middleton of Smith New Court, sponsors of the issue, said that the
bulk of applications in the public offer were for small lots of shares.
Investors who applied for up to 5,000 shares at 100p will receive the full
amount. Only applications for more than 5,000 shares received after June 17
will be scaled back, by between 10 per cent and 26 per cent.
Mr Jeremy Hill, chairman, said: 'We are delighted with the level of interest
shown in the Schroder Japan Growth Fund, particularly given recent market
turbulence.'
Separate dealings in the shares and warrants, which were attached on a
1-for-5 basis, are due to start on July 11.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Difficult trading for Budgens as profits
decline to Pounds 5.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budgens, the small retailing chain which is being backed by Rewe's, one of
Germany's largest food chains, said trading conditions proved very
difficult, particularly in the first quarter of this year, writes Andrew
Bolger.
The group, which warned in April that opening discount stores had proved
more expensive than anticipated, said pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.2m
to Pounds 5.4m in the year to May 1.
Sales dipped to Pounds 298m (Pounds 301m).
Budgens said that in line with other food retailers it experienced
year-on-year price deflation and in its case this was about 3 per cent.
Budgens converted nine existing stores to Rewe's Penny Market discount store
format. The German group last year took a 29 per cent stake and has an
option to raise this to 47 per cent next September, which would require a
full bid.
Conversion costs and operating losses in the first year had an adverse
effect upon profits, although these costs were offset by the profit
generated from the sale and leaseback of a second warehouse adjacent to its
main operations in Wellingborough, Northants.
Budgens plans to open a further 30 discount stores in the south-east over
the next two years, although most of them are likely to open in 1995-96.
The retail format at the existing Budgens' stores has been re-focused to
concentrate on fresh food at competitive prices. The group said the Penny
Market stores were experiencing encouraging sales trends.
Earnings per share fell to 2.8p (3.4p). A final dividend of 0.7p maintains
the total at 1p.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birkby turns in threefold gain to Pounds
3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birkby, the space management and hire purchase company, announced pre-tax
profits up threefold to Pounds 3.3m for the year to March 31, and said that
all divisions were experiencing record sales for the first 13 weeks of the
year.
The company completed the Pounds 58.7m purchase of In-Shops in March, and
management said that occupancy levels had already improved from 78 per cent
to 82 per cent on In Shops' retail management portfolio.
In addition, Mr Bill Cran, chief executive, said In-Shops should achieve
administrative cost savings of Pounds 1.4m a year, of which up to Pounds 1m
would come through during the current year.
Following the acquisition, Birkby has emerged as a Pounds 118m capitalised
company focusing on the provision of premises, credit and services for small
businesses or retailers.
Turnover for the year increased 26 per cent to Pounds 14.7m, aided by
contributions from Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle leasing company
acquired in July, and In Shops.
The space management operations saw occupancy rise to 94 per cent, and
pre-tax profit from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 809,000. Every
1 per cent increase in occupancy from In Shops means another Pounds 260,000
of income.
The vehicle hire business, which started with the rationale of offering
services to tenants, contributed Pounds 1.8m, of which about Pounds 1.6m
came from Hill Hire.
Profits were held back by a Pounds 525,000 loss - primarily the write-off of
goodwill - on the sale of businesses from Finlan, which was taken over by
Birkby in August 1992.
Birkby's gearing has fallen from 46 per cent to 41 per cent.
Earnings per share improved from 11.1p to 11.8p. A recommended final
dividend of 4.8p makes a total 6p, an increase of 70 per cent.
COMMENT
Birkby has delivered all its promises so far, and the company is promising a
lot more. It has carried the costs of the In Shops acquisition, and has
already improved earnings potential. With full year contributions from In
Shops and Hill Hire this year, profits could reach Pounds 8.6m, putting the
shares on a p/e of 15. It is a cyclical business with little asset backing,
and the outlook could change from a likely increase in competition and
rental pressure on leased properties. But Birkby has found a good formula
and the current rating seems justified.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Industrial fan integration lifts Howden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Howden Group rose by 4p to 88p yesterday after the Glasgow-based
engineering company reported a 49 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 27.6m.
The pre-tax figure, for the year to April 30, included a one-off gain of
Pounds 1.38m from the sale of a property in Hong Kong. Turnover rose from
Pounds 335.1m to Pounds 373.4m.
Howden said profits had improved partly because of the successful
integration of two industrial fan companies bought last year for a total of
Pounds 40m - Novenco in Denmark and Buffalo Forge in the US.
The subsequent rationalisation programme involved the closing of 900,000 sq
ft of manufacturing capacity in the US, Canada and UK and a reduction in the
combined workforce of about 750 employees.
Mr Johnny Johnsen, chief executive, said the restructuring had yielded
annual cost savings of about Pounds 18m. The result was that the formerly
lossmaking North American fan operations, and the lossmaking activities of
Novenco in Europe, were now in the black.
Order intake was Pounds 389m, an increase of 46 per cent. The highlight was
the Pounds 27m tunnel boring machine order won by Wirth, Howden's German
subsidiary, for a road tunnel in Taiwan.
Wirth incurred a loss of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m because of low orders last
year and the cost of a rationalisation programme to reduce its workforce by
250 to 500, which will be completed during the current first half. The group
said these savings, plus the impact of the Taiwan order, should contribute
to an improved performance in 1995.
In the UK James Howden improved profitability and won orders for tunnel
boring machines for the Brighton flood alleviation scheme and the Heathrow
express line.
Mr John Jackson, chairman, said the international spread of Howden's
businesses has enabled the group to weather the worst effects of the
recession and would bring further reward as the economic recovery developed.
Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 6.7p (6p). A final dividend
of 1.61p gives a total for the year of 2.43p, an increase of 10.5 per cent.
COMMENT
Howden's strategy of reducing its exposure to contracting and construction
is paying off, with the successful integration of the fans business offering
scope for further margin improvement - particularly in the US. Forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of
11. That 14 per cent discount to the market is partly because memories still
linger of the group's disastrous Danish tunnelling contract, which caused
the share price to plummet and nearly wiped out group profits in 1990-91.
The shares should be uprated from their current level in the medium term, as
the market learns to view the group as an engineering stock, which should
benefit from later-cycle investment.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ICI makes Dollars 300m Taiwan expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI is planning to spend about Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m) on more than
doubling the size of a chemicals plant in Taiwan.
The scheme takes to over Dollars 600m the investment ICI has earmarked for
increasing its capacity in terephthalic acid, a raw material used in
polyester manufacture.
Four weeks ago, ICI said it was planning to built a plant in Pakistan.
The new Taiwanese plant, ICI's second at the Kuan Yin site, would be able to
produce 450,000 tonnes of TPA a year.
The existing 350,000 tonnes a year plant opened in 1992 and it currently
being expanded to 400,000 tonnes.
ICI said that the TPA market 'continues to surge'.
World TPA demand had grown by 14 per cent a year since 1980 and even faster
in Taiwan. Demand was 'capacity constrained' and prices 'were rising'.
The new plant would use a proprietary technology to create 'the world's
lowest cost production unit in terms of both capital and production costs,'
said Mr David Hewitt, ICI's international TPA business manager.
The plans, as with those for Pakistan, are subject to ICI board approval.
If given the go-ahead, the second Kuan Yin plant should come on stream in
1997. The two Asian sites would then account for half ICI's world capacity
in TPA.
ICI denied the TPA investments signified a return to commodity chemicals.
The company has been reorganising itself in recent years to concentrate on
fewer areas in which it can add significant value and had a strong
technological position.
It said its proprietary manufacturing methods give it a technological
advantage over competitors. ICI is the second biggest producer of the
material in the world after Amoco, the US oil company.
Asia is a popular location for investments to supply the fibres industry
because of the strength and size of local customers.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing rises 32%

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling Publishing Group, which specialises in international business
reference books and magazines, increased pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to
Pounds 7m in the year to March 31.
Sales rose from Pounds 42m to Pounds 52m. The group's principal division,
which publishes international business reference books and quarterly
magazines, increased operating profits to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 4.9m).
Sterling introduced a record 23 new publications to its range during the
year, and in total published 70 individual titles. Two new titles launched
were Who's Who in the Former Soviet Union and Who's Who in Central and
Eastern Europe.
Sterling said Turret, its trade magazine publisher and exhibition organiser,
had a satisfactory year in competitive market conditions, with operating
profits up to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.2m).
Mr Roger Harrison, chairman, said future prospects were bright, with forward
sales for all activities showing healthy increases.
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 10p (7.8p). A final dividend of
2.9p raises the total to 3.6p (3p).

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: European Motor plans takeover after rise to
Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Motor Holdings, the motor retail and services group, revealed
yesterday that it was in detailed discussions which could lead to 'a
significant acquisition'.
Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive of the group - which reported a 50 per
cent increase in full year profits - added that if the acquisition proceeded
the board planned to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of new funds
through a rights issue.
Mr Palmer said an announcement could be made later this month and added that
if the deal goes ahead it would not dilute earnings.
Despite this assurance the shares closed 11p lower at 123p.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 5.15m in the year to March 31, up from
Pounds 3.44m last time. Turnover expanded by 35 per cent to Pounds 157.5m
(Pounds 117.1m).
The motor retail division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.4m to
Pounds 3.1m. The motor services division boosted its pre-tax contribution to
Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.6m).
Operating profits increased from Pounds 4.43m to Pounds 5.6m.
Mr Palmer said used car trading was satisfactory, although difficult
conditions were experienced in the second half of the year.
After sales operations, including bodyshops, which accounted for 67 per cent
of divisional profits, performed well.
In the motor services division Wilcomatic, the vehicle washing equipment
company, lifted operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.6m)
on turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 15.3m. The improvement in margin
reflected greater efficiencies.
A final dividend of 2.525p is recommended, making a total for the year 21
per cent ahead at 4.25p (3.5p).
Earnings per share increased by 32 per cent from 7.3p to 9.6p.
COMMENT
The announcement that European Motor is close to finalising another purchase
should come as no surprise. The group's last acquisitions (Mill Garages and
Wilcomatic) were made two years ago and the group now wants to mix organic
growth with expansion through the acquisition of underperforming businesses
in its core areas. As the latest results confirm, management has a solid
track record for squeezing more profit out of its operations. Pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 6m look possible this year, producing earnings of
just under 11p. After yesterday's fall the shares are trading on a
reasonable multiple of 11.2.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank of Scotland expands in United
States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday announced a further expansion of Citizens
Financial Group, its fast-growing US retail banking subsidiary, through
acquiring the business of the failed Old Stone Federal Savings Bank, which
is based in Rhode Island.
The bank said that Citizens had been negotiating with the Resolution Trust
Corporation, an American government agency, to acquire the 28 branches,
USDollars 1.1bn deposits, and selected loans of Old Stone, which was placed
in receivership in January last year.
The bid has been accepted, but the bank is not allowed by the RTC to
disclose the price until the completion of the deal which is expected to be
within the next week or so.
The acquisition of Old Stone, the fourth largest bank in Rhode Island, is
the fifth Royal Bank has made within the past year,and the eighth since it
acquired Citizens in 1988.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said the purchase was in
line with the aim of gaining market share in southern New England.
Royal Bank said that after concluding the Old Stone deal, Citizens was
expected to grow to about USDollars 10bn, making it one of the 60 largest US
banking groups.

Shani Group, the USM-traded fashion wear company, reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.71m for the nine month period to April 30 1994.
The group is changing its year-end to October 31 reflecting the seasonal
nature of LAS, the women's coat and suit business; comparisons cover the six
months to end-January 1993.
The outcome, up from Pounds 1.34m last time, was achieved on turnover ahead
from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 16m.
Mr Martin Hollis, chairman, said the second period of the 15-month year had
started well with turnover continuing to increase on a like-for-like basis.
The interim dividend goes up 67 per cent, from 1.8p to 3p, payable from
earnings ahead to 8p (6.3p) per share.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cellnet lifts Securicor to Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securicor Group, the communications, security and parcels business,
yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 37m, following a sharply improved performance by Cellnet, its 40 per
cent owned mobile phone network.
The telephone company saw profits rise from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 26.9m as
its subscriber base expanded by 55 per cent to 1.15m customers.
Its contribution lifted profits at Security Services, the Securicor
subsidiary where most of the group's operating companies are held, by 33 per
cent to Pounds 26.8m in the six months to March 31.
While hailing the contribution of Cellnet and predicting rising demand by
customers, the company yesterday hinted at a shift in strategy to reduce its
dependence on the phone network.
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said likely initiatives could include
head-on competition with Parcelforce and service contracts with Royal Mail
Letters if the Post Office was privatised.
'The privatisation offers the prospect of enhancing profits of our parcels
business,' he said.
Profits in the parcels division increased 37 per cent to Pounds 4.9m on
increased turnover of Pounds 152.7m (Pounds 123.7m).
The security division, meanwhile, has placed tenders to build and operate
two new prisons and is seeking further custodial contracts.
Such measures follow Securicor's success last year in winning a Pounds 96m
contract to escort 250,000 prisoners a year for London's Metropolitan Court
Escort and Custody Service.
It saw profits increase from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 5.02m on turnover ahead
at Pounds 147.4m (Pounds 143.6m).
The business services division saw profits increase from Pounds 164,000 to
Pounds 893,000, although the finance and insurance business saw profits
decline from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 1.7m.
Nevertheless, the strong contribution from Cellnet enabled the company to
declare an increased interim dividend of 0.805p (0.732p) for the group and
1.686p (1.533p) for Security Services.
Earnings per share rose to 18.6p (14p) and 17.4p (12.2p) respectively.
The result prompted a 30p rise in Securicor Group shares to 1210p, while
Securicor A shares - the most heavily traded - closed up 5p at 825p.
COMMENT
Securicor may be keen to reduce its reliance on Cellnet, but it is by no
means ready to sever its lucrative relationship with the high-earning
network. Mr Wiggs yesterday admitted that its holding remained an investment
and serious offers would be considered. But likely bidders have so far been
deterred by the high price Securicor would demand for a business which is
the engine room of its own profitability. So although the group is giving
greater attention to its managed businesses, its reluctance to relinquish
its grasp on Cellnet has reassured analysts and persuaded them to increase
year end profit forecasts to up to Pounds 84m, which on a forward multiple
of 20 makes the group an attractive long-term, if expensive, option.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Betterware shares hit by 8% fall in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Betterware fell by 7p to 97p yesterday after the direct
home-shopping group revealed that first-quarter UK sales were 8 per cent
lower than a year earlier.
The fall reflected teething problems associated with the opening of a new
distribution centre and consumer uncertainty.
The decline follows a warning in May when Betterware announced its full year
results. That warning prompted the shares to fall by 5p to 123p.
Yesterday Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, told the annual meeting that the
trend in the second quarter was improving with growth about 1 per cent
higher. Overall sales for the first 18 weeks were down 6 per cent on a
like-for-like basis.
Mr Goldsmith said the problems at the new distribution centre were now over
and predicted that if the present trend continued the short-fall would be
made up over the coming months.
Pentos, the specialist retailer which raised Pounds 45m through a 4-for-3
rights issue at 25p earlier this year, confirmed yesterday that it would
report a substantial loss for the first half of 1994 reflecting a number of
factors.
However, Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting
that this should represent, 'the bottom of the cycle for Pentos'. The shares
closed unchanged at 25 1/2p.

<TEXT>
Kerry Group, the Irish meat, dairy and food ingredients manufacturer, is to
acquire the chilled meats business of Mattessons Walls from Van den Burgh
Foods for an as yet undisclosed sum.
Net asset value of the business being acquired has been independently
estimated at Pounds 25m.
The acquisition, which Kerry said was still at the due diligence appraisal,
would double Kerry's business in the UK consumer foods sector to about
Pounds 160m in sales. It would also give it control of some of the leading
brand names in Walls, the added-value meats business. Walls ice cream will
continue to be produced and marketed by Birds Eye Walls.
Other brands include Mattessons, Richmond, Lawson, New York Deli and Valley
Farm, all familiar names on UK supermarket shelves.
According to Kerry: 'The acquisition is part of our strategy to build a
strong branded position in the UK market.'
The deal would add a nationwide van sales operation of 200 people in England
and Wales and two manufacturing plants at Manchester and Durham to Kerry's
existing UK distribution and manufacturing facilities.
The company said the Mattessons business 'is now at a turnaround stage and
there will be opportunities for further streamlining'.
According to analysts in Dublin, the UK chilled meat sector is highly
competitive, but the acquisition would strengthen Kerry's focus on the food
ingredients and consumer foods businesses, and position it well for an
upturn in the UK food sector next year.
Van den Burgh Foods said the decision to sell its chilled meats business was
part of its plan to concentrate resources in its established core areas of
margarine, low-fat foods, spreads, liquid oils and meat snacks.
Mattessons Walls joined Van den Burgh, a subsidiary of Unilever, in 1992
from another division of Unilever. The company said that during the past two
years there had been an ongoing pruning and rationalisation of the chilled
meats division.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fisons sells horticulture business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons yesterday effectively completed its troubled odyssey from
horticultural company to pharmaceuticals and scientific group.
The company has sold its UK horticultural business for Pounds 25.3m in one
of the largest management buy-outs so far this year. The operations had
sales last year of Pounds 47m and operating profits of Pounds 3.8m.
The business was acquired by a consortium led by Prudential Venture
Managers, which provided Pounds 50m financing to senior management. The new
company, to be called Levington Horticulture will supply garden fertilisers,
composts and chemicals to the retail and professional markets. It has the
right to market horticultural products under the Fisons name for seven
years.
The deal virtually completes Fisons' disposal programme announced by
management in April 1992.
Fisons said it was negotiating with buyers for its last remaining
horticultural businesses in France and Benelux. These generated operating
profits last year of about Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds 20.3m.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gt Southern attacks 'knockdown price'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Southern Group, the funeral operator that has become the target of
Service Corporation International, the US funeral group, yesterday issued
its defence document, claiming the 600p hostile offer was a 'knockdown
price'.
Great Southern emphasised the 252 per cent increase in its share price since
its October 1986 flotation - even before the offer - and its activity in
building up its crematoria and funeral businesses, through acquisitions.
In addition, it claims SCI 'shows no understanding of Great Southern's
business or the UK funeral industry', and has not done the homework
necessary to be the 'careful custodian' of its traditions.
Shareholders appear likely to head the call to 'ignore the offer'. The
shares closed yesterday 1p higher at 609p, suggesting the expectation that
it will be raised.
More importantly, the Field family, who control 56 per cent of its shares,
have said the bid price is 'unacceptable', and the offer is contingent upon
acceptance by the family holding company JD Field.
The document claims that the company offers profits growth from its recent
programme of expanding its crematoria, and the success of Chosen Heritage,
its successful pre-paid funeral scheme, which has a 65 per cent UK market
share.
SCI is clearly convinced of the attractions. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI
president, returns to London tomorrow and is expected to endeavour to sound
out a price which will tempt the Fields to sell.
The offer is due to close next Tuesday.

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Neepsend up to Pounds 761,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neepsend, the light engineer, reported pre-tax profits for the year to March
31 of Pounds 761,000, against losses of Pounds 99,000. Turnover increased
from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 18.6m.
The company said the improvement had continued into the present year. The
shares rose 3p to 41p.
The result was after lower interest charges of Pounds 283,000 (Pounds
411,000) and an exceptional cost of Pounds 253,000 (Pounds 275,000) relating
to the sale of land on which the company will be entitled to extra payment
of Pounds 1m or Pounds 2m depending on planning permission.
Neepsend is also in talks on the disposal of its Canadian subsidiary which
should result in proceeds of Pounds 375,000.
Earnings per share were 2.12p (0.32p losses) and a final dividend of 0.75p
is recommended for a total of 1.25p (0.75p).

FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Evans of Leeds climbs to Pounds 9.7m and
net assets up 13p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans of Leeds, the family-controlled property investment and development
company, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 9.74m for the year to March 31.
Net assets per share rose by 13p to 111p, reflecting an 8.9 per cent
like-on-like increase in the value of its property portfolio.
The company received gross rental income of Pounds 22.5m, compared with
Pounds 19.2m in 1993, following 'some satisfactory reviews', as well as the
purchase of Pounds 16m of property during the year. However, net interest
payable rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m).
The company said it was proceeding with the Pounds 100m development of the
White Rose Shopping Centre in Leeds, which it is undertaking with joint
venture partner Yorkshire Water.
It is currently awaiting detailed planning permission for the development,
which was initially planned in the mid-1980s, but Mr Bill Gibson, director,
said work could commence during 1994. Given the size of the project, he said
Evans was considering a number of options for White Rose, which could
include taking on other partners.
The company raised another Pounds 13m from the issue of debentures last
year, and it has a Pounds 15m bank stand-by facility. In addition, gearing
remained at 53 per cent last year, which is conservative for the sector.
A proposed final dividend of 1.74p brings the total for the year to 2.53p
(2.285p adjusted). This is the 18th successive year in which Evans has
increased its total dividend by more than 10 per cent.
Earnings per share were 5.72p (5.69p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnum Power, which designs built-in uninterruptible power supply units
(Bi-ups), is planning a USM flotation through a placing with institutional
investors.
Bi-ups can be built into equipment such as personal computers and
fileservers to protect against the loss of valuable data and equipment
damage if the primary power supply fails.
Magnum was founded in 1990 by Mr Vincent Lavin, who claims to have invented
Bi-ups the previous year, and Mr Ian Irvin, finance director.
The flotation, which is sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, is
designed to strengthen Magnum's capital base so that the group can fully
exploit the commercial potential of Bi-ups and build sales volumes.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Texaco to sell half its US fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US oil group, is to sell half its US oilfields and cut 2,500
jobs from its worldwide workforce of 32,000 over the next year as part of a
plan to increase profitability.
The restructuring will result in a second quarter charge to earnings of
about Dollars 165m (Pounds 109m), to cover redundancy costs, the write-down
to market value of assets being sold, and a previously-announced charge of
Dollars 49.5m relating to the sale of its chemical operations.
However, Texaco said the moves would reduce overheads by some Dollars 300m a
year, about a third of which would be realised this year and the rest by the
end of 1995. Its shares rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 60 7/8 in early
trading.
Texaco's actions mirror those of other big US oil companies which have been
responding to low oil prices by rationalising US production and cutting away
at management and administration functions.
Texaco has more than 600 producing fields in the US. The 300 or so to be
sold or traded will mostly be small fields that have been rendered marginal
or unprofitable by recent declines in oil prices.
The company said US activities would be focused on the remaining oil and gas
assets accounting for more than 90 per cent of US profits, cashflow,
production and reserves. Proceeds from the oilfields being sold would be
redirected to growth opportunities in the US and overseas.
Texaco is also cutting production costs by consolidating offices and
reducing layers of supervision. There will also be rationalisation in
international production.
Further cuts will be made in the company's downstream operations.
Earlier consolidations and restructurings have cut Texaco's workforce by 13
per cent in the past two years and produced annual pre-tax savings of
Dollars 54m. Last year the company made after-tax profits of Dollars 1.1bn.
Reuter adds from Quito: Ecuador's energy minister Mr Francisco Acosta said
his government planned to sue Texaco after a study found the oil firm had
caused damage to the environment in the Amazon rain forest.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Airbus to form finance subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium, is expected to announce
today the formation of an aircraft financing subsidiary, to be called Airbus
Finance Corp. The new company will handle the financing of future Airbus
sales, and AFC could eventually handle up to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of
aircraft finance.
Many airliner sales are via leases, with banks owning the aircraft and
airlines holding long leases. Airbus Finance Corp will act as a middleman,
helping to arrange the finance in whatever form the airline customer
requires.
It is intended that AFC should stand alone and eventually hold its own
credit rating. Initially it will be led on a part-time basis by Mr Tony
Rice, the treasurer of British Aerospace. Negotiations to open banking lines
are expected to begin shortly, with the company becoming operational in the
autumn.
Creating the new subsidiary will allow Airbus greater flexibility in the
financing packages it can offer customers. It will also cut down the
financial commitments of the Airbus consortium members, enabling them to
help guarantee the finance of more aircraft sales than hitherto.
Because Airbus is not incorporated, each Airbus partner is jointly and
severally liable for the financial risks run by the consortium. So, for
example, if Dollars 100m of aircraft were leased directly from Airbus, each
of the consortium members would be potentially liable for the Dollars 100m
if the aircraft were returned. All four consortium members would thus have a
contingent liability of Dollars 100m and would have to retain the financing
capacity to meet that.
Under the new finance company, the four Airbus partners will between them
guarantee the financial risks of the subsidiary, which might typically
amount to 20 per cent of finance provided. Each individual member would thus
see its contingent financing needs fall from 100 per cent of the aircraft's
value now to 5 per cent.
Establishing AFC is also intended to help Airbus put its assessment of
financing risks on a more scientific footing and allow the consortium to
make more informed decisions about the risks of default when considering
aircraft sales to airlines.
The new structure is backed by all of the consortium members, but is based
on the model developed by BAe to restructure its regional jet business. Mr
Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director who pioneered the development
there, was closely involved in designing the new finance company.
Currently about one-third of Airbus's aircraft are leased, with the rest
being direct sales to airlines. However, many of the leased airliners are
handled by external finance companies which have no recourse to Airbus.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The small step from timidity to liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the price of long-term capital jumps, as it has done in the first half
of 1994, explanations abound. There is a capital shortage, argue some,
because the world's savings are no longer large enough to support both the
gargantuan borrowing appetites of too many governments and the rapidly
rising demands of the recovering private sector.
Not at all, argue others, there is simply an increasing fear of inflation
and a worry that governments will soon more generally begin to raise
short-term interest rates. Savings and investment will always balance,
though maybe at a different interest rate.
Yet the Swedish government, at least, may see things more starkly following
last week's announcement by one of the country's biggest institutional
investors, the insurance group Skandia, that it was ceasing to buy Swedish
government bonds because state indebtedness was threatening to run out of
control.
Gerald Holtham, London-based international economist at Lehman Brothers,
dismisses the idea that there is any kind of global capital shortage. This
could only arise in much more buoyant economic circumstances, he says.
Instead we have been seeing an increase in liquidity preference.
The role of Japanese investors and institutions, seeking to escape risk, has
been crucial here. They have been repatriating overseas assets and building
up their liquid yen assets; to offset the flows the Bank of Japan has been
buying US Treasury bills and other short-term paper.
Moreover the western hedge funds and banks which last year were eagerly
borrowing short and investing long have been unwinding their positions.
However, I am not sure that the distinction between capital shortage and
liquidity preference is particularly helpful. A mere expectation of a future
capital shortage will in effect generate that shortage sooner.
In any case, any current apparent shortage should be seen in the context of
last year's capital glut, which caused borrowers to become complacent. In
the UK, for instance, the government sold only Pounds 12.6bn of gilts to
domestic long-term institutions in the 1993-94 fiscal year, down Pounds 3bn
on 1992-93, but sold an unprecedented Pounds 17.5bn to foreigners. It also,
according to Salomon Brothers, sold Pounds 5bn to securities dealers in the
first nine months, but these sold out in the January-March quarter.
This pattern was probably typical of many national government bond markets
last year, and raises the question of how deficits can be funded if the
speculative inflows cease, and still more if they are reversed.
Meanwhile Gordon Pepper, of the City University Business School, has
recently developed his monetarist theory of asset prices to attempt to
explain the abruptness of the bond market break last winter. He says that
when securities trades based on liquidity pressures become persistent it
becomes impossible for the valuation shifts they cause to be reversed by
speculative (or value-based) transactions, and then rises or falls in prices
can become self-feeding.
This happens when the financial system is badly out of equilibrium: the
demand for finance is not equal to the supply of savings. Last year the bond
markets were overwhelmed by liquidity-based purchases and were not able to
discount adequately the predictable event of a monetary tightening by the US
Federal Reserve. Once the signal came, however, the liquidity-based
transactions went into reverse.
By the same token, you could add, the bond markets may at some stage in the
near future bounce sharply upwards, and thus yields fall, once the selling
pressure abates.
That is presumably, for instance, the expectation of the British government,
which is refusing to fund its deficit in the normal way at the rates set by
the market for medium- and long-term sterling debt. There is a UK issuers'
strike to set against the buyers' strike in Sweden.
Probably the notion of a capital shortage is too vague to apply precisely.
But governments had better stop behaving as though there were an unlimited
supply of global capital available to prop up bankrupt state pension schemes
or pay for the soaring costs of unemployment.
They will encounter a credibility shortage soon enough.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Receivers warn British Land on Broadgate sale: Oldfield
claims strong support from Rosehaugh's bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers to one of the partners in Broadgate, London's biggest property
joint venture, have said they will fight attempts by British Land to acquire
its developments on the cheap.
Mr Roger Oldfield, joint administrative receiver at Rosehaugh, one of two
Broadgate partners, said yesterday: 'We have a strong position and I am not
going to allow British Land's chairman, or anybody else, to get their hands
on some of London's most valuable assets at less than a full price.'
His warning follows the acquisition by British Land in February of a 29.9
per cent stake in Stanhope Properties, which owns 50 per cent of Broadgate
Properties, developer of two of the capital's largest ever office schemes
valued in excess of Pounds 1bn.
Rosehaugh, which owns the other 50 per cent of Broadgate, went into
receivership in December 1992. British Land has transferred its Stanhope
stake to the Pounds 500m British Land Quantum Property Investment fund,
formed last year with Mr George Soros, the US investor.
British Land would not comment on the state of negotiations. But it has made
no secret of its intention to implement a restructuring which would give the
fund 100 per cent of the Broadgate Centre and the Ludgate office
developments, and leave Stanhope's existing management with a less indebted,
but substantially scaled down business.
Many of the banks which are still owed about Pounds 280m by Rosehaugh also
lent large sums to Stanhope and Broadgate.
Mr Oldfield said that he had received strong support from Rosehaugh's
bankers when he met them last month to outline the receiver's position on
the recent events at Stanhope.
'With the commercial property market rising, we told them they could afford
to wait for the right deal and should not be bounced into a hasty sale
because a non-controlling interest had been acquired in one of the partners.
If British Land or Mr Soros want control they are going to have to pay a
proper price for for it,' said Mr Oldfield.
Stanhope had a negative net worth of Pounds 15m at the end of last year
after making losses of more than Pounds 270m in the previous two financial
years. The purchase by British Land, however, was unsuccessfully opposed by
Mr Stuart Lipton, Stanhope's chief executive.
The issue is complicated as both Stanhope and Rosehaugh have pre-emption
rights should either partner decide to sell their stakes in Broadgate
Properties.
A key factor in the negotiations will be Jones Lang Wootton's June 30
valuation of Broadgate, which is currently being undertaken for Stanhope's
accounts, and will provide a basis for any competing bids.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Call for review of takeover rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-executive members of the Takeover Panel will press for a review of the
rules on cash share purchases during hostile takeover bids following the
controversial purchase of Lasmo shares during Enterprise Oil's failed bid
for the company.
'The question is whether an offeror making an all-paper bid should be
allowed to buy 10 per cent of the target's equity for cash in the market. It
is not clear that this is in the public interest,' said a panel member. If
the cash bid is more attractive than the paper bid, it should not be allowed
unless all shareholders have equal opportunity to take advantage of it, he
said.
The call for the review has been triggered by S . G. Warburg, brokers for
Enterprise, which offered some of Lasmo's largest shareholders the chance to
sell their shares for cash in the last days of a hostile bid. It bought just
under 10 per cent, as allowed by the Takeover Code in such circumstances,
but the bid failed by a wide margin.
However, the method of the share purchase was highly unusual in a takeover
bid. Usually the bidding company's broker will make a general cash offer for
shares to the market and purchase them from tenderers on a pro-rata basis.
The London Stock Exchange has received a complaint about the deal and a
committee will meet today to consider whether Warburg acted properly.
Swiss Bank Corporation is said to have been the complainant although a
spokesman for SBC would not comment.
The complainant is arguing that under Stock Exchange rules pre-existing
'limit orders' lodged with Warburg's market-making arm to sell Lasmo shares
to Enterprise should have been satisfied first.
This is a 'grey area', according to one marketmaking source. Under Stock
Exchange rule 354.8, a marketmaker with an order from a client to sell, say,
Lasmo shares at the offer price would have 'the right to declare whether . .
. it wishes to participate' in the business being conducted. But it is not
clear it would have an obligation to do so. Merchant bankers said the
Takeover Panel will eventually have to consider converging its rules with
those of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

<TEXT>
Last week's purchase by Enterprise of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo may
well have been within the rules of the takeover game. But that only goes to
show that the rules need changing. A system that allowed Enterprise to offer
a few large shareholders up to 169p for their Lasmo shares when the best
most investors could receive in the market was 143p is blatantly
discriminatory. Non-executive members of the Takeover Panel are pushing to
have the rules reviewed. All power to their elbow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's figures from British Rail are something of a curiosity. This
year's results will be transformed as BR starts to pay Railtrack service
charges in place of its own direct costs. But whichever way the cake is cut,
the Pounds 350m gulf between operating costs and revenue will have to be
narrowed if privatisation is to be a success. While the 7 per cent reduction
in costs last year points the way ahead, today's strike is a reminder of the
countervailing pressures.
Of course, it is possible that savings matching those in other privatised
industries can be achieved. But to revive the railways, franchise operators
will also have to do better at drumming-up business than BR's current
management. The average fare per mile increased 6.5 per cent last year, yet
passenger revenue rose by less than 3 per cent. Passenger miles have now
fallen 10 per cent over the last five years. Although recession played its
part, rail shows no sign of reversing its long-term decline in market share.
BR's response has been to raise prices on peak commuter services, where it
believes it has a captive audience, and use promotional activity to fill
off-peak trains. Given the mixed results of that pricing strategy, the time
may have come for some Branson-style innovation.

Mr Derek Keys looks sincere in maintaining that there is no policy
motivation behind his resignation as South Africa's finance minister. Just
the same, his departure is a further blow to hopes that political reform
would lead to large investment inflows. Mr Chris Stals, who is widely
respected internationally, remains at the helm of the Reserve Bank, but he
has no influence over fiscal policy. Mr Nelson Mandela's government moved
quickly to announce a replacement. But it is hard to imagine Mr Keys'
successor wielding the same clout in cabinet on the budget, and an ability
to keep public spending under control is crucial to South Africa's economic
stability.
In theory South African equities represent good value. A historic
price/earnings multiple of around 19 is low both by general emerging market
standards and for a country on the threshold of a cyclical earnings
recovery. Similarly bonds offer attractive real returns after the three
percentage point rise in yields this year. But while the political
uncertainty continues, enthusiasm is likely to remain muted. It would help
if higher prices for minor metals like palladium spilled over into the
dollar price of gold. Extra prosperity would make the politicians' task
easier too.

The Paris bourse is being torn between fear and greed. It is uncertain which
emotion will prevail. The recent whiff of corruption in the business world,
which is rapidly developing into a stench, has been offending international
investors. Companies accounting for some 16 per cent of the CAC 40's
capitalisation have been tainted by one form of scandal or another. Many of
the allegations may prove unfounded but the damage to sentiment will
persist. The CAC 40 has already fallen 18 per cent this year, substantially
underperforming the German and UK markets. It is not easy to see that trend
quickly reversing itself as political uncertainties mount ahead of next
May's presidential elections.
Nevertheless, investors with steely nerves and long time horizons may sniff
a chance to buy shares on the cheap. Political rows and corruption scandals
are unlikely to knock corporate earnings. Significantly, perhaps, the
savaging of Alcatel's shares on Monday was followed by a sharp rebound the
following day. The French economy also appears to be coming good. The
statistics office yesterday confirmed industrial production had risen 2.1
per cent in April. That may have owed much to a fiscal stimulation package
revving up the car market in particular. But many other industrial groups,
which have squirrelled away provisions during recession, could well produce
some surprisingly good earnings gains.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco's cost-cutting plan is a sign of just how hard oil companies are
having to work to earn a decent return from their assets. Most majors,
including Texaco, made returns on capital of 8-10 per cent last year.
Economic recovery throughout the industrialised world and the recent rebound
in crude prices will boost these returns, but not sufficiently to cover the
long-run cost of capital over the economic cycle.
So the majors are having to take an axe to their costs. Most, apart from
Exxon, the industry's master of cost control, have plenty of fat to trim.
Companies became bloated in the 1970s and the early 1980s when crude prices
were high. Texaco's package of job cuts, asset write-downs and 'delayering'
is designed to cut overheads by Dollars 300m a year, the company's biggest
reorganisation since it was forced into Chapter 11 in the late 1980s. Mobil,
Chevron and Amoco have all made similar moves to slim down. BP, which is
close to reaching its target of cutting operating costs by Dollars 1bn a
year, is about to kick into the second phase of its restructuring plan which
involves cutting another Dollars 1bn of costs.
In the short term, the restructuring wave will deliver improved returns. But
in the medium term, competition will prevent cost-cutting translating into
wider margins. A leisurely approach to restructuring, such as that adopted
by Shell, will not be enough to earn good returns. Only companies that
constantly strive to improve efficiency will move ahead. Cost-cutting looks
like becoming a permanent industry feature.

<TEXT>
US stock and bond markets held their ground in nervous trading yesterday as
investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve's open market committee
(FOMC), which began a two-day meeting in the afternoon, would vote to raise
interest rates.
The recent decline in the dollar's value had convinced some Wall Street
analysts that the Fed governors and regional presidents who make up the FOMC
would decide the currency needed the support of higher interest rates.
Although market sentiment has since shifted towards the view that central
bank support is unlikely, the dollar held firm against the yen in New York
yesterday. It was quoted at Y98.90 in late New York trading, having dipped
to Y98.825 in London from Y98.9 on Monday.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar lost more than a pfennig during London
trading, closing at DM1.5826 against DM1.5965 on Monday. In New York, it
fell to DM1.5800 in late trading. Traders in New York attributed the decline
to a temporary surge in demand for the D-Mark.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 5.83 at 3,652.48 with other stock
indices ending flat. Treasury market prices barely moved.
Although all eyes were on the FOMC yesterday, some analysts thought the Fed
would not review its stance until it saw job figures, due on Friday.
Michael Prowse in Washington adds: President Bill Clinton said yesterday the
priority at the Group of Seven economic summit beginning on Friday would be
to find ways of co-operating more effectively to create jobs.
On the eve of his departure for the summit, Mr Clinton did not directly
address fears that exchange rate volatility would depress global growth
prospects. He signalled instead that G7 leaders should focus on economic
fundamentals, especially those relevant to the 'well-being of working
people'.
He said G7 leaders needed to address the 'tinderbox issues of global
population growth and the environmental crisis' and to lay plans for
creating global 'information superhighways'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Alcatel chief hits at probe into use of company funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecoms and
engineering group, yesterday described as unfounded an investigation into
alleged payment irregularities and called for a stock exchange inquiry into
how the news of his detention on Monday was released.
The Alcatel chairman, who was freed from police custody early yesterday
morning on bail of FFr1m (Pounds 120,000), has been formally placed under
investigation for alleged irregularities in payments for work at his private
residence. But he received support from senior officials, including Mr
Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister.
'I find it distressing that the image of a company with tens of thousands of
employees can be tarnished in this way,' Mr Longuet told French radio.
He said the reputation of the company and other French exporters could be
damaged by the investigation and expressed confidence in the Alcatel chief,
who, he said, had put France among the leaders in the international energy,
telecommunications and railway industries.
The investigation into Mr Suard is the latest blow to the French business
establishment in the past few months. In May, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne,
chairman of Groupe Schneider, the electrical engineering group, was arrested
in Belgium and detained for 12 days in connection with a fraud
investigation.
Allegations of corruption at several French companies by Mr Thierry
Jean-Pierre, a prosecutor-turned-politician, have exacerbated business
concerns of an increase in judicial investigations into French companies.
According to Mr Guy Danet, Mr Suard's lawyer, the investigations into the
Alcatel chairman are focusing on some FFr700,000 of work done at his private
properties. About FFr400,000 relates to personal work, including the
refitting of bathrooms and a kitchen. The investigating judge claims that Mr
Suard had underpaid for the work, performed by suppliers of the group, a
claim rejected by the Alcatel chairman.
The investigation is also examining payments for FFr300,000 relating to
security work at Mr Suard's properties, which was paid for by Alcatel. The
company says all the work, which totalled FFr3.2m, was justified by
professional considerations and in line with government guidelines on
security measures following the assassination in 1986 of Mr Georges Besse,
the former head of Renault.
Mr Suard dismissed the probe as 'banal', but expressed fears that it could
hurt the reputation of Alcatel on international markets. He was also
concerned about how news of his detention on Monday had spread to the
financial markets and called for an inquiry by the Commission des Operations
de Bourse, the French stock exchange watchdog.
Mr Suard's detention prompted a fall in Alcatel's shares, which lost more
than 8.3 per cent on Monday. Yesterday the shares regained much of the loss,
closing up 5.7 per cent at FFr572.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Rover to increase Discovery production by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group announced a Pounds 68m investment programme yesterday to expand
production of its highly successful four-wheel-drive Land Rover Discovery.
The project, which will increase capacity at the Solihull factory producing
the car, is to be completed early next year.
The announcement marks the first substantial investment programme to be
launched by Rover since it was taken over by German car maker BMW at the
start of the year.
Rover executives stressed last night that the project would be financed from
Rover's own earnings. There would be no contribution from BMW, which bought
Rover for Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions and which pledged to allow Rover
to operate autonomously.
'It had been envisaged for some time, before the BMW takeover in fact, that
the investment would be necessary in order to meet soaring demand,' Rover
said.
The expansion will allow Land Rover, the Rover group's four-wheel-drive
subsidiary, to increase production of the Discovery by 20 per cent to 1,500
a week and confirm it as one of the most successful vehicles ever to be
launched by Rover, formerly BL.
The model was launched in 1989 at a production rate of 270 a week and within
a few months became the UK's best selling four-wheel-drive model.
Since then production has been increased a total of nine times, creating an
extra 1,600 jobs at the Solihull factory, which now employs 9,700.
It is expected that the latest expansion will create some further jobs,
although Rover said last night it was too early to say how many.
Discovery sales last year reached 36,433 vehicles world-wide, representing
half of Land Rover's total sales. Its image is sufficiently good for Honda,
which is still collaborating with Rover despite the BMW takeover, to sell
the vehicle under its own name, the Honda Crossroads, in Japan.
The expansion is one of the biggest spending projects on a single plant to
be announced by Rover in recent years.
The increase in production is designed partly to cater for demand in the
North American market, where the Discovery was launched only three months
ago.

US stock and bond markets held their ground in nervous trading yesterday as
investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve's open market committee
(FOMC), which began a two-day meeting in the afternoon, would vote to raise
interest rates.
The recent decline in the value of the dollar had convinced some analysts on
Wall Street that the Fed governors and regional presidents who make up the
FOMC would decide that it required the support of higher interest rates.
But as market sentiment shifted towards the view that central bank support
of the US currency was unlikely, the dollar yesterday lost more than pfennig
during London trading. It closed in London at DM1.5826 against DM1.5965 on
Monday, while in New York it was trading at DM1.5835 at lunchtime.
Against the yen, the dollar dipped to Y98.825 in London, against Y98.9 on
Monday, and was quoted at Y98.87 in New York midsession trading. Higher
interest rates could divert international money flows into dollar-based
financial assets such as US government bonds.
Although sentiment towards the dollar remains firmly negative, analysts said
the market was wary of selling the currency aggressively for fear of being
caught out by concerted central bank intervention.
Meanwhile, US stock and bond prices spent the morning moving within a narrow
trading range, as many investors and traders chose to sit on the sidelines
until the FOMC meeting was over.
By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.63 at 3,659.28, but
broader indices were either flat or lower. Treasury market prices also
barely moved, with the yield on the 30-year benchmark bond holding steady at
7.6 per cent.
Although all eyes were on the FOMC yesterday, not everyone on Wall Street
was convinced that the committee would decide whether or not to raise rates.
Some analysts believed the Fed would not review its monetary policy stance
until it had seen the latest employment figures. The next employment report,
for June, is due to be released on Friday.

Journalists assembling to hear president of the board of trade Michael
Heseltine hold forth at the South Africa-Britain Trade Association official
lunch in Johannesburg next Tuesday were initially told they would have to
pay for the privilege - unless they are the fortunate recipients of 12 free
tickets set aside for hacks. 'Can't afford to pay for more,' said an
organiser firmly.
When it was suggested that such mean-spiritedness was not only ungenerous
but also might be less than beneficial for UK trading interests, the
organisers relented. Maybe guests at next year's Queen's birthday party in
Pretoria will be asked to pay for their pink gins.

On the Pacific island of Guam - at the US official war dog cemetery - you
will soon be able to visit a life-size bronze sculpture of a Doberman,
erected in honour of the many dogs which died helping US troops in the war
against Japan.
The dogs 'saved hundreds of lives on the island and thousands the Pacific',
says retired Lt Gen Claude M. Kicklighter, director of the Pentagon's 50th
anniversary of the second world war commemoration committee. As yet, no
mention of a presidential medal for Socks.

The sight of a flak-jacketed Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of state for the
province, roaming the Republican streets of west Belfast late on Monday
night caused a bit of a stir among Ulster Unionists.
The Northern Ireland Office described it as a routine patrol by its
minister, who likes keeping 'in touch with the security forces'.
But such is the suspicion of anything Sir Patrick says or does these days
that some of the more paranoid unionists were speculating that he may have
been en route to a clandestine midnight chat with Sinn Fein president Gerry
Adams, in a bid to hurry along the peace process.
Then again, he might have been having one last look at one of the tougher
bits of his fiefdom - before being replaced in John Major's forthcoming
reshuffle.

He may be the bad boy of international soccer but when he returns to Buenos
Aires tomorrow Diego Maradona will receive a hero's welcome. So what if he
single-handedly scuppered his team's chances in football's World Cup? His
fans - just about the whole of Argentina - still worship him.
A poll just published by a Buenos Aires newspaper records that 58 per cent
of respondents reckon Maradona was the innocent victim of an international
conspiracy to cheat Argentina out of winning its third world championship;
only 13 per cent think he made a serious error in imbibing his mysterious
cocktail.

Roll up, roll up, for round two of the fight to give the TUC a friendly
face. After yesterday's conference on full employment, the TUC is holding a
'fiesta' in Brighton on Saturday to show off the 'new face' of trade union
campaigning. All the fun of the congress - composite motions, deletions and
walk-outs - have been quietly muffled to allow a carnival of bands, buskers,
clowns and jugglers to perform beneath a big screen television. Once a
symbol of Big Brother, the screen is showing live coverage of the World Cup
finals.
Sensibly, TUC general secretary John Monks, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown
and the union barons addressing an old-fashioned rally have promised to be
out of the way before the big match.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Do the people running Naples' royal palace know something we don't? They
have put a good part of their library of 1.5m books under lock and key,
prior to this weekend's summit of the G7, which is being held at the palace.
But the subtle carpentry is apparently a little selective. Russia's Boris
Yeltsin, who will turn up for dinner on Saturday and stay for Sunday's final
part of the summit, is being housed in slightly less luxurious quarters than
G7 members; that's only fair perhaps, since he's not a member.
Glass panels have been fixed to prevent books from disappearing from the
main room being used by Yeltsin's aides and those of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. The books are already under lock and key in the room reserved
for French President Francois Mitterrand.
But while French and German officials will be free to handle the books in
their adjoining offices, the same is not true for the Russian visitors. If
they feel the need for some reading matter, they will have to supply their
own.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Clearing the air
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's rail strike, the fourth in four weeks, will force a third more cars
than usual to battle with Britain's clogged roads. It will also pump more
pollution into the layer of smog hanging over southern England and Wales.
This week, as levels of ozone exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines
by more than 30 per cent, ministers advised those suffering from asthma or
heart problems to avoid outdoor exercise. They also called on drivers to
leave their vehicles at home and take to bicycles. It does not take ranks of
wheezing cyclists to point out that the advice is partly contradictory; it
is also an inadequate response to a growing problem.
Recent warm weather has been the catalyst for the smog, by causing
pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons to react together to
produce ozone. While ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from the
sun, at ground level it causes coughing, eye irritation and lung damage.
But the real culprits are motor vehicles, especially those without catalytic
converters and those with poorly-tuned engines. If all vehicles were fitted
with catalytic converters, which strip out 80 per cent of harmful gases,
this summer's smog would not have formed. Since January 1993, converters
have been compulsory on all new cars - nearly two decades after the US took
the same step. But the effects will take time to show: converters cannot be
fitted to older cars, and cur-rently only 15 per cent of UK vehicles carry
them.
The government's immediate target should be the dirtiest engines. According
to the Royal Automobile Club, 10 per cent of vehicles - particularly old
buses and lorries - emit half the pollution. The annual MOT test on vehicle
quality has incorporated emissions standards since 1991. If these were met
year-round by all vehicles, that would solve much of the problem. But
motoring organisations say that many vehicles meet the standards only on the
day of the test: ageing vehicles can be eased through the MOT by temporary
retuning, while recession has discouraged drivers from servicing their
vehicles as often.
For that reason, the government should consider tougher roadside checks of
vehicle exhausts. Ministers' resistance to this suggestion, raised by health
and environmental groups as the shortcomings of the MOT have become clearer,
is partly based on cost, but this ought not to be excessive given the
vehicle-checking arrangements that already exist.
A second objection is that tighter checks would carry an unwelcome air of
intrusiveness. But compared to staying indoors in stifling weather, this is
a small constraint on freedom.
Public concern about dirty air is growing. If ministers fail to act against
the worst polluters, they will face pressure to restrict all vehicles in
urban centres during hot weather, as is already the case in cities like
Athens. It is time to face the problem.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: A sad loss for South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement of the impending departure of Mr Derek Keys as
South Africa's finance minister presents Mr Nelson Mandela with the first
serious challenge of his presidency.
There is no reason to doubt Mr Keys when he cites 'personal reasons' for
deciding to hand over his portfolio in October: he had always made clear
that he did not see a long-term future in politics, and that once he had
overseen the economic transition from apartheid to a government of national
unity he would want to leave public life.
He can justly claim that his budget of June 22 set the seal on such an
orderly transition. It demonstrated that the new government intends to live
within its means - by keeping the budget deficit to about 6 per cent of
gross domestic product - as it struggles to redress the legacy of apartheid
with a reconstruction and development plan. It underlined, above all, that
stability would have to take precedence over fulfilling expectations of
dramatic change.
Nevertheless, Mr Keys's departure leaves a large hole. Former President F W
de Klerk apart, no other individual has done as much to reassure the local
business community and international investors during the past two years of
tumultuous change.
His greatest achievement has been to win and maintain the confidence of the
African National Congress during the transition. Although he was chosen by
Mr de Klerk, the force of his personality and his reputation as an
apolitical pragmatist played a vital part in the ANC's abandonment of
socialist economic policies.
Compounding the loss was the way in which the resignation emerged - through
a premature leak that unsettled financial markets. Mr Mandela's announcement
last night that Mr Christo Liebenberg, a respected banker, will succeed Mr
Keys goes some way to limiting the damage. But Mr Mandela must also reaffirm
that his government intends to persevere with Mr Keys's policies of fiscal
discipline and market reform.
Ideally, such a reassertion of principles would be accompanied by equally
unambiguous statements from the two other key members of the team
administering economic policy, Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, and
Mr Jay Naidoo, responsible for the reconstruction plan. They have already
played a critical role, arguing as vigorously as Mr Keys for financial
discipline, and their background in South Africa's trade union movement will
give their words added weight.
The jittery market reaction to the rumours that preceded yesterday's
announcement should in itself provide Mr Mandela with a salutary lesson:
that South Africa's new leadership still has a lot to prove in economic
policy. If the episode of Mr Keys's resignation reinforces awareness that
the policies he bequeathes are vital to domestic management and
international confidence, it may yet turn out to have served a useful
purpose.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Lean eagle fights a fat turkey: Quentin Peel asks whether
Deutsche Telekom will prove attractive to investors when it is privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Own goal for Germany,' the banner headline over a full-page advertisement in
the mass circulation Bild Zeitung trumpeted, as the World Cup football
matches were getting under way last month.
It showed a dismal-looking German eagle, feathers flying, watching
helplessly as a football flashed by. But it had nothing to do with football.
The advertisement was a desperate appeal by the German state post and
telecommunications services to their employees not to go on strike. That
would amount to an own goal, they said.
Instead, they urged them to back a pay deal which would allow the reform of
the entire sector to go ahead, leading to the eventual privatisation of
Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly, Postdienst, the postal
service, and Postbank, the postal savings bank.
In the early hours of last Saturday morning, the employers and the trade
union reached agreement. It was greeted with almost universal relief. The
accord preserves for the 670,000 workers in the industry a comprehensive
package of social benefits, cheap housing, health insurance and the like, as
well as strict rules preventing redundancies, for up to three years.
The employers said the deal went to the limits of what was
'entrepreneurially responsible'. Despite their failure to renegotiate the
industry's fringe benefits, their fear of delaying the privatisation process
proved too great to resist. On Friday, the last parliamentary step in the
process - approval in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament - is
expected to be a formality.
On January 1 1995, Deutsche Telekom will become an Aktiengesellschaft (AG) -
a joint stock company - and from some time in early 1996 the privatisation
process proper will be launched with a first share issue. That will raise,
it is hoped, between DM15bn (Pounds 6bn) and DM20bn.
Yet many observers fear that the pay deal will prove to have been another
own goal for the telecommunications giant itself. It will be coming to the
market encumbered with massive debt and a host of burdens from its
public-sector past, which could make it decidedly unattractive for private
investors.
'There are a lot of questions still to be answered,' says Mr Evan Miller,
telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers. 'They will have to address
them very specifically when they publish their prospectus.'
Not that Deutsche Telekom is shy with facts and figures. When the management
board faced press and analysts at the annual press conference last week,
simultaneously broadcast from Bonn to London and Singapore, the audience was
inundated with statistics.
Turnover has been growing by leaps and bounds, thanks not least to an
explosion of new users in east Germany, Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief
executive, declared. It was up 9.3 per cent last year to DM59bn, and in
eastern Germany up from DM3.5bn to DM4.5bn.
Its investment programme in the east has transformed the former communist
state from a telecommunications backwater, where only one in 10 had a
telephone, and a single rainstorm could knock out tens of thousands of
lines, to a country enjoying more modern technology than the west. The
cumulative cost of modernisation will have been DM60bn by 1997, by when 7.2m
connections will be installed, as well as 360,000 fax connections, 50,000
packet-switched data links, 5m TV cable connections, a complete digitalised
switching system, optical fibre networks, and mobile communications networks
covering the entire territory.
Ironically it is the sheer scale of that investment which has many observers
worried. Telekom has had three huge projects running simultaneously: the
eastern investment, the construction of a television cable network, now
covering 14m households - the densest in Europe - and the establishment of
mobile telephone networks.
'They are a company positioning themselves to be a global player, and to get
into all the key parts of the business,' according to one Frankfurt industry
expert. A considerable strength is Telekom's control not only of the
terrestrial telephone infrastructure in Germany, but also of the dense cable
network, opening up options for multimedia transmission.
Its recent deals with France Telecom, and the purchase of a 20 per cent
stake in Sprint, the US telecommunications company, fits with the strategy
of internationalisation. So does a push into eastern Europe, led by the
purchase of a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian telephone company, a
stake in Ukrainian Telecommunications, and an expected stake in the Czech
telephone system under negotiation.
On the downside come the burdens of the past. The biggest is the debt
burden, now standing at DM107bn, or almost 70 per cent of the balance sheet,
and rapidly inflated by the heavy investments of recent years.
Another concern is the unresolved pension question for Telekom's employees.
More than 120,000 of the 230,000 employees will retain their status of civil
servant. They cannot be fired, and will receive 75 per cent of their final
salary in guaranteed pension. The other employees have obtained deals with
many of the same advantages.
Mr Peter Paterna, chairman of the German Bundestag's post and
telecommunications committee and a leading critic of the privatisation
process, estimates the unfinanced burden of pensions and insurance payments
for employees at about DM35bn. All three arms of the postal service
combined, including the Postbank, face commitments of about DM100bn. As
public authorities, they were never required to accumulate the necessary
pension funds to pay for the future: they were to be financed from operating
income. 'The pensions issue is unresolved,' Mr Miller says. 'It cannot be
swept under the rug. It is a big black hole.'
Yet he believes the absolute debt level is more worrying. 'The interest
burden is very real,' he says.
What reassured many investment analysts who attended Telekom's presentation
last week was the prediction that the current investment programme is
peaking, and by 1996, cash flow will exceed capital expenditure, thus
gradually bringing the debt burden down. Nevertheless, they still believe
that Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, may have to take over a
portion of the debt burden to make Telekom shares more attractive in 1996.
There has also been an explosion of potential competitors from the private
sector, getting ready to compete with the monopoly once the EU enforces
competition in voice telephone services from 1998. The first was Mannesmann,
already operating a mobile phone network, which has joined forces with RWE,
the electricity utility, and Deutsche Bank to offer corporate networks. Few
expect them to stop there once the market is open.
As the telecommunications market place starts to look crowded, for Telekom
'the real question is to assess the level to which they are becoming
customer-facing, which means recognising the fact that they are a service
company,' says Mr Tim Hurst, telecoms analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
'The customer should be the measure of all things,' says Mr Horst Gellert,
the board director responsible for customer relations.
The prospect of privatisation is certainly having a galvanising effect, but
there is still a good way to go. 'They are working their way up the learning
curve,' says Mr Miller. 'Meetings with analysts still remain long and
painfully detailed.'
In spite of a massive public relations exercise, with young ladies in lilac
and grey suits popping up at public events all over Germany and abroad,
Deutsche Telekom still has a fair way to go to persuade a sceptical
investing public that it will be a lean and profitable competitor in the
harsh telecoms market round the turn of the century.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Child support
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare for government bodies to acknowledge their shortcomings, still
less to apologise for them. So Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive of the UK
Child Support Agency, deserves credit for her candid apology for the
agency's failure to provide an acceptable standard of service. Improving its
performance, however, will require a more realistic approach by ministers to
the job of making absent parents provide adequate maintenance for their
children.
The difficulties in establishing the agency have been seriously
underestimated from the outset. The Child Support Act floated through
Parliament in 1990 on the complacent assumption that it would concentrate on
extracting maintenance from the feckless and the irresponsible. Instead, it
has hit solid citizens, who have often made what they regard as adequate
provision for their children. Their effective campaign against the agency
has drowned out the case for greater support for single parents.
That case remains strong. Seventy per cent of absent parents pay no
maintenance to their children. Of those that do, the amount averages Pounds
25 a week. Most single parents live on social security, usually well below
the standard of living enjoyed by the absent partner. It is the children who
suffer the consequences, while the state pays the cost.
Attempting to improve the position of single parents by making absent
fathers pay more was bound to provoke protests. Treasury greed has made the
task much harder, however. The agency was set performance targets that were
excessively high for a new organisation involved in sensitive work. These
included a requirement to make savings of Pounds 530m in the amount of
social security paid to single parents. Aiming at this over-ambitious target
forced the agency to concentrate on the easiest cases with the greatest
scope for higher payments - fathers already paying maintenance. They have
been among the most vociferous in campaigning against the agency.
The legislation was also deficient in not providing an appeals procedure for
aggrieved parents. And it overturned 'clean-break settlements' where the
absent parent had settled property on the mother. These settlements often
left social security to support the single parent and make the mortgage
payments on the transferred home. But the retrospection involved in
overturning clean-break settlements flies in the face of natural justice.
Ministers appear to have accepted that their excessive ambition has damaged
the agency. More realistic targets have been set for this year and extra
resources provided. However, addressing issues such as retrospection and
appeals would require further legislation. The government is to be commended
for keeping its nerve on the central aims of the CSA; steering through the
necessary legislation will be a still bigger task.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Personal View: Three cheers for a weak dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WYNNE GODLEY and WILLIAM MILBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trade-weighted dollar has fallen about 5 per cent since April, but this
must be seen in perspective. The dollar had previously been trending upwards
and, even after the recent fall, it is still 3 per cent above its 1992
average.
President Bill Clinton is 'puzzled' by the weak dollar at a time when the US
economy is so 'strong', and markets around the world are jittery because
they fear that the Federal Reserve is going to put up interest rates again.
But are the US authorities right to resist the dollar slide, such as it is?
As it happens, Clinton's 'strong' economy has been heading for the rocks,
even if these are still on the horizon. In the first quarter of 1994, the
current balance of payments was 2 per cent of gross domestic product in
deficit, having deteriorated fast through 1993. Import penetration of the
US, still relatively low by international standards, has for years been
growing much faster than penetration of foreign markets by US exports.
We calculate that, other things (including exchange rates) being equal,
world output has to rise at least 1.5 times as fast as US output for the US
balance of trade to remain a constant share of GDP. For many years this is
what happened, as productivity in other countries rose towards US levels.
But, since the mid-1980s, growth in the rest of the world has been only a
little faster than US growth, so the underlying US trade deficit has
deteriorated in a secular fashion.
As a result, US foreign indebtedness has begun to build up in an
unsustainable way. In the last 20 years the US has become the world's
debtor, and by the end of 1993 had net foreign liabilities worth about 12
per cent of GDP. For a long time the loss of overseas wealth did not
obviously matter because, with recorded profits on foreign direct investment
in the US so low, the total net flow of property income across the exchanges
remained positive.
But the tide has just turned. During the last few quarters, the income flow
has become negative and, if the US trade deficit (including transfers) were
to be a steady 2 1/4 per of GDP in deficit, the outflow would build up quite
rapidly from now on. The US current account deficit as a whole would rise to
nearly 4 per cent of GDP in 10 years and net foreign debt would approach 40
per cent of GDP - the proportion that normally relegates countries to the
ignominious 'highly indebted' category. Matters would be far worse if
interest rates rose further or if the balance of trade deteriorated even
more.
Things could never really get that bad. Long before the US deficit and
foreign debt rose to such levels, corrective forces would come into play.
The danger is that the correction, when it came, would take the form of
demand disinflation, as it always has with debtor countries in the past. If
this were to happen, a new twist would be given to the recessionary screw,
with endemic unemployment, not just in the US but in the rest of the world
as well, ratcheted up several more notches.
A devaluation of the dollar now, before things get out of hand, seems to be
just what is needed. The effects on the US economy of changes in the
exchange rate are far less costly than in the textbook story - less costly,
too, than in the UK experience. Dollar devaluations only seem to have a very
small effect on US import prices, real wages and the terms of trade, and as
imports of goods and services are still only 11 to 12 per cent of GDP, the
direct effect of a (say) 10 per cent devaluation on US price levels is a
mere quarter of 1 per cent.
On the other hand, the fact that the dollar price of exports is unresponsive
to devaluation means that the price of exports denominated in foreign
currency falls a lot when devaluation occurs, causing the trade balance to
improve in a very lively way.
A fall in the dollar, even if this goes considerably further than it has
already, should therefore be positively welcomed by the US authorities, and
by the rest of the world as well. It offers some hope that a significant
part of the US chronic payments imbalance, which poses a grave long-term
threat to activity and employment throughout the world, will be ameliorated
in a timely fashion.
If the US authorities succeed now in supporting the dollar, they will only
make the underlying problem worse. If they raise interest rates further in
the process, the error will be compounded because the outflow of interest
payments on its foreign debt will build up faster, bringing forward the day
of reckoning.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Living with the bomb: North Korea's actions have highlighted
flaws in the nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest problem facing American diplomats, ahead of Friday's negotiating
session with the North Koreans in Geneva about their secret nuclear
programme, is to guess the ultimate objectives of the Stalinist regime in
Pyongyang.
Optimists like former US President Jimmy Carter, who made a lightning
freelance trip to Pyongyang last month, hope Kim Il Sung may be ready to
trade his nuclear ambitions against international recognition and economic
aid. But pessimists fear that he is committed to the nuclear weapons
programme. Carter may know something we don't; but the circumstantial
evidence, from all the ducking and weaving over many years, tends to support
the pessimists.
North Korea was always a reluctant member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. It signed the treaty under pressure from the Soviet Union in 1985,
but it did not ratify the accompanying inspection arrangements with the
International Atomic Energy Agency until 1992, five years after the NPT
deadline.
Not long after ratification, North Korea informed the IAEA that it had seven
nuclear installations; the agency had only previously been aware of two. But
when the IAEA demanded to inspect two hitherto secret sites at Yongbyon,
North Korea announced it would leave the treaty. Under pressure from the US
and others, North Korea backed off; but last month, after further hindrances
over inspection, it announced that it would leave the IAEA.
Because of Pyongyang's obstructiveness, we still do not know what has been
going on at the secret nuclear sites. But the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty cannot remain un-scathed by the North Korean experience; the question
is whether it is fatally damaged.
Current speculation is that North Korea may be diverting fuel rods from
nuclear reactors to acquire and reprocess plutonium, which could be used for
nuclear weapons. But American intelligence believes North Korea already has
one or two nuclear weapons, which it had constructed before 1992; maybe that
is why it delayed so long in submitting its pretend compliance with the NPT.
Here we have a classic stable-door dilemma. If North Korea does have a
couple of nuclear weapons, there is no point in the Americans raising the
issue, because the North Koreans will deny it; they will certainly not leave
them out in the open to be inspected. Therefore, the Americans are almost
bound to turn a blind eye to this more fundamental problem. What they are
left with instead is a deadpan debate over the controversial fuel rods.
The trouble is that this is a negotiation. The Americans want North Korea to
conform absolutely to the NPT and reaffirm its formal status as a
non-nuclear state. Since no negotiation ever leads to 100 per cent success
for one side, this result is impossible. So if there is a negotiated
settlement, it must involve a significant weakening of the rules of the NPT.
Many people look for a scapegoat; and the first scapegoat they spot is the
IAEA. 'Aha]' they say; 'if the IAEA inspection systems had been more
rigorous, we would have known about the North Koreans long ago, and about
the wicked Iraqis before them.'
Well, they may have a point; but it is, in any political reality you or I
would recognise, only a small point; for the issues at stake are much more
complex than that.
In the world of arms control, verification is a subject on which there is
only one certainty: you cannot have certainty. It may be possible to imagine
an international inspection regime so thorough and so intrusive that no
state would have a secret it could call its own. In theory this would
guarantee complete compliance with any arms control treaty; but the treaty
would not be signed, let alone ratified, by a single one of the 160
sovereign states in the UN.
The best you can hope for is some degree of probability; the arms control
experts will argue till dawn over how much is enough. But the starting point
is that an arms control treaty should seem, to all the sovereign
signatories, to be self-justifying in itself: on balance, joining should
seem a better bargain than not joining. For then verification can play the
modest role of circumstantial indicator of willing compliance, not pretend
to be an alternative to it.
There are two reasons why these principles are not working out in the case
of the NPT. The first is that this treaty is deeply discriminatory between
the signatories. Its very purpose is to discriminate against
non-nuclear-weapon states; and, as a result, its inspection regime also
discriminates against them. Moreover, the NPT mainly discriminates against
less developed states, because some of them are still tempted by the nuclear
option.
The NPT's second weakness is that it is a child of the cold war, the product
of the arms control which grew out of the nuclear confrontation between the
two superpowers. North Korea and Iraq signed, only because they were put
under pressure by the Soviet Union; and today no other country can exert
that pressure on them.
Last November, US President Bill Clinton said: 'North Korea cannot be
allowed to develop a nuclear bomb.' But the administration subsequently
backed off from that absolute position, no doubt because it was not sure how
it could be enforced. Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, seems to
believe that the US should be prepared to go to war to enforce it; but this
seems unlikely.
We may have to live with the possibility, or perhaps the probability, that
North Korea, like Israel (client of the US), is an undeclared nuclear power;
because we can't do anything reasonable about it.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions white paper falls down on
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK RITTNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr N G Preston's letter (July 2) is timely. The worst of the legacies
of Robert Maxwell has not been his plundering of pension funds but the
extent to which government thinking has been obsessed with regulation,
security and the custody of pension funds to the exclusion of a wider
consideration of the inadequacies of the present system. Both the Goode
Commission and the recent white paper have confirmed and reinforced the cosy
bureaucratic conspiracy between the public and private pensions
establishments. Apart from a small, but important, proposal (on flexible
vesting) the white paper fails totally to suggest any reforms or even to
hint that they might be necessary.
The secretary of state is to be congratulated on obtaining legislative time
in the next session of parliament for a comprehensive pensions bill. The
white paper only goes half way to reform. The ideas put forward by Frank
Field and Matthew Owen, the proposals set out by former economic secretary
to the Treasury, John Maples (Personal View, November 12 1993), and the
ideas offered by the late Philip Chapell and Lord Vinson on pension fund
ownership are some of the informed and constructive ideas being put forward
at the present time.
It would be tragic indeed if social security secretary, Peter Lilley, funked
the opportunity for a radical rethink. What is needed perhaps is not just a
white paper but, following the Goode report, an even better commission]

FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Support for CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M C F SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to articles by Charles Batchelor and Kevin Brown ('CrossRail
plan doomed despite MPs' support', July 1; 'Expiry of London's Pounds 110m
ticket to nowhere', July 2), in which reference is made to a 13-point letter
sent by Dr John Marek MP to his Labour Party colleagues.
In the letter, Dr Marek says if 'the promoters rethink the proposals and
have a go at integrating CrossRail with the rest of the transport network,
the project should be given the go-ahead'.
The CrossRail promoters welcome this support, because this is precisely the
position. CrossRail is already planned to connect to 26 lines through 46
interchanges. In addition, the promoters have stated they will give binding
undertakings to the committee to promote an additional provision that will
provide for the construction of links to Heathrow Express and the proposed
Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
Finally, it is significant that nowhere within Dr Marek's 13 points or the
full letter does he say that CrossRail should not go ahead.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HURLSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is no need to look to America to see the advantages of employee
ownership ('Benefit of employee ownership', June 25).
Research published last month by the Esop Centre showed that managers of
more than four out of five non-quoted British companies with employee share
ownership plans (Esops) felt their employees were better motivated and more
productive because of the Esop. Furthermore, 58 per cent of managers of Esop
companies said their profits had grown faster than their competitors, with
the rest saying profits had grown at the same level.
The share prices of companies with Esops grew by an astonishing 43 per cent
every year, on average. Those companies whose share prices have performed
the best, however, are the ones which communicate with their employees and
provide them with information. Conversely, those companies which have made
no changes to management-employee communication since setting up an Esop
have been ones with the worst performing share prices.
Statistics such as these persuaded the government to relax some of the
restrictions on setting up statutory Esops in this year's Finance Act.

<TEXT>
Sir, After reading John Postgate's diatribe against religion ('Religion: are
we better off without it?', June 18), it was refreshing to read in the same
issue about another scientist, Conway Morris, who trusts his intuitions in
non-scientific as well as in scientific matters. Postgate's case might have
been stronger if he had not judged religion by its worst representatives and
science by its best. Fundamentalists are no more characteristic of the best
in religion than are cheats and frauds representative of the best in
science.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pressure on paper prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W J BARTLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I note, with interest, that according to the British Printing
Industries Federation (Letters July 1) 'today's price for printing ranges
from 1990 levels to 5 per cent below that', and that 'at the depth of the
recession it was 6-10 per cent below the peak touched in mid-1990'.
We appreciate the dilemma faced by printers in passing on costs and, if the
pulp and paper manufacturers had been able to hold price reductions during
the recession to 6-10 per cent, I can confidently say printers would not be
facing the scale of paper price recovery they are today.
However, the fact is that manufacturers' prices for most bulk grades of
printing and writing papers fell by between 30 and 40 per cent between 1989
and 1993 (during which period inflation rose by 22 per cent). This has led
to massive losses by pulp and many paper manufacturers - for some, the
largest they have ever incurred.
In facing the fact that it is essential for pulp and paper prices to recover
and the industry to return to profitability, we should not lose sight of the
long-term trend - over the past 20 years, a substantial fall in prices in
real terms as the industry continues to invest in technology and techniques
in a highly competitive market.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gibraltar assured of insurance status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J J BOSSANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To complete the picture so comprehensively set out in your article on
the single market in insurance ('Hard work to be free and single: A look at
the opportunities and constraints of a single European market in insurance',
July 1), your readers will wish to know that, within this context, Gibraltar
is in fact deemed to be a separate member state.
This is reflected in the new UK regulations which amended the 1982 act so
that it applies 'as if Gibraltar were a separate member state'. Insurance
companies in Gibraltar fully comply with European Community law and are
required to match UK standards. They are licensed by the Financial Services
Commission which is ultimately accountable to the UK but on a day-to-day
basis acts independently of the British and Gibraltar governments.
In terms of the single market, I believe Gibraltar has the ingredients to
become the most competitive location.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Cracks merely papered over: Deborah Hargreaves says pulp
price rises come at a difficult time for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writing a letter is about to become a more expensive pastime; so too might
reading glossy magazines or books.
The cost of paper is rising steeply. In Britain, prices have risen so
rapidly that printers and publishers complained earlier this year to the
Office of Fair Trading that paper makers were operating a cartel.
But for the paper companies, the response has generally been 'if only that
were true'. They argue they are only passing on the sharp increases in the
cost of their raw material - wood pulp.
After five years of falling prices, pulp manufacturers had by this year cut
back output. An unexpected pick-up in demand has therefore led to price
rises of up to 50 per cent since January.
To a large extent, the pulp market is following the pattern of other
commodities, such as coffee and copper, which have risen in price as the
world's economies have emerged from recession. North American producers
recently announced their fourth rise in pulp prices this year, due to take
effect later this month or in August. By that time, the price of northern
bleached softwood kraft pulp - used as the benchmark in the industry - will
have risen from Dollars 390 a tonne last year to Dollars 620 (Pounds 408).
Paper producers are passing on these increases to their customers - printers
and publishers - with varying success. They have been most successful in the
market for high-quality paper. Prices for the highest grades of paper have
been marked up by 20 per cent since the beginning of the year.
In the newsprint market, many paper manufacturers have stopped discounting
prices they charge newspaper publishers. 'The moment we have the
opportunity, prices will inevitably go up,' says Mr Andre Van Hattum,
chairman of Bridgewater Paper, one of the UK's largest newsprint
manufacturers.
But media moguls such as Mr Conrad Black, publisher of The Daily Telegraph,
who is engaged in a price-cutting war with other newspapers, will be anxious
to resist further increases when annual supply contracts are renegotiated
towards the end of the year. That raises the question of which sector will
suffer the biggest squeeze on profits - pulp producers, paper manufacturers
or printing?
If paper mills and pulp producers are unable to pass on the rising cost of
raw materials, their already low margins will fall further. Many have been
operating at a loss for the past three to five years.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, says his company has
not made a profit for four years, and during that time has lost CDollars
460m (Pounds 218m). He estimates his return on capital employed has averaged
less than 3 per cent over the past 10 years - a figure regarded as typical
in the industry.
But there are signs the tide may be turning, and Mr Oberlander says he is
confident that the industry is heading for a period of improved financial
performance.
His optimism is based on the assumption that manufacturers will be able to
continue pushing up prices. Certainly paper makers are able to argue
increases are justified: in the past five years, during the worst recession
the industry has suffered, prices fell sharply and have not yet returned to
previous peak levels. Newsprint prices, for instance, dropped last year to
their lowest point in real terms since records began in 1924 and so far have
returned only to 1990 levels.
Nevertheless, paper manufacturers are still being squeezed, as the prices
they charge paper users are not yet rising as fast as their raw material
costs. Pulp prices are being driven upwards by supply shortages caused by
three main factors: The steep fall in prices pulp manufacturers were willing
to pay over the past few years has meant many lumber farmers in Nordic
countries, which account for about 17 per cent of the world pulp market,
decided not to harvest their trees last year. The collapse of the former
Soviet Union - one of the largest producers of high-quality birch pulp - has
disrupted supplies to the large pulp manufacturers in Finland, Norway and
Sweden. Many pulp makers in countries around the world have shut down
operations, temporarily or permanently, as prices declined to below their
costs of production.
In large part, the crisis in the industry has been exacerbated by the pulp
producers themselves, which had previously built up capacity to such an
extent they were forced into cut-throat competition to hold on to markets.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging
group, describes the overcapacity as a 'home-made mess'.
That overcapacity has now been reversed, thanks to a rise in paper
consumption. Mr Roger Digney, marketing director at UK Paper, Britain's
biggest supplier of high-quality printing papers, says: 'The huge growth in
orders has been quite uncanny and it seemed to hit the whole of western
Europe simultaneously.'
Paper and pulp manufacturers appear to have been caught out by the strength
of world economic recovery and the growth of the paper market. At the same
time, strong growth in Asian paper markets has boosted Japanese paper mills,
which in turn have bought more European pulp.
The industry also appeared to have assumed the problems of excess supply
would remain for some years. When the pulp industry was dogged by
overcapacity, paper mills and printers became used to ordering raw materials
for instant delivery. As a consequence, they ran down their stocks.
Now paper mills are finding it hard to offer quick deliveries. 'We're
finding it extremely difficult to buy the amount of pulp we need to keep our
machines going,' says Mr Digney. In spite of the recent rise in prices, he
says some smaller paper mills have shut through lack of supplies.
There has been a knock-on effect on pulp makers, which are eating into their
own inventories of timber as they rush to meet world demand. It is estimated
the world stock of pulp will last 22 days at current consumption rates -
down from 35 days' supply last year.
Mr John Bingham, at the London office of consultancy Hawkins Wright, which
advises the forest products industry, says most pulp makers have full order
books for the next three months. The capacity utilisation rate - the
proportion of the industry's production facilities in use - among the
industry's largest and most efficient producers has risen to 92 per cent
from about 80 per cent last year.
Another factor is adding uncertainty to an already over-heated market. There
is the threat of a strike by British Columbian pulp mill workers, who
recently rejected management attempts to introduce mill-by-mill wage
bargaining. The possibility of disrupted pulp supplies from one of the
largest markets has encouraged the build-up of supplies.
The danger the pulp and paper manufacturers now face is that the cycle of
chronic overcapacity followed by a rapid fall in prices will be repeated, if
the supply of pulp now grows too rapidly. 'Pulp makers can't expect to keep
pumping it out at this rate indefinitely,' says Mr Bingham.
Mr Oberlander argues pulp and paper manufacturers are their own worst
enemies. 'If history has judged this industry harshly, it's because of our
inability to manage the periods of prosperity and our inability during these
periods to spend money wisely,' he says.
Unless manufacturers are able to predict with greater accuracy the future
patterns of demand, they may find that users of their products - the
printers and publishers - will retain the upper hand in price negotiations.
Mr Oberlander calls for a more co-operative approach among pulp and paper
producers to deal with issues that go beyond short-term competitive
pressures. They need to address such long-term subjects as the competition
from multimedia and environmental issues, he says.
But as one paper producer comments: 'In a business where the margins are
virtually nil, what can you do but concentrate on immediate market prices?'

FT  06 JUL 94 / Arts: Fanny Burney's 'Busy Day' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all her importance as a text-book figure in the history of the English
novel, Fanny Burney is less often quoted than her father, Charles, who sheds
an invaluable light on musical Europe in the 18th century. Yet if Fanny
Burney the author is neglected, Fanny Burney the person exercises an
increasing fascination. One-woman shows are not infrequent, and are a
reminder of her courage, cheerfulness and independence. The RSC's royal
anthology, The Hollow Crown, immortalised her near-surreal encounters with
dotty George III and lugubrious Queen Charlotte. Journalistic vividness,
perceptiveness and sympathy allied to high spirits and good sense explain
why Jane Austen admired her.
That much comes over in A Busy Day, one of Burney's unpublished plays, now
at the King's Head Theatre, Islington, after its premiere from the
Bristol-based Show of Strength Theatre Company last September. It would be
good to see a really polished production, by the RSC, say, that imposed
discipline on this panorama of late Georgian heiresses, fortune-seekers,
snobs, beaux and arrivistes. This version is rustic but hearty, the overall
effect resembling a jolly school play - the main impression being so
homespun that the professional credentials in the cast's potted biographies
come as a surprise.
'Adapted, produced and directed' by Alan Coveney, the play reveals elements
old and new. An emphasis on fortune (mortgages, dowries, inheritances) looks
forward oddly to Bulwer Lytton's Money, which also has a clubland scene and
a tendency to foppish caricature (Lytton's fatuous Frederick Blount is
surely a descendant of Burney's languidly inert Lord John). The grotesquely
snobbish Lady Wilhelmina is the comic dragon with aspirations and
pretension, an aristocratic version of Mrs Hardcastle or Mrs Malaprop. Our
heroine Eliza has an embarrassing family she has grown away from, like Fanny
Price in Mansfield Park; and the Austen link is strengthened by the
supremely selfish Sir Marmaduke, a comic distortion of Sir Walter Elliott in
Persuasion.
Not that the work exists only as a thesis-writer's goldmine of cultural
references. As the distended romp of this production shows, it has comic
vitality, notably in such characters as Eliza's bedizened, nouveau-riche
mother and sister, or the man-mad Miss Percival, whom Juliette Grassby has
honking in mock-panic at imagined amatory pursuers. The hero's foppish
brother is more conventional (though Ian Kelly's comic gifts come into their
own), but, in this slightly unbalanced and still too long adaptation,
manages to take over the plot with Miss Percival, now a spiteful avenger.
The plot rambles, and I suspect such astonishingly Wildean remarks as 'One
has no chance with any girl until her family are all against one' owe more
to the adaptor than Miss Burney. What emerges is Burney's tolerance; it just
saves her from being snobbish about lower-class ambitions or reactionary in
her championship of middle-class values, just as her sense of humour redeems
her from the charge of Thatcherism in her accolade of the City and its
socio-economic virtues. The cast enjoy themselves and may soon learn how to
pronounce 'harass' and 'exquisitely' in the traditional English way rather
than the American.
Fanny Burney's other plays may well deserve a look.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Arts: The changing shape of history - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For anybody still wondering if we really live in 'the age of television',
the past week must surely have settled things. It is not so much the
material which television creates itself which matters - although the repeat
of Monty Python's Flying Circus on BBC2 on Sundays does emphasise the extent
to which television has been defining the zeitgeist for several decades.
More significant are the events which measure out our lives and which we now
tend to experience via television; matters in which television does not
create the programme material but seems at first sight to be acting simply
as a medium of communication. The American space programme, the activities
of the royal family, and sporting events such as Wimbledon and Grand Prix
motor racing are examples. Such things may be affected very much by being
conveyed via television; in some instances they may be changed, sometimes
profoundly. In extreme cases they may cease to have any real significance
except as television.
When rain stopped play at Old Trafford on Monday, BBC2 showed a tape of a
1973 Test between England and New Zealand, and you suddenly remembered what
cricket used to be like. Not only were the players not wearing the kiddy-kit
which is now required for so many televised matches, they did not have a
single line of writing on their white shirts, wore English caps, and there
was no advertising painted on the pitch. Television has changed cricket.
Watching the Wimbledon finals, the French Grand Prix, and the Tour de France
it was hard to avoid the feeling that all major sports are steadily becoming
adjuncts to television. Wimbledon and the Tour feel increasingly like
branches of the marketing business, and it seems unlikely that Sampras would
have walked away with Pounds 345,000 but for television's involvement. Not
long ago it was a novelty to have television pictures delivered from inside
a racing car; in the French Grand Prix most of the cars seemed to be fitted
with cameras. For BBC1's new series The Contenders starting on Friday they
have fitted miniature cameras to the forehead of hurdler Colin Jackson and
the back of high-board diver Bobby Morgan. How long before Olympic athletes
are fitted with cameras? How long before the Olympics are seen solely as a
television event?
Throughout most of history monarchs have been known to their subjects via
their portraits on coins. What little our parents knew about the royal
family came from cinema newsreels and newspapers. Today thanks to television
the British royal family is as familiar as soap opera stars. True, it seems
that last week's studiously hyped ITV documentary about Prince Charles
achieved a rating rather lower than that for Coronation Street which
preceded it. However, the reason, presumably, is that it lasted two and a
half hours and included some dreadfully boring passages.
Vigorous editing could have transformed a wearisome 150 minute programme
into a taut 50 minutes containing all the important bits. Perhaps it was
only by including the tedious details about foreign visits and duties that
the programme makers managed to get the access they wanted, but the result
will have been that even if the transmission began with 25 million or so
viewers, many will have given up. The royal family may live to regret the
way they have embraced television, but there is no mistaking the fact that
they have. It could even be argued that, like the Olympics, the royal family
is ceasing to have much significance except as a television phenomenon.
The best example, however, of the way that we may now experience some of the
most important parts of our lives via television has come from BBC2's series
on the American space programme, One Small Step. At the time of the Apollo
missions, like many others I was enthralled and inspired. When the first
astronauts were on the dark side of the moon and no one knew for sure that
we would ever see them again, I stayed up all night in front of my first
television set and went bleary eyed to the office next day to discuss every
arcane detail with other newspapermen who had done the same.
Our knowledge came solely from television. Of course the trappings helped:
the music from 'Also sprach Zarathustra', the portentous build-up from
Mission Control ('Zero minus three minutes and counting . . . all engines
running . . . we have a lift off' and then that volcanic roar from the
biggest engines ever built). But beyond the trappings was a feeling that
something immense was happening; that what we were watching was on a par
with the setting sail of the 15th century navigators.
One Small Step did a good job in recalling not only what happened, but how
it felt at the time (particularly impressive given that the BBC has, by all
accounts, destroyed the material showing James Burke, Patrick Moore and the
others at the British end, enthusing over the space missions). Most telling
of all, though, is the way in which history and hindsight show that the
American space effort was organised as part of the cold war. Vox pops
preserved from the streets at the time prove that Americans had swallowed
the propaganda of the McCarthy era and were appalled and terrified at the
thought of the Russians ('They can't even make refrigerators]') leading with
Sputnik, the first animal in space, the first man in space, the first woman
in space, the first team in space, the first space walk, and so on.
I still suspect that our descendants will see man's escape from terrestrial
gravity as one of the great milestones in human history. Yet there is no
denying that, seen from a distance of a mere 25 years, the American space
effort now looks like a finite television event. It is hard to believe that
the moon programme would ever have been undertaken as a part of the cold war
(itself a meaningless concept outside the age of mass communications) except
in the television era. The presence of this new mass medium does help shape
our very history. Yes, we are living in the age of television.

Remember the experts who swore that smoking was good for asthma? The experts
who reckoned we were heading straight for a new ice age? And the other
experts who simultaneously warned of the greenhouse effect? Now we are told
that 'Experts believe that inactivity is as dangerous as smoking 20
cigarettes a day' and if today's 'couch potato kids' do not mend their ways
they will cause a national health crisis. This latest danger is addressed in
Open Space (BBC2 8.00). One day someone will have to make a programme
reconciling all the life-threatening phenomena identified by experts with
the fact that life expectancy keeps going up by leaps and bounds. The first
of a new series of Grand Tour (7.20 Radio 4) features Tangiers as seen by
novelist Paul Bowles who has lived in the city since the 1940s. Countryfile
is one of those Barbour-and-wellie programmes which appear to be intended
more for the townie viewer who idealises the countryside than for country
dwellers themselves. Today, presenter John Craven investigates Britain's
largest agricultural show, at Stoneleigh (7.30 BBC1).

FT  06 JUL 94 / Arts: Judith Weir at the Cheltenham Festival - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the current funding climate, the Cheltenham International Festival of
Music deserves a party just for surviving to have a 50th birthday. Ticket
sales this year are looking good enough to suggest confidence in the future
 -a tribute to John Manduell, who retires as programme director this year
after no less than 25 years in the job.
A festival which has spent half its life under the leadership of one man is
likely to have a distinct profile, as Cheltenham indeed does. Together with
Aldeburgh, it is one of the two UK summer music festivals with an emphasis
on living composers. Perhaps the spa town gentility of Cheltenham has always
tended to favour the kind of new music that is unlikely to offend, but that
matters less these days than it used to.
In the 1960s music had to be difficult to be accorded serious study. Now the
user-friendly composer has become fashionable. Alongside minimalists like
Glass and Adams, Cheltenham's favoured composers have started to sound quite
gritty. Michael Berkeley and Judith Weir (both have had operas premiered at
the festival in recent years) are most in evidence, Berkeley because he is
due to take over as Manduell's successor next year.
In the case of Judith Weir,
the festival offers the opportunity to catch up on a couple of orchestral
scores commissioned and first performed by foreign orchestras. Music,
Untangled forms part of the closing concert on July 17; Heroic Strokes of
the Bow, which started life in 1992 with the chamber-sized Westdeutsche
Sinfonia, was included in the BBC Symphony Orchestra's programme last
weekend.
Like everything by Judith Weir, the piece says what it wants to say and no
more. It lasts about 15 minutes, starting with massed violin bow strokes to
reflect the title and proceeding to further distinct groups of ideas, which
do not so much develop as occasionally collide with each other.
The work was inspired by a blue painting by Klee, but Weir says she feels
that it has turned out more a shade of grainy dark green. I cannot claim to
have heard either of these colours in the music. What is present is a desire
to make
every scrap of material tell in
the way that Stravinsky use to, for example in the Symphony in Three
Movements.
Weir's score loses its sense of direction in the middle, but revives towards
the end with statements that build up a feeling of cumulative power, of
having set a goal and achieved it.
For this performance she had the right performers, but the wrong venue.
Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra had prepared the music
diligently to give it the exactness that it needs, but the resonant acoustic
of Cheltenham Town Hall did its best to undo
their good work.
Similarly, there seemed to be a lot of detail carefully rehearsed in Holst's
The Planets after the interval, if only we could have heard more of it.
The festival continues with opera and ballet, more concerts, and a complete
cycle of the Beethoven String Quartets.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Urbanised shanty town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shanty town of Jordanopolis, like hundreds of others in Sao Paulo city,
sprang up on unoccupied ground 20 years ago and is now well entrenched. Its
precarious brick houses, homes to 800 families, are supplied with
electricity, water and - soon - sewers.
Jordanopolis is part of Project Guarapiranga, named after a reservoir in the
south of Sao Paulo city. Four years ago, the reservoir's water, which
supplies 3m people, deteriorated rapidly. Chief culprits were the open
sewers from shanty towns that have encircled part of the reservoir. The
project, which is mainly financed by the World Bank and Sao Paulo's state
government, aims to tackle the problem by installing proper sewers and
building roads to allow better rubbish collection.
But the project also shows how difficult it will be to clean up the Tiete,
into which waste water from the shanty towns eventually flows. Installing
infrastructure like sewers in the favelas is difficult and expensive. Their
houses cluster together without streets, and they are often perched on
hillsides and marginal ground.
The government is neither willing, for social reasons, nor able, for
financial reasons, to resettle inhabitants elsewhere. 'To show how complex
it is, we're having to 'urbanise' these areas by installing small roads for
access and sewers. Everything has to be discussed with the inhabitants,
too,' says Ivan Carlos Maglio, the project's co-ordinator.
The Dollars 262m project plans to install more than 300km of sewers, as well
as developing more than 1,000 acres of parks and leisure areas. A planned
rubbish collection system will daily collect 190 tonnes of waste which is
currently washed into the reservoir.
'Pollution should stop once the project is finished. But it needs education
as well to stop people throwing everything in the sewer system, which is a
serious problem,' says Maglio.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Chernobyl's fate on the table
 -Jill Barshay on a dilemma for G7 nations as they meet this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The road to Chernobyl is strikingly green. Even the abandoned ghost town,
where the power station's employees used to live just 13km from the
reactors, is surrounded with densely packed evergreen and birch trees. Only
the monstrous cement and steel sarcophagus, covering the remnants of the
exploded fourth reactor, reminds the visitor that a terrible disaster
happened here eight years ago.
Radiation levels have fallen considerably around most areas at the station
to about the level of Kiev. Though safety precautions are still observed
inside the reactors, outside workers and engineers no longer button up their
outer body suits and often skip radiation checks at in spite of random
patches of high contamination.
The fate of Chernobyl will be a main topic at a meeting of the seven
industrialised nations in Italy this week. Both the European Union and the
US have been seeking to shut the station's two operating reactors since the
Ukrainian parliament voted last October to keep them open.
While western pressure is heightening, Ukraine is building its production
capacity at Chernobyl. Contract labourers from western Ukraine are working
around the clock to dismantle the old generator in a third reactor, which
has been shut since a 1991 fire, and are preparing to put it on line again
by 1997.
Government ministers now freely admit that a secret presidential decree was
issued last February to restart this reactor. Under domestic political
pressure, the State Committee for Nuclear Safety gave a preliminary green
light last Wednesday for the work to continue.
Officials have argued persuasively that the electricity produced at
Chernobyl, where each reactor saves Ukraine 2m tonnes of Russian oil a year,
is vital for their nation's survival. They point out the reactors are no
less safe than the other 13 antiquated graphite core reactors of this type
that are scattered throughout Russia and Lithuania, but for which the west
is not pressing immediate closure. 'Chernobyl is being isolated because of
its symbolism and world opinion rather than its reality,' says Viktor
Baryakhtar, vice president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.
Beyond the future of Ukraine's graphite core reactors, Ukraine is eager for
western assistance in a greenfield clean-up of the Chernobyl zone. A new
sarcophagus is needed to cover the existing one over the destroyed fourth
reactor. Some 1,000 sq m of cracks originated with the hasty installation of
the shell following the 1986 disaster. More than half have been sealed with
fibreglass glue, but at least 400 sq m of cracks remain, admitting sun and
rain to 10 tonnes of highly radioactive dust.
Nuclear waste burial sites, filled with contaminated reactor parts from the
explosion, also present an environmental hazard. These underground dumps
have not been lined with clay, allowing the risk that radiation could seep
into the water supply, although the water table is low in this area.
Ukraine is willing to close the Chernobyl reactors if the west would offer a
'comprehensive solution', which includes new reactors to build Ukraine's
domestic energy production and a full clean-up from the 1986 explosion. The
issue is how much and how broad this compensation package will be. So far
the EU has offered only Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) of what it estimates will be a
total Ecu1.35bn G7 package to close the reactors.
'Ukraine has not formulated its position yet. We're waiting for the G7 to
make an offer and we'll start our serious negotiation from there and say
what Ukraine can do for this amount of money,' explains Yuri Kostenko,
environment minister. Part of western frustration is that Chernobyl is not
seen as a danger by Ukrainian officials, but as a bargaining chip. There is
the fear that Kiev will continually up the ante and stall as it did during
the negotiations over getting rid of its nuclear arms.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Green river rising - Angus
Foster reports on an ambitious public health scheme to clean up Sao Paulo's
river system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Tiete river, which took slavers and adventurers into the country's
interior in colonial times, now carries a less visible but equally dangerous
cargo - pollution.
The river flows through the centre of Sao Paulo city, whose sprawling mess
of concrete and shanty towns is home to nearly 17m inhabitants. It is
probably one of the most polluted rivers in the world. About 40 per cent of
its flow is untreated sewage, because of the city's shortage of sewers and
treatment stations. More than 1,000 tonnes of organic waste are dumped in
the river daily, along with about 3 tonnes of untreated inorganic waste,
including chemicals and heavy metals. In some stretches, the river is
biologically dead.
Annual floods wash polluted water into the homes of the urban poor who live
along the banks, increasing the risks of diseases such as cholera and
leptospirosis.
Worse, the pollution is not quickly carried into the sea. The Tiete flows
inland before linking with the huge Parana river. Sao Paulo's rubbish
reaches the sea several thousand miles later, near Buenos Aires.
Now a start has been made on cleaning up the Tiete. A huge project launched
in 1992 by the Sao Paolo state government aims to cut the river's pollution
'in half' by next year, and bring the river 'back to life' by 2005. The
programme may cost Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), making it one of the biggest
public health works under way in the world.
The project's general aim is supported by politicians and environmentalists.
But its schedule has been criticised as designed to capture public
imagination rather than being realistic. Brazil's frequent changes of
government often lead to delays of infrastructure projects. Last month,
tenders for two sewage treatment stations were put on hold, apparently for
political reasons ahead of October's general elections.
More important, Sao Paulo has suffered from poor long-term urban planning
since the capital's rapid industrialisation began in the 1950s. The growth
in shanty towns, which are difficult to link to sewage systems, and the lack
of industrial zoning, which would group difficult wastes, suggest that
cleaning up the Tiete will take longer than the government hopes, and that
the already high costs will rise.
The most important element of the project is a planned increase in domestic
sewage treatment. According to Jose Fernando da Costa Boucinhas, Sao Paulo
state's secretary of planning, only 10 per cent of domestic sewage was
treated in 1990. This very low rate is partly due to past lack of state
government interest, and partly because lax municipalities built sewers
straight into the Tiete and its tributaries, rather than building
interceptors linked to treatment stations. 'The Tiete is the symbol of the
project, but most of the pollution comes from the tributaries which flow
into it,' says Edson Jose Andrigueti, project co-ordinator.
A Dollars 900m first phase, due for completion by the end of this year but
likely to slip back to the middle of 1995, is designed to increase this
treatment rate to 50 per cent, leading to an immediate improvement in the
Tiete's water quality. Most of the increase will stem from the introduction
of an activated sludge treatment station to serve three of Sao Paulo's
biggest municipalities in the south.
Work on the station began more than 10 years ago, but has been stalled by
successive governments opposed to the project for political reasons or
because of financial problems. Some equipment, such as compressors for the
station's eight aeration tanks, have been in storage ever since. According
to the plant's technicians, this equipment is out of date but will still
function.
Money for the first phase came in equal part from Sabesp, Sao Paulo's
state-owned water and sewage company, and the Inter-American Development
Bank. A second phase, likely to cost a further Dollars 1.2bn, will take the
total length of sewers installed under the project to nearly 2,000km and add
a further two treatment stations. The target is 100 per cent treatment by
2006, although Andrigueti admits that will be difficult to achieve.
Although domestic sewage and rubbish accounts for about 70 per cent of the
volume of pollution in the Tiete, industrial waste is probably equally
harmful. Sao Paulo is home to most of Brazil's biggest polluters, such as
its car, chemicals and metals industries. The country's economic problems
have provided companies with an excuse to delay environmental spending, even
when tougher legislation was introduced five years ago.
The clean-up project targeted 1,250 companies that were deemed the most
serious polluters. They were given until the end of this year to arrange
pre-treatment of wastes to be discharged into the public system.
According to Boucinhas, 840 companies are now complying, mainly by
installing pre-treatment facilities at their sites. According to critics,
the effort to clean up the big polluters is welcome, but largely symbolic.
Since most of these companies are well-known or multinationals, most had
already moved towards pre-treatment. Also, government claims that these
companies represented as much as 80 per cent of industrial pollution are
challenged by environmentalists, who say it is impossible to measure
pollution from Sao Paulo's thousands of small companies.
'Some companies are doing good work, but many others are not. And (the
government) is still only concentrating on what comes out of the end of the
pipe rather than on how to help companies improve production processes to
reduce pollution,' according to Eugenio Singer, president of consultant
Semco-ERM.
Independent estimates of the number of small and medium-sized companies that
are regular polluters range from 10,000 to 100,000, so it is difficult to
guess how long Sao Paulo's industrial clean-up will take. But the government
will have to hurry if it is to meet its 2005 pledge to return the Tiete 'to
life'.
