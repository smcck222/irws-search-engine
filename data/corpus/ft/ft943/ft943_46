<TEXT>
Less than a week after SG Warburg's Nick Snee, 29, was named the top-rated
European Motor industry analyst, he has been poached by a rival US
investment bank.
Snee, who has worked at Warburg since 1987, is joining JP Morgan Securities,
the London stockbroking arm of the New York commercial bank. Snee, who will
be a vice president, has been hired to initiate JP Morgan's coverage of the
European car industry, one of the biggest pan-European stock market sectors.
JP Morgan Securities is a relative latecomer to European stockbroking and
the firm did not figure in the recent Extel rankings. SG Warburg remains the
market leader but several US brokers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch have been increasing their market share.
Europe's motor industry lends itself to cross-border comparison and Merrill
Lynch and Lehman already rank among the top five firms analysing the
European sector.

FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Coutts quits APV over personality clash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, the big producer of food and drink manufacturing equipment, is looking
for a new executive director following the surprise resignation of Neill
Coutts with immediate effect.
Coutts joined APV in 1991, and had responsibility for APV Crepaco, the US
process engineering company for the dairy and beverage industries, and for
the components business.
His departure is put down to a personality clash with Clive Strowger, APV's
chief executive. 'There is nothing sinister about this,' said Neil French,
APV's finance director, yesterday. 'It was just a question of two people
finding it difficult to get on.' There were no disagreements over policy.
Strowger will take on Coutts' responsibilities temporarily, which will give
him an opportunity to evaluate whether Coutts' successor should be an
internal or external appointment, said French.
In March, APV announced that 1993 pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 13.4m, from
Pounds 20.2m a year earlier, but struck a positive note on orders and future
prospects.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Management: Attraction of the opposite - Adrian Furnham
finds that turning conventional theories on their head can have intriguing
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One way of being creative is to think through the opposite of an idea or
technique. Academics have performed this trick so often they have the jargon
terms of thesis, antithesis and synthesis.
Turning an idea on its head (as Marx did to Hegel) can be useful,
mischievous or just plain fun. It can help to define positions, clarify
differences and set out clear alternatives. It can also point out the sheer
ordinariness or commonsense nature of ideas or concepts, because the
opposites are so ridiculous. In a sense antonyms simply do not exist. Thus
the opposite of looking for zero defects is to look for zero perfects or 100
per cent defects.
Some opposites are not that obvious. The opposite of managing by walking
about (MBWA) could be management by staying in the office (MBSITO) or
management by hiding away (MBHA) - surely more fun. But 'creative opposites'
is an entertaining and useful exercise.
Thus we have:
Shoddy squares. Sitting around in circles becoming obsessed with quality
might be desirable for the obsessive but it is incredibly boring. Checking
for, and throwing out, the odd shoddy product or service system is probably
a good idea, but not worth getting excited about.
Disempowerment. Because responsibility and accountability come with power,
so does stress. Empowerment means no one else to blame; being on-call;
making executive decisions and facing the consequences of one's own actions.
Disempowerment means the easy life and the old excuse that 'I was merely
following orders . . .'.
Relayering the company. All this down- or right-sizing has been too similar
to a vicious cull of the herd. Just as the mature elephants are the
embodiment of the wisdom of the herd, so we need to bring back the
middle-brow middle-manager and have a deep gateau of management layers to
pad out the management structure.
Thriving on order. Organisations, like the world in general, are too
chaotic, capricious and unpredictable to be either enjoyable or beneficial.
Management's job is to give order to the organisation, to bring stability to
the chances and changes of this world and to abolish chaos.
De-engineering the organisation. People are not machines and to talk in this
language only encourages mechanistic thinking. Re-engineering is not the
best metaphor in these people-oriented times. It is too redolent of the
'dark satanic mills' of the last century. Perhaps a metaphor from cooking
should be used: 'Reheating the organisation' or 'Defrosting the
organisation', for instance.
Job impoverishment. All that consultant clap-trap of job enrichment ignores
the obvious fact that it is not the tedious or routine nature of jobs that
make them distasteful, but having to do them at all. Job impoverishment
removes horrid jobs. Get everyone to write down on a piece of paper the job
they hate the most. Put these in a hat and draw one each to be performed
next month. The same work gets done and everyone gets to do a new task.
Management without objectives: The trouble with management by objectives is
that it expends massive and wasteful effort defining and then measuring
objectives. Ignore mission statements, section goals and job descriptions.
Work relations are optimised under MWO because people love doing their own
thing. This is especially true of more senior positions where the
undesirable side-effects of lower productivity are of little consequence.
Time-serving related pay: Performance-related pay means that loyalty to the
organisation (40 years at the mast) is not sufficiently rewarded. Young,
workaholic, thrusting newcomers are promoted over the steady-as-you-go
types. Hence, companies need to stop rewarding effort and ability and indeed
support Lifo (last in, first out) and Figs (first in gets support). We could
have one-hour (not one-minute) managers; corporate philistinism, not
corporate culture.
Lady Thatcher understood the power of opposites. In strident tones she would
turn with contempt on the cowed Labour parliamentarian and shout 'Tina'.
This stood for 'There Is No Alternative.'
She knew, or hoped, that the available alternatives had either been tried
before (and found wanting) or were clearly impractical.
Perhaps executives could try shouting 'Creative Realistic Alternative Plans'
at board meetings and training sessions and see the immediate beneficial
effects on the organisation.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Management: Lessons in education - John Authers on BP's
assessment of its projects in schools and colleges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is to be gained from corporate involvement in education? Several
multinational companies, which have already poured funds into educational
programmes, have been asking this question with increasing urgency.
While the long-term aims may be self-evidently laudable, the precise nature
of what they are trying to achieve is not always clear.
BP believes it has now found a means of assessment.
Chris Marsden, BP's head of group community affairs, who unveiled the
results of applying the company's new system for assessing its education and
general community involvement at the International Conference on
Education-Business Partnership in Paris last week, admits that it is not
'measurement' of benefits in the hard sense. But, he claims: 'Our system
allows systematic subjectivity. It is putting numbers to values. Those
numbers are based on sound collective opinion and are therefore as valid as
anything else.'
The system has already led BP to drop some programmes completely while
adapting others for use elsewhere. Marsden's technique, devised with
Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester two years ago,
obliges BP managers to form working groups with representatives of the
community and education schemes which the company is supporting.
They must then answer a series of questions, which will allow them to
position any project on a grid such as the one shown (right).
The format requires managers to analyse what they are trying to achieve for
the company and for the educational project. In the case of BP, discussions
led to the verdict that any programme should set the following five aims. It
should:
Contribute to the motivation and development of BP staff; Create
opportunities for the company to understand, influence and learn from
education;
Help recruitment;
Earn goodwill;
Give access to resources, expertise and facilities.
This represents a much more sophisticated approach than BP's earlier forays
into education, which were regarded largely as public relations exercises.
Managers are also expected to rank these five aims in order of importance to
their branch of BP, on a scale of one to five.
The benefits for education are analysed according to five 'matching'
criteria. These are almost identical to those used for the company, but make
relevant adjustments - for example, educationalists aim to develop their
pupils and students as well as staff, and to improve career choices rather
than recruitment.
Next, managers assess the impact of each educational project, allocating a
mark out of five for each criterion. Managers must also make a judgment on a
target audience - for example, they must decide how to rank a scheme which
is very successful, but in only one school.
The score for each criterion is then multiplied by the score for its impact.
When these are added together they give two scores - for the benefits to
education and to the business. That enables the project to be plotted on a
grid, as shown. Costs are also shown, to help investment decisions.
The object is to move further towards the top right-hand corner. The numbers
allow comparison between programmes and systematise decisions on whether
improvements can be made.
Marsden says participants should not only give a measure for a scheme's
current impact, but should also decide whether identifiable changes could
help achieve a higher mark. If such changes can be made, an arrow is added
to the grid, showing the direction in which a project could move.
Smithers also suggests that if the changes being sought are quantifiable
(for example, in short-term recruitment), there may be a case for
commissioning market research.
The subjective grid can therefore be used both to spot projects that should
be closed and those that need further investment.
Following a trial of the model by BP Malaysia, the company discovered that
Cabaran BP had been a big success, giving the pupil participants an
excellent learning experience. Cabaran is a scheme in which schoolchildren
are set ambitious technological challenges in return for prizes, However,
there were opportunities for better publicity by making challenges more
televisual.
A version of Cabaran has since been launched in BP Singapore, while several
southern Europe companies - Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey  - intend to
adopt it. The idea is that BP companies will be able to learn from - and
adapt projects pioneered by - others in the group.
The Pak Cipan range of sponsored glossy nature books, however, drew a
different reaction. Teachers and pupils found little use for them, and the
only benefits for the company came from limited public relations exposure.
The scheme, a typical example of the old PR-led corporate involvement in
education, has been dropped.
This reflects the company's business-like approach to education. Its
involvement is rooted in enlightened self-interest. As Russell Seal, chief
executive of BP Oil, puts it: 'This is not a charitable activity but a
business tool for enhancing our reputation and licence to operate, and for
investing strategically in social infrastructure which has impact on BP's
businesses.'
BP Malaysia assesses its community projects in the following ways:
Career Fairs. These provide a low-cost, much-valued activity, which students
use in big numbers. Staff are highly involved and committed - a classic
simple example of successful sponsorship.
Cabaran BP. This technological challenge programme was recognised as a
success, but the benefit to the community could be increased by wider
involvement of schools. Publicity for BP could also be improved.
Turtle Conservation. BP provided funding and some expertise for programmes
to protect the Malaysian turtle from extinction. The programme was
successful, and generated good publicity, but is now being wound down as the
threat to turtles has abated.
Pak Cipan Nature Books. This 'old-style' PR support for schools books was
'not achieving much value'. The books have since been discontinued.
Larian Hijau. Prizes were offered to science journalists under this scheme -
it had initial strong benefits for BP's recognition, but this is 'less
likely in future', while there is little serious community benefit, so the
scheme is being wound down.
Science &amp; Environment Camps. This direct form of education sponsorship
greatly benefited the community. However, it was decided the value to BP
could be raised by increasing staff involvement.

Service, PO Box 934, Poole, Dorset, BH17 7BR. Pounds 10 inc p&amp;p.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Lateral lures can pull in people - Looking
beyond the basic career requirements of your company is a useful enlistment
aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Akio Morita, chairman and founder of Sony, the Japanese electrical giant,
was asked some years ago why there had been so much Japanese investment in
the UK ahead of its other European partners.
He listed a string of attractions: political stability, relatively cheap and
trained labour force, good internal communications, English language,
telecommunications. Then he paused and said: 'But the real reason was the
golf courses.'
What goes for Japanese investment also goes for recruitment, yet many
advertisers fail to tap into the hidden desires of potential recruits.
We might all learn something from the resourceful town councillors of
Adaminaby, a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of Australia's New
South Wales. Adaminaby's doctor has just retired and the town is having
problems finding a new one.
Instead of circulating the job in the medical press, Adaminaby has chosen to
capitalise on its chief asset. Set just five miles from Lake Eucumbene,
Adaminaby is acknowledged as the trout fishing capital of Australia. Hence
the letter in this month's Trout and Salmon magazine, published in the UK.
Anyone suitably qualified should telephone 010 6164 542351.
The town councillors of Adaminaby, whether they know it or not, are engaging
in what is termed, in the US, 'lateral recruitment', the sort of idea for
which consultants demand very high fees.
US computer games manufacturers have been known to search among Hollywood
screenwriters for potential candidates, but perhaps the most marked example
of this practice in the UK was the advertisement taken out by Chemical Bank
in Flight International magazine in April for 'numerate, risk-oriented,
confident and highly ambitious professionals' to train as dealers.
The theory was that air traffic controllers, used to reacting to movements
on screens under pressure, would be good dealers. What the theory did not
take into account was that they must be risk averse, not risk takers.
While Chemical Bank may have missed the target, it is clear that some
recruiters are prepared to cast their net in unusual areas to fill a job.
Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the Vermont-based manufacturer of quality ice cream,
is seeking a new chief executive for its business which last year notched up
Dollars 140m in sales.
The search has been prompted by the resignation last month of Ben Cohen, the
chief executive who founded the business with Jerry Greenfield in 1978.
The manufacturer is known for its quirkily-named flavours, such as Chunky
Monkey and Cherry Garcias, and its support for charities and righteous
causes.
For the first time the company is abandoning its pay policy that has limited
executive salaries to no more than seven times the lowest wage, a decision
which Cohen, who remains chairman, described as the hardest the board had
made.
Realistically, the company did not think it would get the highest-calibre
people using the old policy.
The company has lost none of its novelty. While it has engaged a recruiting
firm, the post has also been advertised on Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream tubs with
the added incentive that the runner-up in the appointment contest will get a
lifetime's supply of ice cream.
Applicants are asked to explain in 100 words or less 'Why I would be a great
CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'. By last Friday there were 15,250 applications with
several thousand more through the letter box over the holiday weekend.
One application came on a brass plate mounted on marble, another on a large
flat cake and another on parchment script. In spite of the competition, the
suspicion is that most applicants are hoping to come second.
The lesson from all these approaches is that lateral lures are worth
exploring when fishing for people but care must be taken when hauling them
in. You're never quite sure what you've hooked.
Counting the cost
Investment banks are finding a shortage of good-quality back office staff,
according to Robert Walters Associates, recruitment consultants.
The firm says that towards the end of last year, the trading houses began to
require specialists capable of handling sophisticated products, instead of
people fulfilling more general roles.
The development reflects the need for back-office staff to keep abreast with
the ever more complicated and inventive derivatives trading emerging in the
market.
The sacking earlier this year of Joseph Jett, the Kidder Peabody trader, who
allegedly ran trades that led to profits being overstated by Dollars 350m,
resulted in an attack of nerves among the securities firms on both sides of
the Atlantic anxious to ensure their internal controls were effective.
While some have been content to take on newly qualified accountants and
train them, others are demanding highly qualified people who understand
business processes.
Walters says: 'The last time the City was so buoyant the cry was 'get me
bodies' but now we are finding that the calibre of people being requested is
so much higher and the standard is being maintained.'
There are also signs, he says, that some firms are returning to the
so-called golden hello or joining fee and guaranteeing an element of bonus.
Roberts Walters adds that word of mouth is proving the most effective way of
finding candidates. Its own office in Bedford Street resembles a small city
dealing room, only the calls are to match people to jobs instead of buyers
to sellers.
IT shortfall exposed
Meanwhile, the speed of technological change is leading to shortages in the
information technology industry, according to the Anglo-Dutch CMG Computer
Management Group which launched a recruitment drive for 400 staff for its
information processing and consultancy business.
Colin Osborn, associate director responsible for resource management in the
UK, says that at junior levels the computer industry was paying the price
for not giving graduates opportunities two years ago. As a result, he says:
'Skills in some areas are almost non existent and so demand for talented
people, for example with Oracle skills, is very competitive.'
More than half of its UK recruitment was at a junior level, 30 per cent from
intermediate level and about 10 per cent at a senior level, mainly in
business development, sales and project management.
Down and outs
The newly launched Institute of Personnel and Development has committed
itself to reducing the jargon which has pervaded the profession in recent
years.
There is much to be done. To give some idea of the mysteries of human
resource management, here is a cynic's glossary of personnel terms for
managers.
Downsizing: getting rid of half your employees.
Delayering: getting rid of your promotion prospects.
Empowerment: getting rid of your responsibilities.
Outsourcing: getting rid of the work.
Outplacement: saying goodbye with a smile.
Rightsizing: correcting your mistake.
Flex Programme: doing other people's jobs
Stress management: dealing with those who think they'll be got rid of.
There are more but that should suffice for now.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Imro gives boost to new watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another change in the structure for regulating retail financial services
announced yesterday should give further impetus to the setting up of the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private
investor.
Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the investment management
industry, said it was reducing its scope to cut down the overlap between
organisations that could be regulated by it instead of by the PIA. It
estimates that about 40 of its 1100-member firms fall into this category.
The arrangements remove the option of staying with the existing regulator
from some members of Imro.
Instead, they will have to choose between joining the new regulator - the
more likely course - or insisting on exercising their right to be regulated
directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.

A committee of MPs is to consider holding an inquiry into the fees and
conduct of the liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee,
confirmed yesterday that he had received a request for an inquiry and would
raise it at a meeting later this month.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, urged the committee to examine
the fees of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, which has so far generated
more than Pounds 98m in fees for its work on the case.
Touche Ross was not available for comment yesterday, but has previously said
that its fees have been scrutinised and approved by the creditors' committee
and by the courts.

The construction recovery will remain weak because of a sluggish housing
market and lower public spending, say independent forecasters which
previously provided output estimates for the National Economic Development
Office, Andrew Taylor writes.
But figures published by the Department of the Environment yesterday showed
that housebuilding activity continued to increase in the first five months
of this year.
The department said builders started work on 7 per cent more homes in the
three months to the end of May compared with the corresponding period last
year.
More recently builders and estate agents have reported that the pace of
sales recovery has faltered after increases in tax and fixed interest rate
mortgages.
According to Construction Forecasting and Research, construction output is
likely to rise by 1 per cent this year, by a further 2 per cent next year
and 2.5 per cent in 1996.
This follows three consecutive years of decline in which the value of
construction output at constant 1990 prices fell by 12 per cent.
Mrs Jacquie Cannon, CFR director, said: 'While there are many positive
indications, the fragile state of the housing recovery together with the
problem of government finance does dampen expectations.'

Cathedral Employment Enterprise, one of the biggest providers of training
for the unemployed in London, yesterday went into voluntary liquidation with
debts of nearly Pounds 1m. The joint liquidators said the chance of selling
the whole concern was limited but constituent parts might be sold. Cathedral
employed about 150 staff in 50 centres across London. Its annual turnover
was Pounds 3m.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Council shake-up in Surrey urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surrey County Council should be abolished and replaced by all-purpose
unitary authorities, The Local Government Commission recommended yesterday.
The commission proposed a similar fate for Hereford and Worcester County
Council, and in its report on Nottinghamshire it recommended that Nottingham
become self-governing.
The commission's decision to favour retention of the status quo of two-tier
counties and districts as an option in all three counties suggested further
conflict with the government's desire for unitary authorities.
The recommendations were:
Surrey: A choice is offered between a new five-unitary structure, with
boundaries almost totally different from those of the present districts, or
keeping the status quo.
The preferred option is to create five unitaries, although the commission
makes pessimistic forecasts on costs. Set-up costs would be between Pounds
40m and Pounds 44m and annual savings would be between Pounds 5m and Pounds
1m. It could take 44 years to recoup reorganisation costs.
The five unitaries would be: Epsom Downs, based on Epsom and Ewell District
Council, plus Esher, Leatherhead and Banstead; North Surrey, based on
Spelthorne borough, plus Weybridge; North West Surrey, a merged Surrey
Heath, Runnymede and Woking boroughs; South East Surrey, based on Tandridge
district, plus southern parts of Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead
boroughs; South West Surrey, based on a merger of Guildford and Waverley.
Hereford and Worcester: Herefordshire to re-appear on the local government
map after an absence of 20 years. The commission, reflecting the view of all
local authorities in Hereford and Worcester, recommends that Herefordshire
be a unitary authority.
Worcestershire should be split into two unitary authorities, north and
south. Local authorities are divided on this. The county is prepared to
accept two unitary authorities if two tiers of government were not kept,
while the districts want Worcestershire split into five unitary authorities.
In addition to its preferred option, the commission will consult on plans
for a single Worcestershire unitary council or for the present arrangements
 -a county council, five district councils and one new district council. The
commission estimates that if Hereford and Worcester were split into three,
transitional costs would be up to Pounds 26m, with annual savings of Pounds
4m to Pounds 7m.
Nottinghamshire: The city of Nottingham should have its own unitary
authority but the rest of Nottinghamshire should retain two tiers of local
government.
Mr David Thomas, commissioner responsible for the county, said: 'We have
found the Notts review very difficult.' The eight local authorities and the
county council all held to stances designed to protect their position, and
could not agree on a list of options.
Nor has the commission been able to find a regular pulse of public opinion.
Mr Thomas said: 'The people seeking change are about the same number as
those wanting the status quo.'
Although the commission has not found a satisfactory case for change outside
Nottingham, it is offering options of seven unitary authorities or four
unitary authorities.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Training charity to be relaunched: GrandMet will provide
Pounds 50,000 a year for ethnic campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fullemploy, the charity which catered for the training of ethnic minorities
before it collapsed under debts three years ago, is to be relaunched today.
The charity was founded 20 years ago to develop training centres in the
inner cities as part of an attempt to address higher than average
unemployment among ethnic minorities. It had government funding of Pounds 1m
a year at its peak and backing from the corporate sector.
Fullemploy embarked on an ambitious expansion programme through its trading
arm. By the end of the 1980s it was involved in a number of activities
including publishing and campaigning.
It was hit by the resignations of two chief executives in quick succession
and government cuts in funding for employment training schemes. Fullemploy
went into liquidation in early 1991.
Today's relaunch comes after two years of work by GrandMet Trust, a
charitable organisation funded by Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks
company, which bought the assets from the liquidators after an approach by
the charity's former management.
GrandMet Trust has merged Fullemploy's training centres with its own,
combined some of its other functions with the Urban Trust, and absorbed the
accounting and personnel functions. The rescue package has cost GrandMet
Trust about Pounds 150,000, with another Pounds 120,000 coming from Home
Office grants.
Mr Geoffrey Bush, group community relations director at GrandMet, said
Fullemploy had been over-extended.
What will emerge is a consultancy service called Project Fullemploy, with a
staff of six, housed in the Truman Brewery, in the east end of London, which
is home to several GrandMet charities.
Its emphasis will be on helping to develop specialist training and
employment-creating programmes for organisations with special attention to
equal opportunities.
Another important role will be to help foster a business ethos in the black
community.
Mr Joel O'Loughlin, director of Project Fullemploy said: 'The reasons
Fullemploy started have not gone away. Black unemployment remains higher
than ever but we are taking a different route to addressing the same
problem.'
GrandMet Trust is to fund the organisation through a Pounds 50,000 annual
grant for the next three years and provide free office space and accountancy
support. British Gas, Shell and Morgan Grenfell are making donations.
The government is to provide support this year.

FT  06 JUL 94 / OECD criticises record of Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance of training and enterprise councils, the employer-led bodies
charged with transforming vocational training in England and Wales, has
'fallen short of initial expectations', says a report from the Organisation
of Economic Co-operation and Development, David Goodhart writes.
The judgment is contained in an unpublished note on the UK labour market
produced for last month's OECD jobs study.
It is critical of the UK's educational and skills base. 'Improvements are
required if the UK is to reduce the large discrepancy between its ratio of
skilled to unskilled workers compared with those of Germany and Japan,' it
says.
But it praises the Re-Start programme for the long-term unemployed and the
general approach to labour market deregulation which has made the UK labour
market 'one of the least regulated in Europe, if not the entire OECD area'.
The OECD researchers seem puzzled why this has not led to better results.
The report says: 'It may be that the positive effects of structural reform
take longer to bear fruit than originally assumed.'
The report is critical of continuing real-wage rigidity. 'Real wage growth
during the most recent cycle continued long after the recession had
started,' it says.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Profits up at Nuclear Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, yesterday said
that some of its stations could, for the first time, produce electricity for
less than its selling price.
It said its five advanced gas-cooled reactors had cut generation costs to
2.6p per unit compared with the 2.7p which the company received, on average,
for its output. The company hailed this as 'a major breakthrough' which
reinforced the case for privatisation.
Mr John Collier, the company's chairman, said: 'The time has come for a
rethink of our status as a public-sector company.'
Yesterday's announcement, made as Mr Collier announced the company's results
for the year ending March 31, came only a month after the government
launched its review of the nuclear industry, one aim of which is to
determine whether Nuclear Electric should be privatised.
The results showed that the company made further strides in the direction of
cutting costs and raising its share of the electricity market in England and
Wales. Its profits amounted to Pounds 361m, up from Pounds 109m last year.
This included income of Pounds 1.2bn from the nuclear levy, which adds about
10 per cent to electricity bills. Without the levy Nuclear Electric would
have made an operating loss of Pounds 434m, although this was an improvement
on the previous year's loss of Pounds 616m. Nuclear Electric has set next
year as the target date for making a profit without the levy, which is due
to be phased out by 1998.
The company presented its accounts in a way which distinguishes its present
operations from those inherited from the Central Electricity Generating
Board. The first made a profit of Pounds 702m and the second a loss of
Pounds 341m, mainly because the older stations have large clean-up
liabilities which are not fully funded.
Nuclear Electric's income from electricity sales was up by 21 per cent to
Pounds 1.7bn, with most of the increase coming from advanced gas-cooled
reactors. Productivity measured by electricity produced per employee rose 27
per cent.
The older Magnox stations are still holding back the company. Their
production costs were 3.8p per unit, nearly 50 per cent higher than the
AGRs.
Nuclear Electric's share of the electricity market in England and Wales rose
from 21.6 per cent to 23.2 per cent. It expects this share to rise further
next year as the new Sizewell B station comes into operation. Nuclear
Electric is now the second-largest generator in England and Wales after
National Power.
Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said it was 'a year in which we clearly
demonstrated that we are fit to enter the private sector'. He said that
apart from keeping open the nuclear option, development of the nuclear power
industry would bring substantial environmental benefits because it produced
no atmospheric emissions.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Hunt tells TUC of unions' limited role: Polite applause for
employment secretary after stewards are firm with hecklers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers, unions and the government yesterday committed themselves to the
goal of full employment, but differed sharply over the means, at the Looking
Forward to Full Employment conference organised by the Trades Union
Congress.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary - whose presence caused a demonstration
outside and the non-attendance of several union leaders - said Britain had
to 'combine US-style job creation and enterprise with the kind of social
standards we in Europe expect'.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, raised the spirits of the
300-strong audience by saying 'it is possible to create a million jobs
during a period of government'.
Mr Hunt is the first cabinet minister to attend a TUC conference for more
than a decade. His reception was not enthusiastic, but hecklers were firmly
dealt with by TUC stewards and he received polite applause at the end of his
speech.
He welcomed the growing consensus that active labour market measures had to
concentrate on the long-term unemployed. But he also said that some
unemployed people needed to change their attitude to the new service-sector
jobs.
He said there was still a role for unions in the battle against unemployment
but this should be in the workplace. He attacked the 'discredited' union
link with the Labour party at national level.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, contested the de-regulatory approach
of the government. He said: 'We need new national institutions to improve
competitiveness and employment. We have a good record in health and safety
at work because we have strong national regulations. If we did the same with
training we might get better results.'
Mr Monks said that there was 'strong suspicion in trade union circles that
mass unemployment had been a deliberate act of policy'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said that 'if a government with a policy commitment to full employment were
elected we would not take our bat home'. He also revealed that the CBI was
surveying employers about the skills of the unemployed who present
themselves for work.

FT  06 JUL 94 / CBI chief hails broader family credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's interest in extending family credit, the in-work benefit
for low-paid people, was both welcomed and criticised at the conference.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
supported the idea - floated by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor - of
extending the benefit to single people.
Mr Davies said it was the most effective way of encouraging job creation by
keeping down the price of labour to the employer while ensuring that income
to the employee does not sink too low.
He said: 'The rapid growth in earnings dispersion is emerging as a more
serious social and economic problem than is yet appreciated by most
politicians.' Lord Lawson recently expressed the same view.
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, expressed doubts about family credit. He said it required an
intrusive means test.
Mr Britton said: 'A relationship of dependency is unavoidable between the
recipients and the state as the donor. This may be right and proper as a
temporary relationship for individuals or households in times of particular
adversity, but it is not so appropriate as a permanent relationship between
the state and perhaps millions of skilled workers.'
He said that family credit could act as a disincentive to seeking promotion
or better paid work as the benefit was phased out as incomes rose, leaving
the individual no better off.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said the TUC was interested in
the idea of in-work pay supplements but warned that 'the government must
guard against subsidising employers' lousy pay and conditions, and taking
advantage of both their employees and the state'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Building upturn 'to remain weak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction recovery will remain weak because of a sluggish housing
market and lower public spending, say independent forecasters which
previously provided output estimates for the National Economic Development
Office, Andrew Taylor writes.
But figures published by the Department of the Environment yesterday showed
that housebuilding activity continued to increase during the first five
months of this year.
The department said builders started work on 7 per cent more homes during
the three months to the end of May compared with the corresponding period
last year.
More recently, builders and estate agents have reported that the pace of
sales recovery has faltered after increases in tax and fixed interest rate
mortgages.
According to Construction Forecasting and Research, total construction
output is likely to rise by 1 per cent this year, by a further 2 per cent
next year and 2.5 per cent in 1996.
This follows three consecutive years of decline in which the value of
construction output at constant 1990 prices fell by 12 per cent.
Mrs Jacquie Cannon, CFR director, said: 'While there are many positive
indications, the fragile state of the housing recovery together with the
problem of government finance does dampen expectations.'
Infrastructure output, which had risen by two-fifths between 1990 and last
year helped by the construction of the Channel tunnel, is forecast to fall 9
per cent this year and a further 5.5 per cent next year.
Private-sector housing output, which rose 9.5 per cent last year, is
forecast to rise 5.5 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Poor sampling blamed for failure of polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An exhaustive inquiry into the failure of opinion polls to predict
accurately the outcome of the 1992 general election yesterday put most of
the blame on the sampling techniques used by pollsters.
An independent report commissioned by the Market Research Society says a
swing from Labour to Conservatives in the last days of the election campaign
accounted for only between a fifth and a third of the error.
Introducing the report, Mr David Butler, a psephologist from Nuffield
College, Oxford, said the failure of eve-of-election polls to predict Mr
John Major's victory was the 'most spectacular in the history of British
election surveys'.
A team chaired by Mr Butler and including representatives of two of the main
polling organisations - MORI and ICM - singled out two crucial flaws in the
way the opinion polls were collated.
The quota and weighting systems used to select samples did not reflect with
sufficient accuracy the social profile of the electorate.
The systems, which take into account such factors as age, sex, social class
and occupation, were not fully representative of the distribution of
political support across the electorate.
The opinion polls, which were 4 percentage points away from the actual
outcome for both the Conservative and Labour parties, also suffered from the
refusal of many voters to reveal their loyalties.
More Conservative than Labour voters declined to state their preference and
the polls were not adjusted to take account of this.
The report says the final important factor was the late swing in support
towards the Conservatives and the fact that Tory supporters proved more
likely to register their votes on election day. Minor influences included
the choice of constituencies for polling and interviews with people not on
the electoral register.
The main polling companies said yesterday that they had already implemented
the main recommendations of the inquiry in part or in full.
These include better techniques for selecting quota samples and weightings
and new approaches to limit the number of 'refusals'.
But the report stresses that there is no single framework available to
ensure that the mistakes are not repeated and companies should continually
develop their research techniques.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Pay curb halted 5.7% deal - June offer
would have avoided conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A deal over signalmen's pay could have been reached early last month between
Railtrack and the RMT transport union, written evidence to the Commons
employment committee showed yesterday.
The deal would have avoided the industrial conflict which includes a further
24-hour strike today. But it was torpedoed by government intervention on the
grounds that the deal would have breached its policy on pay in the public
sector.
The evidence emerged at a public session of the committee at which MPs
questioned Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general
secretary of the union. It was disclosed at the session that Mr Horton had
been in regular contact with Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
since the conflict began early last month.
Railtrack, a company wholly owned by the government, indicates in its
written evidence to the MPs that it believed union negotiators were ready to
agree an interim settlement. It would have increased basic pay of signalmen
by 5.7 per cent in recognition for past efficiency improvements.
The company also discloses that the union was prepared to settle on terms
acceptable to Railtrack. Nineteen hours of 'exploratory' talks spread over
June 6-8 had brought both sides to the point of a deal.
The company says: 'During these talks the Railtrack team formed the view
that the RMT might accept an offer of an increase in basic rates in the
region of 5.7 per cent (rather than the 11 per cent now claimed) accompanied
by some productivity improvements to meet their interim claim and enable
negotiations on the main restructuring proposals to proceed.'
The Railtrack position is confirmed by the RMT's written evidence to the
committee. This states that the company 'offered a 5.7 per cent increase in
basic rates of pay with conditions attached in recognition of productivity
and lost differentials'.
The RMT adds: 'Railtrack indicated they would put this proposal to us
formally on June 9 but this never materialised and under pressure from the
government, Railtrack withdrew it on 13 June.'
In its evidence Railtrack adds that 'the company's negotiating team reported
back on June 9 on the exploratory talks held over the previous three days
and the board discussed various options to resolve the dispute in the light
of these talks'.
That board meeting adjourned without a decision and then reconvened on the
following Monday. By the time the directors met again the line had changed -
because of intervention by the Department of Transport.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Horton and Knapp to 'chat' - Railtrack
chief to meet minister again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton and Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport
union's general secretary, will meet soon about the increasingly bitter
signalling staff dispute.
This emerged yesterday when the two men appeared before the Commons
employment committee. After much pressure from Mr Greville Janner, the
committee's Labour chairman, Mr Horton agreed that he should have what Mr
Janner called a 'little chat' with Mr Knapp.
Mr Knapp was quick to accept a meeting. 'Yes, of course. I would be a fool
not to say so,' he told Mr Janner.
Mr Janner made clear at the start of the hearings that he understood that
neither side would want to prejudice a return to negotiations to try to
settle the conflict.
At one moment a Conservative member of the committee had to restrain an
increasingly irate Mr Janner who seemed particularly incensed to discover
that Mr Horton has been in regular contact with Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary, since the conflict began early last month.
The Railtrack chairman said he had seen Mr MacGregor 'three or four times'
and after consulting his diary informed Mr Janner his next session with the
transport secretary would be tomorrow.
The Railtrack team caused exasperation when they were unable to tell the MPs
what the average earnings of signal workers were.
Mr David Armstrong, the company's industrial relations director, ploughed
hurriedly through his file of documents in search of the vital statistics in
an increasingly frantic manner. Mr Janner suggested in headmasterly style
that perhaps he should leave the room to find the figure. Mr Armstrong
eventually revealed the figure to be Pounds 16,650 a year for a 50.1 hour
working week.
Mr Horton was in conciliatory mood. He said he did not regard the signal
staff as Luddites - 'the last word I would use to describe them'. He talked
warmly of a 'beneficial cycle' that would ensure the men high earnings in
return for productivity improvements.
Committee members expressed surprise at what they saw as the signalling
staff's poor levels of pay for long hours of work. Mr Knapp made it clear
that his members had 'strong feelings' about their pay grievances.
Mr John Major said yesterday that he was 'pretty fed up' with the rail
strikes. He said during a visit to Edinburgh that millions of people had
accepted low wage rises in the past two years. 'I don't think they would
think it right for Railtrack to concede an 11 per cent rise to the
signallers without any productivity improvements.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: NOP poll finds blame on government
increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poll by NOP after last Wednesday's stoppage found that voters allocated 40
per cent of the blame to the government, 18 per cent to Railtrack and 18 per
cent to the RMT union, Kevin Brown writes. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow
employment secretary, said the poll showed that voters did not trust the
government's claims that it had left negotiations to Railtrack and the
union.
A cabinet sub-committee chaired by Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, is
monitoring the dispute, but ministers have no plans for further intervention
in the short term.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: More lines to operate today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail hopes to run a fuller train service today than on any of the
three previous strike-bound Wednesdays as it brings a growing number of
signal boxes into service.
Railtrack, which operates the track and signalling, said the train companies
had been able to increase services because signal staff were being used to
greater effect. There was not expected to be any increase in the number of
signal staff reporting for work.
British Rail said it expected between 1,700 and 1,750 trains to run. Last
Wednesday BR ran about 1,600 trains.
Train operating companies have made a special effort to keep travellers
informed.
In London, Victoria and Waterloo stations will be open for the first time.
BR's South Eastern division will run trains into Victoria from Ashford and
Sevenoaks and from Orpington and Bromley. South West Trains will run a
service from Epsom and Chessington via Wimbledon into Waterloo.
Regional Railways will run trains between Swansea and Cardiff and the
Cardiff Valleys line will run between Penarth, Cardiff and Bute Road.
InterCity East Coast will run trains from York via Newcastle to Edinburgh
while Regional Railways will operate a York-Newcastle-Berwick service.
On most routes a special timetable will operate with trains running every 30
or 60 minutes. Some lines will run more frequent shuttle services.
There will be extra parking in London for coaches in Battersea and Victoria
Parks and for cars in Hyde Park, Regent's Park and Greenwich Park. Free car
parking will be available at Tooting Bec Common, Royal Albert Dock and
Greenland Pier in Surrey Quays.
Additional services will run on the River Thames between Greenwich, the
Tower of London and Charing Cross Pier. A special river service for up to
200 passengers will run from Gravesend and Tilbury to London Bridge and
Charing Cross. A single boat will leave Gravesend at 6.45am returning from
Charing Cross at 5pm.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: CrossRail bill fails in the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A private bill authorising the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme for an east-west
railway under London was killed by the Speaker of the Commons yesterday,
triggering a battle between transport ministers and the Treasury for funds
to revive the project.
The attempt to resurrect the bill, rejected in May by a quasi-judicial
committee of four MPs, failed when Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker,
objected and blocked the motion signed by 288 MPs of all parties.
Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, supported Mr Morris. She said: 'Future
legislation on that bill is now for the government to determine.'
Downing Street said Mr John Major remained 'firmly' behind the project.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is keen to take over the project and
promote it through the hybrid bill procedure - a mechanism sometimes used
for major private projects backed by the government.
Supporters believe, however, that CrossRail will have little prospect of
success unless its revenue forecasts are raised.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Variety of views from the Railway Tavern -
Peter Marsh on a propaganda war which the signal workers are winning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the rail dispute enters a new phase victory in the propaganda battle over
who is to blame is inching towards the signal workers' union.
Mr Bob Worcester, chairman of the MORI opinion poll company, said: 'The days
when strikes are automatically blamed on the trade unions are long gone. The
public perception is that the government and Railtrack have not handled well
their side of the dispute.'
This view is backed by an analysis of leading articles in national
newspapers since the strikes started.
Of 30 editorials in London-based daily papers, only six have singled out the
RMT union for blame, with 10 neutral and 14 apportioning most responsibility
either to the government or Railtrack.
In a highly unscientific poll by the Financial Times of the managers of 15
pubs around Britain, all called the Railway Tavern, only five said the union
was unambiguously to blame. Five put the responsibility on the other side
and five said they did not have a view either way.
Ms June Charles, landlady of the Railway Tavern in Mile End, east London,
accused the government of 'mismanaging' the dispute. Mr Sid Hogarth of the
Railway Tavern in Langley Mill, Derbyshire, said: 'The government has been
trying to prove it's the boss. If it hadn't intervened, the dispute would be
over.'
Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of Westminster Strategy, a lobbying
group, said: 'So far surprisingly little blame has come the way of the
union. A lot of people seem to think Railtrack has been a bit incompetent.'
According to Mr Greg Parston, director of the Office of Public Management, a
consultancy specialising in public-sector issues, the union's 'brilliant'
handling of the dispute had helped to build up public support.
Mr Parston also believes the tactic of one strike a week underlines the
importance of the dispute and keeps it in the public eye, while reducing the
chances of a backlash against the union by directly affecting only
relatively few people.
The degree of sympathy for the rail union in the FT poll of pubs was skewed
by region and type of customers. Publicans in the commuter belt of
south-east England, in particular, were more likely to blame the rail union.
Ms Debbie Spiers, landlady of the Railway Tavern in Staplehurst, Kent, said
her views were influenced by her customers, many of whom had been greatly
inconvenienced by the signal workers.
Mr Peter Kelly of the Railway Tavern in Andover, Hampshire, said: 'The
government has my support. Anyone who goes on strike should be sacked.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: BR cuts annual loss to Pounds 108m -
Service claimed to be more punctual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail achieved improved financial results, a smaller call on
government subsidy and a more punctual train service in 1993-94, according
to its last annual report as a centralised organisation.
But this positive picture of the last 12 months of the nationalised railway
was matched by the shedding of a further 9,000 jobs and substantial losses
in large parts of its freight and parcels operations.
Sir Bob Reid, chairman, said: 'The popularity of road and air travel has at
times raised questions about the (rail) industry's very survival. But the
programme of change that is now beginning is happening at a time when the
potential for rail has again come to the forefront of the transport debate.'
The cost to British Rail of preparing for privatisation was Pounds 92m,
including Pounds 48m for the creation of Railtrack, the company which has
taken over BR's track, signalling and stations and is in dispute with
signalling staff.
A 10 per cent cut in operating expenditure, much of it from reducing staff
numbers, allowed BR to report an operating profit of Pounds 23m in the year
ended March compared with a previous loss of Pounds 94m. The recession
reduced passenger numbers and turnover fell from Pounds 3.12bn to Pounds
3.1bn.
After interest charges and other costs British Rail's loss was Pounds 108m
compared with Pounds 183m the year before. Government subsidies fell nearly
20 per cent to Pounds 930m.
BR invested Pounds 828m in renewing and upgrading the present rail network
and Pounds 378m in developing the Channel tunnel. The InterCity division
achieved its punctuality and reliability targets for the first time, while
Network SouthEast improved performance.
Turnover rose slightly in BR's passenger divisions but fell sharply in its
two freight divisions and parcels.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour transport spokesman, said the BR figures confirmed
that 'BR has returned an operating profit through massive cuts in costs.
However, the profit would be far too small for private investors, while
costs are soaring under the newly fragmented system'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Tory MPs take focus off Blair's chance to
shine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers were accused of engaging in a phased withdrawal from the
Commons yesterday when Mr Tony Blair took the leading role in a debate on
law and order.
It was his first opportunity to star from the Opposition front bench as
shadow home secretary since emerging as clear favourite to succeed Mr John
Smith as Labour leader.
As Mr Blair's most prominent supporters arranged themselves around him in a
phalanx designed to ensure favourable exposure on television, government
whips seemed intent on ensuring that he had a minimal audience on the Tory
back benches.
Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall north, complained that the Tory
whips were trying to empty the government back benches.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, said she did not know what the
Conservative whips were up to. 'As far as I am concerned I am totally
riveted on Mr Blair.'
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, also sought to play down the
significance of the occasion by deputing Mr Charles Wardle, a junior
minister, to reply to Mr Blair.
The shadow home secretary renewed his claim that Labour was the only party
with an effective policy on law and order by seeking to include crime
prevention among the statutory duties of local authorities.
Moving a new clause to the police and magistrates' courts bill, he said it
would reinforce community policing and had the support of local authorities
and senior police bodies.
Mr Blair charged the government with trying to impose national objectives
and refusing, because of Tory dogma, to allow local needs to take precedence
in crime prevention.
Mr Wardle said that Mr Blair's speech, far from being a 'landmark
contribution' to the law-and-order debate, had consisted of one bland
generalisation after another.
The minister said that there was no need to impose new statutory duties on
local authorities because they were already participating in partnerships to
promote crime prevention.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Clarke hits at 'obsession' with monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The political obsession in Britain over European monetary union is a
'tedious irrelevance', Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday.
He insisted before the Commons Treasury committee that he remained committed
to the long-term goal of a European single currency, in spite of opposition
from the Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party.
But in a conciliatory gesture towards these Euro-sceptics he stressed that
European monetary union was still so remote that it was 'not even on the
agenda' of European ministers at present.
Mr Clarke said: 'I do not think this parliament will be troubled by the
matter and I am not sure that the next one will be either.' He added that
the main issue facing Europe was how to achieve economic convergence between
the different EU members, with low inflation and healthy public finances.
As he answered two hours of questions from the committee about the
Treasury's economic forecast, unveiled last week, Mr Clarke reiterated his
commitment to steady growth, free from the 'boom and bust' cycles that
characterised earlier recoveries.
Although he decline to say precisely when he might change interest rates, he
indicated his readiness to act if the government's stated goal of keeping
inflation below 2.5 per cent by the end of this parliament was breached.
The Bank of England currently forecasts that inflation will be rising over 3
per cent by next year, although the Treasury predicts a lower rate of
inflation.
But Mr Clarke insisted that 'if the Bank's forecasts are correct' the
government would take the appropriate action to keep inflation in check.
He noted, however, that there was 'no set figure' for growth - forecast by
the Treasury to be 2.75 per cent this year and next - which would trigger
this interest rate rise. And he insisted that the British economy appeared
to have sufficient unused capacity to enjoy healthy growth before any
'corrective' monetary action was needed.
Consequently, the recent rise in long-term interest rates in the bond market
were unjustified and the markets were simply 'wrong' to doubt his
anti-inflationary resolve, he said. Nevertheless, Mr Clarke admitted that
this rise in long-term interest rates presented a threat to the upbeat
outlook presented in the Treasury forecast.
Mr Clarke indicated that the government would press ahead with the
government's scheduled increases in value added tax on fuel, in spite of
some hopes from his own back bench that the government might abandon the
scheme in face of public opposition.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Fading breed takes on 'grain barons': Small farmers are
seeking a bigger share of EU funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Thompson works an 80-hour week on his dairy and sheep farm on the
North Yorkshire Moors near Whitby. The holding is not big enough to make it
worth employing another pair of hands, and the 56-year old farmer is fed up
with the hard graft - he is considering giving up his cows and developing a
bed-and-breakfast business.
The long hours and poor income for Britain's 150,000 small farmers make them
a fading breed - 2,000 a year are leaving the business or taking part-time
jobs.
Today a group of small farmers will visit Westminster to press Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, to agree to changes in the Common
Agricultural Policy that would favour small producers.
Mr James Mulford, chairman of the Small Farmers Association, says: 'The
public agrees to support agriculture because they think the money is going
to small farmers like us. But 80 per cent of CAP spending goes to 20 per
cent of the biggest farmers: it's wicked.'
Mr Mulford does not want any additional cash, he wants CAP funds spread more
evenly by setting a cut-off point after which large holdings would fail to
qualify for aid. This would stop hundreds of thousands of pounds in
subsidies going to the 'grain barons'.
'These subsidies are just pure profit to some of my larger neighbours, but
every pound of aid I get goes to pay for food for my family,' says Mr
Mulford, who farms 200 acres in Suffolk.
If Mr Mulford's ideas were adopted there would be more funding to spread
among the whole farming population, with a greater proportion going to
smaller producers.
A small farmer typically has fewer than 200 acres and 80 per cent of family
income is generated on the farm. Under this definition almost half of
Britain's farmers can be termed small, but Mr Mulford argues that their
voices are never heard.
Smaller producers also say they are caught in a vicious circle - if large
farmers are enjoying a good year, as at present, their desire to expand
pushes up land prices and the cost of agrochemicals is increased, making it
harder for small farmers to compete.
Many large farmers hope to buy up their smaller neighbours in an effort to
cut costs and compete with lower-cost operators overseas when the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal comes into force next year.
Mr Thompson's farm could well be swallowed by a bigger landowner. It will
not support a full-time living when he retires, as on 30 of his 80 acres he
has only a life tenancy which cannot be passed on. But the bed-and-breakfast
business is also uncertain as fewer people choose to spend their main
holiday in Britain.
Mr Mulford says diversification by farmers has not been a big success - he
believes only two in every 10 projects prove successful. Farmers closest to
towns gain most by diversifying as there is a ready market for them, he
says, but this does not help those in more remote areas.
'There is increasing pressure on us to diversify, but if you're a small
farmer you are working flat out anyway and have no time to devote to a new
business,' he says.
Mr Mulford is hoping to convince Mrs Shephard to take notice of the
interests of the small producers. 'The large producers dictate the
agricultural debate in the UK and also in the European Union, but a small
mixed farm is what the public think of as a traditional holding and they
want to keep it that way,' he says.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Lords jolt for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government suffered two defeats in the Lords last night over plans to
set up secure training centres for persistent young offenders.
The defeats followed a warning from Earl Ferrers, the home office minister,
that amendments proposed by Lord Carr, a former Conservative home secretary,
would undermine the criminal justice bill.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has struggled to win parliamentary
approval for large parts of the bill, which implements law-and-order reforms
announced at last year's Conservative party conference.
Mr Howard is expected to seek to reverse the defeats when the bill returns
to the Commons, but the setback could complicate the government's business
programme, delaying the start of the summer recess.
The Lords voted 170-139, a majority of 31, to support Lord Carr's main
amendment, allowing courts to sentence young offenders to local authority
secure accommodation rather than government-run secure centres.
Peers then voted 147-128, a majority of 19, for a further amendment allowing
well-behaved young offenders to be transferred from secure centres to
complete their sentences in local authority care.
Earl Ferrers told peers during the bill's report stage that the amendments
would undermine the government's proposals to set up five privately run,
40-place, secure training centres for offenders aged 12 to 14.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Howard is rebuked for bitter attack on Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was rebuked last night for breaching
Commons rules in launching a personal attack on Mr Tony Blair, the
front-runner in the Labour leadership contest.
Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the deputy Speaker, twice called on Mr Howard to deal
with the content of the police and magistrates courts bill instead of
criticising Mr Blair.
Mr Howard ridiculed claims that Mr Blair had succeeded in establishing
Labour as the party best equipped to tackle the crime wave and improve law
and order.
Dismissing Mr Blair's 'muddled' opposition to the bill, the home secretary
said Mr Blair had given the impression that he had discovered the Ten
Commandments and that he had 'received them from the Almighty'.
As Labour backbenchers protested, Mr Lofthouse ordered the home secretary to
return to the third reading of the bill. He added: 'We are showing a great
example of law and order in this House tonight.'
Mr Blair said the bill had been 'savaged' by the House of Lords, and
remained a centralising measure which would undermine the concept of
community policing favoured by the public.
He forecast that the home secretary would also use it to secure 'wholesale
amalgamations' of police authorities against the wishes of the people in the
areas concerned and without any public inquiry.
Earlier, government whips encouraged Tory backbenchers to leave the chamber
when Mr Blair had his first opportunity to star from the Opposition front
bench since emerging as the clear favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour
leader.
Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, complained that the Tory
whips were trying to empty the government back benches.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said she did not know what the
Conservative whips were up to.
'As far as I am concerned I am totally riveted on Mr Blair,' she said.

The government yesterday faced growing pressure to slow down its shake-up of
London hospitals amid signs of concern in 10 Downing Street about the public
backlash.
Ministers suggested last night that the impending Cabinet reshuffle could
provide the opportunity for a rethink of proposals in the Tomlinson report
to slim down radically the capital's hospitals.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is widely expected to move to
a new department in a reshuffle which could come as soon as next Monday.
Her successor would be in a much stronger position to announce a review of
the planned hospital closures and mergers.
Mr John Major is said to be particularly concerned about the decision to
close in-patient services at Guy's hospital, one of the most advanced
research and teaching units in Britain.
Sir Philip Harris, a substantial benefactor to the hospital and a deputy
treasurer at Conservative Central Office, is among a number of influential
figures lobbying the prime minister to change Mrs Bottomley's decision.
An all-party group of MPs is leading a campaign to prevent the effective
closure of Guy's as part of its merger with St Thomas'. The merger is still
the subject of public consultation and opponents of the plan have threatened
a legal challenge.
Downing Street also appears uncertain of the financial calculations in the
original plan to close a number a leading teaching hospitals and cut the
number of beds in London by up to 2,500.
The British Medical Association yesterday angrily condemned the closure
plans. It voted unanimously at its annual conference for a reappraisal of
the 'disastrous' recommendations in the Tomlinson report.

FT  06 JUL 94 / MPs to probe Hualon project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recently established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe
aspects of the Pounds 157m Hualon textile project as part of its inquiry
into employment creation in the province.
The cross-party body is expected to question representatives of Northern
Ireland's Industrial Development Board on the subject later this year. A
decision on whether to question ministers will be taken later.
The project, to build a Belfast textiles plant, became the subject of
controversy in May when it emerged that the European Commission overrode
strong objections from its own officials in approving a Pounds 61m UK
government grant.
The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese
conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern
Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture.
Two of Hualon's top managers have been charged in connection with an alleged
share fraud.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Canvey Island gas plant may be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday announced that it was considering the sale of the
liquefied natural gas terminal on Canvey Island in Essex, the world's first
commercial LNG import terminal, Robert Corzine writes.
The 87-acre facility, which employs about 50 people, was built in 1964 to
handle natural gas imports from Algeria. It initially supplied large
industrial and commercial users before the country converted to natural gas.
At its peak in the 1970s the site employed 200 people. But the recovery of
large amounts of gas from fields in the North Sea eliminated the need for
regular shipments of LNG, which ended in 1982.
British Gas says there should be no contamination problem associated with
the site. A company official said, however, that soil under those parts of
the facility where the original in-ground storage tanks were located is
'well and truly frozen'.
The cold from the tanks, in which liquified gas was held at minus 160
degrees centigrade, so permeated the ground that it could take 100 years for
it to fully thaw.
Mr Harry Moulson, managing director of TransCo, British Gas's transportation
and storage business, said yesterday: 'There are currently no requirements
from our customers for LNG importation and vaporisation services.'
It is also unlikely that TransCo customers, including the trading division
of British Gas, will need to use the site to store LNG for use at peak
periods of demand, the role which it has fulfilled in recent years.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Swan Hunter employees agree to reduced pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The employees of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
agreed at a mass meeting yesterday to abandon the company severance scheme
after March 1995 if Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the only
potential bidder for the company, buys the yard.
The decision means any employees made redundant after that date would
receive a pay-off from CMN based on the state minimum, about 50 per cent
less than the present company severance scheme offers.
Mr Eddie Darke, one of Swan Hunter's union leaders and co-ordinator of the
Save Our Swans campaign, said: 'People realised the main priority was
keeping Swan Hunter open. This is the price which has to be paid.'
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team for Swan Hunter and prospective
managing director of the company, welcomed the decision.
Mr Henderson and Mr Iskandar Safa, whose Paris-based company Soffia bought
Cherbourg-based CMN in 1992, lobbied MPs at Westminster yesterday in support
of Swans' bid for the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. CMN's bid is
conditional on Swan Hunter winning this order from the Ministry of Defence.
An announcement is due this month.
'The Sir Bedivere contract will ensure the survival of Swan Hunter,' said Mr
Safa. 'But more than that, it will also lead British shipbuilding into a new
era of international co-operation and the potential for the joint
development of a new generation of surface warships for European navies.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / OECD endorses criticism of Pergau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has given a
cautious formal endorsement to domestic criticism of the UK's use of aid to
Malaysia to help build the Pergau dam.
In a report on the UK's aid programme, published yesterday, the OECD
endorses last October's National Audit Office criticisms of the government
for approving aid for Pergau against the overwhelming advice of civil
servants. The report says: 'The British government operates its aid
programme alongside diverse foreign policy and commercial interests.
Conflicts of objectives can arise on occasion, as in the case of the Pergau
project.'
The much-delayed report by the OECD's development assistance committee
raises concern about Pergau to an international level.
The committee considers Pergau to have vindicated its previous reports
criticising Britain's aid-and-trade provision, which is supposed to support
development pro-jects of value to British industry.
The report pinpoints criticisms of ATP by non-government aid organisations:
That it creates a conflict of objectives between the commercial need for
quick decisions and the need for full appraisals of the social,
environmental and economic aspects of the proposal.
That it benefits affluent countries disproportionately, diverting aid from
the poorest.
That ATP projects distort development planning and country strategies
because they are identified by commercial interests.
That ATP projects, because they are concentrated in a few sectors, create a
vested interest and a lobby which 'may not always give as high a priority to
development as aid officials might wish'.
The aid and trade rules were changed last year so that a country as
prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify for British bilateral aid.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Church plans housing scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 300 chapels are expected to be demolished and replaced by social
housing in a scheme by the Presbyterian Church of Wales to take account of
falling congregations.
The church has 977 chapels, mostly Victorian, and a membership of less than
56,000, with some congregations as small as 12.
The Rev Daffyd Owen, the church's general secretary, said yesterday:
'Membership has been in steady decline since the end of the first world war.
Most of Wales has a huge overcapacity of church buildings - in many rural
areas the capacity is more than the total adult population.
'We think this is a positive reaction to the decline. A message has been
coming through that the church has not been sufficiently concerned about the
community at large and not using its resources in line with the gospel
message.'
The cost of repair and restoration of all the chapels has been estimated at
Pounds 35m. Mr Owen said: 'Even if we had the money, it would be ridiculous
to spend in that way.'
The sites will be valued and sold to Aelwyd (Hearthside) Housing
Association, set up three years ago by the church in conjunction with the
United Reformed Church and Baptists. The association will develop the sites
for those in housing need. The church intends to use part of the income from
the land sales to subsidise rents. Decisions on closures, which are expected
to be phased over 10 years, will be subject to final approval by the
church's general assembly. Worshippers would attend other nonconformist
services.
Mr Owen acknowledged that there was a great deal of opposition. He said:
'There is a very close emotional attachment between church members and their
buildings. It needs a sea change in our thinking and attitudes which I think
is vitally important.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Lloyd's dissident admits bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading campaigner for dissident members of the Lloyd's of London
insurance market yesterday said he had been driven into bankruptcy.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, the outspoken chairman of the Lloyd's Names
Associations Working Party, was served with a petition for nearly Pounds
2.9m by a bank ultimately controlled by the family of Mr John Latsis, the
Greek shipping billionaire.
The move is not directly related to Mr Stockwell's participation in
underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's, but means it is unlikely he will be able
to pay off any of his outstanding debts to the insurance market.
It may also add to pressure by some groups for his removal as chairman of
the association, which has acted as an umbrella group for loss-making Names
taking legal action. Names are the individuals whose assets have
traditionally backed the market.
Mr Stockwell said yesterday that the bankruptcy was caused by his inability
 -because of demands from Lloyd's syndicates - to pay off loans secured
against his personal assets. He said he planned to continue in his
campaigning role. 'There are a great number of younger Names who have got
both Lloyd's losses and consequential losses,' he said. 'I am very sorry
about (the petition). It is very unpleasant for any Name. It is not a
situation anyone would set out to create.'
He said he had already paid out 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' to Lloyd's
syndicates until running out of money last year and his outstanding debts
were Pounds 2.5m 'and rising very fast'. He had also applied for 'hardship',
a Lloyd's scheme designed as an alternative to bankruptcy.
Lloyd's said yesterday that it was aware of the bankruptcy but stressed it
had taken no part in the petition, which was being handled by the Official
Receiver's office. Any syndicates owed money would rank alongside other
creditors including a number of banks.
The petition was served by the Private Bank &amp; Trust Company, a London-based
bank. Its directors include the son and one of the daughters of Mr John
Latsis, the Greek shipping magnate.
The bank specialises in providing banking, fund management and advisory
services to private clients with considerable wealth and is ultimately owned
by the Latsis family.
Mr Stockwell owned a number of property and furniture companies, including
Stockspring, which owed money to Private Bank and was placed in receivership
in 1991. He was paid Pounds 59,000 in salary and expenses last year in his
role as chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party.
He was several years ago subject to an earlier bankruptcy petition by
Kingham Hill School in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, but reached an
agreement with creditors.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Plugs ruling is setback for two-pin campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign to abandon the UK's three-pin plug and socket system in favour
of a proposed two-pin 'plug for Europe' received a blow last night after the
Department of Trade and Industry announced new regulations for domestic
appliances.
The controversial regulations, first proposed in January 1992, will require
most domestic appliances made in or imported into the UK to be supplied with
a correctly fused 13-amp plug from February 1 next year.
Supporters of harmonisation have been fighting the proposals because they
believe that they will lock the UK into the three-pin, 13-amp ring-main
system for years to come.
Mr Simon Hossack, a leading campaigner for the harmonised European system,
said: 'This is a triumph of politics over common sense.' The regulations
were a barrier to trade and would impede progress of a vital single market
goal, he said.
Mr Hossack added: 'Whatever plug is fitted to appliances will effectively
dictate the plug and socket system that the country uses. There would be no
incentive for the consumer to fit the new harmonised system when rewiring if
he had to cut off the plug supplied with the appliance.'
The new regulations are strongly supported by the UK plug and socket
industry and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents on safety
grounds.
In a parliamentary written answer yesterday Lord Strathclyde, consumer
affairs minister, said: 'Fatalities and injuries occur each year because of
incorrectly fitted electric plugs. These regulations represent an important
step forward in consumer safety for the British public.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A complaints officer with the Commission for Racial Equality yesterday
accused her employers of discrimination.
Miss Ila Dhorajiwala, who is of Indian origin, said she was overlooked by
the commission for a job which went to a white candidate.
She was desperate to move into personnel and had told her bosses she wanted
a transfer. She said she was stunned when she saw a vacancy in the
commission's human resources management department advertised in a magazine.
She failed to secure the job.
She told an industrial tribunal in Leeds: 'I have never been given any
reason why that happened. I think it is because of my race. I have seen
people of other races being transferred and given jobs and I cannot
understand why my transfer was not even considered.'
Miss Dhorajiwala, who joined the commission in 1987, said she had not come
across one coloured officer in human resources in the past four years.
The solicitor for the commission said Miss Dhorajiwala tried to get her job
in personnel through the back door.
Mr Paul Nicholls said she did not apply for the job, but asked for a
transfer from the complaints department to bypass the selection procedure.
'If you had put in an application you would have been shortlisted, but
instead you put in for a transfer,' he said.
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.

<TEXT>
Four US naval amphibious assault ships will sail for Haiti today, carrying
2,000 US Marines, the defence department said yesterday.
The ships are being sent to help in any evacuation of US citizens and
'designated foreign individuals' from Haiti, the department said. They will
join eight US warships patrolling the waters off the Caribbean nation to
enforce UN sanctions against Haiti's military regime.
A ninth ship - the helicopter-carrier Wasp - is also in the area for
training exercises with 650 Marines aboard.
It was also announced yesterday that the US would no longer offer asylum to
Haitian boat people, although refugees at centres built on the country's
territory would continue to be processed for possible asylum in the US.
Mr William Gray, President Bill Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said
that those fleeing by sea would only be offered safe haven in Panama, which
has agreed to accept up to 10,000 Haitian refugees for a six-month period.
Mr Gray acknowledged that the policy shift was prompted in part by the
drowning of nearly 100 boat people after their vessel had capsized.
After Mr Clinton's decision to end all commercial air traffic between the US
and Haiti, refugees have fled the nation in record numbers, often putting to
sea in overcrowded and unsafe open boats. By reserving political asylum only
for refugees at processing centres on land in Haiti, Washington is trying to

Mr Clinton has refused to rule out the possibility of an invasion to
reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, exiled after a military
coup in September 1991.
However, a Pentagon spokesman said ships were being sent only as a
precaution and no invasion was imminent.

FT  06 JUL 94 / An old man's magic: Canute James on a suspect Dominican
electoral win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joaqun Balaguer, the seemingly eternal president of the Dominican
Republic, has perfected the science, much to the annoyance of his political
opponents, of snatching slim electoral victories from almost certain defeat.
For the third time in the last three elections in the Caribbean state, Mr
Balaguer has retained office controversially, and in conditions which have
encouraged losing candidates to claim that he did so by less than fair
means.
While the country's electoral board is still reviewing the preliminary
results of the presidential and congressional election held in May, Mr
Balaguer is preparing to be inaugurated in August for his seventh term. But
there must be questions about the result.
In an electorate of 3.3m, Mr Balaguer's conservative Social Christian Reform
party received about 30,000 votes more than the social democratic Dominican
Revolutionary party of Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez. The latter, for whom
opinion polls had forecast a win, has claimed there were widespread
irregularities.
Most of the estimated 200,000 prospective electors who were unable to cast
their ballots were his party's supporters, Mr Pena Gomez claimed. Foreign
observers concurred. The US National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs noted 'significant problems and irregularities in the electoral
process.' It said that about 200,000 people did not get voting cards on time
and concluded: 'A disproportionate number of the disenfranchisement cases,
which members of the delegation noted, appeared to affect opposition
parties.'
Mr Balaguer, aged 87 and blind, dismissed the charges and claimed victory,
saying the election had been clean. Officials of his party agreed that all
had not gone well with the election but denied that fraud had brought the
result into question. They allowed that some inefficiency had occurred but
said this would not have altered the result despite the narrow victory of
the Social Christian party. Mr Pena Gomez is unlikely to succeed in his plan
to have foreign governments press Mr Balaguer into holding new,
internationally supervised elections.
If, as expected, his victory is confirmed by the board, Mr Balaguer will
have to deal immediately with two main issues. One is relations with Haiti,
with which the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola. The
recent tightening of international economic sanctions on Haiti, to prise out
the military rulers and allow the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
from exile, has forced Mr Balaguer into an awkward position.
The Dominican leader is far from enthusiastic about the return of Father
Aristide, who once described as 'slavery' the conditions of Haitian migrant
workers in the Dominican Republic. Mr Balaguer has publicly opposed the
tightening of the embargo on Haiti. Amid reports of suggestions that the
Dominican Republic could lose US trade preferences, he has moved to curb the
smuggling across the border with Haiti which is violating the economic
embargo and has been facilitated by the Dominican military.
The president's second big problem will be the country's economy. Some main
pillars - sugar, gold and nickel - have been hard hit by high production
costs and low market prices. The trade deficit is widening but the pressure
has been relieved by growing earnings from tourism. The central bank was
forced last month to intervene to stabilise the currency, which slipped
after two years of relative stability.
Mr Balaguer promises nothing new for the economy, which has been growing
moderately in the past three years: 'We should not embark on an adventure
and should continue our cautious policy.'
There must be doubt over how long he will remain in office. Few Dominicans,
including Social Christian party functionaries, expect the president to
stand for office again in 1998 when he would be 91. So there is much
attention on Mr Jacinto Peynado, a 53-year-old businessman, the grandson of
a former president and in line to be Mr Balaguer's new vice-president. Mr
Peynado's economic philosophy is less conservative than that of Mr Balaguer.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Top planner in Venezuela offers to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The head of Venezuela's presidential planning office, Cordiplan, has offered
his resignation in protest at the government's failure to approve a series
of free-market reforms he proposed.
Mr Luis Carlos Palacios, who joined Cordiplan from the industry ministry at
the end of May, had recommended President Rafael Caldera's government
approve moves including:
negotiating agreements with the International Monetary Fund and other
multilateral agencies;
increasing domestic petrol prices and subsidising public transport;
reforming the country's onerous system of severance benefits to workers;
higher taxes.
Free-market policies have been generally rejected by the Caldera
administration since it took office in February.
Announcing his resignation, Mr Palacios said his proposals had not been
accepted by the cabinet, and warned that price and exchange controls
introduced on June 27 were attacking only 'the symptoms of the crisis', not
the causes.
Although it was not clear yesterday whether President Caldera would accept
the resignation, Mr Palacios's initiative reflected the depth of the schisms
within and outside the government over the imposition of the controls.
Another cabinet member, Mr Alberto Poletto, industry minister, told
businessmen that the recent controls, while necessary in the short term,
were 'not the correct way to run the economy'. He said he had never imagined
that he would be industry minister when such drastic measures were taken.
Since the controls were announced, several ministers have said they will be
'temporary', although no time span has been specified. Details of the price
and exchange controls are still being announced. The government was expected
to announce the new foreign exchange programme - Venezuela's fourth this
year - late last night.
Bad economic news has continued to pile up. Mr Palacios announced that
Venezuela's GDP shrank by 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994,
compared with the equivalent period in 1993. The oil sector grew by 2.9 per
cent but non-oil activities declined by 4.8 per cent. Imports for the first
four months of 1994 were down 32 per cent from the equivalent period last
year.
Some economists are predicting a 5 per cent decline in GDP this year,
compared with a 1 per cent decline in 1993.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of depositors are still waiting to claim
their money from eight financial institutions closed by the government last
month. Depositors protesting outside Banco Metropolitano on Monday
threatened to set fire to bank offices if they were not paid.
Two prominent bankers - Mr Jose Mara Nogueroles, president of Banco
Provincial, Venezuela's largest bank, and Mr Edgar Dow, head of Banco del
Caribe - warned that the government's plan to 'recycle' money from strong
banks to weak institutions will destroy what is left of the country's
banking system.
A recent IMF report, published by a Caracas daily, predicted that the
Venezuelan government would have a budget deficit equivalent to nearly 17.5
per cent of GDP this year, due to official financial assistance to the
banking system.
Caveme, an association of pharmaceutical companies, has also warned that the
government ban on foreign exchange sales will cause shortages of medicines
since many raw materials are imported.
Stocks of some processed foods have also run low due to the industry's
reliance on imports.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Big Argentine protest today to protect jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentine President Carlos Menem has promised strict security measures for a
demonstration today by trade unions and opposition parties in the centre of
the capital, Buenos Aires.
Organisers say this will be the largest demonstration against Mr Menem's
free market economic policies since he took office in mid-1989. They hope to
mobilise more than 40,000 people.
Mr Menem, concerned there could be violence, has ordered 6,000 police,
backed by helicopters and riot police, to patrol the city centre.
The demonstration will occur in the context of rising industrial unrest,
fuelled by stagnant wages and worsening unemployment. Discontent is also
increasing in the provinces, where most local economies are in deep
recession.
The march today is to be led by a new breed of union bosses, mainly leaders
of public sector workers from the provinces fighting to protect jobs under
threatened local government reforms.
A younger generation of more aggressive union leaders is out-flanking more
cautious union bosses prominent in the old guard of the Peronist movement
which also spawned Mr Menem. Branch members of the powerful UOM
metalworkers' union have swept aside their leaders' remonstrations and
called a series of one-day strikes for this month to press for a 30 per cent
wage increase.
Previous anti-government protests and strikes in Argentina have failed
because of apathy and skilful counters by Mr Menem's Peronist government,
which has co-opted labour leaders while reducing traditional union
privileges.

Four US naval amphibious assault ships will sail for Haiti today, carrying
2,000 US Marines, the defence department announced yesterday.
The ships are being sent to help in any evacuation of US citizens and
'designated foreign individuals' from Haiti, the department said. The
amphibious assault group will join eight US warships patrolling the waters
off the Caribbean nation to enforce UN sanctions against Haiti's military
regime.
A ninth ship - the helicopter-carrier Wasp - is also in the area for
training exercises with 650 Marines aboard.
A naval spokesman refused to comment on whether the ships could be used to
land troops on Haitian soil.
President Bill Clinton has refused to rule out the possibility of an
invasion to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, exiled after a
military coup in September 1991.
After Mr Clinton's decision to end all commercial air traffic between the US
and Haiti, refugees have fled the nation in record numbers, often putting to
sea in overcrowded and unsafe open vessels in the hope of political asylum
in the US. The flood of asylum-seekers - who have left Haiti at rates
sometimes reaching 1,000 per day - has forced the Clinton administration to
reopen its refugee centre at Guantanamo Bay in south-eastern Cuba.
The refugees - those picked at sea up by the US Coast Guard - are also being
brought to naval ships serving in the Caribbean as floating processing
centres, and to refugee camps on the British-owned Turks and Caicos Islands.
Under current US policy, refugees are being given brief asylum hearings and
those not given asylum are returned to Haiti.
Panama said yesterday it would be willing to accept up to 10,000 refugees.

Bulgaria are through to the quarter-finals for the first time in their
history after beating Mexico in a penalty shoot-out at Giants Stadium, New
Jersey, yesterday.
The game finished 1-1 after 30 goalless minutes of extra time.
Bulgarian striker Stoichkov gave his side the lead with an unstoppable
left-foot shot in the 7th minute only for Mexico to equalise within 11
minutes. Kremenliev was adjudged to have fouled Alves in the penalty area,
allowing Alberto Garcia the chance to score from the penalty spot.
The match was halted for over five minutes midway through the half when
Mexican defender Bernal became tangled in his own net, damaging the support.
In the second half, Kremenliev and Mexico's Luis Garcia were both sent off
for second bookable offences as the game drifted towards extra time.
The first three penalties were missed, but then Guentchev, Borimirov and
Letchkov scored for Bulgaria and only Suarez hit the target for the
Mexicans.
Bulgaria now play Germany on Sunday.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italians hold off Nigeria for extra-time
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roberto Baggio and the Azzurri were about two minutes away from a date with
lions in the Coliseum of Rome in Foxboro, Massachusetts, yesterday, Jurek
Martin writes.
But the Italian superstar rescued his team with an 88th-minute equaliser and
then, in the 10th minute of extra time, converted the penalty that his own
lovely lobbed pass had helped create, giving Italy a 2-1 victory over
Nigeria in the World Cup second round.
If ever a game had two parts it was this. Nigeria took the lead in the 25th
minute in virtually their first attack. A corner from the right rebounded
off Maldini across the area to Amunike, who placed a sidefoot volley past
Marchegiani. Whereupon Nigeria sat on their lead and Italy attacked in
waves. But so stout was the Nigerian defence and so poor the Italian offence
that Rufai in goal had no serious save to make until Baggio beat him.
The goal followed a run from the right by Mussi, playing only his third
international, who gave Baggio a clear shot from a dozen yards inside
Rufai's right post. The winner came after Baggio lofted a dead ball to set
Benarrivo through in the area, where he was clattered down by Eguavoen. The
penalty went in off the right-hand post.
That a penalty was called at all was the fitting climax of an eccentric
refereeing day by Arturo Brizio of Mexico. He issued nine yellow cards,
tying a World Cup record, five to Italians, though the match was never
vicious. His worst error occurred in the 75th minute when he sent off Zola,
a second-half substitute, for what seemed the mildest of tackles.
But two minutes later he decided not to send off Maldini, who had brought
down Yekini with the sort of arm toss of which a sumo wrestler would have
been proud.
So Italy, as against Norway, won with 10 men. Even so, as the Nigerians
cranked up their attack, they left openings which both Baggios nearly
exploited. At the other end, Dino Baggio saved the day in extra time by
hooking a Yekini poke off the line.
Later, Yekini launched a bitter attack on Nigeria coach Clemens Westerhof,
saying the defeat was due to his tactical folly. He also criticised his
team-mates for not passing to him enough.
It was a match which salvaged Roberto Baggio's pre-tournament reputation -
though only just. After a bright beginning, he faded from the scene and
looked tense and unsmiling. The goal unleashed a talent that seemed withered
under pressure. Next come Spain on Saturday and their defence is far more
uncompromising than Nigeria's.

FT  06 JUL 94 / US allows more flexible transfer pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury unveiled new tax rules yesterday that will allow companies
greater flexibility in determining the transfer prices of their internal
cross-border transactions.
Transfer pricing, in which companies allocate prices of their transactions
with a foreign subsidiary or parent, has become a highly contentious area in
the international tax arena. Foreign companies operating in the US have
often been accused of manipulating transfer prices in order to reduce their
tax liability. In the 1992 election campaign President Bill Clinton hit at
foreign companies for paying too little tax in the US.
The new rules, which formalise and extend temporary regulations introduced
last year, give companies more leeway over the methods by which they
determine their transfer prices. They are called upon to choose the 'best
method' for their particular circumstances from a range of options.
However, in turn, the Internal Revenue service will be able to impose
financial penalties of 20-40 per cent where it determines underpayments of
tax have been made due to transfer pricing adjustments.
'Although the rules are broader in application and based on more general
principles, they also give the IRS the tools to go after companies trying to
cheat,' a treasury official said yesterday.
While the regulations 'afford considerable leeway for the exercise of
judgment by the IRS and the taxpayer, taxpayers may feel pressure to
excercise that judgment appropriately, given the substantial penalties that
could be imposed if they did not apply the regulations in a reasonable
manner,' the treasury said.
The benchmark for determ - ining accurate transfer prices is the arm's
length principal, which asks what a similar commercial transaction between
unrelated companies would cost.
The final regulations 'are intended to maximise the extent to which relevant
information may be taken into account in evaluating a taxpayer's results
under the arm's length standard,' the treasury said, adding that it does not
believe that the changes are likely to result in any significant rises in
revenue. However, companies which were not complying under the old system
could well find themselves paying more, it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's meeting in Riga today with the presidents of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia marks a renewed effort by the US to complete
agreements for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the three Baltic
countries by August 31.
US officials say the visit to the Latvian capital - the first by a US
president to a Baltic country - is a signal of the Clinton administration's
commitment to the three countries. Their annexation by the Soviet Union was
never recognised by the US. 'This trip is meant to say: we support the
independence of the Baltic countries and their future is important to the
US,' a senior administration official said.
Russian troops have already withdrawn from Lithuania and an agreement was
signed in April for a withdrawal from Latvia. 'What is missing in this
equation is an agreement between Russia and Estonia,' a US official said.
Negotiations are under way this week in Geneva and Mr Clinton is expected to
use his meeting later in the week with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at
the Group of Seven industrialised nations' summit in Naples to press for an
agreement. Issues unresolved include the status of retired Russian military
personnel who have settled in Estonia; the status of a naval research base;
and the availability of housing for Russian officers returning from Estonia.
Mr Clinton is also expected to raise US concerns about the restrictive
citizenship law recently passed by the Latvian parliament which raises
anxieties in Moscow over the status of ethnic Russians. The law has been
rejected by Latvia's president.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Surreal enough for Magritte? Almost certainly
 -Jurek Martin finds the tournament has its fair share of the unexpected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This World Cup is becoming too surreal for comfort. Let us simply try and
count the ways in which what passes for normality in soccer has been
transformed into something of an illusion.
One, a team from the US, most of whose players are obscure - to put it
mildly - and whose goalkeeper is more intent on an acting career, comes
within 15 minutes of forcing Brazil into extra time. This was in no script
written outside Hollywood.
Of course, the US were out-played for much of the game by a team which, for
half of it, were a man short. The Americans only managed one clear chance
and no actual shot on goal, but nor did the Brazilians, Romario apart,
threaten annihilation; and the tension of the moment showed on every
Brazilian player's face - so much so that one of them, Leonardo, gave in to
his nerves by planting his elbow in an American's face.
Two, a game in Giants Stadium between Saudi Arabia and Morocco drew a crowd
of 72,000. Think about it: two Arab teams playing in New Jersey, no less,
and selling out the place.
It would only have been understandable had it been played in Casablanca or
Riyadh, with Bogart as referee and O'Toole and Omar Sharif working the
lines. Equally amazing, Russia against Cameroon drew an even bigger crowd.
Three, the poor Colombian who scores an own goal against the US gets
murdered on his return home. Soccer may generate war, pestilence, famine and
rioting, but players do not get knocked off by irate fans, even in Medellin
(Cali, maybe, but not Medellin, now that its narcotics kingpin, Pablo
Escobar - no relation to the unfortunate Andres - is no more).
Four, Diego Maradona, captain of Argentina, is not apparently in disgrace
for having failed a drugs test, thus fatally weakening a team that had begun
to appear a favourite. There he was out in California doing TV reporting on
the Argentina-Romania game and weeping on air as his team went down.
Fallen idols are treated differently here. As Tony Kornheiser put it in the
Washington Post: 'Do you see Doc Gooden (the Mets pitcher suspended last
week for narcotics abuse) going to Cincinnati to sit in the booth with Ralph
Kiner? Does this guy have no shame at all?'
Americans can be remarkably tolerant of those they have been reared to
revere. 'Say it ain't so, Joe', they all said after Shoeless Joe Jackson was
charged with accepting bribes in the 1919 World Series.
More recently, O J Simpson, the former gridiron great, lost no jobs after
pleading guilty to wife-beating (a murder rap, however, has proved another
matter).
Five, the clog-laden Dutch are now rated a fast team by virtue of
extinguishing Ireland. Even Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, said so, so it
must be true, though he might have been decently disguising the shortcomings
of his own side.
So shocked were crowds in The Hague - not exactly a city where passions
normally run high - that they went on a looting spree instead of tending
their tulips.
Six, following the completion of the second-round games yesterday, Europe is
in the ascendant, with seven out of the eight sides through to the
quarter-finals. This was not supposed to be. No European side has ever won
the World Cup on non-European soil. It can only reflect the mysterious
chemistry linking European political disarray to performance on the soccer
field.
All the European sides, Germany excepted, were presumed to be cannon fodder
for Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, and even for Nigeria. Now Romania, where
chicken feet were a staple diet not so long ago, look as likely to succeed
as anybody. Ceaucescu and his Securitate must be turning in their graves.
Natural law may yet reassert itself if Brazil take it all, but it might be
pointed out that even Brazil have managed only two goals in their last two
matches. If anything, they are living on that most unnatural of Brazilian
characteristics - defence.
Exactly what Americans make of all this is anybody's guess. Yesterday, the
Tuesday morning quarter-backs (normally they are the Monday morning
quarter-backs, but Monday was a holiday) took pride in the US team but had
their doubts that anything as bizarre as soccer could take deep root here.
'Was this the beginning of an era for American soccer - or the end of a
delightful interlude?' asked George Vecsey in the New York Times. 'Will the
US even be back in the next World Cup in four years in France?'
The usually irreverent Kornheiser even turned semi-serious. 'As much as I've
come to like the World Cup, I'm glad we don't treat it with the same fervour
as other nations. All this talk about how 'soccer is a passion' and 'soccer
is a religion' makes me nervous.'
He also found it pretentious. 'One man I know, who has been salivating about
the World Cup for years while attacking American sports as loutish, informed
me (that) 'every play, every rush downfield is a short story in itself.' I'm
watching 22 guys with hairy legs kick a ball around and he's seeing Carlos
Castenada in a crossing pass.'
In this Cup, Rene Magritte would be a more apt point of reference. There is
a hole in the middle of the body of soccer through which bright blue skies
can be seen. That must, somehow, be good. But explaining it is no joke.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: No homecoming party for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be no great home-coming for Ireland's World Cup team. Four years
ago, more than 300,000 people packed Dublin's streets to welcome the team
when they returned from the World Cup in Italy after reaching the
quarter-finals.
But plans for a similar open-air party were canceled yesterday in the wake
of Ireland's 2-0 loss to Holland. Up to 500,000 fans had been expected at
Phoenix Park to greet the team tomorrow, but organisers cancelled the
reception when they learned that manager Jack Charlton and half the players
would not be returning this week.
Charlton is staying in the US to work as a television commentator, while up
to a dozen players are taking holidays.
The Irish broadcasting service RTE was swamped with calls from fans critical
of Charlton's decision to ignore the homecoming.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Injury fears for key Swedish players
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish mid-fielder and captain Jonas Thern will miss at least four days of
practice because of a sore knee, but is expected to play in Sunday's
quarter-final against Romania.
'I've played so much and I don't need more practice,' said Thern, who left
Sunday's second-round game against Saudi Arabia in the 69th minute with a
sore right knee.
Sweden defeated the Saudis 3-1 and have yet to lose a game. Except for a
weak first half in their June 19 opener against Cameroon (2-2), Thern has
been the key mid-field player for Sweden.
Central defender Joachim Bjorklund, who left Sunday's game early in the
second half complaining about pain in his thighs, is also likely to miss the
next few days' training in Oakland, California.
The Swedes are studying videos of the Romanians. They are impressed by the
Romanians' defensive play, and by Hagi, whom they rate the player of the
tournament so far.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Romania uplifted by win over Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Romanians are looking for more World Cup scalps. And they say they have
prepared themselves carefully enough to go further in the competition,
following their 3-2 win against Argentina that eliminated the two-time world
champions.
The victory put Romania into the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time
and triggered intense excitement in Romania and in the US. The match was
greeted as the high point of the World Cup finals so far.
'This was our greatest performance ever,' said Ilie Dumitrescu, who scored
two goals against Argentina. 'We eliminated one of the best teams in the
world.'
In Bucharest, tens of thousands of people appeared on the streets in
celebrations reminiscent of those in the winter of 1989, after the downfall
of Romania's Communist regime.
Head coach Anghel Iordanescu said that the win against Argentina was
Romania's 'greatest joy since the revolution.'
Four years ago Romania lost to Ireland in the World Cup second round on
penalty kicks.
Against Sweden in the next round, the Romanians will be even stronger with
the return of striker Florin Raducioiu, who had to sit out the game against
Argentina because of suspension.
Romania were seen as underdogs before the tournament started. But they have
won three of their games (Colombia, the US and Argentina). Only Switzerland
(now eliminated) have beaten them - 4-1 in the first round.
Brazil, who did not over-impress against the US on Monday, winning only 1-0,
will have their work cut out if they bump into the Romanians next week.

victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy beat Nigeria 2-1 yesterday in the first game of the World Cup finals
to go to extra time, setting up a quarter-final clash with Spain on
Saturday.
Amunike scored following an error by Italian captain Maldini to give Nigeria
a 1-0 half-time lead against the run of play.
Italy beseiged Rufai's goal in the second half but were kept at bay by
Nigeria's powerful, physical defense and their own lack of punch.
The Italians, reduced to 10 men after Zola was sent off, equalised in the
last minute of regular time.
Roberto Baggio broke the deadlock from the penalty spot in the 12th minute
of extra time after Eguavoen had brought down Italian defender Benarrivo.
While Italian fans held their breath, Baggio stayed cool and planted his
penalty to the right of goalkeeper Rufai.
Two minutes later Yekini might have hauled Nigeria level again. However,
with the Italian defence all at sea, he could not fasten on to a proper
shot.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Baby Bells set for contest with judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four of America's 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies are expected to
launch a legal battle as early as today aimed at eliminating the immense
powers wielded over them by a US district judge for the past decade.
The case could play an important role in breaking down the complex legal and
regulatory framework which prevents the Baby Bells from competing in the
long-distance telecommunications market, or making telephone equipment.
The Bell companies are expected to call on Judge Harold Greene to give up
the oversight of the US telecommunications industry he has exercised since
the early 1980s, when he presided over the court-ordered break-up of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph on anti-trust grounds.
AT&amp;T's local operations were spun off into seven separate Baby Bells.
Because each of these enjoyed regional monopolies, they were forbidden from
entering the long-distance market, equipment manufacturing and information
services (though the latter ban was lifted in 1991). AT&amp;T retained its
long-distance operations, though these were opened to full competition.
Since then, Judge Greene has presided over the so-called consent decree
which established this framework, and both AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells must seek
his permission for substantial changes in operating practices. Judge Greene
has tended to interpret the consent decree conservatively and the telephone
companies have grown frustrated at his court's long backlog of requests for
waivers.
Many industry observers argue that to vest such powers in a solitary judge,
committed to a framework 10 years old, is seriously to impede the evolution
of one of the world's fastest changing industrial sectors.
The four companies pursuing legal action - Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex
and Southwestern Bell - are expected to argue that the consent decree has
outlived its usefulness.
The House of Representatives last week passed a telecommunications bill
which would do away with the consent decree and eventually allow the Baby
Bells into the long-distance market. But the legislation faces a tough fight
in the Senate and the Baby Bells are evidently launching their court battle
as a precautionary measure.
Judge Greene seems likely to reject the call for him to relinquish his
powers. If so, the four are likely to take the battle to the Supreme Court.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Keys, master of inspired commonsense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Keys taught South Africa to believe in itself. Yesterday he
jeopardised that new-found confidence by announcing he will resign as the
country's finance minister, from October.
Less than a month ago, Mr Keys stood before international investors at a
meeting of the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, displaying his 'good news
tie', a garish neckpiece whose multi-coloured stripes clashed painfully with
the bold striping of his shirt. He asked them to believe in South Africa, to
trust its intention to maintain strict fiscal and financial discipline.
To the extent they did so, it was because the presence of Mr Keys in
government gave them confidence and reassurance. Now this consummate
psychological manipulator is leaving government; it is hard to see another
man taking his place.
Mr Chris Liebenberg, last night named as Mr Keys' successor, certainly has
the technical skills to be finance minister, having served as chief
executive of the country's fourth largest bank. But he lacks Mr Keys
powerful personality, and his carefully nurtured relationship with top
figures in the African National Congress; he will not command the same
respect in the government of national unity, or outside it. Mr Keys' loss is
a serious blow to the new govern-ment's credibility, at home and abroad.
When he said, only a month ago, 'We've spent the past four years proving the
sceptics wrong and we are quite happy to go on doing so,' no one suspected
he would not be there to carry on that struggle. A man of strong faith and
devotion to his wife Silma, Mr Keys has often made clear she would prefer
him to leave politics, and that he likes to please her whenever possible.
But once he accepted the post of finance minister in Mr Nelson Mandela's
government after having served in that role under Mr FW de Klerk, no one
expected him to bow out so soon. He seemed to enjoy his new role, and his
relations with Mr Alec Erwin, his deputy, and Mr Jay Naidoo, reconstruction
and development minister, both socialists and former radicals from Mr
Mandela's African National Congress, were excellent.
The only consolation comes from the fact that Mr Keys' departure appears to
be genuinely motivated by personal reasons, rather than irreconcilable
policy differences with Mr Mandela.
Mr Keys's achievements of the past two years are substantial: reducing the
budget deficit, keeping to budget targets, constraining the rise in
government spending, restoring confidence. But most of all, he has ensured
that, as he put it last week, 'there is a real understanding that the pot is
only a certain size; that the RDP (reconstruction and development programme)
has got to come out of it, and that if the pot looks as though it's being
emptied too much, it's going to have repercussions'. The budget he presented
to parliament a fortnight ago marks the government's acceptance of those
realities.
Throughout the country's turbulent transition to democracy, he has been
relentless in his optimism, even in the most violent days leading up to the
April elections.
He has mastered the art of making everything he says sound simple and
obvious. He has used commonsense and the commercial acumen developed over 30
years as one of South Africa's top businessmen, to induce sanity among the
country's fractious politicians.
At a time in 1992 when they had sunk to new depths of squabbling, Mr Keys
told them a few choice economic truths: that unless they moved quickly,
South Africa would not be worth fighting over. The politicians listened, and
democracy talks began in earnest.
'I'm the minister of the obvious,' he once told the Financial Times. 'I see
myself as someone who jollies people to do what common sense dictates they
ought to do.' He saw what had to be done, and had the political skill to
persuade the ANC, the black trade unions, the business community and the
cabinet that they had seen it first themselves.
His force comes from the strength of a truly uncluttered brain: clear like
his 'desk', the round conference table which stands empty at one end of the
room; simple like his rhetoric. Perhaps this is genuine, perhaps a trick of
personality. Either way, it worked; Mr Keys' personality was an important
force driving economic recovery which should see growth hit 2.5 per cent
this year, after a four-year recession.
His campaign has been overwhelmingly psychological. Investors must believe
in investing, bureaucrats must believe in giving their best efforts by
cutting waste and inefficiency, the ANC must believe in the virtues of a
free market, the unions must believe they have a stake in growth, and all of
them must believe in Derek Keys.
'Government is in a typically feminine role,' he told the FT in a 1993
interview. It is 'trying to create a situation attractive enough to
stimulate some initiative from another party (the private investor). Once
you commit yourself to relying on the private sector because only it can
produce the investment directions with adequate yields, then you put
yourself in this situation. How can I be more attractive? That's the heart
of the problem.' Now the problem is somebody else's.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Man with new set of rules to learn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christo Liebenberg, South Africa's newly appointed finance minister, is a
respected member of the South African business community, report Philip
Gawith from London and Mark Suzman from Johannesburg.
Without any political background, and given his solid reputation as a
successful banker, he is seen as unlikely to diverge sig-nificantly from the
cautious fiscal policy framework established by Mr Keys. But he lacks Mr
Keys' charisma.
Mr Liebenberg, 60, was until February chief executive of Nedcor, South
Africa's fourth largest banking group.
Under his guidance, Nedcor had a good record of social involvement, and was
co-sponsor of the influential Nedcor-Old Mutual planning exercise a few
years ago. The resulting document set out policy proposals to help push
South Africa into growth and alleviate black poverty.
In politics, Mr Liebenberg will have to learn to play by a new set of rules
as he seeks to maintain fiscal stability in face of continued demands for
extra spending.
He will also have to try to earn the respect of his key cabinet colleagues,
especially Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin, and Minister Without
Portfolio Jay Naidoo, with whom he will have to work closely in implementing
the reconstruction programme, the centrepiece of the government's economic
policy.

<TEXT>
Dismay was the common response among South African businessmen yesterday to
the imminent departure as finance minister of Mr Derek Keys, whom they
credit with having put the country's finances on a sounder footing during
two years in office which spanned the transition to democracy.
Bond, equity and currency markets all reacted negatively in an afternoon of
rumour-laden turmoil before his confirmation last night that he was stepping
down. The unexpected resignation was a blow to growing confidence of
international investors in South Africa, which was increasingly being tipped
as a fashionable 'emerging' market.
Mr Cedric Savage, president of the South African Chamber of Business, said
it came as a surprise and shock to business that Mr Keys felt obliged to
resign so soon after the inauguration in May of the government of national
unity. 'Financial markets and business confidence are likely to react
negatively to this development,' he said.
Although the overall stock market dropped only three points on the day to
close at 5,451, bond yields climbed above 15 per cent after starting at 14.5
per cent, and the financial rand, the country's investment currency,
regarded as the best barometer of international investor sentiment, fell
12.5 cents from R4.72 to the dollar in London to R4.845.
The news is a particular blow for the stockbroking community, which has been
aggressively marketing South African shares abroad in the wake of Mr Keys's
recent budget, which was widely praised for prudence and commitment to
cutting the budget deficit.
'There's no question it will be viewed as a major negative, especially
overseas, where Keys was known and trusted,' said another broker. 'He was a
stabilising and reassuring figure and his departure will cost South Africa
dearly.'
The resignation could also spell trouble for the first global offering of
convertible bonds for a South African company. Robert Fleming is in the
process of 'book-building' - sounding out investors - in a Dollars 360m to
Dollars 500m offering for Liberty Life, the country's fourth largest
company. The deal is due to be priced on Tuesday. 'I do want clarity before
I commit to this deal,' said one London-based international fund manager.
'Part of the comfort with South Africa was that the people in charge of the
economy were running a tight ship.'
Mr Ian Hannam, the banker in charge of the offering at Robert Fleming,
admitted the news had caused concern but said 'no investors have dropped out
as a result. The most important thing is who will replace Mr Keys'.
Businessmen were inclined to accept at face value Mr Keys' statement that he
was leaving for unspecified personal reasons. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of
Liberty Life and TransAtlantic Holdings, and one of Mr Keys' oldest friends,
commented: 'I would believe they are genuine reasons. He would not put his
name to anything like this unless it was true.'
'We're all quite amazed,' said Mr Peter Davey of brokers Frankel Pollak
Vinderine, 'It's all so sudden. Everything seemed to be going so well,
particularly with the economic team of Keys and (deputy finance minister
Alec) Erwin.'
Investors feared strict controls on public spending in Mr Keys' June budget
would not be implemented and the government would be tempted to meet its new
spending commitments by more borrowing.
'Keys was seen as a tough negotiator who could stand up to the many
competing claims on the governments resources,' said Mr Graham Bell, head of
bond research at Baring Securities in London. 'The markets were also
unnerved by the manner of the resignation, which was basically bad PR.' 'Mr
Keys had credibility in the eyes of the financial markets,' said Ms Wendy
Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. 'His resignation will dash
investors' confidence in South Africa as an emerging market in which they
can invest strongly.'

commented: 'I would believe they are genuine reasons. He would not put his
name to anything like this unless it was true.'
Mr Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, South Africa's
largest banking group by market capitalisation, was the name most frequently
mentioned yesterday as a possible successor to Mr Keys. Associates of Mr
Strauss said he had been unaware of the news before it became public and it
was untrue that he had been approached as a successor.
Mr Gordon did add, however, that 'it was not impossible' that Mr Strauss
could succeed Mr Keys. He said Mr Strauss would 'probably be my first
choice'. The issue is close to home for Mr Gordon as Mr Strauss has often
been mooted as a likely successor to him at Liberty Life. The two groups
have close ties.
Rumours that he will be replaced by Mr Strauss helped reassure traders that
the resignation may not indicate a split on policy between Mr Keys and the
government. 'If he is genuinely leaving for personal reasons, the market
will calm down again,' said one banker.
Business leaders also reacted with dismay to the news and expressed worries
it might have serious longer term repercussions in the next budget, where Mr
Keys's restraining influence on spending will be missed. 'It's the end of
the honeymoon,' said one disconsolate banker.
'We're all quite amazed,' observed Mr Peter Davey of brokers Frankel Pollak
Vinderine, 'Its all so sudden, everything seemed to be going so well,
particularly with the economic team of Keys and (deputy finance minister
Alec) Erwin.'
The bond market felt the blow particularly keenly, as Mr Key's resignation
prompted fears that the government's control over public expenditure would
now be loosened.
Investors feared that strict controls on public spending in Mr Key's June
budget would now not be implemented and that the government would be tempted
to meet its many new spending commitments by increasing its borrowing.
'Keys was seen as a tough negotiator who could stand up to the many
competing claims on the governments resources,' said Mr Graham Bell, head of
bond research at Baring Securities in London. 'The markets were also
unnerved by the manner of the resignation, which was basically bad PR.'
'Mr Keys had credibility in the eyes of the financial markets,' said Ms
Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. 'His resignation
will dash investors' confidence in South Africa as an emerging market in
which they can invest strongly,' she said.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Cabinet short on experience and lacking electoral tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Palestinian national authority sworn in before Mr Yassir Arafat in
Jericho yesterday is short on experience and made up largely of loyalists
who depend on the PLO chairman for their political position.
The authority, a de facto cabinet, contains a cautious balance of people
from the West Bank, Gaza and the 'leadership in exile', prominent families
and both the Islamic and Christian Palestinian communities.
Few of the 'ministers' have any proven administrative ability or have passed
an electoral test. None is expected to pose any real threat to Mr Arafat's
way of centralising power and ruling by fiat.
The position of all the ministers, who will rule as a caretaker or interim
government until national elections expected in mid-October, is likely to be
fragile in the face of a Palestinian population anxious for democracy after
27 years of Israeli occupation. During those three months they will have
enormous problems in producing any tangible results in solving day-to-day
problems of unemployment, poverty and inadequate services facing the 900,000
Palestinians now under self-rule.
But some of the ministers do have a technocratic record in the portfolios to
which they have been appointed, among them Mr Yassir Amr, education
minister, and Mr Riyad al-Zanoun, health minister. But it is unclear if they
will be allowed to exercise real power.
'The fundamental question about the authority is going to be whether Mr
Arafat will give them the authority to implement decisions,' one PLO
official said. 'In the past, he has never delegated. If he carries on this
way, we are going to have tremendous problems with decisions delayed,
changed arbitrarily and overruled on the personal whim of President Arafat.'
Concern about the authority's real power, democracy and credibility have
been reflected in Mr Arafat's difficulty in recruiting members. Mr Mahmoud
Abbas and Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, two of the most senior PLO leaders, have
refused positions on the authority and chosen to stay at PLO headquarters in
Tunis.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, former PLO spokeswoman, also turned down a job. Mr Faisal
al-Husseini, the man with perhaps the greatest independent political base in
the West Bank, refused to be sworn in yesterday as minister without
portfolio on the excuse that his responsibility to the 150,000 Palestinians
in Arab East Jerusalem was beyond the geographical limits of self-rule in
Gaza-Jericho.
At least five places on the 24-member authority have yet to be filled as Mr
Arafat continues to cajole opposition figures into taking some seats.
Nobody symbolises the nature of the authority more than Mr Nabil Shaath,
minister for planning and economic co-operation. Aged 55 and a businessman
with one of the biggest publishing and management consultancy companies in
the Arab world, he led the PLO negotiating team with Israel and Mr Arafat
has, so far, made him front man for self-rule. Mr Shaath, respected for his
intellectual, organisational and communications skills, has no political
base in the West Bank or Gaza. Many Palestinians see him as more Egyptian
than Palestinian.
Mr Mohamed Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, finance minister, is closely associated with
Mr Arafat. He comes from a prominent Jerusalem family, is head of the PLO
economic department, and is a member of the PLO executive committee. His
power was substantially increased yesterday when the 'cabinet', among its
first decisions, transferred responsibility for the annual budget from the
development council to the finance ministry.
Two members of the authority represent the Palestinian Democratic Union, or
Fida, a small breakaway political party set up in 1993 with marginal popular
support. Fida has, with reservations, supported the peace process and backed
Mr Arafat.
Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, 49, a leader of Fida and a PLO executive committee
member, becomes minister for arts, culture and information. Mr Azmi Shuaibi
is made minister of youth and sports. Mr Elias Freij, Christian mayor of
Bethlehem since 1972, becomes minister for tourism and monuments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERICHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat flew into Jericho on an Egyptian helicopter yesterday for
an emotional reunion with the West Bank after 27 years' exile, and to press
his demands for a speedy expansion of Palestinian self-rule beyond
Gaza-Jericho.
In a whirlwind visit to the capital of Palestinian self-rule, Mr Arafat,
still croaking from too many speeches during his historic four-day
homecoming, blew kisses to an excited crowd, vowed to build a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital, swore in the first Palestinian
self-government and held a series of meetings with dignitaries and
well-wishers.
Mr Nabil Shaath, senior Palestinian negotiator, said Israel, which has
hailed Mr Arafat's visit as a 'triumph of common sense and pragmatism', had
upgraded its delegation for talks in Paris today to cover redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank and an early transfer of authority.
Mr Arafat has asked Israel to redeploy its troops out of Palestinian
population centres in the West Bank, the second major phase of the peace
process, by August to allow Palestinian elections in mid-October.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who will meet Mr Arafat in Paris for the first high-level
negotiations since the signing in May of the Gaza-Jericho accord, vowed to
strengthen the peace process with Palestinians, despite right-wing Israeli
protests against Mr Arafat's return to Gaza and Jericho.
'With all the protests and the shouting, we will continue with the peace
process. We got a mandate from the people and we will go on with it,' Mr
Rabin told trade unionists.
In Jericho, a crowd of 3,000-5,000 joyous Palestinians pushed and shoved to
get their first glimpse of 'Mr Palestine'. PLO officials blamed the poor
turnout on Israeli demonstrations and restrictions which stopped many
Palestinians from the West Bank arriving.
As soon as Mr Arafat stepped off his helicopter in a cloud of dust, one boy
shouted: 'I see him, I see Abu Amar' - referring to the veteran PLO leader
by his nom de guerre. Others shinned up telegraph posts and pushed against
security forces, breaking down a wire-mesh fence in the frenzy to see more
than the tip of Mr Arafat's head surrounded by bodyguards in olive-green
uniforms.
To the applause of the crowd, Mr Arafat embraced orthodox Jews in black hats
and coats from the small Neturei Karta sect, which supports the creation of
a Palestinian state on the grounds that it will hasten the coming of the
Messiah.
Mr Arafat then sped through the town centre in a convoy of jeeps, fire
engines and at least 12 ambulances, their sirens wailing. Two Palestinian
youths rode on horseback with the motorcade.
Later Mr Arafat took the oath of office on a Koran covered with white
shells, then swore in 12 members of the Palestinian national authority, a de
facto cabinet.
Mr Shaath, planning and economic co-operation minister, said the authority
got to work in its first official meeting and took several decisions
including negotiating strategy in Paris and a plan to build 25,000-30,000
new housing units and create 20,000-25,000 jobs in the next 12 months.

FT  06 JUL 94 / French troops will 'retaliate': Pledge on Rwandan refugee
zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, KIGALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French troops will 'retaliate' if the refugee zone they have created in
south-west Rwanda is attacked, Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister,
said yesterday.
But French officials said that, after capturing the capital Kigali, the
rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) forces had by midday yesterday stopped
some 10km short of the line created by French and Senegalese troops around
the rapidly filling refugee zone.
The French Foreign Ministry said the number of refugees had doubled in the
past few days to 400,000, without specifying their ethnic origin, and French
troops had on Monday disarmed militia whose 'behaviour was threatening'.
Mr Juppe said it was nonsense to suggest France was establishing the safe
haven 'as a means of protecting government troops or of blocking the RPF'.
He told a press conference the main part of the government forces lay
outside the refugee zone, while a French envoy had discussed in Kampala,
Uganda, on Monday with General Paul Kagame, the RPF military leader, 'ways
of putting the security zone into effect'.
The French foreign minister said it was absurd to think 'the total victory
of the RPF would settle the problem' and that, after the fall of Kigali to
the RPF, 'the reasons for a ceasefire are all the greater'.
Admiral Jacques Lanxade, French chief of staff, affirmed yesterday French
troops would 'continue to be neutral' so as to help 'all those who felt
themselves threatened'.
Reuter adds from Kigali: The RPF said yesterday it would form a government
within days and declare a ceasefire but hit out at France for what it saw as
threats over the safe zones. Maj Gen Paul Kagame, RPF commander, said at a
seized Kigali barracks: 'The French must recognise our sovereign rights in
our own country. We don't mind having zones where civilians will be
protected but the way the matter is being handled raises questions. It comes
across as a threat.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / Morocco plans to extend scope of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CASABLANCA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morocco is planning to extend its privatisation programme to include sectors
such as power generation which until now have been considered out of bounds
for the private sector.
Mr Abdellatif Filali, prime minister, emphasised the need to reduce the
state's role when meeting business leaders in Casablanca yesterday, in his
first major economic policy statement since he was appointed a month ago.
Earlier, he told foreign journalists that privatisation was 'an absolute
necessity'. Morocco needed to develop foreign and domestic investment to
combat a 15-16 per cent unemployment rate. The government would do 'the
maximum' to help the country's private sector and cut red tape.
It would seek safeguards to prevent a loss of control over 'strategic'
activities such as banking; in certain cases the state might keep majority
shareholdings. But Mr Jettou Driss, commerce and industry minister, said:
'Nothing is excluded. There are no taboos'.
Morocco has so far sold control of 22 companies to foreign and domestic
investors under an initial programme covering 75 companies and 37 hotels to
be privatised by the end of next year. These include Societe Nationale
d'Investissement, a state holding company with interests ranging from
brewing to banking. The programme is expected to bring in some Dirham 17bn
(Pounds 1.2bn).
Sectors excluded so far from the programme, such as public utilities, the
Samir oil refining company, and Office Cherifien des Phosphate, the
phosphate company, will now be considered for privatisation. 'It is possible
to associate the private sector with everything,' Mr Driss added.
Plans include giving private companies responsibility for future electricity
plants and possibly selling off some existing power stations. Distribution
of electricity would remain in state hands although possibly with minority
private-sector shareholdings.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Japanese tax cuts promise confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new government yesterday confirmed it plans to cut income tax, in a
bid to stimulate domestic demand and curb the trade surplus.
'By promising tax cuts for next year, we have made clear our consideration
of the economy,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister.
He was, however, unspecific on how to fund the tax cut beyond indicating
there would be a rise in the 3 per cent sales tax at an undefined later
date. In the meantime, the government would avoid issuing deficit-financing
bonds 'too easily', he said. The tax cut is expected to be of the same order
as this year's one-off Y6,000bn (Pounds 39bn) income tax rebate which was
decided by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and was to last for
one or two years.
This indicates the new government is going for an expansionary economic
policy, to reinforce the signs of a fragile upturn from Japan's longest
recession since the second world war.
The prospect of a resultant fall in the trade surplus helped the yen weaken
slightly yesterday, closing at Y99.5 to the dollar in Tokyo, from Y98.67 the
previous day. However, fears that the government will have to issue more
debt provoked a sharp drop in government bond prices.
An outline tax plan will be presented at the Group of Seven summit of
leading industrial nations in Naples at the end of the week and the
government hopes to draft details of overall tax reform by the end of the
year.
A rise in sales tax would be doubly controversial for the three-party
coalition. The government is already unpopular because of the manner in
which it seized power last week. The Social Democratic party of Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, prime minister, opposed the introduction of sales tax in 1988 and
is loth to increase it.
Uncertainty over future funding is unwelcome to the Finance Ministry, which
has always argued that an income tax cut and sales tax increase must be
decided simultaneously. It fears the budget deficit could rise out of
control at a time when Japan's ageing population is set to make increasing
demands on social security spending.
Tax revenues fell short of spending in 1993 - by Y568bn - for the third year
in a row, the ministry said yesterday. It will make up the shortfall by
borrowing from a state fund set up for this purpose.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Athens hails ruling on Cyprus exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ASSOCIATED PRESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek officials claimed yesterday that a ruling by the European Court of
Justice amounted to a ban on the import into European Union countries of
goods from Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, Associated Press reports.
The court declared that export licences issued by Turkish Cypriot officials
were invalid as the EU recognises only the Greek Cypriot government in
Nicosia. Its ruling was requested by a British court hearing a dispute over
export licences issued by Turkish Cypriot authorities for citrus products
and potatoes, most of which end up in Britain.
Under the association accord between the EU and Nicosia, the 12 EU states
can only accept export documents issued by 'the competent authorities of the
Republic of Cyprus' in Nicosia, the court ruled.
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos said the ruling was of
great political and economic importance. He said 75-80 per cent of the
occupied territory's exports went to Britain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US policy of linking improvements in labour and intellectual property rights
in developing countries with the tariff-free benefits granted under the US
Generalised System of Preferences has yielded 'substantial results',
according to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative.
In the last year the US has monitored worker rights in 10 countries and
intellectual property disputes in eight.
These countries could lose their GSP benefits unless they show improvement
in the two areas.
Mr Kantor said five of 10 countries reviewed for labour violations had made
enough progress to be dropped from the list of scrutinised countries.
They five countries are: Bahrain, El Salvador, Fiji, Oman and Peru.
El Salvador, for example, enacted a reformed labour law in close
consultation with the International Labour Organisation, and violence
against workers was found to have abated.
Oman has joined the ILO and asked for its assistance in drafting a new
labour code.
Five countries which made less progress will remain on the US review list.
These are: Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Maldives, Pakistan and Thailand.
Eight countries reviewed for their intellectual property protection were
found to have made 'important gains'.
Egypt, Guatemala and Cyprus were dropped from the review list, while
Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Poland and Turkey remain on the
list.

<TEXT>
The 13 member countries of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) are to apply to
join the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than risk losing exports
and being put at a trading disadvantage.
Caribbean and Central American states have been seeking 'parity' with Mexico
in exporting to the US and Canada as one way of protecting their markets.
However, Caricom leaders decided at their annual meeting in Barbados this
week that they are being asked to concede too much in exchange for parity,
and stand to gain more through actual membership of Nafta.
This change of policy follows publication of a report by the World Bank
suggesting that Caribbean basin countries will lose millions dollars in
exports because of the Nafta accord. The World Bank report says Nafta 'may
pose large export losses for individual Caribbean countries'.
Caricom leaders described an interim trade agreement being proposed by
President Bill Clinton's administration as inadequate, and said that the
Community had to prepare itself for full accession.
Fearing the loss of markets in the US and Canada to a more competitive
Mexico, Caribbean and Central American countries had asked for parity with
Mexico for a range of products exported to the US. These included clothes
and textiles, leather goods, petroleum products and tuna.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said recently that the administration was
seeking congressional approval for the removal of quotas and duties on
Caribbean Basin clothing exports to the US. 'We asked for the Caribbean
basin countries to be given Nafta parity, and we got a limited offer for
garments and textiles,' said Mr Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime
minister.
Caricom had decided that too much was being asked of the region and too
little was being granted, he said.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Shippers compromise on Atlantic routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shipping lines which have set up a controversial price-fixing agreement on
north Atlantic cargo routes yesterday put forward compromise proposals to
the European Commission, writes Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent.
Plans to revise the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) to meet Commission
objections were unveiled in Brussels by Lord Sterling, president of the
European Community Shipowners' Associations.
The Commission said it could not respond to the new proposals until it had
time to study them, but the British Shippers' Council, representing most
large UK exporters, said the changes did not go far enough and it would
still press for a dismantling of the TAA.
The TAA is an accord between 15 large shipping lines accounting for about 85
per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to regulate rates
and capacity. Members include large container shipping lines such as P&amp;O,
Maersk and Nedlloyd.
Exporters claim that the TAA, which came into effect in 1992, has pushed up
freight rates by as much as 100 per cent. The shipowners say an agreement,
or 'conference,' is necessary to put an end to large losses made on the
north Atlantic routes.
'We believe the revised agreement will provide new and welcome flexibility,'
Lord Sterling said yesterday.
'It is not a climbdown. It is the result of months of discussions to meet
the concerns of the shippers while taking note of where the Commission
stands.'
The new proposals will make it easier for small shippers to negotiate deals
with TAA members. They will also allow shippers to reach agreements with
just five of the shipping companies involved in the TAA.
Shippers will also be able to negotiate different rates for specific
quantities to be moved under general service contracts.
On the question of tariffs, shipping lines will be able to take independent
action to set rates after only five days' notice instead of 10 at present.

week that they are being asked to concede too much in exchange for parity,
and stand to gain more through actual membership of Nafta.
This change of policy follows publication of a report by the World Bank
suggesting that Caribbean basin countries will lose millions dollars in
exports because of the Nafta accord. Caricom leaders described an interim
trade agreement proposed by President Bill Clinton's administration as
inadequate, and said the Community had to prepare itself for full accession.
Fearing the loss of markets in the US and Canada to a more competitive
Mexico, Caribbean and Central American countries had asked for parity with
Mexico for a range of products exported to the US. These included clothes
and textiles, leather goods, petroleum products and tuna.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said recently that the administration was
seeking congressional approval for the removal of quotas and duties on
Caribbean Basin clothing exports to the US. 'We asked for the Caribbean
basin countries to be given Nafta parity, and we got a limited offer for
garments and textiles,' said Mr Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime
minister.
'There has been no response on leather goods, petroleum products and tuna.
In return for the limited offer on garments and textiles, we are being asked
to sign bilateral investment treaties, agreements on intellectual property
rights and to waive deferments to developing countries which are allowed
under sections of the Uruguay Round. All of this we are being asked to do
for limited gains.'
Caricom had decided that too much was being asked of the region and too
little was being granted, he said.
The World Bank report says Nafta 'may pose large export losses for
individual Caribbean countries'.
The report estimates the displacement of Caribbean exports by Nafta at
between Dollars 35m and Dollars 53m annually, and says that this is only
slightly less than the combined total exports to the US of Barbados and St
Lucia.
The Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica and Haiti 'with 45 per cent to
60 per cent of their exports subject to displacement, are likely to be the
most affected countries, followed by Dominica, St Lucia and St Vincent'.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: ABB in China power deal

The German subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering
group, yesterday signed letters of intent to start up six joint ventures to
build power plants and electric locomotives in China. The signing was one of
several at which Chinese officials put their names to a variety of deals
with 17 German companies worth Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.28bn) during a week
long visit by Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier.
Germany has become China's most important trading partner in the European
Union with trade in 1993 totalling DM23.4bn (Pounds 9.53bn), according to
the Asia committee of federation of German industry. German exports stood at
DM9.6bn, up 67 per cent on the year before, while imports rose 18 per cent
to DM13.7bn.
ABB said it would take several months to work out further aspects of the
joint ventures and it could not give any financial details.
Five joint ventures will build and refurbish powers stations with a
generating capacity 4,000MW, the biggest of which will be a 1,000MW combined
gas turbine power plant near Hong Kong. A sixth joint venture will
manufacture electric locomotives with the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotives Works
in Hunan province.
The company said it expected Chinese orders worth over DM1bn from China this
year.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, said much could be done through
closer economic contacts to improve the human rights situation in China. 'We
achieved the same thing with the Soviet Union and other countries in the
former eastern bloc,' he said.
About two dozen parliamentary delegates from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union wrote protesting about the Chinese human rights
record and questions about what the Chinese will do about their political
prisoners have featured in many conversations between Mr Li and his German
hosts.
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, one of the world's leading makers of diesel
engines, signed a letter of intent to set up a joint venture with the China
First Automobile Group which plans to make around 100,000 engines by the
year 2002.
Klockner signed another two contracts worth DM40m to build two cement-making
plants.
BASF, the chemicals group, said it had signed a contract to build a plant
near Shanghai which will produce auxiliary products for textiles, part of
DM220m which is being invested by a Sino-German joint venture in which BASF
holds a 60 per cent stake.
KSB, the pump maker, said it closed a contract for a Dollars 22m joint
venture with the Shanghai Pump Works which will start work in April.

FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Beijing to put restrictions onfilm imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday said it would impose new censorship rules on imported films,
signalling a chill in official attitudes through media reports that imports
would be limited to 30 per cent of the total film market and co-production
deals would be curtailed.
The official China Daily quoted Mr Li Wenbin, an official of the Ministry of
Radio, Film and Television, as saying that foreign films would be subjected
to 'more careful screening.'
Mr Li insisted the restrictions were not aimed at excluding 'foreign
culture.' Rather the intention was to 'protect and develop the national
movie industry.'
Mr Li added that the restrictions were not aimed at shutting out foreigners.
'Co-production of films with foreigners can survive (the new rules) if the
principle of mutual benefits is observed,' he was reported as saying.
But over the past year, the Chinese authorities have exhibited increasing
sensitivity to films that have reflected negatively on the role of the
Communist Party. The acclaimed 'Farewell My Concubine' was heavily censored
because it cast the party in a poor light.
A co-production deal involving the filming of the Cultural Revolution epic
'Life and Death in Shanghai' has also been put on hold, apparently because
of worries about negative official reaction.
The proposed new censorship rules coincide with general tightening up by
China's leaders, including campaigns against official corruption and
dissident publications. The China Daily report did not reveal when the new
regulations would come into effect.
China has also this year sought to curb reception of satellite-broadcast
films by banning satellite dishes without a permit.
However, attempts to curtail the spread of dishes appears to have been only
partially successful.
China's film industry which, for many years, was heavily protected from
foreign competition, has recently been obliged to compete with imports,
particularly those from Hong Kong, which are popular in southern regions.
According to the new rules, co-production deals - the main avenue for
foreign film makers operating in China - will be limited to 30 annually and
'at least three of them must be based on real life.'
'Film co-production will be well received so long as they are of fine
artistic taste and sell well,' said Mr Li.
The Chinese official said the draft rules also repudiated the practice of
labelling films 'unsuitable for children.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / Corporate France gets shivers: Probe of Alcatel chief adds
to climate of anxiety in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Suard, the taciturn chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, was in unusually
strident voice. The latest and most senior target in a series of corruption
probes which have shaken French industry, he yesterday condemned the
investigations he faces as banal and said there was a campaign of defamation
against his company, one of the world's largest engineering and
telecommunications groups.
Mr Suard's tone reflects the events of the last two days. On Monday morning,
the Alcatel chief was summoned to the magistrates' office in Versailles, to
the west of Paris. Early yesterday, after more than 12 hours of questioning
and a search of his home in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly, Mr Suard was
formally placed under investigation for misuse of funds for work carried out
at his private residences and released on bail of FFr1m (Pounds 110,000).
Alcatel has strongly denied any wrongdoing, describing Mr Suard's detention
on Monday as 'scandalous'. The company demanded a stock exchange
investigation into the way information concerning the investigation was
released and the movements in the company's share price, which lost more
than 8 per cent on Monday, before bouncing back yesterday.
The turbulence surrounding Mr Suard's ordeal, however, stretches far beyond
the share price of his telecommunications and engineering company. The
investigation into one of France's most respected industrialists and the
head of an empire of almost 200,000 employees, has fuelled concerns among
France's business establishment, already worried about the expansion of
judicial investigations into French companies.
The protracted legal tangles of Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing
entrepreneur, the incarceration for 12 days in a Brussels prison of Mr
Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, who is accused of
fraud concerning two Belgian subsidiaries, and allegations of systematic
corruption by French utilities companies by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a
prosecutor turned politician, have contributed over the past few months to a
climate of anxiety surrounding corporate France.
'There is a feeling of nervousness, in which allegations can be magnified
out of proportion,' says one French merchant banker.
'It can be very harmful for the groups involved.' This view was echoed by Mr
Gerard Longuet, the industry minister. 'I consider it distressing that one
can damage the reputation of a group of tens of thousands,' he told French
radio, adding that the affair could damage the image of French industry.
For some observers, there is more to come. Mr Elie Cohen, a director of
CNRS, the state research institute, believes that the flurry of
investigations reflects a greater freedom on the part of law officials. 'The
judges now feel free to investigate big companies,' he says. 'They feel a
greater independence from political authority.'
Mr Guy Danet, Mr Suard's lawyer, rejects the idea of a systematic campaign
against business leaders. 'There are certain judges who don't hesitate to
pursue business leaders, which doesn't bother me. But we reject
categorically the investigation into Mr Suard, and the spectacular methods
which have been used.'
According to Mr Cohen, however, business will come increasingly under
examination and the political right will be just as vulnerable as the left.
Such a view is supported by the background and political connections of the
Alcatel head. Unlike Mr Bernard Tapie, Mr Suard is a pillar of the
industrial establishment with leanings to the political right. Despite his
differences with the government over Framatome, the state-controlled nuclear
power group which Mr Suard is pursuing, he is close to many senior members
of the Gaullist RPR party, including Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister.
In 1986, Mr Balladur, then finance minster, backed Mr Suard for the
chairmanship of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, a diversified group which
became Alcatel in 1987 after the merger of its telecoms activities with ITT
of the US.
The case of Mr Suard is more worrying than that of Mr Pineau-Valencienne,
who has been released on bail from a Brussels prison but still faces an
investigation into fraud and acting against the interests of minority
shareholders at two Belgian subsidiaries.
'For many in France the problems of Mr Pineau-Valencienne are blamed on the
Belgians and their legal system,' says one industry observer. 'This is not
the case with Mr Suard. It is a purely French affair.'
That affair dates back to an investigation into two former employees of
Alcatel CIT, a subsidiary of the group involved in the manufacture of
telecommunications equipment. The two employees, accused of manipulating
prices for France Telecom, were fired by Alcatel last year. But during their
investigation, they accused senior Alcatel executives, including Mr Suard,
of having work done at their homes which was paid for by the company.
In the case of Mr Suard, attention has focused on security systems installed
at his Paris homes at a cost to the group of more than FFr3m. Alcatel denies
any wrong-doing and says that the security devices were fitted on the advice
of the government after the assassination in 1986 of Mr Georges Besse, the
head of Renault, the state-owned vehicle group.
This claim is supported by Mr Alain Madelin, minister for small business,
who was then the minister for industry. Mr Madelin said he was 'very
surprised' by the decision to take Mr Suard into custody and said that the
expenses in question were not for luxury items but reflected the dangers of
Mr Suard's job.
Despite the specific nature of the case, however, there are common elements
with Mr Pineau-Valencienne's ordeals at Groupe Schneider. In both cases, the
chairmen have been dragged into a legal tangle by subsidiaries. In both
cases the companies have offered this as a defence.
'Mr Suard does not exercise any functions at Alcatel CIT,' Alcatel Alsthom
said, echoing the claims made at its electrical engineering rival.
The tenacity of the investigating magistrates is also a common thread. At
Alcatel, as with Mr Tapie, the French investigating magistrates have
demonstrated an unexpected degree of doggedness in pursuit of their
inquiries. That is why the business community is feeling rattled, and why Mr
Suard's counterparts will be watching the headlines with interest.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Crisis in French press may see more casualties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is one conspicuous absentee from the French newsstands this morning -
Le Quotidien, the Paris-based daily that yesterday suspended publication
after months of struggling to solve its mounting financial problems.
Mr Philippe Tesson, founder and director of Le Quotidien, explained to his
readers in a mournful editorial splashed across yesterday's front page that
the paper was to cease publication until an emergency meeting on July 18 at
which its shareholders would decide if it had a future.
Le Quotidien is the latest casualty of the crisis in the French press, which
has come under intense financial pressure during the economic recession. It
has disappeared from the newsstands at a critical time. The future of many
of France's most famous newspapers is clouded by uncertainty.
Liberation, the liberal-left daily, is searching for an additional FFr80m
(Pounds 9.5m) to conclude a FFr260m recapitalisation package to finance a
relaunch this autumn. Le Monde, the venerable political paper, is trying to
adjust to life under a new senior management team appointed several months
ago.
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Hersant, the enigmatic industrialist who is the most
powerful figure in the French press, is under pressure from Credit Lyonnais,
his bank, to repay his debts by selling France-Soir, his loss-making evening
title, and even Le Figaro, the conservative daily which is France's
biggest-selling national newspaper. The Havas media group and Mr Claud
Bebear, chairman of the Axa insurance empire, are mooted as possible
purchasers.
The immediate cause of the industry's problems is the recession, which has
taken a toll on advertising revenue (particularly on recruitment and
property advertising) and on circulation. These difficulties have affected
the entire French press, but national newspapers have suffered most of all
due to competition from the historically strong regional press and
television, which has expanded significantly since deregulation in the
1980s.
The nationals saw their advertising revenue decline by 27 per cent last
year, according to industry estimates, and are braced for a further 10 per
cent fall this year against respective reductions of 14 per cent and 6 per
cent for the regionals. They have also borne the brunt of the decline in
circulation. Le Figaro is still the largest national, but its circulation
has slipped from 432,000 to 380,000 over the past five years and is well
below those of three regional dailies: Ouest France, Le Progres in Lyon and
Le Parisien.
These problems have been aggravated by a stream of new launches - including
Aujourd'hui, the national version of Le Parisien, and InfoMatin, backed by
Le Monde.
The new launches have also adopted tactically low cover prices of FFr3.00 or
FFr3.50, against FFr6.00 for Liberation and FFr7.00 for Le Monde. Some
established titles have retaliated by slashing their prices in a desperate
attempt to boost sales. Yet price cutting has proved to be a dangerous
tactic as Le Quotidien discovered. It dropped its price from FFr6.00 to
FFr4.00 but only increased circulation from 30,000 to 40,000.
Le Quotidien's gamble has failed. It is hoping shareholders will rally round
at the July 18 meeting - or that a white knight rides to its rescue.

FT  06 JUL 94 / US-Russian push for Bosnia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Russia both said yesterday that the arms embargo against Bosnia's
Moslem-led government could be lifted if it accepts a new partition plan for
the republic while the Serbs reject the proposal.
'I think there is a recognition that the pressure to lift the arms embargo
may become irresistible, unavoidable,' said Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state. He was speaking at a meeting in Geneva, where he and his
counterparts from Russia, Britain, France and Germany endorsed the peace
plan.
Ministers from all five countries stressed that they were committed to the
idea of using threats and inducements to encourage the warring parties to
accept the partition plan.
However, there have been ominous signs of disagreement between the five over
how far the 'carrot and stick' approach should go.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said the warring parties
had been given two weeks to respond to the proposal, which awards 51 per
cent of Bosnia to a new Croat-Moslem federation and the remainder to the
Serbs.
The Serbs currently control about 70 per cent of the republic and there was
continued fighting yesterday over strategic ground in northern and central
Bosnia. Mr Kozyrev described the proposal as the only possible alternative
to continuation of the war and stressed that both sides could expect
generous treatment if they gave a positive response.
The Russian minister said that if the parties did not agree to the proposal,
enforcement of existing UN sanctions would be tightened. He added: 'As an
extreme measure, a Security Council decision on lifting the arms embargo may
be unavoidable.' The joint warning from the US and Russia amounted to a
determined effort to keep up a common front, although the domestic pressures
in the two countries run in diametrically opposing directions.
A formal resumption of arms supplies to Bosnia, while very popular in the US
Congress, would be anathema to Russia. Mr Kozyrev warned earlier this week
that western moves to penalise the Bosnian Serbs for their alleged
intransigence could lead to a world war.
Senior figures on both sides have said they would rather fight on than
accept the peace plan, but neither party wants to accept the international
opprobrium of being the first to reject it.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, told Moslem ambassadors in Geneva
that he would not reject the peace proposal out of hand and would try to
keep the peace process going.
At a meeting with ambassadors from the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference, Mr Izetbegovic also said his army had managed to acquire large
amounts of weapons despite the UN arms embargo on former Yugoslavia.
He did not hide his dissatisfaction with the peace plan, but one diplomat
quoted him as saying: 'Our answer will not be some radical No . . . We
believe it wouldn't be wise to reject the plan fully. In other words, we
believe that peace negotiations should continue.'
Reviewing the military situation, Mr Izetbegovic said the Bosnian army was
better off than a year ago. 'We have managed, despite the blockade, to bring
in some quantities of weapons and we consider it our right,' he said.

A total of 5,000 coalworkers and 13,000 steelworkers in Belgium, Germany and
Britain will benefit from a European Commission aid package, announced
yesterday by Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner. The aid -
available for such areas as retirement, unemployment, vocational training
and redeployment - amounts to Ecu38m (Pounds 29.7m). It will benefit workers
who lost their jobs in the past two years. The commission also said it would
add Ecu21m to a Ecu60m grant given last year for steelworkers made redundant
as a result of the EU steel restructuring plan. Last year some 23,000
steelworkers in Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal
and Britain benefited from this programme. Mr Flynn said the aid would
ensure that ex-miners and steelworkers received a high level of social
protection and would also be given a helping hand into new jobs.

Germany was warned yesterday by the European Commission that it would be

bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The agriculture
commissioner wrote to Bonn warning against unilateral action on Friday when
the German parliament is due to vote on the subject. The EU is considering
scientific evidence and may draw up new rules on the import of British beef.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture secretary, welcomed the move. 'It
certainly vindicates our stance and it vindicates my view that the Germans
would end up in court  - and now they know it officially,' she said in a
television interview. EU scientists yesterday resumed talks on the best way
of countering the threat of mad cow disease.

A former director of the Bank of Spain faces a Pta15m (Pounds 74,000) fine
following allegations of insider trading in connection with the removal late
last year by the Bank of Spain of the board of Banesto, the private banking
group. Mr Tomas Ramon Fernandez is alleged to have learned of the impending
move on Banesto in discussions at the Bank of Spain on December 23 and sold
Pta5m worth of personally held shares in Banesto the day before a central
bank board meeting on December 28 which he attended. That meeting decided to
intervene in the banking group. Mr Fernandez claims he sold his equity in
Banesto to avoid a conflict of interest at the subsequent board meeting to
decide on the intervention. He was sacked from the central bank's board in
February after the stock market regulators began inquiries into possible
insider trading.

European Union member states would get common air quality monitoring
standards and pollution limits under a draft directive approved yesterday by
the the European Commission. The draft regulation, which requires approval
by ministers, is part of a review and simplification of EU environmental
legislation for air and water standards. It has been drawn up as a result of
growing concern about air pollution in several countries, including Britain,
Belgium and Greece.
Up to 14 air pollutants would be covered by the directive, ranging from
sulphur and nitrogen dioxide to ground-level ozone and carbon monoxide. The
first three pollutants, along with lead and hydrocarbon particles, are
already covered by five EU directives, but Brussels now wants a more common
and broader approach. This would consist of: common reporting standards;
setting pollution limits to be attained within 10-15 years; and setting
provisional ceilings. When the latter are exceeded, the public should be
informed and emergency measures taken. The Commission itself would
eventually publish regular reports on Union-wide air quality. It envisages
that pollution limits for substances already covered by EU law should be set
by the end of 1996, with a deadline of the end of 1999 for the other nine
chemicals being targeted. See Editorial Comment

<TEXT>
Workers at Fiat Auto in Tychy, southern Poland, have voted to strike in
support of a wage claim if talks with management fail. The plant's 6,000
workers, who produce Fiat's Cinquecento model, voted 84 per cent in favour
of strike action. The unions are demanding a 40 per cent pay increase. At
the same time, the Solidarity union in Warsaw has threatened a boycott of
Italian goods as a result of a four-week strike at the Warsaw steelworks
owned by Lucchini, an Italian private steelmaker. Solidarity says the
'strike will determine if Italian capital and other foreign investors are to
treat our country as terrain for ruthless exploitation or will respect our
workers and consumers'. The factory, taken over by the Italian company two
years ago, has been occupied by its 2,000 employees and 10 of them have
begun a hunger strike in an attempt to force a 30 per cent wage rise and to
speed the modernisation of the plant. Lucchini says that delays over
establishing title to the land have held up financing for new equipment in
the Dollars 300m project.

<TEXT>
The biggest trial in Italy's long-running corruption scandal opened
yesterday in Milan, in the absence of all the best known defendants,
including Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist prime minister, and Mr Umberto
Bossi, leader of the federalist Northern League. The two men, along with 30
other political and business personalities from Italy's old regime, are
charged with breaking the law on the financing of political parties. Most of
the defendants were witnesses in the six-month trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a
financial consultant to Ferruzzi-Montedison, the industrial group, which was
alleged to have paid a L150bn (Pounds 62m) bribe to political parties to
ease its withdrawal from Enimont, an ill-fated chemicals joint venture with
Eni, the state holding company. This second trial could last even longer and
began slowly yesterday with procedural points. Much of the media interest is
concentrated on Mr Craxi, who refuses to return from his villa in Tunisia,
on the grounds that he is too ill.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Walesa in threat to resign over abortion reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Lech Walesa has threatened to resign if he is forced to accept an
easing of the country's strict anti-abortion laws voted through recently by
parliament. The governing centre-left coalition has also come under fire
from the Catholic church for postponing the ratification of the concordat, a
treaty with the Vatican, which defines the church's status in Poland.
President Walesa, the father of eight, earlier this week refused to accept
an easing of Poland's tight abortion laws voted in by parliament and said
that he would resign rather than sign the new laws.
Under the constitution parliament now has to muster a two-thirds majority to
overrule a presidential veto and should it be successful the president would
have no choice other than to sign the new law or resign and call an
election.
Earlier this month 241 deputies in the lower chamber voted in favour of
liberalisation allowing women to ask for abortions in 'difficult personal
and economic circumstances'. With 107 against and 32 abstentions this was
only around 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overrule the
veto.
The ban on abortion, except in cases where the mother's life is endangered,
came into force in March 1993 and saw the number of legal abortions cut from
11,640 in 1992 to 777. Last year the number of births fell, due to
demographic and social factors, to 493,000 from 519,000 the previous year.
Should President Walesa, who is riding low in the popularity ratings, decide
to call an election on the issue he would be pushed to win a majority.
According to recent polls around 30 per cent of voters want to keep
restrictions in place while 56 per cent were in favour of liberalisation.
Meanwhile, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Polish Primate, has said he is not
'afraid of war' over the delay in the ratification of the concordat,
Poland's treaty with the Vatican.
Last week, parliament voted to postpone the ratification until a new
constitution was in place next year. The concordat, which includes the
church's right to teach religion in state schools and opens tax loopholes
for the clergy, is deeply unpopular with the former communist Left
Democratic Alliance coalition partner, which believes it gives the church
too many rights. The co-governing Polish Peasants' party is more inclined to
accept the treaty.
Both agreed to postpone ratification in order to avoid increasing tension
within the coalition.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Sweden counts cost of financial uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in interest rates, driven partly by concern over the rapid
growth in state debt, will cut Sweden's projected GNP growth by up to a
third next year and add SKr10bn (Pounds 847m) to the budget deficit, Mrs
Anne Wibble, the finance minister, admitted yesterday.
At a special meeting on the dramatic developments in the Swedish financial
markets over the past few days, Mrs Wibble told Mr Goran Persson, economy
spokesman for the opposition Social Democratic party, that GNP growth this
year would only be marginally reduced by the interest rate rises. The
economy is set to grow by 2.7 per cent after three years of contraction. But
Mrs Wibble said the knock-on effects of higher interest levels could cut
growth in 1995 - previously forecast to reach 3 per cent - by up to 1 per
cent of GNP.
She added that the extra interest costs to the government would swell the
budget deficit to SKr160bn in the current 1994-95 budget year from SKr150bn
previously forecast. This will still be well below the deficit of SKr193bn,
or almost 13 per cent of GNP, reached in the just-completed budget year.
However, it is likely also to increase the borrowing requirement, previously
set at SKr195bn. The news helped induce another bout of nervousness in local
markets. Heavy over-subscription to a SKr6.5bn issue of government bonds,
despite the announcement of a bond boycott by the insurance company Skandia,
had steadied the stock market and the Swedish krona and eased interest rates
on Monday.
But yields on five-year bonds rose above 10 per cent again yesterday, the
stock market fell by more than 1 per cent and the krona slipped against the
main world currencies.
Mr Persson described the picture given him by Mrs Wibble as serious and said
it contrasted sharply with the optimistic prognosis for the economy
routinely given by Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative prime minister.
He said the Social Democrats would give more details on their plans to
tackle the budget deficit before the general election on September 18.
Underlining the continued weakness of the Swedish economy were figures
showing unemployment had risen sharply in June.
Although the rise was expected because of the influx of school-leavers and
students on to the market, the total of 14.8 per cent of the workforce
unemployed or in government training schemes is some three times the level
before the recession.
Graham Bowley adds from London: The Swedish government bond market fell back
from its highs yesterday after a short-lived rally caused by follow-through
buying after the success of Monday's auction.
'Underlying sentiment (in the bond market) remains very fragile,' said Mr
Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg.
'It is clear that Monday's auction went well only because the currency was
extremely low and yields were so high, which attracted opportunistic money
looking to take profits,' he said.
Analysts said the comments by Mrs Wibble that the 1994-95 budget deficit had
been revised upwards and that the forecast for economic growth had been
revised downwards had unnerved the market.
'It was read as a negative factor,' said Mr Kokko.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French industrial production rose by 2.1 per cent in April, giving a
year-on-year rise of 3.3 per cent. Output rose a revised 0.5 per cent in
March from February. The April rise was mainly because of a 9.4 per cent
increase in energy production. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent, after
a 5.8 per cent rise in output in the car and land transport sector. Output
of semi-finished goods rose 0.5 per cent, while consumer goods fell by 0.3
per cent in the month.
Swiss construction sector activity is likely to remain depressed throughout
1994 after a sharp drop in production in 1993, the Swiss Building Industry
Group said. Combined turnover for its 18 members declined to SFr3.42bn
(Pounds 1.64bn) in 1993 from SFr3.62bn in 1992.
Spain's official currency reserves declined Dollars 61m (Pounds 40m) in June
from May. The reserves stood at Dollars 44.28bn as of June 30, the central
bank said.
Hungary's current account deficit stood at Dollars 1.18bn (Pounds 760m) in
the year to April, from Dollars 809m to March.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Midland offers 'Pounds 10 an error' to win rival accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank, one of the UK's four largest clearing banks, launched an
aggressive campaign yesterday to win personal customers from its
competitors.
It promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each failure to meet four
standards of service in transferring an account from another bank.
The specific encouragement to customers to switch accounts is a new feature
in UK personal banking, where banks have previously been able to rely on
some reluctance among customers to move their accounts even if they are
dissatisfied with the service provided.
It comes less than a week after the prospect of a price war to attract
personal customers was raised by the decision by Abbey National bank to
halve the interest rate it charges on authorised overdrafts.
Mr Keith Whitson, Midland chief executive, said the aim of the scheme was to
persuade people that transferring a bank account could be fairly painless.
He said research by NOP, the polling organisation, showed that while an
estimated 8.4m people in the UK would like to transfer their accounts to a
different bank, only around 500,000 actually did so in any one year.
Midland promises to get the first cheque book and the first cash card to a
customer within five working days; the personal number to use with the card
within seven working days; and to pay correctly all standing orders and
direct debits.
The Pounds 10 payment will apply for each promise that is not kept, and will
be in addition to any other refund to a customer as a result, for example,
of a failure to follow a payment instruction.
Mr Whitson said running current accounts was not especially profitable. But
he highlighted the value to a bank of cross-selling financial services, such
as insurance or mortgages, to customers with whom it already had a
relationship.
'We want to be a high street supermarket for financial products,' he said.
'It is much easier to effect a sale to an existing customer than to make a
cold sale.'
With around 5m personal customers, Midland's retail base is about the same
size as that of Lloyds Bank. Barclays has around 7m personal customers,
while National Westminster Bank has 6.5m.
Mr Whitson said Midland would review the scheme at the end of the year, but
expected to have won 'tens of thousands' of customers by then.

FT  06 JUL 94 / S African markets hit as finance minister quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Keys resigned suddenly yesterday as South Africa's finance minister
in a move which threw markets into turmoil and raised concern about the
country's future economic policies.
Mr Keys denied that any policy clash lay behind his announcement, and cited
unspecified 'personal reasons' for his decision.
President Nelson Mandela, who told a hastily summoned press conference last
night that Mr Keys had informed him of his request last Thursday, moved
quickly to allay market concern by naming Mr Christo Liebenberg, a prominent
banker, to replace Mr Keys. Mr Liebenberg, 60, retired in February as chief
executive of the Nedcor banking group.
Mr Keys' efforts to reassure markets were undermined only hours later by a
sharply critical statement from the powerful Congress of South African Trade
Unions, which charged that by his actions yesterday the minister had put at
risk the government's reconstruction and development programme, and had
betrayed Mr Mandela's trust.
In his official announcement released yesterday, Mr Keys praised Mr Mandela
and Mr FW de Klerk, the deputy president, as 'remarkable leaders' and said
that his aim as finance minister had been to contribute to an orderly
transfer of power and 'protect the country's economic base'.
His resignation created South Africa's first crisis since the inauguration
of Mr Mandela in May. It was greeted by widespread shock and dismay in the
local business community.
Mr Keys was respected both domestically and abroad for his prudent
stewardship of the South African economy and had become a symbol of
integrity and competence in the administration during a two-year term of
office which began under the white-led government of Mr de Klerk.
Adding to the distress was the inept way in which the news yesterday was
handled.
If Mr Keys' statement can be taken at face value, news of the move was
inadvertently leaked earlier in the day and the result was that for several
hours confusion reigned.
Rumours about Mr Keys' decision began to reach the Johannesburg stock market
by mid-afternoon, and bond yields climbed sharply while the financial rand,
the main barometer of foreign sentiment, weakened by 2.6 per cent against
the dollar.
However the appointment of Mr Liebenberg, who has no formal political
affiliations, will partially help to stabilise the situation. By again going
outside the political arena to appoint a minister with credibility in the
private sector, Mr Mandela will hope to allay fears that Mr Keys' departure
will also mean a shift from the government's commitment to fiscal restraint.
The appointment also means that the National party, which in terms of the
constitution is entitled to six cabinet posts, will be given another cabinet
appointment.
'In the short term at least it's very bad news for the markets,' said Mr
Michiel Bester, economist at the consulting firm Econometrix. 'It creates a
lot of unwelcome uncertainties.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / NEC looks to US or Britain for Dollars 1bn computer chip
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, is considering a Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) investment in a new semiconductor plant in either the UK or the US.
The company believes its latest semiconductor plant, to be opened soon in
Kyushu, southern Japan, will be unlikely to meet rising global demand. A new
plant would substantially boost NEC's capacity outside Japan and could
create up to 1,000 jobs.
Recent projections from company annual reports estimate that Japan's six
leading electronics companies plan to increase investment in semiconductor
capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined Y461bn over the next nine months, in
response to a surge in demand for personal computers in the US and Japan.
NEC, the second-largest semiconductor manufacturer after Intel of the US,
said it was likely to decide on the investment before the end of the year.
Production would be likely to start in 1996.
The company has substantial facilities in both the US and UK. It employs
1,800 people in the UK, including 900 in a semiconductor plant in
Livingston, Scotland, and 600 in a mobile phone facility in Telford,
Shropshire. In the US, it has a large semiconductor plant in Roseville,
California, employing 1,900. NEC said neither country had been chosen as
favourite and no specific sites had been considered.
The Kyushu plant will manufacture 16-megabit dynamic random access memories
(drams). The new plant would manufacture 16-megabit chips, and a new range
of 60 and 64-megabit chips. Demand for chips is already beyond projected
capacity, and the soaring yen is making an overseas investment particularly
attractive. 'Building another plant in Japan is not considered an option,'
the company said.
Earlier this year NEC announced plans to boost drams production at Roseville
from tens of thousands a month to 1.5 million. It also pledged a Pounds 28m
investment to increase output at Livingston, and an expansion of
semiconductor production in Ireland and Singapore.
NEC's semiconductor sales rose 8 per cent last year. It is projecting an
increase of at least 10 per cent this year.
The UK and the US governments will lobby hard for new facilities. NEC was
one of several Japanese groups attracted to the UK in the 1980s by
development incentives and Britain's position as a point of entry into the
EU market.
The electronics industry now accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports,
but has not expanded markedly since 1989. NEC's choice of Telford in 1987
followed intensive government efforts to persuade the company not to go to
Hanover in Germany.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Fresh hope in search for EU chief: Britain lists names of
'broadly acceptable' candidates for Commission presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of seven possible candidates for the presidency of the
European Commission has reinforced optimism in Mr John Major's government
that there will be an early end to the dispute over the successor to Mr
Jacques Delors.
British ministers indicated that the names on a draft list of contenders -
drawn up in Whitehall but representing the government's understanding of the
position of other European Union member states - are all broadly acceptable
to London. The names have been canvassed during intense consultations among
EU governments after the deadlock at the EU summit in Corfu last month.
It also became clear yesterday that Mr Major now appears willing to risk the
anger of Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches by nominating Mr Neil
Kinnock, the former Labour leader, as Britain's second commissioner in
Brussels from January.
Among the fresh contenders for the Commission presidency are Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the former Danish foreign minister, and Mr Pedro Solbes,
the Spanish finance minister. But Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian
prime minister, apparently remains the choice in London.
British ministers acknowledged that the list, which also includes candidates
from the Netherlands, is by no means final. A strong contender from Belgium
might yet emerge within the next few days. Mr Peter Sutherland, Irish
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, could also
re-enter the race.
But comments by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday that Spanish
prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez has ruled himself out of the race
strengthened the view in London that the successful candidate most probably
will be drawn from the names now circulating.
Mr Kohl, who as president of the EU council is preparing the ground for a
decision at or before the Brussels summit on July 15, signalled also that Mr
Delors is unlikely to extend his presidency.
Apart from Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Solbes and Mr Amato, the other four being
mentioned in London are Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister
who failed to muster enough votes at the Corfu summit; Mr Hans Van den
Broek, the Dutch commissioner in Brussels for external political affairs; Mr
Renato Ruggiero, at present Italy's candidate to head the World Trade
Organisation; and Mr Poul Schluter, the former Danish prime minister.
Britain is unwilling to give public support to any individual candidate for
fear of a backlash from other EU governments in the wake of Mr Major's
decision in Corfu to veto the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene.
But it is clear that Britain's first preference is Mr Amato and it would
also be happy with Mr Ellemann-Jensen or Mr Solbes. Mr Major is said to have
no 'overwhelming objection' to the other candidates.
It is understood that Mr Major will delay a final decision on whether to
propose that Mr Kinnock join Sir Leon Brittan at the Commission until after
the new president has been chosen.
But colleagues say the prime minister is ready to remove the bar he placed
on the former leader when Mr Kinnock was first suggested two years ago. If
that position is confirmed, the government is likely to press for Mr Kinnock
to be given the overseas development portfolio.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Hunt urges unions to end Labour link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions should come out of opposition by seeking partnerships in the
workplace and by cutting their 'discredited' link with the Labour party,
employment secretary David Hunt told a Trades Union Congress conference on
jobs yesterday.
Mr Hunt (pictured giving his speech) is the first Tory cabinet min-ister to
attend a TUC conference for more than a decade. He had been heckled outside
Congress House in London but received polite applause at the end of his
speech.
Mr Hunt also said that some unemployed people needed to change their
attitude to the new service-sector jobs.
Speakers at the conference, who included Mr John Prescott, shadow employment
secretary, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, and Mr John Monks, TUC
general secretary, backed the goal of full employment but differed over the
means of achieving it.

FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Hubbard leaves Murray in charge of Andrews Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Murray has completed his boardroom takeover at Andrews Sykes by
succeeding David Hubbard as chairman of the specialist industrial services
group.
Murray, who is also chairman of Nu-Swift, and four of his supporters won
control of the Sykes board at an extraordinary general meeting in May. He
holds a 29.67 per cent stake in the group and had waged an 18-month battle
for control of the board.
Although Hubbard originally opposed Murray's attempts to win control of the
Sykes board, the changeover was completed amicably.
Commenting on his decision to resign, Hubbard said: 'With the change in
control of the board and the appointment of a new chief executive voted by
the shareholders in May, transition to the new management is now complete.'

FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Frances Heaton joins Harrisons &amp; Crosfield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the industrial conglomerate which is recovering
from several difficult years, was ever to face an unwelcome takeover bid it
would not be short of merchant banking advice.
Frances Heaton, 49, the former director general of The Takeover Panel, has
just been appointed a non-executive director. She joins a board which
already includes Sir Richard Lloyd, deputy chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, and
Martin Anderson, the new finance director who joined from Hill Samuel a
couple of months ago.
Heaton, an executive director of Lazard Brothers, trained as a barrister,
and joined Lazards in 1980 after a stint at the Treasury. She is also a
non-executive director of The Bank of England, Commercial Union and WS
Atkins.
She is the first non-executive director to be appointed to the board since
George Paul, the former chief executive, took over as chairman at the end of
May. Paul has been making a number of changes to his board and several
directors are departing over the next year as part of a move to do away with
the group's old divisional management structure.
Tom Preston, 61, who has worked for the group for over 30 years, retires
from the board shortly following his appointment as chairman of the recently
floated Australian companies. Peter Savage, 50, head of the chemical and
industrial division, is leaving at the end of the month having completed the
rationalisation of the chemical businesses. Peter Simmonds, 54, head of the
food and agricultural division, is taking early retirement next May and Jim
Miller, 57, also retires next year after a new managing director of Harcros
Timber &amp; Building Supplies has been appointed.
Under the reorganisation, the managing directors of the operating companies
will report directly to Bill Turcan, 51, who replaced Paul as chief
executive.

FT  06 JUL 94 / Brazil's inflation over 50% a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian inflation accelerated sharply in June before the launch of the
country's new currency, with the monthly rate of more than 50 per cent,
technically placing Brazil in hyperinflation.
Prices increased by 50.75 per cent in June, up from a monthly 45.1 per cent
in May, according to the FIPE institute. However, many prices were raised
ahead of the introduction of the new currency, the Real, last Friday.
Inflation in the Real is expected to fall sharply this month, helped by
parity to the US dollar. But the June increase will add to pressure on the
government to force suppliers to reduce prices in the Real.
The acceleration in inflation in the last few weeks has also fuelled claims
by workers that their purchasing power was undermined before the new
currency was introduced.
Yesterday, petroleum workers' unions at the state-owned oil and gas company
Petrobras claimed six of its refineries had been affected by strike action.
The unions are demanding compensation for what they claim is a 50 per cent
loss in buying power because of inflation and the new currency. Petrobras
claimed that production was not affected at any of the six refineries.
Uncertainty over the new currency also led to a near 2.5 per cent fall in
early trading on the Sao Paulo stock market. Investors are concerned the
government may move to block foreign investors tempted by Brazil's high
interest rates.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Canada seeks to widen business ties with
Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's business presence in Cuba has been given a boost by a flurry of
commercial and political initiatives in recent weeks.
The announcement late last month that Canada was easing a 16-year aid
embargo, imposed in protest at Cuba's involvement in the Angolan civil war,
is expected to speed the growing involvement of Canadian non-governmental
organisations and universities in Cuba. Two Canadian universities for
instance, have set up English-language training courses for Cubans.
Ottawa has never joined Washington in imposing trade sanctions against Cuba.
Air Canada, for example, has maintained a regular service to Havana, and
Canadians have been among the largest groups of foreign tourists visiting
Cuba. Two-way trade totalled CDollars 311m (Dollars 224m) last year.
The Canadian business presence in Cuba is centred on mining, oil and gas
exploration and tourism. Joutel Resources of Toronto last year became the
first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with
Geominera, the Cuban mining agency.
Last month, Sherritt, a Canadian nickel and cobalt producer, unveiled plans
for a joint venture with Compania General de Niquel which will include
mining and ore processing facilities in Cuba, and a refinery in Alberta.
In addition, Canadian hotel operators have signed management contracts with
more than half a dozen Cuban hotels.
Companies will also benefit by being able to draw on funds from the Canadian
International Development Agency (Cida) for feasibility studies. Canadian
investors and joint-venture partners have generally found a warm welcome in
Cuba.
Dr Jim Henderson, a member of the Ontario provincial legislature who has
taken a close interest in Cuba, says that 'the wheels can turn very quickly,
provided it's a kind of business that Cuba has decided it wants.'
The recent shift in Ottawa's policy towards Cuba are unlikely to have a
profound impact either on Cuba's tottering economy or its relations with the
outside world.
However, they highlight a clear division between the US and some of its
allies on the best way of halting the deterioration in social and economic
conditions in the country.
The Clinton administration has continued to apply, though without great
enthusiasm, the comprehensive embargo imposed 30 years ago.
Calls from the US business community, especially hotel operators, to ease
the curbs have been offset by pressure from the large Cuban community in the
US to maintain them.
Ottawa however, has come to the conclusion that continued isolation carries
risks of its own.
Its new policy is based on a view that industrial countries need to become
more involved to alleviate the island's economic and social problems before
they lead to an explosion.
Ms Christine Stewart, a junior foreign affairs minister, told an
Organisation of American States meeting in Brazil earlier this month that
'the isolation of Cuba is unhealthy, and it's within all of our interests to
support change in Cuba that is positive and healthy.'
The Clinton administration has taken an interest in the recent initiatives
by Ottawa, but is said to have neither encouraged nor discouraged them.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Russian investment 'to surge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A vastly increased rate of foreign investment in the Russian economy for
this year was forecast yesterday by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime
minister for privatisation - in a confident survey of a process which has
thrown state companies into private hands at a rate and in a volume
unmatched anywhere in the world.
His forecast was backed by a senior foreign banker in Moscow who - speaking
on conditions of anonymity - said that 'a lot of private and company
investors have been coming in and quietly investing in Russian
privatisation. My impression has been that there is a lot more than we have
thought because they have been doing it discreetly and don't want to draw
attention to themselves.'
Mr Chubais said that estimates of a Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn limit on
foreign investment in Russia in the course of this year had to be sharply
revised upwards to between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn, according to forecasts
made by the state property committee, which he chairs.
He said that Russian capital flight - estimated at more than Dollars 25bn -
was now returning because 'it is more profitable to keep money here in
rouble accounts than abroad in hard currency accounts'. The real interest
rate in Russia, though falling, is one of the highest in the world.
Strongly defending bankruptcy for hopeless companies - a process yet to get
under way - Mr Chubais said that 'we must do it not because we want to but
because the country needs it'.
However, Mr Chubais admitted that he had washed his hands of the
privatisation process in Moscow - where only 20 per cent of large industries
have been privatised.
The mayor of Moscow, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, has managed to get presidential
backing to greatly slow down the process and to prolong the use of
privatisation cheques to the end of the year - though they lost value in the
rest of he country at the end of June.
'In Moscow we see so many breaches of the law, so many breaches of the
constitution, so much corruption that I can have nothing to do with it,' he
said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / FBI in business in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr Louis Freeh,
yesterday opened a representative office in Moscow and appealed to the
Russian authorities to combat crime before it overwhelmed them.
Mr Freeh told an audience of interior ministry police officers that Russian
organised crime represented 'a threat to world security'.
The FBI chief, on a 10-day tour of eastern Europe, told a packed hall at the
interior ministry police academy that the fact that Russian crime groups
could 'use their existing and expanding criminal networks to exploit weapons
grade radioactive materials is sufficient to warrant international concern
and action'.
Though his speech was a model of diplomatic balance, he stressed the many
mistakes made by US law enforcement agencies in the original response to the
growth of organised crime which 'permitted the expansion of a powerful,
well-organised crime syndicate'. However, he stressed the need to tackle
urgently the Russian problem - now being internationalised.
As well as the 'significant threat . . . of a catastrophic attack' by
criminals armed with nuclear weapons, Mr Freeh stressed:
The potential of crime gangs 'to ultimately retard Russia's economic
development and precipitate the flight of legitimate capital';
The ability of the gangs to 'launder' money from Russia through banks in the
US - 'a potentially corrupting influence on the banking industries in Russia
and the US'.
The threat posed to the Russian state by the growing and ruthless power of
the gangs. Quoting President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Freeh said that 'organised
crime is trying to take the country by the throat'.
The use of Russia as a transhipment point for drug traffic - especially by
the Colombian drug cartels.
However, Mr Freeh insisted that the 'law enforcement response to this
criminal threat must be 'consistent with the fundamental principles of
justice'.

Leaders of the RMT transport union were discussing their next move in the
railway signal dispute last night.
The 21-strong executive was deciding whether to escalate the conflict by
extending the 24-hour weekly stoppages to two days a week. It was also
looking at Railtrack's latest pay proposal that would give most signalmen
self-financing pay increases of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent.
There seems little likelihood, however, that tomorrow's 24-hour strike can
be avoided.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilians spoil USA's Independence Day party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not all revolutions end with the good guys winning, Jurek Martin writes.
The second 'shot heard around the world' came not from a young American in
red, white and blue but from Bebeto of Brazil in the 73rd minute as the
World Cup's favourites ousted their hosts 1-0 on Independence Day. Brazil
now meet Holland in the quarter-finals.
There were times yesterday when the improbable dream of the US soccer team
seemed alive and in never more than in the closing minutes of the opening
half.
First Romario, comfortably the best player on the field, struck a right-foot
shot against Meola's left-hand goalpost. Moments later, Leonardo's left
elbow struck Ramos's jaw front and centre. The American went down - not to
return - and Brazil's right side offensive threat went off under a red card.
No score at the break and Brazil down to 10 men presented the US with an
opportunity to excite even the most hardened pessimist. But the essential
superiority of the Brazilian team reasserted itself in the second half.
Or, to be precise, Romario imposed himself on the game. Time and again he
ran at the US defence, the ball under close control, the intent lethal. It
was he who created the coup de grace.
After 73 minutes, he beat a couple of defenders on the run down the middle,
before laying it off with the outside of his boot to Bebeto, his faithful
side kick, on the right inside the penalty area. The shot was not hard, but
it was low and accurate, just inside Meola's right post and under his dive,
which seemed higher than it might have been.
After 85 minutes, Clavijo, the stalwart US defender, got his second yellow
card, and thus an ejection, for bringing down, inevitably, Romario. But by
then the US had run out of steam and ideas.
Brazil dropped Rai from mid-field, an odd decision given his earlier
performances. He certainly seemed missed in the first half, as his team
rarely threatened to score. This, and Leonardo's sending-off must have
elated Bora Milutinovic's men but their ultimate lack of offensive skills
proved too great a handicap.
The US team certainly achieved all reasonable expectations. They did not, as
many feared, become the first host country not to survive the first round.
And they held the favourite to one goal. July 4 commemorates victory over
the Redcoats, but it was not enough to inspire the US 218 years later to
knock off the men in gold.
Earlier in Orlando, Holland shrugged off criticism of their early form to
beat Ireland 2-0.
Bergkamp scored in the 11th minute and Jonk blasted home the second in the
41st. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper, grappled with Jonk's searing 25-metre
drive but failed to stop it.
Ireland tried to rally in the second half but their limitations had been
exposed by a far sterner and more imaginative Dutch side.
Fifa said yesterday that Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger would play no
further part in the tournament after he admitted he should have awarded
Belgium a penalty during their 3-2 defeat by Germany.
'He admitted that he made a mistake. He knows that's it for him,' said Fifa
general secretary Sepp Blatter.
Belgian soccer authorities attacked Roethlisberger's decision not to award a
penalty in the 70th minute of the second-round match, arguing that his
decision was the turning point of the game.
Roethlisberger, in his second World Cup finals, was earlier quoted telling
Swiss tabloid Blick he realised he made a mistake when he saw a television
replay of the foul.
'I decided mistakenly. The Belgians were right to claim a penalty,' he told
the newspaper.

Turkey's reform programme was given a boost yesterday on the eve of signing
a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund, with inflation
falling to 0.9 per cent in June compared with 10 per cent in May. June
inflation, the lowest monthly figure in two years, will underpin government
efforts to restrain wages in the talks with public sector unions which start
this month. Turkey's letter of intent with the Fund envisages an annual
rate, which is now running at 115 per cent, will fall to 20 per cent by
mid-1995. John Murray Brown, Ankara

FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The offer of a large line of stock depressed leisure and television group
Granada. The stock retreated 5 3/4 to 492p, with most of the day's volume of
1.5m shares said to have been done in one hit as a big US holder
relinquished part of its holding.
The stock has been under a cloud since last week's stake reduction by
Mercury Asset Management, the single largest stakeholder, with 15.8 per
cent.
The two building sectors, construction and building materials, were heavily
bought, with sector analysts pointing to hopes of cuts in German interest
rates, and strong buying after the poor showing of both sectors during the
last quarter.
'It seems sector rotation principles are having a run,' the analyst said. He
added that the sectors performed well in the first quarter of the year but
abysmally in the second. 'Buying of the stocks can be increasingly supported
by the earnings recovery story but the general feeling is that the buying
has come from fund managers with a one quarter time horizon.'
In the housebuilders/construction stocks, Wilson Bowden rose 14 to 412p. The
best performances in building materials came from RMC, 29 higher at 863p,
Blue Circle, 13 better at 304p, and Meyer International, 20 up at 404p.
Wolseley put on 32 at 772p.
Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle ended the day 2 lower at 501p in spite of annual
profits which were up 21 per cent and in line with analysts' forecasts.
Reuters was strong as the market responded to US buying late on Friday.
Dealers said the gain in the US had prompted bear closing in London, a
situation where dealers who have gone short of stock buy the shares back.
The shares rose 18 to 448p.
ICI shares, up 3 at 793p, failed to react significantly to news that the
company was considering the flotation of its European Vinyls Corporation
subsidiary.
Negative comment over one of its products saw SmithKline Beecham 'A' decline
4 to 404p. However, analysts dismissed the claim that sales of Tagamet,
SmithKline's ulcer drug, had collapsed in the US since its patent expired in
May.
Final turnover of 26m shares was believed to have reflected several big
tax-related 'bed-and-breakfast' trades which were transacted at 375p a share
shortly before the close of dealing. Wellcome was similarly affected, with
6.8m dealt at 560p a share - well below the market price.
Clothes retailer Laura Ashley fell 5 to 68p on the news that it had lost its
finance director to Burton. Ashley's loss was not Burton's gain and the
latter was flat at 57 1/2 p.
A rise in profits for furnishing group MFI saw the shares gain 3 to 142p.
However, some analysts said the pre-tax improvement to Pounds 34.4m from
Pounds 30.7m previously was flattered by various factors.
Speculation of an impending rights issue saw shares in Hartstone, the socks
and stockings company, slip 3 1/2 to 34p.
Courtaulds grew 6 to 485p ahead of a visit by analysts to Germany next week
to inspect one of the company's joint operations with Hoechst.
Shanks &amp; McEwan added 4 at 88p following a newspaper article suggesting that
the troubled waste disposal group was a likely takeover target from
international freight management company Ocean, 3 lighter at 278p.
British Aerospace advanced 10 to 464p, boosted by positive remarks from
Charterhouse Tilney. Rolls-Royce rose 6 to 181p, with Lehman Brothers
reported to have shown a keen interest in the stock.
News from engineering group GKN that its defence division had signed an
agreement of more than Dollars 225m with Kuwait on the sale of armoured
vehicles helped the shares gain 9 at 566p.
Talk of a profits downgrading for Vickers checked an early advance in the
shares and they finished 3 up at 174p.

The failure of Enterprise Oil's bid to absorb fellow oil exploration group
Lasmo saw the former's shares wilt under heavy selling pressure following a
welter of criticism in the weekend press.
Enterprise shares were the worst performers in the FT-SE 100 list, closing 9
1/2 lower at 389p. Turnover of 6.1m shares was the fourth highest this year.
Dealers said the market had taken Enterprise's failure in the bid battle
very badly, and added that there had been growing criticism of Mr Graham
Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive and viewed by the market
as the architect of the bid strategy.
A number of brokers were said to be recommending a switch out of Enterprise
and into Lasmo, notably Kleinwort Benson and Nomura, a move which helped
Lasmo shares move up 3 to 139p on heavy turnover of 13m. Nomura said: 'The
clear message of the Enterprise bid is that Lasmo is undervalued in relation
to Enterprise.'
Other analysts, however, said there was a danger that selling of Enterprise
could be overdone. 'It was the terms of the offer that was given a vote of
no confidence, rather than Enterprise as a company,' said one. He added that
all the bad news that could possibly emerge on Enterprise in the short term
had done so, by courtesy of Lasmo. 'The bad news is all in the price,' he
said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone back on line

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Better than expected new subscriber figures for the second quarter from
Vodafone, the leading cellular phones group in the UK, saw the company's
shares extend their recent recovery.
During the second quarter Vodafone attracted 155,000 net new subscribers to
its cellular network. 'These are great numbers; Vodafone has added as many
new customers to date as it did in the whole of 1993,' said Mr Mark Lambert,
a telecoms specialist at NatWest Securities.
The NatWest analyst said the new subscriber figures underpinned increased
forecasts for the company's earnings pencilled in following the preliminary
figures announced early last month.
Vodafone shares, which fell to an 11-month low of 473p only a week ago,
moved up a further 10 to 509p on the news, which helped to confirm the
group's position as the leading brand name in the UK mobile phones market,
in spite of sharply increased competition.
This has come from Mercury's One-to-One cellular network, launched last
autumn, and a heavy marketing programme for Orange, the new network launched
by Hutchison Telecom.

FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good advance by shares but trading
moderate - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A very buoyant start was made by UK equities yesterday to what promises to
be an eventful week for global securities markets. Encouraged by firmness in
bonds and in other European stock markets, shares moved ahead steadily as
investors weighed the prospects for concerted action to stabilise the US
dollar by the Group of Seven countries at next weekend's meeting in Naples.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed a further 34 points higher at 2,970.4, about four
points under the day's best. The broader market was also firm, taking the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 14.6 to 3,430.4. But trading volume was modest,
and London, similar to other markets, showed the effects of the Independence
Day closure in US markets.
US Federal bonds, which have often held the key to trading in European bonds
in recent weeks, were not traded in either New York or Tokyo yesterday. UK
traders commented that the London market might not have been fully tested
yesterday, and noted how quickly the Paris market turned off on bad news
just before the close of business.
Markets were also bracing themselves for the meeting today of the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee and for Thursday's routine policy meeting at
the Bundesbank. Either the Fed or the Bundesbank could take action on
interest rates, but markets heeded comments yesterday from the Bonn Finance
Ministry that there might be no major initiative planned on dollar support.
Shares opened quietly but extended gains in modest trade as UK government
bonds rose. The markets remained optimistic on the outlook for the domestic
economy, although some analysts expressed concern over the Item Club report
which cast doubts on the upbeat forecasts of the UK Treasury.
Retail stocks, including the leading store names, responded vigorously to
the rise of 6 per cent in UK June M0 money supply, and were unperturbed by a
significantly smaller increase in May credit business that had been
expected. On balance, the statistics were seen as pointing the way to
continued recovery in retail spending, regarded as the necessary base for
sustained economic recovery.
Seaq-reported trading volume for the day fell to only 483.3m shares from the
517.1m of the previous session. On Friday, retail, or genuine customer,
business in equities was worth only Pounds 943.5m, one of the lowest daily
figures for the year. By comparison, in the middle of last week, trading
sessions recorded volume of more than 760m shares for a retail value of
comfortably above Pounds 1bn.
Corporate developments provided some features, mostly on the positive side
of the market ledger. Vodafone strengthened after confirming increasing
customer sales in the buoyant, if competitive, market for cellular phones.
The repercussions, of the failed takeover bid in the oil sector continued,
with Enterprise Oil sharply off following widespread criticism of the
board's handling of the offer, while Lasmo, the escaped victim of
Enterprise, moved ahead.
Few strategists saw much reliable direction in the UK stock market until
next week, when the outcome of the G7 meeting will have become known. But
the underlying tone of the market apeared firm, with most UK stockbroking
concerns predicting rises of around 11 per cent in the FT-SE 100 Index by
the end of this year.

FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of greater stability for the US dollar, together with renewed firmness
in European bond markets, brought an advance in the derivatives, although
volumes remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,952 and buying
from independent traders, also known as locals, steadily sent the contract
ahead.
The strength of bonds provided a useful lead to futures and the release of
UK economic data helped to boost trading further,
US markets, usually a factor in afternoon trading, were closed for the
Independence Day holiday, but September remained in positive territory for
most of the session and reached a peak of 2,988. It was at a premium to cash
for most of the day.
The contract finished at 2,987, up 38 from Friday's close and about 10
points above its fair value premium to cash which has fallen to 5 points on
this account. Volume was very thin, a mere 7,695 lots being dealt by the
close.
Turnover in the traded options was also poor, amounting to just 18,342
contracts. Only 4,156 lots were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,550 in
the Euro FT-SE option. Lasmo, which recently escaped the clutches of
Enterprise Oil, was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,327 contracts
traded.

Toronto finished a sleepy post-holiday session stronger as several
inter-listed shares played catch-up with gains made in the US on Friday,
when Canadian markets were shut for Canada Day.
The TSE 300 index rose 28.3 to 4,053.6 but advances outpaced declines by
just 299 to 289 after extremely thin volume of 19.96m shares, well below
last Thursday's 59.4m. Trading value was CDollars 131.9m.
All but one of the 14 stock groups rose, mining and banking leading with
increases of 1.90 and 1.37 per cent respectively. Industrial products gained
1.02 per cent, while energy and golds were flat.
Wall Street was closed for the Independence Day holiday

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse collapses in
Alcatel aftermath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fragility of yesterday's bourse gains was emphasised by the low level of
turnover in Germany, and the rapid downswing on bad news in France, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS collapsed in the afternoon as Alcatel-Alsthom, the energy and
telecommunications conglomerate, confirmed that its chairman, Mr Pierre
Suard, had been questioned by police in the Paris region.
Alcatel, France's second biggest quoted company and with a near 8 per cent
weighting in the CAC-40 index, fell FFr49 to FFr541; the CAC 40 index closed
6.68 lower at 1,866.18 after an intraday peak more than 40 points higher.
Turnover was thin at FFr2.7bn. There were worries that there could be a
knock-on effect from the Alcatel affair, and Generale des Eaux, for example,
lost FFr11 at FFr515 after a day's high of FFr551.
Elsewhere, AGF, the insurer, dropped FFr29.20, or 6.3 per cent, to
FFr437.80, although brokers found nothing severely disappointing in a
domestic press report yesterday.
FRANKFURT took a day off from immediate worries about American initiatives
in the currency, bond and equity markets, and the Dax index, having risen
17.88 to 2,054.40 on the session, extended its gains in the afternoon to end
on an Ibis-indicated 2,061.70.
However, the upswing was described as fragile. Brokers pointed to turnover,
down from DM5.9bn to DM4.4bn, and said the market was waiting for the result
of today's Federal Open Market Committee in Washington, and its potential
effect on US interest rates.
Other potential foreign influences included the visit of Chinese Prime
Minster Li Peng, who said that China will agree business deals worth Dollars
3.5bn with German companies this week. However, while Siemens said it had
big prospects here, dealers said that a DM7.50 rise to DM662.50 for the
stock was not connected with the Chinese visit.
Domestic news included a DM10 rise to DM704 for Deutsche Bank, after it said
there was no evidence of 'dishonourable conduct' by members of Deutsche's
staff in regard to the Schneider affair.
MILAN marked time in very thin turnover, the Comit index gaining 3.43 at
686.84.
Shares in Cartiere Burgo, the paper maker, recovered from a low of L8,700 to
finish L384, or 4.1 per cent, down at L9,080 in reaction to its announcement
on Friday of a L230bn capital call to finance future purchases. The stock
was suspended temporarily at the start of trade because the sharp price fall
made it difficult to match orders.
Fiat put on L84 at L6,458 in further response to last week's positive
forecasts, although volume was a low 5m shares.
ZURICH was higher in low volume, the SMI index adding 47.5, or 1.8 per cent,
to finish at a day's high of 2,636.4.
Banks were firmer, with some said to be using the low volume to push their
own shares higher. CS Holding bearers, up SFr24 at SFr574, led the active
list.
Among exporters benefiting from expectations of a firm dollar, Roche
certificates rose SFr85 to SFr6,415, Brown Boveri SFr28 to SFr1,191 and
Nestle SFr14 to SFr1,131.
AMSTERDAM found support in a steady dollar and marginally higher bond
prices. The AEX index rose 3.48 to 388.00.
ABN-Amro firmed 80 cents to Fl 60.40 on the view that it had been oversold
during the market's recent fall, while DSM, the chemicals group with
cyclical recovery potential, moved up Fl 4 to Fl 133.50.
BRUSSELS climbed on selective programme buying from London, the Bel-20 index
ending 30.52, or 2.2 per cent, stronger at 1,432.66.
Higher bond prices and a firm dollar were also put forward as reasons for
the rally, which took the interest rate-sensitive utility Electrabel up 2.9
per cent to BFr5,660 in the day's largest volume. Royale Belge, Belgium's
largest insurance group, rose BFr380, or 7.6 per cent, to BFr5,380, but
dealers said the stock was illiquid and catching up with the market after
lagging behind for three months.
MADRID trading was hindered by technical problems but the general index
still managed to rise 1.74 to 300.82 in turnover of Pta18.2bn.
Telefonica was the most active stock, up Pta35 at Pta1,805 in some 5.4m
shares following last week's move into the Unisource European telecoms joint
venture with companies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.
TEL AVIV extended Sunday's near 4 per cent fall with a further 3 per cent
decline, leaving the market at its low for the year. The Mishtanim index
lost 4.95 at 159.40, for a 40 per cent drop since the start of the year, in
turnover up to Shk162m from Shk135m.
The declines prompted Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, to express
concern, saying the economic situation was far better than was suggested by
the performance of the stock exchange.
HELSINKI rose 1.2 per cent, led higher by strong gains for Nokia shares. The
Hex index added 20.6 at 1,698.3.
Nokia jumped FM24 to FM451 and the preferred FM18 to FM450: the shares found
strong demand in New York on Friday after the company announced the pricing
for an offering of 5.3m preferred shares.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S African shares post quarter's biggest
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve's move towards tighter US monetary policy, begun in late
February, provided the major theme for many equity markets during the second
quarter of the year.
The FT-Actuaries World index, however, rose 2.9 per cent in dollar terms,
with a stunning 10 per cent advance in the Pacific region as investors
rediscovered Tokyo and Singapore, more than outpacing declines elsewhere.
South Africa provided the world's best performance in the three months to
the end of June, as April's general election was successfully concluded and
the violence which had marred outside perceptions of the country subsided.
The market strengthened 14.2 per cent, almost eradicating the losses seen in
the previous 12 months.
European money which had begun flowing into the market after Mr Nelson
Mandela was released from prison was augmented by American funds late last
year as US city, county and state bans on pension fund investment in South
Africa were lifted.
More important was the appearance of specialist funds for South African
investment by several leading US money managers, including Morgan Stanley
and Alliance Capital.
More recently, the IFC has said that it is to include South Africa in its
global index of emerging markets within the next few months, with a
weighting of 13 per cent. SG Warburg estimates suggest that this could imply
inflows of between Dollars 6.5bn and Dollars 21bn into the market, compared
with purchases totalling Dollars 650m last year.
The market is, however, markedly illiquid, with only about 13 per cent of
listed stocks changing hands last year. But Mr Michael Coulson at Credit
Lyonnais Laing believes that Mr Mandela might be in the mood to change that
next year through a privatisation programme which could include the
telephone sector, South African Airways and Escom, the electricity
generating company.
'It would be a wonderful way of liberating assets, generating much needed
cash and putting money back into the economy,' he said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Rolimpex offer returns to original
price

<TEXT>
Yesterday saw the public offer of 50 per cent of the equity in Rolimpex, the
state-owned agricultural goods import and export company, open at the
original minimum price of 300,000 zlotys per share, in spite of earlier
statements by the Privatisation Ministry that the price would be reduced to
take in the market downturn, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Defending this, Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the minister, said: 'It is not my
intention to contribute to the fall in prices by dropping the Rolimpex price
 -it is a first rate company.'
Yesterday also saw the first market quotation of shares in the recently
privatised Jelfa pharmaceuticals group, which fell 7 per cent from the
initial public offer price of 300,000.
Equities staged a rebound after the recent correction, but light volume and
moderate price movements were seen as signals that the market had not
recovered confidence after more than three months of bearish trade. The Wig
index rose 226.5, or 2.9 per cent, to 8,019.0 in turnover that fell 7.5 per
cent to 509bn zlotys.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firmer on
small-lot buying
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Most investors remained inactive ahead of the Bank of Japan's quarterly
branch managers' meeting and the Group of Seven summit in Naples, and share
prices gained moderate ground on small-lot buying in low volume, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 88.52 to 20,631.93. Following a morning session
in which the index saw a day's low of 20,573.21 and a high of 20,703.14, it
stayed in a narrow trading range.
Arbitrageurs, leading sellers during the previous week, took a breather as
the yen's ascent, which depressed share prices, halted briefly yesterday.
Uncertainty over a possible concerted interest rate move, incorporating a US
increase, and falls in Germany and Japan, prevailed.
Foreign investors were also absent, but domestic institutions and new
investment trusts placed small-lot orders, and volume totalled 248m shares
against 372m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks moved up 10.57 to 1,672.73,
while the Nikkei 300 put on 1.70 at 304.00. Advances led declines by 732 to
280, with 176 issues unchanged, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
1.81 to 1,356.99.
Dealers bought back export-oriented high-technology issues, which faced
selling due to the yen's strength. However, some shares which had risen last
week on the portable telephone theme lost ground on profit-taking.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose sharply last week on hopes of a
broader investor base following its planned listing on the London and New
York stock exchanges, dipped Y9,000 to Y872,000 on profit-taking.
DDI, the long distance telecom operator, declined Y100,000 to Y9.35m.
However, Nitsuko, a telecom equipment maker, firmed Y20 to Y1,590 and
Kyocera, DDI's top shareholder, added Y60 at Y7,500.
Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, gained Y40 at Y1,120. The
company is seen as a beneficiary of the high yen due to its crude oil
imports, while some investors continue to be bullish over the company's
previous news of its oil well discovery in Vietnam.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting, which gained ground recently on the rise in
commodity prices, lost Y4 at Y416.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 172.69 to 23,130.18 in volume of 15.2m
shares.
Roundup
Most of the region had a quiet day, although one or two markets had their
moments.
SYDNEY fixed upon last Friday's late gains on Wall Street, and the All
Ordinaries index rose 21.3 to 1,987.1. Resource stocks were the day's main
winners, with the all resources index up 20.2 to 1,283.3.
Turnover was ADollars 409m. Foster's Brewing topped turnover with 7.7m
shares traded. The stock closed a cent firmer at ADollars 1.09. MIM
Holdings, which climbed 4 cents to ADollars 2.90 in 3.5m shares dealt, was
the most traded resource issue.
The Australian Stock Exchange launched a new stock index called the ASX100
as part of a series of new indices which will be available by the end of the
year.
Mr Richard Humphry, ASX's managing director, told reporters that the new
index, introduced in response to local institutions and managed funds,
covers companies among the top 120 by market capitalisation, which have
about 1 per cent of their stock traded per month.
Mr Humprhry said that funds need a new benchmark: the All Ordinaries index
covers 307 stocks, whereas many funds only invest in 30 or 40.
WELLINGTON followed gains in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge, up 15 cents to
NZDollars 4.68 and 11 cents to Dollars 3.77 respectively, the NZSE-40 index
closing 26.45 higher at 2,009.79.
SEOUL's composite index rose 12.93 to 951.23 after a rebound in blue chips.
Brokers said that unfounded rumours of an expansion of foreign ownership in
local stocks helped to boost the market.
TAIPEI closed off its highs but the weighted index still ended 61.79, or 1
per cent, better at 6,067.63, after strong buying in electronics. Turnover
rose to TDollars 64.42bn, from TDollars 40.96bn in Saturday's shortened
session.
HONG KONG's turnover shrank to an 18-month low, a preliminary HKDollars
1.30bn, against Friday's adjusted HKDollars 2.29bn and the lowest since
HKDollars 954m on January 4, 1993. The Hang Seng index finished 6.09 down at
8,628.28.
KARACHI fell sharply at the close on profit-taking before settlement today
and on lack of institutional support. The KSE 100 index shed 23.98, or 1 per
cent, to 2,314.93.
Dewan Salman Fibre, up sharply before the 1994/95 budget, retreated Rs7.50
to Rs164 on profit-taking.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar moves narrowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independence Day holiday in the US, and caution ahead of today's Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, ensured that the dollar yesterday
traded in a fairly narrow range, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency finished little changed in London, at Y98.9 from Y98.705 on
Friday, and DM1.5965 from DM1.5946.
With the US markets closed, the currency market had effectively shut by
mid-afternoon in London, with one leading bank reporting that most of its
spot traders had taken off to watch the crucial Ireland-Holland match in the
World Cup.
Traders said investors, faced with a bewildering array of monetary policy
meetings this week, appeared to have taken to the sidelines. There is
increasing scepticism, however, about the likelihood of co-ordinated policy
action in support of the dollar from leading industrial nations.
In Europe, the Swedish krona and Italian lira recovered from their weakness
of last week. The pound had an uneventful day, the sterling index ending
steady at 79.6.
There was little fresh news for the market to chew on, save for comments
from President Clinton that 'we do not believe a country can devalue itself
into prosperity'.
Commenting on the dollar's recent weakness, Mr Clinton added that 'great
care should be taken before unusual actions are taken'. Some traders
interpreted this as diminishing the likelihood of concerted intervention.
Bolstering this impression were remarks from Mr Gert Haller, state secretary
in the German Finance Ministry, that the current dollar/D-Mark rate, of
about DM1.60, 'corresponds to the long term average'. He added: 'I have not
understood the excitement about the dollar in relation to European
currencies.'
While few analysts rule out the possibility of a monetary tightening from
the policy-making FOMC, most agree that this would be motivated by domestic
economic conditions, rather than the weakness of the US currency.
Similarly, analysts said any monetary easing from the Bundesbank council,
which meets on Thursday, would be tied to domestic factors.
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said if the FOMC
authorised a rise in rates, it was possible that Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve chairman, would be given leeway to move only after he has seen
Friday's payroll figures, and the preliminary second-quarter GDP figure
later this month.
The Barclays economist said a 'do nothing' policy might be the best option,
and that an intervention strategy was very dangerous as it provided markets
with a target to aim at.
But Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said he did
not believe finance ministers and their political leaders were ready to risk
a 'crisis of confidence' in international markets. He added that recent
dollar weakness had been a catalyst for financial market weakness, and
predicted that this causality will continue.
Mr Chertkow doubted whether G7 leaders will come up with a pre-emptive
strategy to defend the US currency, and expected more intervention as a
response to further dollar weakness. He said this is likely next week when
the market wakes up to discover that there is no strategy to defend the
dollar.
Chase Manhattan, in its weekly foreign exchange analysis, notes that
'although G7 intervention has seldom been effective at the first or second
attempt, it generally has been effective eventually'.
The bank makes two further points: there has so far been little intervention
from the G7, with past episodes seeing 10 or more episodes of intervention
before markets turned. Second, there has been more limited G7 success with
intervention on dollar/yen than on Dollars /D-Mark.
In Europe, attention focused again on the lira and krona. Against the
D-Mark, the lira finished in London at L990.6 from L994.7 and the krona at
SKr4.890 from SKr4.906.
The recovery in the krona was tied up with the Swedish bond auction, which
went off more successfully than expected. Analysts said there was evidence
that the weakness of the krona had enticed foreign investors to participate
in the bond auction.
Mr Chertkow said the recovery in the lira was perhaps linked to market
rumours that the government planned, later this week, to announce
significant cuts in public expenditure. This would help address market
concern about the size of Italy's budget deficit.
The general torpor infecting markets spread to interest rate futures, where
volumes were at a very low ebb. But the firmer tone in the bond markets
helped prices, with the December Eurosterling contract closing at 93.73,
from 93.71. Only 2,782 lots were traded.
The December Euromark contract saw 5,042 lots dealt and ended at 94.97 from
94.94.
In the money markets, German call money rates eased to 5.05/5.15 per cent.
In the UK, the Bank of England provided Pounds 915m liquidity to the market
after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3
1/2 and 5 per cent.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers join environmentalists
in reform call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of prominent UK farmers and environmentalists yesterday launched a
campaign to reform the common agricultural policy, describing it as 'an
astonishing abuse of public money'.
'At the moment, the more intensively you farm, the more handouts you get,'
said Mr Patrick Holden of the Soil Association, Britain's leading organic
farming organisation, at the Royal Show in Warwickshire, England's biggest
annual agricultural event. 'We want to change that so it becomes
commercially possible for farmers to farm in a more environmentally friendly
way.'
The Gay Hussar Group, named after the London restaurant where its members
thrashed out their platform, includes Mr Jonathon Porritt, former director
of Friends of the Earth, Sir Simon Gourlay, a past president of the National
Farmers' Union, and Ms Marie Skinner, a member of the NFU's policy-making
council.
Mr Oliver Walston, a large-scale arable farmer in Cambridgeshire and a
leading critic of the Pounds 3bn paid annually in subsidies to UK farmers,
admitted he had undergone a conversion to the environmentalist cause.
'Two years ago I was out of touch with their sort of farming,' he said. 'But
the situation in the countryside is economically and politically
unsustainable.'
The group is calling for CAP subsidies to be redirected from production
support to maintaining the landscape and wildlife, cutting pollution and
rebuilding rural economies. 'As a result, food surpluses will be reduced and
farmers will be brought closer to the market place,' it argues.
It also wants to end 'the insanity' of set-aside, under which farmers are
compensated for leaving the land uncultivated.
Most of the group's ire was directed at what Mr Porritt described as 'the
misdirection of public monies and policy' by the British ministry of
agriculture. But Sir Simon Gourlay accepted that CAP policy was determined
by the EU and that other European governments and farmers 'would need a lot
of persuading'.
Some farmers in the UK, too, have yet to be persuaded of the need for CAP
reform. Sir David Naish, NFU president, said yesterday that the union's
recent policy document on options for reform 'has initiated a discussion
which some would probably prefer not to have'.
However Sir David, who has been meeting EU counterparts to discuss reform,
said there was a feeling in Europe 'that no longer have the treasuries in
any member state the willingness to throw money at agriculture to get rid of
the problem'.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, yesterday announced a 33 per
cent increase in funding to nearly Pounds 1.3m a year for research into new
industrial and energy crops that could be grown on set-aside land. 'About a
sixth of our arable land is now in set-aside and there is justifiable
concern that more positive use should be made of it,' she said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big copper deficit estimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's recent price rise followed a substantial deficit in supply during
the first quarter of this year. Nickel and tin supplies were also outpaced
by demand in the quarter, according to the UK-based World Bureau of Metal
Statistics.
However, the aluminium market continued to be plagued by a supply surplus,
as did the lead and zinc markets.
In its latest quarterly review, the WBMS said a big increase in demand for
copper plus a fall in western production and net imports from the former
eastern bloc countries, helped copper to a first-quarter supply deficit of
264,000 tonnes.
The bureau estimated that copper demand rose by 7.5 per cent in the first
quarter compared with the same months of 1993 to 2.42m tonnes. Meanwhile,
refined copper production slipped by 3.3 per cent to 2.15m tonnes and net
eastern bloc imports dropped from 43,000 to 12,000 tonnes.
Nickel producers helped themselves by cutting production substantially in
the early months of this year because of the low prices at that time.
Refined nickel output dropped by 10 per cent to 124,000 tonnes in the first
quarter. There was also a sharp fall in net eastern bloc imports, down from
20,000 to 8,000 tonnes. A near-2 per cent rise in consumption, from 162,000
to 165,000 tonnes left the market with a supply deficit increased from 4,000
to 33,000 tonnes.
Tin's deficit slipped slightly in the quarter, from 9,000 to 8,000 tonnes
reflecting a 3 per cent rise in output to 34,000 tonnes and static
consumption at 42,000 tonnes.
Consumption of aluminium in the quarter was shown 5.7 per cent ahead at 3.8m
tonnes, while production eased by more than 2 per cent to 3.66m tonnes.
The aluminium market was still left with a surplus of 157,000 tonnes, but
that was down from 457,000 tonnes in the same quater last year.
The WBMS estimated that net eastern bloc aluminium imports in the quarter
were still high by past standards, but they slipped from 318,000 to 302,000
tonnes.
Zinc's supply surplus in the quarter also fell back - from 79,000 to 59,000
tonnes. Slab zinc output was down by 0.8 per cent, from 1.38m to 1.37m
tonnes, net eastern bloc imports were down from 47,000 to 29,000 tonnes
while consumption was down by 0.7 per cent at 1.34m tonnes.
The surplus of lead supplies in the quarter increased from 79,000 to 89,000
tonnes, boosted by in net eastern bloc imports - nil in the first quarter of
1993 - to 9,000 tonnes.
Lead's prospects were helped by producer cuts at the mines. According to the
WBMS western world refined lead output and consumption both edged up by 0.6
per cent, to 1.15m tonnes and 1.068m tonnes respectively.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Free access to plant genetic
resources assured - Geoff Tansey reports on an agreement to put gene
collections under intergovernmental control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new international agreement, guaranteeing equitable access to plant
genetic resources should be signed within a few months.
This follows the conclusion last Friday of the second session of the
Intergovernmental Committee of the Convention on Biological Diversity in
Nairobi, Kenya, where delegates agreed that there should be no intellectual
property rights governing the use of the 500,000 crop samples held in the
gene banks of 11 international agricultural research centres.
The committee gave 'strong support for finalising the agreement between the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the international
research centres as soon as possible'.
It will put the various collections under centralised intergovernmental
control under the management of the FAO's Commission on Plant Genetic
Resources.
The agreement means that the collections will not be the centres' assets but
will be globally-owned resources and the centres will manage them as
trustees not owners, according to Dr Geoff Hawtin, director of the
International Plant Genetic Resources Institute.
The centres will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring continued
availability of materials under free access.
There will also be no intellectual property rights (patents or plant
breeder's rights) on those materials in the collections, which mainly come
from developing countries, and this condition will be passed on to
recipients of the samples.
The institute has the lead role in dealing with plant genetic resources
among the 17 centres funded by the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research, an informal group of donors. Each centre, however, is
an independent legal entity governed by a board of trustees. Every year,
more than 120,000 germplasm accessions from the collections and 500,000
samples of improved materials are distributed by the centres, mainly to
developing countries.
The agreement has already been accepted by the FAO's governing council, the
commission and the individual centres.
The opening of the Nairobi meeting was overshadowed by accusations by some
non-governmental organisations that the World Bank was attempting to seize
control of the consultative group's activities regarding plant genetic
resources and to delay signing of any agreements until 1996.
These fears were rejected by Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the
consultative group and a vice president of the World Bank, as based on
'fanciful guesswork not backed up by facts'.
However, Mr Henk Hobbelink, director of Genetic Resources Action
International (Grain) says that in a letter sent before the meeting he told
one of the non-governmental organisations that it would be 'foolhardy to
lock into agreements' before then.
In a statement issued to the meeting, Dr Serageldin said: 'The CGIAR is
committed to carrying out the responsibilities of trusteeship (over the
genetic resources in its gene banks) in concert with FAO and its Commission
on Plant Genetic Resources, and with the contracting parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity'.
Mr Hawtin welcomes the 'clear message from Nairobi that says sign'. The
consultative group would like to sign the agreement but since it is not a
legal body it can only do so if each centre delegates its signature to the
group chairman. This is what is likely to happen, believes Mr Hawtin; but he
sees possible delays if some centre boards still have to meet to give
approval.
'I'd rather see a quick signature than delays,' he says, as would the
non-governmental organisations, which welcome the Nairobi meeting's call for
an agreement as soon as possible. They see it as an important step in
ensuring equitable access to the world's genetic resources.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London aluminium price touches
a 39-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium touched Dollars 1,530 a tonne, a 39-month high, on the London
Metal Exchange yesterday as investment funds continued to make their
presence felt in the metal markets.
However, some profit-taking emerged and there was no support for prices from
the US, where markets were closed for Independence Day. As a result
aluminium for delivery in three months eased back to close at Dollars 1,519,
up Dollars 9.
Aluminium's fundamental situation was improving, said Mr Angus MacMillan,
research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, 'but the market appears to
have run ahead of itself to some extent'. Cuts in western world daily output
had yet to translate into a sustained fall in the huge stocks overhanging
the market.
Mr MacMillan said that, if prices continued to strengthen, producers might
be tempted to restart capacity at present shut down. However, for the time
being Billiton was assuming this would not happen and it had revised its
aluminium price forecast for 1994 up from an average of 54 cents a pound
(Dollars 1,190 a tonne) to 60 cents.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Feel-good
factor leads UK growers into danger - Plans for increased spending may be an
over-reaction to short-term financial benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crops beside the road between my farm in Norfolk and the Royal
Agricultural Showground in Warwickshire confirmed my judgment that, in spite
of the late spring, the grain harvest would begin at about the usual time in
a few weeks.
Winter sown barley had turned from green to cream and the hot, dry spell
over much of southern England had begun to ripen wheat as well. Indeed there
were patches in many fields along the road where the short sharp summer
drought had caused crops to die off rather than mature gently; and that
bodes ill for potential yields.
But even though my car windscreen quickly became splattered with dead
aphids, which in large numbers can cause serious damage to cereal crops, I
concluded that there was little I could economically do at this stage to
influence the result of the harvest and continued on to the show.
The cereal variety plots, grown by the National Institute of Agricultural
Botany for demonstration purposes on the showground, gave a similar picture.
It was interesting to note the emphasis the institute now gives to natural
resistance to or tolerance of pests and diseases. Growers are advised to
select for such characteristics (defined in NIAB literature) for economic as
well as environmental reasons.
But it is not as simple and uncomplicated as that. Yield penalties on winter
sown wheat, where no fungicides are used, can, according to the NIAB, be as
high as 33 per cent and are seldom less than 14 per cent. Clearly a
judicious and limited usage of chemical is these days most appropriate in
order to optimise yield and maximise profit. A few years ago yield was
everything and most farmers applied whatever it took to achieve the maximum.
Some of us believe we are a bit more sophisticated today.
Meanwhile there is a real danger that the recent short-term improvement in
UK farmers' fortunes, which is not shared by most other EU farmers and is
based almost entirely on the accident of sterling's devaluation, might
promote a false sense of long-term security across the industry. Moreover a
survey by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which stages the Royal
Show, suggests that may already be happening.
Each year the society attempts to measure the mood of the agricultural
sector. The results of the poll it took among its members last autumn, which
almost by definition are bigger than the average farmer in England, indicate
that, based on increases in income, some confidence has returned to the
industry following the devaluation.
More than three quarters of respondents said they were planning to invest in
their businesses within 12 months, the majority intending to buy machinery.
A further devaluation of the green pound last Friday triggered by the recent
decline in the value of the pound against other European currencies, adds
about 1.25 per cent to farm price guarantees and area payments for set-aside
and the like. On the face of it this appears to justify the ebullient mood
which has already resulted in significant increases in sales of tractors to
UK farmers.
According to the Agricultural Engineers Association 1993 saw a rise in new
tractor sales of 33 per cent and during the first six months of 1994 the
figure is up 9.7 per cent on the same period in 1993. Some industry pundits
predict that the trade will continue to increase while others suggest the
year-end figure will be similar to last year's. Meanwhile manufacturers, who
cut back capacity during several years of declining sales, are finding it
difficult to keep up with demand.
It seems churlish to question the wisdom of all this business during a
colourful and jolly trade event like the Royal Show. But I am not the only
one doing so.
The government's Agricultural Development and Advisory Service is also
counselling caution. In a comprehensive strategy document, launched at the
show, ADAS points out that the profitability of arable farming 'has now
passed its peak and will continue to decline as CAP (the European
Community's common agricultural policy) reform measures take effect'.
The document considers each sector of agriculture and horticulture in turn
and projects the effects of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
settlement as it too is implemented. It concludes that reform measures and
the single EU market will intensify competition for home sales; that the
Gatt deal will increase competition on export markets; and that a further
and much more financially stringent reform of the CAP is inevitable within
the next two or three years.
'A two-speed agriculture could develop' says ADAS, 'with the larger, dynamic
businesses taking the lions share, with the remainder relying on EU support
for their contributions to the wider economy.' And the agency urges farmers
with ambitions to be in the dynamic group to adapt their business practices
to ensure success.
One of the changes necessary is to keep tight control of expenditure. Those
booming tractor sales may be good for the farm machinery trade in the short
term, but they suggest to me that some of those who have been buying have
not yet learned that lesson.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: UK gilts top world league
table for June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds outperformed the rest of the world's bonds in June, as
core European markets moved higher.
The JP Morgan government bond index shows a return for gilts of 0.72 per
cent, measured in local currency.
Second came Germany, with 0.5 per cent. Australia was the worst performer,
with a return of minus 3.07 per cent, just below Spain, Italy and Japan. The
average rate of return across all countries was minus 0.57 per cent.
'Investor sentiment is being influenced by anecdotal evidence that European
bond market performance may be bottoming out after several months of sharp
decline,' the report said.
Gilts were boosted by the government's white paper on pension industry
reform, while economic growth remained in line with expectations and
underlying inflation figures were revised downwards.
Worries over the government's commitment to controlling the budget deficit
hit the Italian market, while Spanish bonds suffered from political
uncertainty following the European parliamentary elections.
However, 'concerns centring upon the US dollar and bond markets, as well as
uncertainty over the timing of future US interest rate increases, continued
to weigh heavily upon the global fixed-income markets', the report
emphasises.
Over the last three months, the report shows that the UK has been one of the
worst performers with a rate of return of minus 4.27 per cent.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Europe higher in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets moved slightly higher yesterday in very
thin trading, with the US closed for Independence Day and investors bracing
themselves ahead of a busy week of economic data and official policy-making
meetings.
The US Federal Open Markets Committee meets today and tomorrow to discuss
monetary policy, amid speculation that it may raise official short-term
interest rates, due to signs of domestic economic strength and to support
the dollar after its recent weakness.
The Bundesbank holds its regular fortnightly meeting on Thursday, although
no significant moves on interest rates are expected. On Friday, US non-farm
payrolls data are released and the Group of Seven leading industrialised
nations meets in Naples for its annual economic summit.
'Markets squeezed upwards apathetically,' said Ms Alison Cottrell,
international economist at Midland Global Markets. 'With slightly more
stability to the dollar, and with nothing special domestically to focus on,
there was no reason to go down,' she said. 'Ahead of all these events, this
is not a market you take a big risk in.'
Analysts said bond markets may be boosted by the Naples summit, particularly
if pronouncements made on trade relations between Japan and the US stabilise
the dollar.
The German September government bond contract on Liffe was down 0.25 points
at 92.15 in late trading, while the September long gilt future on Liffe was
down  3/8 points at 100 11/32 .
Confidence returned to the Swedish government bond market after the
successful SKr6.5bn auction of seven and 15-year bonds.
The average accepted yield on the sale of SKr3.5bn of 15-year bonds was
11.05 per cent and that on the auction of SKr3bn of seven-year bonds 10.51
per cent. Both issues were fully covered, with bids of SKr4.36bn entered for
the 15-year and SKr8bn for the seven-year bond. Analysts said domestic
retail investors and foreign institutional investors were the main buyers,
tempted by the high yields.
'It was a relief,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG
Warburg. 'But the problems are not going to go away and the next test will
be the Treasury bill auction on Thursday and the next bond auction in two
weeks time,' he said.
Yields had risen dramatically ahead of the auction on fears that the
government would be unable to find sufficient buyers for its bonds.
These fears were triggered by the announcement on Friday by Skandia, one of
Sweden's largest insurance companies, that it was boycotting government
bonds in protest at the continuing rise in public sector debt.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Funds take a fresh look at
cash management - The pressure is on fund managers to make their large cash
positions work harder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When negative sentiment takes a grip of markets in the way it has done for
most of this year, that old adage 'Cash is King' could not be a wiser
investment strategy.
The recent slide in bond and equity prices has prompted many investors,
professional and private alike, to run for cover. Those who have decided to
take their losses on the chin have sold their positions and placed the
proceeds in the safety of short-term bank deposits. Some fund managers are
also holding back from investing the fresh funds which flow in at regular
intervals.
As a result, they are sitting on historically large cash positions in their
equity or bond portfolios, in some instances as high as 100 per cent. The
norm is around 5 per cent for pension funds and 10 per cent for low-risk
private client portfolios.
Since they are only meant to be in cash on a temporary basis, fund managers
tend to opt for the best overnight rate to ensure capital preservation and
allow immediate withdrawal for a quick return to the markets when they think
the time is right.
Mr Peter Flynn, director of fixed income at Fleming Investment Management,
says it would be inappropriate to manage such cash positions too actively.
'You want to be flexible, you are only in cash pending re-investment,' he
says. 'Anyway, cash benchmarks such as three-month sterling Libor (the
London interbank offered rate) would have been tough to beat since the
beginning of the year.'
But with markets remaining volatile, the pressure is on fund managers to
make these cash positions work harder.
Mr Tim Easun, managing director at Union Fund Management, estimates that
there is at least Pounds 12bn of pension fund money which could be getting
better returns than overnight rates. The amount would be even greater if it
included cash piles in the corporate and public authority sectors.
'It is accidental money which is not being invested properly,' says Mr
Easun, adding that in the UK, fund managers tend to have a 'loose change'
attitude towards cash. 'Cash should be an asset class in its own right, like
in the US.'
In the US, pension funds, companies and even hospitals are seeking a better
return on their excess cash than the yields which they could get from
rolling over overnight bank positions. Although the cash is often deposited
with a custodian bank, the decision on how it is invested is taken by cash
management specialists.
Mr John Isaacson, chief investment officer and executive vice-president at
Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles, says his philosophy is to look at cash on a
total return basis. For example, buying a liquid two-year bond and holding
it for three months could well be more profitable than a three-month deposit
because of the likely capital gain. Founded 11 years ago, Payden and Rygel
now has Dollars 16bn under management, reflecting the demand in the US for
cash management expertise.
Mr Isaacson says that, although the emphasis on yield is ingrained among
European investors, he believes low interest rates will prompt them to want
more from their cash. But he has found that European investors still
associate investments maturing in more than one year with a risk of making
losses on the principal, as value fluctuates.
Mr Easun detects an increasing trend among UK institutional investors to
farm out the management of their cash positions. 'We now have more than
Pounds 1bn under management. Such economies of scale allow us to get better
rates than the corporate treasurer who rings up the bank every day at
10.30,' he says.
Meanwhile, some UK fund managers are starting to copy their American
cousins. Mr Paul Meader, head of fixed-income management at Matheson
Investment Management, says he constantly monitors short-dated instruments
to find the best return for his cash position. 'Yields are inconsistent at
the short end of the yield curve, you can find anomalies which allow you to
get rates of 5 per cent rather than 3 per cent,' he says.
Mr Meader points to the Bank of England's latest auction of floating-rate
notes as an example. 'On the new gilt FRN it will be possible to get a yield
of 5.75 per cent provided the FRN goes to par by the next coupon fixing,' he
says. This compares favourably with overnight rates, where it is sometimes
difficult to get 4 per cent.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Large transactions held in the wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spate of new issues in Swiss francs and yen buoyed activity on an
otherwise subdued day in the Eurobond market. But the yen deals were
targeted at Japanese investors, while the Swiss franc issues were largely
aimed at retail investors.
In addition, ABN Amro Lease Holding launched a Fl 100m four-year deal, which
was partly sold to institutions, but mainly aimed at retail investors,
according to lead manager ABN Amro.
No borrowers ventured to launch large offerings targeted primarily at
institutional investors yesterday, due to the closure of the US market for
the Independence Day holiday.
A similar pattern is likely to continue for the rest of the week, as large
transactions are held in the wings, while traders await the outcome of the
US Federal Open Market Committee meeting today and tomorrow, the Bundesbank
council meeting on Thursday and the latest US jobs figures on Friday.
In addition, dealers are hoping that the dollar may stabilise, perhaps in
the wake of the Group of Seven summit at the weekend, creating a more
favourable environment for new offerings next week.
Finland, which was last week rumoured to be planning a deal, yesterday
awarded a mandate to Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to arrange a 10-year
global bond offering, denominated in dollars. The size of the deal has not
yet been set, but it is expected to total Dollars 1bn or more.
Other deals likely to emerge next week are the global offerings for Fannie
Mae and Italy, while there have been rumours that both Sweden and Spain are
also eyeing the markets.
The Kingdom of Spain has replaced its existing Dollars 500m eurocommercial
paper programme with a Dollars 2bn programme, arranged by Lehman Brothers.
The new programme allows paper to be issued in a broader range of
currencies.

100 share index

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Stock Exchange yesterday launched an index, called the
ASX100.
The aim of the index is to give institutional fund managers a better
indication of how portfolios based on the leading big company shares are
performing than the current All-Ordinaries Index.
The All-Ordinaries Index is made up of 305 stocks at present. However,
according to Mr Richard Humphry, managing director of the ASX, equity
portfolios held by both local and overseas institutional investors typically
contain about 30 to 40 of the top 100 stocks.
The new index is designed to provide them with a better match.
In addition, the ASX claims the index could prove particularly useful for
managers of index funds, who aim to have portfolios which duplicate the main
market index as closely as possible.
The index is made up of the stocks in the existing 50 Leaders Index, and
then adds the next 50 largest stocks based on market capitalisation and
liquidity.
At end-June, the resulting 100 stocks accounted for 87 per cent of the
All-Ordinaries Index and 80 per cent of the Australian equities market by
capitalisation.
About two-thirds of the ASX100 is accounted for by industrial stocks, as
opposed to resource shares.
The ASX plans to follow up the move with a series of indices, dividing the
market into three components (top, medium and small stocks) and into
industrial and resources group.
All will have a base date of December 31, 1990.

sales of Pta26bn.
Allied Lyons, the UK group, entered Spain earlier this year when it acquired

<TEXT>
The divestment of Air Jamaica has been delayed by three months following
changes in the the consortium purchasing the airline from the island's
government. The disposal was to have been completed last week.
The Air Jamaica Acquisition Group, which is purchasing a 70 per cent stake
in the troubled airline for USDollars 26.25m, asked for more time to study
the company's operations and plan its development, said Mr Horace Clarke,
Jamaica's transport minister.
The government would operate the airline until September 30, and the new
owners would take over on October 1, he said.
The delay followed the departure from the consortium of Cochrane Investments
of Toronto, which was to have taken about a quarter of the consortium's
stake. Two local investors, who were to have bought a 5 per cent interest,
have also pulled out.
Their combined 30 per cent stake has been taken up by Mr Gordon Stewart, a
leading hotelier in the Caribbean.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Garza's Cuban venture gives his
empire a new look - The Mexican businessman is planning to invest about
Dollars 2.2bn in the island's telephone system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From his modest offices above a Citibank branch in Monterrey, Mexico, Mr
Javier Garza Calderon casually explains how he and his partners plan to
invest about Dollars 10bn in Mexico and Cuba over the next few years.
About Dollars 2.2bn will be spent on Cuba's national telephone system, 49
per cent of which he bought a couple of weeks ago. Another Dollars 4.2bn
will be invested in telecommunications and television in Mexico.
The rest will go in mobile energy plants for Mexican businesses, toxic and
non-toxic waste dumps, water treatment plants, and other environmental
projects.
Such talk may seem fanciful, but Mr Garza has plenty of money and is
politically well-connected.
He is a member of the wealthy Garza family of Monterrey, and he and his
father recently sold their 47 per cent stake in Grupo Visa, one of Mexico's
largest conglomerates, for a reported Dollars 400m.
They disposed of 28 supermarkets, other real estate and agriculture assets,
and sold their interest in a cellular telephone company for a reported
Dollars 100m.
'We decided to get out of mature markets that my family was in and invest in
new-age industries,' explains the 44-year-old Mr Garza. He says his Grupo
Domos has about Dollars 1bn of capital, much of which appears to be in cash.
Mr Garza has something to prove. He and his father sold the stake in Visa
after losing a takeover battle with their cousin, Mr Eugenio Garza Laguera.
The two failed to obtain Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), bidding slightly less
than the winner (a group led by Mr Carlos Slim) when the utility was
privatised.
Some suggest Mr Garza is throwing his money around to show that he can be as
successful as some of his relatives.
'He is desperate to put his footprint on the Monterrey scene,' says an
executive with a rival family company. 'Right now he is just known for being
his father's son and a friend of the president.'
Mr Garza is looking for partners in his businesses, to provide both equity
and expertise. He has signed joint ventures with Houston-based Browning
Ferries Industries (BFI), the world's second-largest waste management
company; BellSouth, in wireless telephone systems; Southern Pacific, in a
private telephone network; and expects to announce soon his partner or
partners for a long-distance telephone service.
'What we provide is experience in doing business in Mexico, relations with
the public and private sector, knowledge of the labour market which goes
back 100 years, and capital,' says Mr Garza. He adds that he has about 200
to 300 people working with him, but says he cannot recall the exact number
because the business is growing so fast.
The Cuba investment is perhaps the most ambitious.
Mr Garza says he first considered doing business in Cuba about four years
ago.
In January this year, when Iusacell, a Mexican telecommunications company,
pulled out of a deal to buy a stake in Emtel, Cuba's telephone company, he
agreed to take its place. Grupo Domos agreed to pay Dollars 1.44bn for 49
per cent of the company, of which about Dollars 200m will be obtained in a
swap deal liquidating Cuba's debt with Mexico.
Domos will invest another Dollars 734m over seven years in modernising the
company, a sum to be matched by Emtel. Domos hopes this month to sell 49 per
cent of its stake to a foreign partner. Three European companies and one
Canadian company have shown interest.
Mr Garza claims revenues from international telephone calls will pay for his
investment.
He says such calls generate about Dollars 400m a year, but will increase
once the US, as agreed in principle, lifts the ban on dollar payments to
Cuba for telephone calls, and when, as promised, a fibre-optic cable is
built between Florida and Cuba. Currently most calls between the US and Cuba
are made via Canada.
Domos and Emtel promise to install about 1m new telephone lines within seven
years, more than double the existing number.
Mr Garza says the company will use so-called personal communications systems
(PCS), or cellular wireless technology, when installing the lines, which
will cut sharply the cost of local networks.
'Cuba will be the first country in the America to have PCS,' he claims.
In Mexico, Mr Garza is confident there is room for at least three
telecommunications companies the size of Telmex.
If given regulatory go-ahead, he plans to invest Dollars 2.5bn in building a
long-distance network to compete with Telmex, Dollars 1.2bn in establishing
a personal communications system, and another Dollars 340m in building a
private network alongside Mexico's railway tracks.
Undeterred that at least half a dozen other companies have similar plans, Mr
Garza says he is willing to work with rivals.
He is in talks about joining forces with Pulsar and Alfa, two Monterrey
companies controlled by relatives. He says he is discussing with other
rivals ways of avoiding duplicating their investments by sharing cables.
After talking about his investments for several hours, Mr Garza compares
himself to Isaac Garza, his great grandfather who began what became the
Monterrey group, once Mexico's largest industrial concern.
Mr Garza has yet to run a large company, and his businesses are mostly
plans, but there can be little doubt he is thinking big.

Renong, a Malaysian investment holding company, and Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
one of Indonesia's largest state-controlled banks, are investing USDollars
100m to set up an Indonesian venture capital company to be called P. T.
Malindo Ventura Nusantara.
The deal brings together two large and well-connected groups to invest in
medium-sized companies. Renong's wholly-owned subsidiary, Renong Nusantara,
will have a 50 per cent stake in the company, whilst Bank Rakyat Indonesia
will have 43 per cent. Indonesian enterprises and individuals will hold the
remaining 7 per cent.
The deal highlights growing business ties between Malaysia and Indonesia. In
June, Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an Indonesian businessman, announced plans to
list his non-Indonesian timber-related assets on the Kuala Lumpur stock
exchange through a USDollars 1bn reverse take-over of Construction &amp;
Supplies House, a building supplies company.
The investment presented an avenue for Renong to participate in the growing
Indonesian economy, said Mr Raja Aman Ahmad, Renong Nusantara's chairman,
However, analysts said investment commitments were small with profits
expected only in the longer term.

<TEXT>
Mr Paul Reichmann's efforts to resurrect his family's property empire took
another step forward with the appointment of two experienced executives to
senior posts in recently-formed Reichmann companies.
Mr Evan Marks, a close adviser to financier Mr George Soros, has been named
chief executive of Reichmann International, the New York-based partnership
between Mr Soros and the Reichmann family. Reichmann International acts as
an adviser to Mr Soros's Quantum Realty Fund.
Mr Vernon Schwartz, former president of Catellus Development, a large
California-based developer in which Reichmann-owned Olympia &amp; York had a 15
per cent stake, was recently appointed to head Reichmann International
Mexico.
The Mexican company, which is also a joint venture between the Reichmanns
and Mr Soros, is about to begin construction of a USDollars 500m development
on the western outskirts of Mexico City and a Dollars 250m downtown office
tower.
Mr Schwartz, who will be based in Toronto, will also become chief executive
of a new Reichmann-owned company, as yet unnamed, which will oversee the
family's interests.
The new Reichmann business operates from the same offices in Toronto
occupied by Olympia &amp; York before it collapsed two years ago.
Mr Paul Reichmann, with brother Albert still at his side, has recruited
about a dozen executives. Among the recent arrivals is Mr Donald McCutchan,
formerly Canada's ambassador to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: BHP eyes potential in power
generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, chief exec-utive of Broken Hill Proprietary, said
yesterday that the large Australian steel and resources group had the
financial strength to undertake a large acquisition should a suitable
opportunity arise.
At the the company's annual presentation, following the release of year-end
results on Friday, analysts were also told that BHP was anxious to avoid
seeing gearing drop to a point where it had 'a lazy balance sheet'.
BHP gave no firm indications of what deals it might entertain, but a number
of executives - including Mr Prescott - stressed the potential which the
group saw in the power generation business, especially in Asia and South
America, and in the continued diversification of both its minerals and
petroleum divisions.
Mr Jerry Ellis, executive general manager of the BHP minerals unit, said
later that the former division was aiming to double profit by the year 2000.
Mr Prescott also stressed again that BHP planned to hold its minority stake
in Foster's Brewing Company, the Australian brewery group which owns Courage
in the UK, for the long-term.
Star Mining, the Australian exploration company, plans to contribute a
further USDollars 5m to the 'charter capital' of Lenzoloto, the
state-controlled Siberian gold mining company with which it hopes jointly to
develop the large Sukhoi Log gold project.
The additional investment follows written confirmation from GKI, the Russian
government agency, that a decree has been drawn up resolving the future
structure of Lenzoloto.
Star will be the joint stock company's foreign investor, with a one-third
stake. The Irkutsk government and the Russian ministry of atomic energy will
also become shareholders.
Star's ultimate plan is to raise Lenzoloto's annual gold production from
350,000 ounces at present, to around 2m ounces in six years. The
Australian-listed company is expected to arrange for injection of around
USDollars 250m in order to achieve this.

companies
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, yesterday unveiled plans to
merge his two quoted companies - Nine Network, the television group, and
Australian Consolidated Press, the magazines and publishing business - into
one listed entity with an estimated market capitalisation of more than
ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.4bn).
The deal will be effected by schemes of arrangements, between Nine and its
shareholders, and between ACP and its investors. These will give ACP
shareholders one preferred share in Nine for each ACP share held, and allow
ACP to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nine.
Once the transaction is complete, Nine will comprise three divisions - ACP,
Nine Network, and investments - and have shareholders' funds of about
ADollars 1.7bn. Mr Packer will become chairman, and Mr Brian Powers managing
director. Mr Bruce Gyngell will continue to head the television business,
while Mr Nick Falloon will be finance director for the combined group.
The Packer companies yesterday estimated that market capitalisation of the
combined group would be about ADollars 2.3bn. The deal is conditional on
approvals from ACP and Nine shareholders, other than Mr Packer's
privately-owned Consolidated Press group which has substantial minority
stakes in both groups.
Mr Packer claimed that the merger would bring joint marketing opportunities
and that the increased size of the group would allow it to pursue
acquisitions more easily. Shares in the combined group would also have
greater liquidity: 'With Conspress holding substantial stakes in both ACP
and Nine, the restricted size of the public shareholding . . . has been a
concern in the marketplace,' he commented. ConsPress will hold 45.7 per cent
of the combined group.
The new preferred shares in Nine will have the same rights as existing
ordinary shares in Nine, but will also carry a preferential right to a
minimum annual dividend of 24 cents for the 1994 and 1995 financial years.
Nine's current annual dividend is 14 cents. ACP shareholders will also
receive a 10 cent final dividend making a total of 24 cents for 1994.

Improved sales and rising pineapple prices helped Del Monte Royal Foods
(Delfood), the South Africa-based international fruit products company, to
achieve a 9.5 per cent rise in first-half attributable earnings to R90.1m
(Dollars 24.7m) against R82.2m for the corresponding period last year.
Although conditions remained difficult in the first quarter, sales volumes
rose significantly in the second quarter and turnover rose 8 per cent to
R701.1m from R651.3m. However, operating income at R110.75m was only
slightly up from R110.23 a year ago.
A dividend of 8.5 cents, up from 8 cents, was declared. Interest charges
rose to R27.9m from R20.5m due to temporary working capital requirements,
but this was offset by a substantial drop in tax to R1.47m from R17.52m.
Delfood says it anticipates further improvement on last year's figures due
to the growing economic recovery in main markets, and it has expanded into
new products and new geographic regions over the past six months.
New projects have included entry into Spain and Portugal, expansion in
France and the UK, and licensing agreements to launch a full product range
in Israel and fruit juices in Saudi Arabia.

RWE, Germany's largest utility, yesterday said profits for the year ended
June would improve 'slightly' on the previous year's earnings of DM881m
(Dollars 540.4m) and forecast strong earnings in the coming year from new
telecommunications business.
The electricity group said it was likely to increase its DM12 dividend for
1993-94 but gave no further details. Group turnover last year rose 5.2 per
cent to DM55.8bn with foreign turnover making up 17.3 per cent.
RWE said the improved turnover was due to the first-time consolidation of
several companies in to the mineral resources and chemicals divisions.
Turnover would have risen 2.5 per cent without the consolidation measures.
The group said its worst results came from its waste management activities,
where it made an unspecified loss which it blamed on competition and
technical problems. Waste management is the smallest of the group's six
divisions, but turnover rose 41.7 per cent to DM1bn, up from DM0.7bn the
year before.
A consortium led by RWE won a bid for a data transmission network, pitching
the Essen-based group in to the rapidly expanding market, estimated to be
worth DM2bn annually.
Sales of oils and chemicals, the group's largest division, 'improved
significantly', helped by stronger demand in eastern Germany. Profit margins
in refining had improved but margins on oil sales were 'unsatisfactory'.
The group spent a record DM7.1bn, mainly on regional power utilities in the
five eastern Lander where it is now a significant operator. Electricity
sales, though, rose only slightly due to slack demand as German industry
pulled out of its worst post-war recession.
Hochtief, the construction subsidiary, also spent an unspecified amount to
take an almost 50 per cent stake in Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction
group.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Western Union banks on a rapid
transfer - The movement of cash is expanding in emerging economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For generations of Americans, Western Union means money in a hurry,
especially to the 25 per cent of the US population without a bank account.
The company, now owned by New Valley Corporation, enjoys a 90 per cent share
of the US market for rapid cash transfers.
Many of America's unbanked, mainly lower paid or irregular workers, are
immigrants for whom low hassle cash transfer provides the basic service they
most want - a fast, sure way of transferring cash to the family back home.
Five years ago the growth in demand for cash transfers from the US to
Mexico, Puerto Rico and other countries with large migrant populations
alerted the company to the wider potential in servicing ethnic communities
around the world.
Starting with Central America the company has rapidly expanded operations to
the rest of Latin America, the Far East, Africa and the Middle East, so
adding a new dimension to its traditional overseas operations - providing
emergency cash transfers to tourists and others, including US military
personnel, businessmen and students.
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-integration of the former
communist states into the global economy, provided another opportunity to
expand operations and acquire the capacity to transfer funds globally.
The company now operates in eight of the former Soviet republics and all
three Baltic states. This week it added Slovenia and Hungary, bringing to 75
the number of countries served by Western Union Financial Services
International (WUFSI), a subsidiary set up up four years ago to develop the
company's overseas interests.
International operations are both fast-growing and profitable. Last year the
company handled over 18m individual transfers involving more than Dollars
5bn. Operating profits rose to Dollars 101m from Dollars 90m on revenues of
Dollars 438m up from Dollars 401m. This year turnover is expected to exceed
Dollars 500m.
In London for a board meeting last week Mr Paul Vornle, president of WUFSI,
said the company intended to be operational in 100 countries by the end of
this year. It is negotiating to open up in potentially the biggest market of
all, the unbanked millions of far-flung China plus the flow of remittances
from the many millions of overseas Chinese.
The numbers involved in these ethnic niche markets, can be substantial, like
the near 4m Filipinos in the US or the 300,000 Albanian 'boat people' who
fled as penniless refugees from the collapsing communist dictatorship in
1991 but last year sent Dollars 330m back to relatives. Millions of overseas
Indians, including the discreet and wealthy Indian population in South
Africa, as well as the UK, the US and Africa have also become an important
target market as Western Union goes global.
But, as the company's recent rapid growth in Europe testifies, there is
still plenty of scope for growth even in relatively sophisticated markets.
'A recent European Commission study on the European banking system strongly
criticised the cost and inefficiency of money transfers through the banking
system. We pay out within minutes of funds being placed with us. It can't
get lost. Each transaction is separate and the cash can only be in two
places - either with Western Union or in the hands of the client,' says Mr
Vornle. 'We do not transfer money, just information,' he adds.
The simplicity of the transaction - a sender deposits cash at one of 24,000
money transfer locations worldwide for a recipient to pick up in local
currency and with the minimum of form-filling - requires as many branches as
possible which can be relied upon to keep sufficient sums of cash on hand
and remain open for as long as possible.
The company has set up its black and yellow nameplate in supermarkets,
street-corner stores, military bases, student unions and other sites
accessible to long-distance workers as the inevitable annual crop of
tourists who lose their wallets or need immediate cash from home for any
number of different reasons.
It also works closely with credit card companies which are fast extending
their operations to former unbanked areas such as the former Soviet bloc.
Visa, for example, which has worked with Western Union for 15 years, has
introduced its credit cards to Latvia, Belarus, Estonia and Uzbekistan over
the past month alone.
In Russia, virtually unbanked five years ago, apart from thousands of
primitive savings bank branches, WUFSI chose Mezheconomsberbank, the
Moscow-based International joint Stock Bank of Savings Banks, as its joint
venture partner two years ago.
'The bank has 47 locations all over the former Soviet Union at which it is
possible to transfer and receive cash, and this will be up to 100 by the end
of the year,' says Mr Vladimir Kolbaev, chairman of the bank, which has the
savings banks from 13 former Soviet republics and nine of the biggest
Russian commercial banks among its shareholders.
'We started working with Western Union in 1991 because we believed we could
do profitable business if it was well organised, and so it proved,' Mr
Kolbaev says. 'We not only transfer funds into Russia but also transfer
substantial amounts of roubles abroad for commercial companies as well as
individuals,' he adds.
Funds transferred in this way make up only a small part of the Dollars 15bn
to Dollars 20bn annually which left Russia clandestinely over the past two
years. But with so much Russian money now in Russian-owned accounts in
western banks, and with most Russian banks enjoying an unenviable reputation
for losing and misplacing funds, the scope for money transfers through the
Western Union system is expanding fast.
To ensure that its fast cash, few questions asked facilities do not attract
money-launderers, Western Union keeps a small army of former secret service
agents on the payroll - and US transfers have to abide by the general rule
that all cash transactions over Dollars 10,000 have to be notified to the
Internal Revenue Service.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: AGF privatisation to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France plans to proceed with the privatisation this autumn of Assurances
Generales de France (AGF), the country's third-largest insurer, in spite of
the recent weakness of the Paris stock market, according to Mr Antoine
Jeancourt-Gagliani, AGF chairman.
AGF, like many French companies, has suffered a steep slide in its share
price this year. However, Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani stressed in a French press
interview that the 30 per cent fall in the value of its shares was
'identical to that of other insurers' and was 'not a sufficient reason for
postponing privatisation'.
Speculation has mounted that the government, which has already privatised a
number of large financial groups, might be forced to delay the AGF issue due
to adverse market conditions.
However Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani said he had received 'total confirmation' that
the government intended to proceed with the share sale this autumn as
planned.
AGF was earmarked for privatisation in the mid-1980s by the last French
centre-right government, but the issue was put off after the stock market
crash in October 1987. Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani said the group had 'suffered
greatly' due to that delay.
He also sought to allay concern about AGF's financial performance by denying
rumours that it had lost money from bond futures trading on the Matif, the
Paris futures market.
'AGF has not made a loss on the Matif for the good reason that it is not a
player in that market, except in a marginal way for some funds,' Mr
Jeancourt-Gagliani said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Burda confirms move to take
stake in Vox
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Burda, the German magazine publishing group, confirmed yesterday that it was
negotiating to acquire a 25.1 per cent stake in the ailing Vox television
station, to join Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the Bertelsmann
media group as a leading shareholder.
The company said it was negotiating with state regulators in North
Rhine-Westphalia to acquire 'a relatively big interest' in the station,
which went into liquidation earlier this year.
If successful, the move would bring back together the Murdoch group and
Burda, which publishes fashion and popular magazines, as well as the
conservative weekly magazine Focus.
It would also appear to rule out a participation by the Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), which jointly owns RTL, Germany's
most profitable private broadcaster, with Bertelsmann. CLT had been rumoured
to be bidding for a stake.
However, the takeover by the Murdoch group of its controlling stake in the
television station could run into problems, notably potential infringement
of Germany's strict broadcasting regula-tions.
Bertelsmann has been involved in an urgent exercise to save the station and
its potentially lucrative access to the cable and satellite television
market in Germany, since the original shareholders pulled out earlier this
year. The station has continued to broadcast with a skeleton staff in order
to maintain its broadcasting licence.
Now Mr Friedrich Nowottny, director-general of Westdeutscher Rundfunk, the
main public television broadcaster based, like Vox, in Cologne, has demanded
that Vox should lose its broadcasting licence, in view of the dissolution of
its original shareholding.
Meanwhile, Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive of Bertelsmann, confirmed in an
interview published yesterday that his company had suffered a loss of around
DM450m (Dollars 276m) because of its Vox participation, of which DM350m
would be charged to the accounts in the current year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca del Gottardo, the Swiss bank controlled by Sumitomo Bank of Japan,
yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in non-consolidated cash flow in the
first half to SFr67.8m, (Dollars 49.4m) and made an optimistic forecast
about earnings for the full year.
The bank, which is aiming to place 100,000 existing participation
certificates in the next few days, said revenues from asset management were
up 18 per cent while those from stock trading and new-issue commission
income were up 11 per cent. No figures were given.
Foreign exchange activity remained at the levels achieved last year but
income from lending and securities investment was down.
The 3 per cent rise in costs was in line with expectations.
Gottardo said its affiliates also reported positive results, especially
InterEuropa SIM in Milan, Banque du Gotthard (Monaco) and Gotthardfin in the
Cayman Islands.
The bank said prospects for the full year were 'moderately positive'
considering the uncertainties in foreign exchange and financial markets and
questions over the trend of interest rates.
At the end of June, Gottardo's assets stood at SFr7.74bn compared with
SFr7.59bn at the end of 1993.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holmes Protection, the US security group which is quoted in the UK, has
signed an agreement with HP Partners LP, under which HP will invest Dollars
10m (Pounds 6.5m) in Holmes.
HP - a New York-based partnership formed specifically to make this
investment - will receive in exchange 21.2m shares of common stock at 47.1
cents each and 9.6m warrants, each to purchase one share of common stock at
32.7 cents.
The transaction will give HP a 34 per cent stake in the company. The
proceeds will be used to meet liabilities and particularly to repay Holmes'
Dollars 3m short term bank debt.
Holmes has agreed to seek a listing on Nasdaq and intends to delist its
shares from London once the US listing is effective and taking account of
access of existing stockholders to a public trading market.
In its results for the 1993 year, announced yesterday, Holmes reported a
fall in pre-tax profit from Dollars 4.18m to Dollars 503,000 on turnover
down from Dollars 56.2m to Dollars 53m. First quarter 1994 profits, however,
were little changed at Dollars 338,000 (Dollars 345,000), on Dollars 12.9m
(Dollars 13.7m) turnover.

CE Heath, the insurance broker, has reached a conditional agreement to sell
its underwriting subsidiary, Heath Australia, for ADollars 1m (Pounds
400,000) after increasing reserves against further losses by more than
Pounds 8m.
The deal is designed to draw a line under the losses from Australian
underwriting operations which have marred results recently.
It will reduce pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1994 to Pounds
3.84m, compared with a preliminary figure announced last month of Pounds
11.8m.
But Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, said 'shareholders will be far
better served by the elimination of any further exposure to losses. The
additional exceptional loss of Pounds 8m is considered to be a a worthwhile
cost of achieving certainty.'
Heath Australia, which is no longer underwriting new business, is to be
acquired by CE Heath International Holdings, an independently listed group
in which Heath owns a 23 per cent stake.

On turnover of Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.96m), pre-tax profits for the six

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Carclo shows 50% advance to Pounds 12.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carclo Engineering boosted pre-tax profits by 50 per cent, from Pounds 8.6m
to Pounds 12.9m, for the 12 months to March 31 1994.
The Sheffield-based steel and specialist engineering concern is raising its
final dividend from 6.8p to 7.2p.
The sharp rise in profits was due mainly to a stronger than expected
performance at Arthur Lee, the steel and plastic products group acquired in
June last year.
As a consequence, group turnover jumped by 81 per cent, from Pounds 84.4m to
Pounds 153m.
During the period, which included the pre-acquisition period, the Arthur Lee
division lifted operating profit by 66 per cent to Pounds 7.3m on an 11 per
cent rise in turnover to Pounds 84.3m.
The best performance among the Lee businesses was in steel wire, where
improved margins contributed to a trebling of operating profit to Pounds
1.5m.
Steel profits more than doubled to Pounds 3.9m, but plastics profits fell 8
per cent to Pounds 1.8m.
The performance of Carclo's other main businesses was mixed. The card
clothing division suffered a 24 per cent fall in operating profit to Pounds
2.4m, reflecting continuing recession in the textile industry.
The wire division, in contrast, lifted profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 2m,
while general engineering profits improved by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9m.
The increased final dividend takes the total for the year to 9.1p (8.6p),
covered 1.73 times by earnings per share ahead from 14.6p to 15.7p in spite
of a sharply increased share capital.
Year-end net borrowing, at Pounds 2.2m, amounted to 3.1 per cent of
shareholders' funds, which increased from Pounds 45m to Pounds 71m during
the year.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the enlarged group's order intake in opening
quarter of the current year compared favourably with the same period a year
ago, in spite of difficult trading conditions in some markets.

The performance of Carclo's Arthur Lee steel and plastic products division
inevitably dominated yesterday's results.
But Mr John Ewart, Carclo's sprightly 70-year-old chairman, says last
summer's Pounds 55m merger means much more than a short-term boost to
profits.
The agreed takeover of Arthur Lee has nearly doubled the engineering group's
size and raised its profile in the City.
In the long term it will be the company's most important move since it took
over the English Card Clothing Company - a rival producer of card clothing,
the consumable teeth used in carding machines to comb fibre - in 1979.
Mr Ewart sees the merger as a key move in Carclo's strategy of increasing
the real value of assets and earnings per share by owning and developing
niche engineering businesses.
He gives a number of reasons why Carclo spent three years stalking Arthur
Lee.
First, he says, 'it is extremely difficult to find good niche businesses,
and Arthur Lee was the jewel in the crown of Yorkshire business'.
Also, Lee had a specialist wire rope business, John Shaw. This and Bruntons
at Carclo were the UK's two biggest manufacturers after Bridon, the market
leader.
The sector had suffered in the recession and it made sense to bring the two
second runners together, says Mr Ewart.
And, along with the specialist steel strip business for which Lee was best
known, it had also built up a good position in plastics.
The hunt for Lee began in 1990. Carclo had sold Jonas Woodhead's springs and
forgings business to Hoesch of Germany for Pounds 21.3m and began buying
shares in Lee.
Two years later, it took its stake to 29.9 per cent, thus clearly signalling
its intentions without having to make a full bid, by buying a 22 per cent
stake from GM Firth. After some three months of tough bargaining an agreed
deal was announced in May last year.
The 7-for-9 share offer with a cash alternative was carefully structured to
keep both sides happy. It also compensated Lee shareholders for losing
control just as market conditions were picking up.
'Arthur Lee had gone through a bad patch but was recovering rapidly,' says
Mr Ewart.
The bidder also had to recognise it would be buying Lee after the bulk of
much-needed restructuring work had been completed.
'We had done an enormous amount of rationalisation,' says Mr Peter Lee,
former chairman at Lee and now deputy chairman at Carclo.
On the steel side, Lee sold its bright bar business to United Engineering
Steels in 1992, and over the past two years has completely revised wages and
incentives.
The plastics side has also been rationalised from four to two businesses,
serving the medical and consumer electronics sectors.
The rationalisation explains why the merger has not been followed by heavy
wielding of the hatchet.
The two companies employed a workforce of 2,822 before the deal, and the
combined total now is down by only 70.
This was partly due to the transfer of wiremaking from Bruntons in Edinburgh
to Smiths in Halifax. The rest of the cuts mainly resulted from moving
Carclo's head office into Lee's Sheffield headquarters.
The merged company is already benefiting from such savings and from its
increased buying power for steel and energy. Analysts believe the company is
likely to see further benefits emerge over the next two years from closer
working arrangements between the reorganised businesses.
Carclo is also starting to reap the benefits from capital investment which
had been implemented or planned before the merger.
Gill's Cables, part of the general engineering division, is a recent
beneficiary, while ECC's manufacturing efficiency has been increased by
moving from its old site in Huddersfield to an adjacent building. The move
did cause some disruption, however, which contributed to the fall in the
division's 1993-94 profits.
The Lee steel strip business has spent some Pounds 5m since 1990 on new
equipment.
That excludes a Pounds 2.25m 'stretch bend leveller' which was rolled into
place this weekend. This is crucial to Lee's plans to expand its presence in
markets where near-perfect flatness of strip steel is paramount, such as the
springs on floppy disks.
In the medium term, the Lee takeover is also important because growth
prospects look stronger in its businesses.
In steel strip, world demand for stainless steel is expected to grow at 5
per cent a year into the next decade, with growth in flat cold-rolled
stainless exceeding that.
Stainless accounts for 61 per cent of Lee Steel Strip's 'prime' sales
(excluding tonnage processed for other companies).
The remaining 39 per cent of the business is in a specialised form of high
carbon steel, with which Lee has become world leader in the production of
steel for seat belt springs.
Elsewhere, immediate prospects vary. Card clothing may not have been
'jumping ahead' recently, said Mr Ewart, but it is a relatively high margin
business where entry costs are high and Carclo is one of a handful of world
competitors.
In the wire division, companies such as Joseph Sykes are thriving by
concentrating on speciality wire. Sykes has become one of the world leaders
in nylon-covered wires and is very export-oriented. Still to come, Mr Ewart
hints, could be one or two add-on acquisitions in the core businesses,
possibly in continental Europe where possible candidates have already been
visited.
Some tidying up is also likely, and the company could raise Pounds 15m from
sales of surplus property and non-core businesses such as steel
stockholding.

FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fyffes edges ahead to IPounds
14.2m - IPounds 16m acquisition announced / Some IPounds 40m earmarked for
further expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp drop in interest income held back profits growth at Fyffes, the
European fruit and vegetable distributor, which reported pre-tax profits
ahead by just Pounds 57,000 to IPounds 14.2m (Pounds 14m) on turnover up 38
per cent to IPounds 368m for the six months to April 30.
Interest income fell from IPounds 6.62m to IPounds 3.36m because of lower
interest rates, but operating profits from trading were lifted 44 per cent
to IPounds 10.8m, largely due to the group's two acquisitions in Denmark and
Spain last year.
Mr Carl McCann, deputy chairman, said that some 50 per cent of the group's
net cash of IPounds 80m will be spent on capital investment and acquisitions
this year.
The first of these, announced yesterday, is a 50 per cent stake in Velleman
&amp; Tas, a leading banana and fresh produce distributor in the Netherlands for
a total consideration of IPounds 15.9m.
The move has been welcomed by market analysts in Dublin, who said that it
would lift group turnover to about IPounds 1bn on an annual basis, making
Fyffes the second biggest fruit distributor in Europe, and providing a
further outlet for new banana supplies coming on stream from Guatemala.
Mr McCann said that on the basis of Velleman's past performance, the
acquisition should boost Fyffes' operating profits by IPounds 3.5m over a
full year.
He said that although the net worth of Velleman at IPounds 8.6m 'is a bit on
the light side, we have bought it on a good (earnings) multiple of 4.5'.
The acquisition represents 'an important step for Fyffes in the development
of its continental European business,' the company said.
Earnings per share were 2.68p (2.75p) and the interim dividend is raised by
10 per cent to 0.4294p.
COMMENT
The cash hoard which Fyffes has been sitting on for the past three years was
good for the bottom line while interest rates were high, but has predictably
hit profits now that rates are close to historic lows. It is encouraging,
therefore, that the group is delivering on its promise to spend its treasure
chest on earnings-enhancing acquisitions and is steadily building its market
presence in Europe. If it can break into the French, German and Italian
markets with subsequent acquisitions - and it has the wherewithal to do so -
Fyffes will then have significant market power on the Continent to take on
the likes of Chiquita and Dole. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 34m for the
full-year look achievable. Given the encouraging profit outlook this year
and next, the shares are on a modest prospective p/e of 13.4.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Debt forgiveness helps put TBI Pounds 22.5m
in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TBI, the property investment and development company acquired by Markheath
in a reverse takeover in March, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22.5m in
the year to March 31.
The results were distorted by the restructuring and debt forgiveness of
Pounds 27.2m. Markheath, which suffered in the commercial property downturn,
was heavily indebted to banks led by Midland and ANZ. It incurred a restated
loss of Pounds 68.8m in 1992-93.
In the reconstruction, Markheath acquired Thomas Bailey Investments, a
private property company in south Wales. The estimated net asset value at
completion of Thomas Bailey was about Pounds 7.2m, which was satisfied by
the issue of 37m new ordinary shares.
In addition, Markheath raised Pounds 24.1m via a share placing and open
offer. The company then changed its name to TBI and is now based in Cardiff
and London.
A one-off payment of Pounds 47m has been made to creditor banks and Pounds
27.2m written off. In addition to the new equity, about Pounds 25m of new
debt was raised with Barclays.
Mr Michael Rendle, chairman, said the balance sheet now indicated a company
of substance with net assets of Pounds 41.7m. 'Interest costs and overheads
are now more than covered by our rental income and we can address the future
with renewed confidence.' The property portfolio was valued at Pounds 96.5m
with annualised rental income of about Pounds 7m.
Earnings per share were 18.42p after debt forgiveness. Before, there were
losses of 3.88p (55.29p losses). No dividend is proposed but Mr Rendle said
the board intended to pay dividends at the earliest possible opportunity.
Mr Paul Guy, chief executive, said: 'There is a very good base to take the
company forward. We intend very much to be extremely active with regard to
acquisitions and disposals.'
One property, at Bridgend in south Wales, had recently been sold for Pounds
4.1m when it was in the books at Pounds 2.7m, he said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates reveals plan to delist
Bredero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Bredero Properties, the property developer, are looking to
British Land for a lead in how to react to the news that Slough Estates will
delist Bredero after the close of the current privatisation offer, on July
29.
British Land recently purchased a 6.9 cent stake in Bredero, and is refusing
to comment on its plans. However, it is unlikely to want to emerge as a
passive investor in a private company.
Slough made its 10p a share offer on May 26 (when the share price was 15p),
but at the initial close on June 17, it had acceptances from only 6.76 per
cent of outside shareholders, adding to its existing 49.5 per cent stake.
Mr Trevor Brown, who owns more than 4 per cent of Bredero's shares,
described the move to delist as 'blatant bullying'. However, under Stock
Exchange regulations, directors do nor require shareholders's approval for
such a move.
Slough said it will not increase its offer, but Mr Derek Wilson, group
managing director, denied that the threat of delisting was a means of
pushing shareholders into accepting the offer. 'The company, as it stands at
the moment, is finished. It has no income-bearing assets, and the overhead
needs to be reduced.'
Smaller shareholders may be discouraged from retaining shares in a private
company, but marketmakers have said they would trade shares on a matched
bargain basis, assuming that there remains a substantial minority
shareholding.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 109,500 bonus for Steel chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, received a
Pounds 109,500 performance-related bonus for the 1994 fiscal year, when the
company bounced back into profit after two years of losses.
The bonus, detailed in the group's annual report, formed part of Pounds
389,667 in performance-related payments to British Steel's seven executive
directors for the year ended April 2.
British Steel paid no bonuses under the scheme for executive directors in
the previous two years, when pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 204m.
Last month, however, it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m for the year
to end-April.
Excluding the bonus, Mr Moffat received Pounds 386,690 in salary and related
benefits, compared with Pounds 321,630 in the previous year.
The rise reflects his appointment in May last year as chairman, in addition
to his role as chief executive.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Smiths Industries expands third leg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries, best known for aerospace and medical products, has
enlarged its industrial group with a third acquisition in that area this
year.
Smiths has paid Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m) cash for Dura-Vent, a
privately-owned US ducting business in Indiana which makes fume extraction
products for industrial process machinery.
The deal brings Smiths' spending on industrial acquisitions this year to
Pounds 34m, and to almost Pounds 130m over the past three years.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This shows the
industrial group's growing significance alongside our two other businesses,
aerospace electronics and medical systems.
'We have demonstrated our ability both to identify niche businesses, which
have an established position in their particular markets and to integrate
them quickly with our existing activities. Such acquisitions soon make a
positive contribution to the industrial group's strong performance, based on
high margins and excellent cashflow.'
The downturn in aerospace has caused profits from that division to be
overtaken by medical systems, although last year aerospace had sales of
Pounds 393m compared with Pounds 181m for medical systems.
Last month's Pounds 100m acquisition by Smiths of Deltec, a US medical
equipment manufacturer, will increase healthcare sales by more than a third.
The industrial group's annual sales are now running at more than Pounds
200m, including recent acquisitions.
Dura-Vent will be integrated into Flexible Technologies, Smiths' existing
hosing and ducting business in North America.
In April, Smiths paid Pounds 21.6m for Totco, the US heating element
company, and in May bought Elkay Electrical, based in Newtown, Wales, for
Pounds 6m.
Since 1991, when it acquired Flexible Technologies, Smiths has invested
almost Pounds 130m on acquisitions for the industrial group. The largest was
Vent-Axia, the UK-based ventilation business bought from APV for Pounds
55.8m in 1992.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MFI expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI plans to add 20 stores to its 46-strong chain of kitchen and bedroom
furniture shops in France this year. The company is looking at further
expansion into Spain and Portugal.
MFI has been in France for 10 years, and picked up seven stores with its
Hygena acquisition in 1987.
'We accelerated last year, adding a net nine new stores, and were delighted
with the results. We seem to have a format that works,' said Mr Derek Hunt,
chairman.
That format is of stores much smaller than MFI's in the UK, but selling
mainly UK-manufactured products.
'I enjoy going into the stores and knowing that the kitchens they are buying
were made in Hull,' said Mr Hunt. Last year French sales grew by 33 per
cent, with like-for-like growth of 6 per cent. The operation broke even
after substantial store opening costs, and since 80 per cent of its sales
were manufactured in-house it made a contribution to group profits.
Most of the stores are in shopping malls.
COMMENT
MFI shares have had a nervous few weeks amid increasing signs of a slowdown
in the UK housing market. So it was the 13 per cent growth in sales since
the year-end which particularly reassured the City yesterday. Of course,
that may not last - MFI's markets remain fundamentally volatile. But it is
more adept than most at riding the swings and roundabouts. It is not a
company to sit back and rely on an economic upturn to generate continued
profits recovery. It is working hard on refining its formats and broadening
its product range while all the time chiselling away at costs. It still has
room to grow in the UK and it might even join the select band of British
retailers to make a go of it across the Channel. Assuming it can match last
year's profits, without the Pounds 19.6m Carpetright gain, the shares stand
on a forward multiple of about 14.5. Not expensive at this stage of the
cycle.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shareholders and creditors come to Camper's
rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camper and Nicholsons, the UK yacht builder, was saved from closure
yesterday.
Shareholders and creditors have agreed to a restructuring package.
Camper and Nicholsons had incurred trading losses of Pounds 1.66m over the
last three years.
The losses, which have been funded primarily by its Liberian-based parent
company Naiad Ship Finance Corporation, have been exacerbated by two bad
debts worth Pounds 720,000 which are subject to litigation.
Out of total liabilities of Pounds 4.3m, shareholders and associated
creditors were owed Pounds 3.4m and third party creditors Pounds 900,000.
The yacht-makers bankers are owed Pounds 250,000 but are not covered by the
deal.
The package was negotiated by the company's directors and corporate recovery
specialists from Coopers and Lybrand. The creditors agreed yesterday to the
voluntary arrangement drawn up by Coopers and Lybrand.
Under the voluntary arrangement, drawn up by Coopers and Lybrand, Naiad will
make a cash contribution of Pounds 250,000 to the creditors. This should
trigger a full recovery for the preferential creditors and 16p in the pound
for the unsecured creditors. This could rise to 60 per cent if the bad debts
are recovered and the company is sold within three years.
Camper and Nicholsons employs 115 people. It is no longer associated with
Camper and Nicholsons International, the yacht brokers.
Naiad, which has invested Pounds 8.5m in the company since gaining a 95 per
cent stake in 1982, will not reduce its shareholding under the deal but will
dispose of its shareholding if a buyer can be found.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Property flotation rests on
expectations being realised - The future over the past as 1980s developers
assume the reins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillar Property Investment, which issued its pathfinder prospectus
yesterday, is at an important crossroads which will inevitably colour
perceptions of its offer of up to Pounds 90m of shares.
Set up as a vulture fund to prey on institutional quality properties in the
collapsing market of 1991, it has built up a Pounds 352m investment
portfolio, under the guidance of Mr Robert Maxted, formerly a director of
Speyhawk, the collapsed property developer.
However, the company has taken on board two of the better-known developers
of the 1980s, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, and the story of
Pillar is now more about the future than the present.
The success of the flotation will depend on expectations that these two men
 -founders of the enormously successful Arlington Securities property
business - can deliver returns a second time.
Backers of Arlington should have fond memories of the Pounds 278m buy-out by
British Aerospace in 1989, but the new vehicle is very different.
When Pillar was set up, with the backing of British Aerospace, General
Electric of the US and Electra, it had detailed and demanding criteria for
investment in high grade property.
At present, 64 per cent of its properties are let to either FT-SE 100
companies or government bodies, and there is an average unexpired lease
length of 22 years.
More surprisingly, the company estimates that 85 per cent of its leases are
now at, or below, current market prices, indicating rental growth from the
anticipated upswing.
Pillar estimates that income from existing leases, even if none could be
renewed or increased, would exceed current interest and administration costs
until 2010.
The company is raising up to Pounds 50m in new money from the flotation  -
the additional shares will come from leading shareholders GE and Electra
while management will retain their 11 per cent stake. Debt will fall to
Pounds 166.6m, with gearing reduced from 168 per cent to 92 per cent,
improving interest cover from its Pounds 25.2m rent roll.
This provides an attractive, but not unique, investment base, and investor
interest will focus on the direction under Mr Mould and Mr Vaughan.
Their previous achievements has already won them one significant coup, the
tying up of a joint venture agreement with Canadian investment group Caisse
de depot et placement du Quebec.
The joint venture plans to invest up to Pounds 240m on shopping centres,
which will add to the 41 per cent of Pillar's portfolio that is already
retail.
The fact that the Canadians chose Pillar, when they could have picked almost
any partner, demonstrates confidence that the Arlington business park skills
are transferable.
The pricing is due to be announced on July 28. The company is expected to
have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 175m.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: National Parking bid faces referral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed bid for National Parking Corporation by a consortium of venture
capital investors led by Prudential, the UK insurance group, could trigger a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
National Parking, which owns National Car Parks and the fast-growing
National Breakdown Recovery service, disclosed last week that it was
involved in negotiations which might lead to a bid.
The talks concern the possible acquisition of the 64 per cent stake owned by
Sir Donald Gosling and Mr Ronald Hobson, the company's founders. Last week
National Parking's shares rose from 450p to 575p in over-the-counter
trading, valuing the private company at Pounds 675m.
The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.3m on turnover of Pounds 234m in
the year to March 26 1993, including profits of Pounds 31.1m on its parking
operations.
Despite the concern of the Consumers Association and motoring groups about
NCP's domination of private sector parking in the UK, the group has until
now remained outside the interests of the Office of Fair Trading, the
government's competition watchdog, because of a quirk in the law.
Under the terms of a 1937 court ruling, car park operators are not
considered to be providing either goods or services - instead they were
deemed to be issuing licences to park - and are, therefore, not subject to
competition legislation.
However, in the case of a bid different rules apply. The OFT confirmed that
it was examining the position to see if it had any 'interest or
jurisdiction' should a bid materialise for National Parking.
Under current legislation the OFT can recommend a reference to the MMC if a
merger means either that the resulting group controls more than a 25 per
cent market share, or because more than Pounds 70m of assets are involved.
In either case the OFT can decide to recommend a reference, although this
does not automatically trigger one. Market structure, the degree of
competition between the two companies before the merger, and competition
from other companies would also be considered.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wembley involved in refinancing talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, the City entrepreneurs, yesterday said
they were discussing a refinancing package with Wembley, the debt-burdened
stadium and greyhound track operator.
The pair have drawn up plans for a recapitalisation that would wipe out
Wembley's Pounds 152m net borrowing and could include a debt-for-equity
swap.
Their previous deals include the successful reverse takeover of PizzaExpress
and a discounted Pounds 1.8m rescue rights issue and debt-for-equity swap at
Cupid, the bridalwear group now known as Brackenbridge.
Wembley, however, is understood to be discussing possible deals with other
groups, and Charterhouse Bank, its adviser, said the board had not decided
on a particular route.
Separate talks are thought to be continuing with Live Entertainments, the
promotions business controlled by Mr Harvey Goldsmith, and Apollo Advisors,
the US investment group led by Mr Leon Black.
Wembley has faced pressure for a substantial refinancing following mounting
losses, which almost doubled from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m in the year
to December 31. The company, which repaid Pounds 40m to its lenders earlier
this year and is committed to a further debt reduction of up to Pounds 39.5m
by the year end, has blamed large property write-downs and over-expansion
for its problems.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Own goals keep the underdog in the game -
David Wighton analyses Lasmo's winning strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the City takes stock of Lasmo's victory over the bid from Enterprise Oil
last week, merchant bankers have been reaching for sporting metaphors. 'If
you'd asked me at the start, I'd have put more money on a Briton winning
Wimbledon,' said one. 'It was like Greece taking the World Cup,' suggested
another.
All agreed it was one of the most unexpected results to a big takeover
battle for years. And most agreed it was lost by Enterprise more than won by
Lasmo. 'Lasmo started off Love-40 down, but Enterprise served three double
faults,' said one independent investment banker.
He argues that the first was the original terms of the bid, which involved a
new class of Enterprise shares and warrants but no cash. 'That smacked of
over-confidence. The bid showed how a good defence can quickly undermine the
view of a good company and its paper.'
Enterprise went into the bid with as high a standing in the City as Lasmo's
was low. Yet the Lasmo defence managed to raise questions about its record,
particularly with its attack on Enterprise's accounting policies, and
undermined its share price.
A leading merchant banker said: 'Enterprise appeared unprepared for the
attack. Their advisers should have anticipated what the Lasmo accountants
would say and prepared a proper response.'
To be fair, Enterprise was rushed into unveiling the bid by Lasmo's rights
issue and the Takeover Panel, and the outcome shows how difficult it is to
recover from a bad start.
But independent observers believe it made a fundamental mistake by not
offering any element of cash from the start. 'I would never advise a client
to go into a hostile bid with none of its offer underwritten for cash at
all.'
The Enterprise camp argues that the initial bid was only an opening shot,
and that to underwrite it would have handed fees to the City for nothing. As
for the decision not to have any of the improved offer underwritten, there
is some disagreement whether Warburg, Enterprise's lead adviser, tried and
failed or never tried at all.
Either way there is general agreement that the lack of cash was a deciding
factor. 'Share-for-share offers are very difficult since improving the terms
for the target's shareholders harms the bidder's shareholders. You have to
have a very compelling commercial argument. Enterprise didn't, or at least
didn't manage to get it across.'
This is in contrast to the UK's last big hostile bid - Granada's successful
takeover of LWT - where there was both a convincing industrial case and
cash.
Perhaps the main lesson for other all paper bids is how tricky buying shares
in the market can be. The Takeover Code allows a bidder to buy up to 10 per
cent of the target's shares at a price not more than the value of the paper
offer.
The rule is a case where the Code allows the principle of equal treatment of
shareholders to be relaxed, but the reaction of institutions shows how
cherished this principle is. The institutions felt that the way Enterprise's
advisers handled the purchases was particularly unfair, although within the
rules. However it is unlikely that those that were not favoured rejected the
bid out of pique and more probable that Warburg unfortunately bought from
institutions that were going to accept anyway.
Whatever the truth, there is a growing feeling that the 10 per cent rule is
unsatisfactory and that the Takeover Panel may review its operation in
practice.
Although Warburg has come in for serious criticism, it can point to one
successful innovation in the bid. For the first time a UK company made a
hostile share offer available to the target's US investors. Hostile bids
involving the issue of shares are almost unheard of in the US because the
new shares have first to be registered with the SEC, a long and public
process.
Assisted by Davis, Polk and Wardwell, the New York law firm, Warburg managed
to compress into two weeks a process that usually takes at least two months,
persuading the SEC to review its registration statement in private. The
effort was worthwhile, with almost half Lasmo's US investors, who accounted
for 21 per cent of the shares, accepting the offer.
But the bid is likely to remembered less for this neat bit of footwork than
for the series of own goals. Enterprise and its advisers will be hoping the
City is more forgiving than Colombian football fans.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: British Bus consolidation move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bus, the Salisbury-based company, looks set to acquire two of the
companies formed as a result of the government's 1987 privatisation of the
National Bus Company, further consolidating the industry.
The company expects to sign a deal within the next two weeks to acquire
Proudmutual Transport Group. This comprises Northumbria Buses and Coaches
and Moor-Dale Coaches in north-east England, and Kentish Bus &amp; Coach, now
the largest independent operator for London Transport, in north-west Kent
and London.
It is also waiting to hear whether shareholders in the Luton &amp; District
group of companies, which operates in the north-west home counties, have
agreed its offer.
Luton and District's directors have said that with the industry
consolidating into 'four or five' large bus groups their business should
become part of such a group.
The price offered for the two groups has not been disclosed.
British Bus, which operates 2,700 vehicles and employs 5,000 staff, has an
annual turnover of more than Pounds 115m. It was formed in December 1992 by
a management buy-out of Drawlane Transport.
Proudmutual has an annual turnover of about Pounds 49m. It operates more
than 700 buses and coaches and has some 2,000 employees.
Luton &amp; District operates 500 buses and coaches and employs more than 1,200
people.
Last week Perth-based Stagecoach made a recommended Pounds 27.5m share offer
for Busways, the main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear, and Aberdeen-based
GRT made a recommended offer of Pounds 6.7m for Eastern Counties, which
serves the Norwich area.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach and Sheffield Mainline link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach has agreed to swap shares with Sheffield Mainline Partnership,
which was established in November through an employee buy-out from local
authorities in South Yorkshire.
Mainline has recommended its employees should vote for the deal, which
involves the exchange of 20 per cent of Mainline's enlarged equity for
500,000 Stagecoach shares.
Mainline said the proposal offered an opportunity to work with a leading bus
group, while retaining the principles embodied within its employee-owned
structure.
Stagecoach said the agreement would increase its involvement in one of
Britain's main metropolitan areas at a time of rapid development in the UK
bus industry.
Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said the agreement was a form of
courtship: if the relationship worked out, the larger group would eventually
seek full control of Mainline.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Coda share price falls 54p after Pounds
2.6m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Coda, the Harrogate-based accountancy software group, dropped 54p
to 168p after the company announced interim losses of Pounds 2.55m pre-tax
against profits of Pounds 427,000.
The company came to the market in February at 235p.
Directors said the outcome reflected factors beyond their control,
principally a 27 per cent slowdown in sales of licensed, dedicated software
for Digital VAX hardware.
Coda made an operating profit for the six months ended April 30 of Pounds
308,000 (Pounds 427,000) before a Pounds 2.91m exceptional charge for the
employee share ownership programme included in the flotation.
Losses also took account of a 93 per cent increase in research and
development spending to Pounds 2.7m as Coda stepped up work on its open
systems software packages which will run on any hardware. This is a market
where Coda is already emerging as a leading supplier.
Open system sales increased more than fourfold to Pounds 2.9m. R&amp;D spending
for the full year is forecast at Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 3m), an increase of
Pounds 1.5m over budget, reflecting the urgency of accelerating product
development.
Turnover increased 43 per cent to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 9.32m).
The cost of sales rose by 63 per cent to Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 252,000).
Administrative expenses rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 8.64m).
Coda made Pounds 3.75m on Pounds 23.5m turnover in its last full year before
flotation, and this was an important feature of its prospectus.
The company said except for the software for Digital VAX equipment, sales
were on or ahead of forecast, with its two other licensed, dedicated
software packages for HP3000 and IBM AS/400 systems respectively up 23 per
cent and 60 per cent respect-ively.
Losses per share were 8p against earnings of 1.2p; there is an interim
dividend of 0.5p.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: John Menzies improves 14% - Newspaper price
cuts against industry interests says wholesaler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from distribution was behind a 12 per cent rise in
annual profits at John Menzies, the wholesale and retail chain.
Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 34.4m in the year to
end-April, on turnover up from Pounds 1.17bn to Pounds 1.23bn.
Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director, said the group had produced 'solid,
sensible results in a difficult year'.
The distribution division lifted operating profits by 15 per cent, from
Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 24m, on turnover up 8 per cent, from Pounds 768.1m to
Pounds 829.5m.
Mr Noel-Paton said the newspaper wholesale business had so far been
unaffected by the newspaper price war, but 'it would be unwise to assume
that it won't'. Circulations remained under pressure in spite of price
cutting which the group does not believe is in the long-term interests of
the industry.
However, wholesale growth was driven by a strong performance from magazines
and periodicals.
Sales and profits also grew strongly at TBD, which distributes home
entertainment and books. Sales at Universal Office Supplies were higher, but
intense competition kept profits under pressure.
Operating profits at the retailing side edged ahead to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds
11.1m) on sales ahead from Pounds 375.7m to Pounds 402.1m.
John Menzies Retail, with 263 outlets, experienced 'tremendous' competition
in the high street, with higher sales driven by price cutting. But trials of
revised store lay-outs had proved encouraging.
Early Learning Centres had performed 'very satisfactorily'. The two
superstores, which carry clothing and nursery goods as well as toys and
books, had proved a success and the group was spending Pounds 4m to bring 10
new superstores on stream this year. The group had also opened its first
franchised ELC outlet in the Middle East.
The group invested Pounds 30m in the year, up Pounds 8.5m. It plans to
invest a similar amount in the current year.
Net interest payable halved from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 800,000, reflecting
strong cashflow and lower rates.
Earnings per share advanced from 35.3p to 40.7p.
A final dividend of 7.7p is proposed, taking the total to 11.8p (10.8p).
COMMENT
While these results can by no means be seen as disappointing, there are a
couple of areas that need to be watched carefully in the current year. The
most important is newspaper distribution. While distributors' margins have
been protected during the price cuts, they are unlikely to move higher for
some time. On the retailing side, the John Menzies shops are not performing
as they should be, and it is not yet clear that the management has found the
right format. Profits of Pounds 37m this year give a prospective multiple of
13 - a discount to the market that makes the shares an unexciting hold.

FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Chilly reception for EuroDollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail investors have given EuroDollar, the UK's second largest car hire
group, which is coming to market through a placing and public offer at 220p,
a chilly initial reception.
Only 1.41m valid applications were received for the 5.68m shares available
under the public offer and employee priority offer by the deadline on
Friday.
These applications will be satisfied in full.
EuroDollar was the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year. It
had earlier been forced to delay issuing its prospectus because of difficult
market conditions, and the shares were eventually priced somewhat below
earlier estimates.
The issue values the group at Pounds 107.9m and is sponsored and fully
underwritten by Schroders. It comprises 22.7m shares of which 18.3m are
being issued by the company with the remainder sold by existing
shareholders. Dealings are set to begin on Friday.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Retailers reshuffle top jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's largest clothing retailers reshuffled their top executives
yesterday as Mr Richard North resigned as finance director of Burton group,
to be replaced by Mr Andrew Higginson, finance director of Laura Ashley. In
a separate move, Laura Ashley appointed Mr Graham Searle, currently
non-executive deputy chairman, as managing director.
Mr North, hired by Burton in 1991 from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said he was
leaving because his task of sorting out Burton's financial problems was
complete, and he wanted a new challenge.
Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, emphasised that Mr North's departure
had been mutually agreed, and he was receiving a non-contractual bonus of 12
months' salary - close to Pounds 250,000. 'We always knew Richard was a
special horse for a particular course,' Sir John said.
Mr North retains a 12-month consultancy contract, worth Pounds 60,000, with
Burton.
'I only wanted to go when I had completed the job, and was seen to have
completed the job,' he said. That job involved reducing debts of Pounds 800m
three years ago to Pounds 50m, and gearing from 100 per cent to 6 per cent,
through two rights issues, the sale of Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge for
Pounds 60m, and other property deals. The last was the sale in May of
Burton's four remaining shopping centres to Prudential for Pounds 153m.
Mr North is credited with having improved both the 'reality and perception'
of Burton's accounting, as one analyst put it.
His successor Mr Andrew Higginson, 36, has 14 years' experience at Unilever,
Guinness and Laura Ashley. Mr Higginson's departure contributed to a 5p fall
in Laura Ashley shares to 68p yesterday, as it announced it was appointing
Mr Graham Searle - who joined only last month as non-executive deputy
chairman - as managing director.
Mr Searle, formerly managing director of Dunhill, will hold the position
until a chief executive is found to replace Mr Jim Maxmin - a process Ashley
believes could take up to a year. Mr Geoff Haslehurst is being promoted from
deputy to acting finance director. Ms Ann Iverson, former chief executive of
Mothercare and now with US retailer Melville, was appointed a non-executive
director, along with Mr Richard Wakeling, until recently chief executive of
Johnson Matthey.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Light flickers at the end of the autobahn: David Waller
reports on guarded optimism in the German carmaking industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year was an unrelenting chronicle of bad news for the German car sector
 -a story of plunging order books, big losses and massive job cuts. 'The
worst year in a decade,' mused Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel,
General Motors' German subsidiary, last week.
Now, halfway through the current year, Germany's car industry executives are
beginning to feel that the worst is behind them. If the mood is not exactly
one of unqualified optimism, there are signs that the largest vehicle market
in Europe is staging a steady recovery. Here are some recent developments:
German car production increased by 15 per cent in May, to 353,400 vehicles
and for the first five months of a year in total, car production rose by 2
per cent to 1.69m, reversing the downwards trend of the previous four
months.
Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said last week it
would make a profit of at least DM100m (Pounds 40.3m) in the current year
after incurring losses in both 1992 and 1993.
Also last week, Adam Opel said it expected a 'dramatic improvement' in 1994
 -but hinted that it was unlikely to move back into the black after losing
more than DM500m at the operating level in 1993.
Mercedes-Benz, the Daimler-Benz vehicle subsidiary, said recently that sales
of its new cars within Germany rose 41.5 per cent in the first five months
of the year, while in May the increase was more than 50 per cent.
At Volkswagen, sales of the VW marque were up 0.7 per cent in the five
months and by 11.5 per cent in May alone. Last week Audi, VW's up-market
subsidiary, reported that sales to export markets rose 14 per cent in the
first six months.
BMW, the company which has proved itself most resilient to the downturn,
held unit sales steady at around last year's levels.
German manufacturers have enjoyed a sudden revival in overseas sales,
particularly in the important US market where VW's sales, for example, more
than doubled to nearly 22,000 cars in the first five months.
Porsche, the sports car manufacturer, said on Friday that its sales in the
US would increase by 35 per cent this year.
This combination of factors has led General Motors to revise upwards its
1994 forecast for the German market as a whole: GM now expects sales to be
roughly the same as last year when they dropped to 3.19m, a steep decline
from the 3.93m cars sold in 1992. The original forecast was for a further
decline, to 3m units.
However, the modest improvement in the outlook does not signal the all-clear
for the German car industry, for two reasons.
First, the increase in unit sales in Germany may not translate into a surge
in profitability. Mercedes, for example, owes the increase in its sales to
the new C-Class model, which is selling at five times the sales last year of
the 190 model which it replaced.
The new cars are being sold at what analysts estimate to be an average price
of DM44,500 per car, lower than the DM50,000 which Mercedes hoped to achieve
when developing the model.
The second cloud on the horizon is costs: Mr Stephen Reitman, analyst at UBS
in London, says German car companies still lag their international
competitors. 'In terms of productivity measures, such as the number of
vehicles produced per year per man and the cost per vehicle, the German
companies trail behind.'
This is in spite of the aggressive cost-cutting implemented by German
manufacturers: Daimler-Benz said it reduced its costs by DM5bn last year,
with most of its rationalisation measures falling at Mercedes, where the
plan was to cut 42,500 jobs between 1992 and 1995. Volkswagen cut its
domestic workforce by nearly 9 per cent last year and aims to save DM3bn
this year by introducing a four-day working week.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM director who defected to
VW last year, is thought to have squeezed cost reductions of DM5bn to DM6bn
by putting pressure on suppliers.
But 'even VW has only half grasped the nettle', says one analyst, alluding
to the four-day week programme. 'There is unlikely to be an explosion in
production so VW will end up facing the same overmanning problems as
before,' the analyst said.
The only answer to the competitive pressure will be 'more of the same' -
further job cuts, further pressure on costs, a further shift of production
out of Germany. This is likely to prove difficult for German companies,
especially in the early stages of a recovery when employees are likely to
prove reluctant to make sacrifices that were bearable in a recession.
If the outlook for car manufacturers is fraught with challenge, for their
suppliers there are 'sweat and tears' ahead, according to Mr Rainer Thieme,
deputy president of the the VDA motor industry association which represents
suppliers to the big car manufacturers.
He said last month that despite the painful adjustments necessary in the
wake of the manufacturers' cost-cutting measures, suppliers had only
completed half the rationalisation necessary to guarantee survival over the
medium-term. Job cuts in the sector will not stop at the 50,000 jobs lost
since 1990-91, and many suppliers will be rationalised out of existence.

FT  05 JUL 94 / MFI advances strongly and plans accelerated expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the UK furniture retailer and manufacturer, reported a sharp recovery
in profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 87.8m in the 53 weeks to April and
said that sales were currently running 13 per cent ahead of last year.
The company also announced an acceleration of its expansion in France. Mr
Derek Hunt, chairman, said: 'We are increasingly confident we can establish
a major chain in France.'
In the UK, MFI experienced a slowdown in sales of kitchens and bedrooms at
the end of the period which it blamed on the consumer caution ahead of the
April tax increases. But this proved short-lived and growth has since picked
up strongly.
Excluding the 53rd week, turnover rose 7 per cent with sales per square foot
up 8 per cent.
Mr Hunt said the results were boosted by increased Sunday opening and by the
introduction of new kitchen ranges which contributed to record sales in the
key winter sale period of January and February.
Gross margins slipped to 55.9 (57.3) per cent due to strong growth in lower
margins products but staff costs were unchanged to push the operating
margins up to 11.1 (8.4) per cent.
Adjusting for the impact of MFI's flotation the previous year operating
profit rose 45 per cent to Pounds 73.3m and pre-tax profit, including the
Pounds 19.6m contribution from the sale of the stake in Carpetright, more
than doubled from Pounds 42.4m before taking account of flotation.
The disposal helped to cut gearing from 52 per cent to 9 per cent.
Capital expenditure was up almost a fifth at Pounds 27.5m and is budgeted to
increase by more than 30 per cent this year. MFI plans to add 9 stores to
its 176 in the UK, in addition to the expansion in France.
A final dividend of 2.67p gives a total of 4p, up 6.7 per cent, which was
covered 1.9 times by earnings, excluding exceptional items, of 7.7p (4.5p).
The company said that higher earnings in future would be reflected by
increased dividends, but also improved cover.
The shares closed 3p higher at 142p.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Brewer lifted 22% by pubs purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pub acquisition
helped Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the drinks and leisure group, to a 22 per cent
rise in pre-tax profit for the year to May 1, to Pounds 222m. However,
earnings per share rose only 1.2 per cent, as a result of the rights issue
which helped finance the Pounds 700m deal.
A six-month contribution of Pounds 32.3m in operating profit from Chef &amp;
Brewer, together with an 8 per cent rise in profits from leisure, more than
offset a sharp fall of 11 per cent in brewing. Mr Brian Stewart, chief
executive, said that while beer sales had fallen 2 per cent in the year,
volume in the current year was up 4 per cent.
Volume sales of branded beer to the pub trade had fallen 3.4 per cent in a
market down 2.5 per cent, he said. In off-licence sales, sales were down 2.4
per cent in a market up by 2.5 per cent. This was chiefly due to S&amp;N's
refusal to lower its prices, Mr Stewart said.
The Chef and Brewer acquisition from Grand Metropolitan could not have gone
better, claimed Mr Stewart. 'We had a natural Scottish caution in buying
from Sir Allen (Sheppard, GrandMet chairman), so we were all the more
careful in doing our sums.' Like-for-like turnover at Chef &amp; Brewer had
risen 5 per cent on a cumulative basis over 6 months, having been running at
1-2 per cent at the time of acquisition. The deal had not contributed to
group beer volume in the past year, but was expected to add around 2 per
cent this year.
In the leisure division, Center Parcs had done well in the UK, but occupancy
in France fell from 94 per cent to 85 per cent.
The retail division (excluding Chef &amp; Brewer) had sales of Pounds 290.8m
(Pounds 289.3m), and operating profit of Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 53.3m). Chef &amp;
Brewer's sales in the second half were Pounds 230.6m and operating profits
Pounds 32.3m.
Beer sales were Pounds 870.9m (Pounds 889.2m) and profits were Pounds 86.0m
(Pounds 96.2m). Leisure contributed Pounds 83.1m profit (Pounds 77.0m) on
sales of Pounds 367.5m (Pounds 335.4m).
After interest charges were Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 26.1m). Earnings per share
were 33.1p (32.7p). The final dividend was raised 5.5 per cent to 11.26p,
making 17.04p (16.22p) for the year, a rise of 5.1 per cent. The shares fell
3p to 501p.

FT  05 JUL 94 / ICI and Enichem may sell PVC side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries and Enichem of Italy are considering
the flotation of EVC, their 50-50 polyvinyl chloride subsidiary. The move
would be yet another step in ICI's strategy of quitting commodity chemicals
businesses. Last year ICI sold its fibres business to Du Pont of the US, and
its polypropylene capacity to BASF of Germany.
EVC is Europe's largest manufacturer of PVC, a plastic widely used in the
construction and automotive industries. It has capacity of 1.1m tonnes a
year and about 20 per cent of the European market.
The potential flotation follows the collapse of a possible management
buy-out. Oxychem, a Dallas-based group and a leading US PVC producer, also
expressed interest, but its offer was too low.
Analysts were yesterday unsure how to value EVC, as little is known about
it. Turnover last year was about Pounds 750m. Operating losses were about
Pounds 100m, taking into account raw material discounts provided by the
parent companies. ICI says the subsidiary is now trading profitably.
Merchant bank SG Warburg is advising ICI, while UBS is representing Enichem.
The only comparable company is Geon, the Ohio-based PVC manufacturer floated
in March last year by BF Goodrich, the speciality chemicals and aerospace
group. Geon has a market capitalisation of Dollars 730m (Pounds 480.2m) on
sales of about Dollars 950m. However, the recovery of the US PVC cycle is at
a more advanced stage than that of Europe.
EVC's move into profits is the consequence of a rapid upturn in European PVC
prices. These have risen from a low of DM0.95 per kg of pipe-grade plastic
during the second quarter last year to DM1.3 per kg, according to Chem
Systems, the London-based chemicals consultants. That compares with a peak
of DM1.8 per kg in the first quarter of 1989.
Prices have risen because of a collapse of imports from about 700,000 tonnes
a year in 1992 to a predicted 300,000 tonnes this year. East European
imports have fallen because of production problems, and US imports have
dropped following buoyant demand in North America and Asia.
In Europe, although forecast demand for PVC in Europe is only about 1.5 per
cent a year, production increased 6 per cent during the first four months
this year, according to Chem Systems.
EVC's main competitors are Solvay of Belgium with 905,000 tonnes capacity a
year; Elf Atochem of France (705,000 tonnes a year); Vinnolit, a
joint-venture between Hoechst and Wacker of Germany (635,000 tonnes a year);
and Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group (500,000 tonnes a year).

FT  05 JUL 94 / Councils plan on being Tour de France winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern England's local authorities were hoping last night that the balmy
weather would last a little longer and that Briton Chris Boardman would
continue to wear the yellow jersey as leader of the world's greatest cycle
race.
Kent, Hampshire and East Sussex councils, along with towns such as Dover,
Brighton and Portsmouth, are paying between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m to
bring two stages of the Tour de France to Britain for the first time in 20
years, and hoping to recoup the cost through a visitor bonanza.
Although Boardman is given little chance of winning the 2,400- mile,
three-week race, which attracts an international television audience of
950m, it is hoped he will cling to the yellow jersey for the two British
stages tomorrow and Thursday.
The organisers, Societe du Tour de France, have taken the tour to countries
near France in recent years to broaden its interest. The last time it came
to Britain was in 1974 when a stage was run around Plymouth. It was not a
success.
This time, a stage will run 128 miles from Dover through Kent and East
Sussex and end in Marine Parade, Brighton. A second stage will see the 189
riders cover 113 miles in a Portsmouth to Portsmouth run through Hampshire.
To get the tour, towns where a stage begins or ends have to pay a fee to
Societe du Tour de France. Brighton has paid Pounds 90,000, for example,
plus Pounds 36,000 to Sport For Television, the British company which has
the UK television rights.
Portsmouth and Hampshire County Council are spending Pounds 500,000 on the
tour with a standard Pounds 90,000 going to Societe du Tour de France. The
rest is for signposting, promotion, road closures, policing and other
incidentals. East Sussex County Council has budgeted Pounds 100,000,
including Pounds 78,000 for road closures and special cycle tracks in places
such as Ditchling Beacon.
But the 'investment' as Mr David Knight, project manager in Portsmouth has
called it, could reap substantial returns.
Mr Graham Tubb at East Sussex Council says: 'We are being cautious and only
estimating 200,000 visitors. Others are talking about 500,000 in East Sussex
alone and possibly 1m visitors overall. You only need half a million
visitors spending five pounds each and you have more than covered your
costs.'
Ms Deborah Grubb, the head of arts and leisure at Brighton district council,
says: 'We have had to pay Pounds 150,000 to get the tour and we consider it
a snip. We will get hundreds of thousands of visitors. If they spend Pounds
20 each, we will make millions.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / France seeks EU-wide curbs on British beef
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has joined Germany in pressing for restrictions on British beef
exports to the rest of the European Union, while Germany said yesterday it
had won sympathy from the Benelux countries for its plan to impose a
six-month ban on UK beef.
The French agriculture ministry confirmed that Paris supported German
efforts to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, so-called
'mad cow disease', by imposing restrictions on imports of British beef.
But officials emphasised that France was pressing for general action by the
European Union and had no intention of imposing its own national
restrictions.
The agriculture ministry in Paris said: 'We have, together with Germany,
presented proposals to the European Commission for limitations on British
beef imports. But we do not plan to take action on a national basis.'
Even so, French support for restrictions will cause concern in the UK.
France last year imported Pounds 189m of Britain's total Pounds 407m of beef
exports and is by far Britain's biggest foreign customer.
Mrs Simone Veil, the French health minister, and Mr Jean Puech, agriculture
minister, teamed up with their German counterparts - Mr Horst Seehofer and
Mr Jochen Borchert - to send a joint letter on June 20 to the commission
proposing restrictions on British beef.
The French and Germans are now awaiting its response, which is expected to
be delivered next Monday at a meeting of agriculture ministers in Brussels.
The UK agriculture ministry said the French proposals would be discussed
today by the BSE sub-group of the EU's scientific veterinary group. 'We have
spoken to the French, and as far as we are aware they are not talking about
banning anything,' the ministry said.
The German health ministry said yesterday there were signs that Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg would also support Germany in its efforts to ban
British beef which it fears may be affected by BSE.
The ministry said France and the Benelux nations were the first to have
'open ears' for the warnings from Mr Seehofer about the dangers of
contaminated beef.
The German Bundesrat, or upper house, is to vote on Friday on the proposal
for a six-month ban.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Qantas/BA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government's decision to privatise Qantas early next year
could be finely timed. There is an international appetite for airline shares
at present which will be given added edge by only 10 per cent of Qantas's
stock being offered to foreign investors. Qantas has been restructuring with
a vengeance following its merger with Australian Airlines. The industry
background is also growing more favourable. The head of the International
Air Transport Association yesterday forecast 'massive gains' for the
industry in 1995 as traffic promised to rise ahead of new capacity.
But there will be considerable nervousness ahead of the sale given the
fragility of financial markets. The Australian stock market has fallen 8 per
cent this year. By delaying the sale until 1995, the Australian government
has left itself no room for manoeuvre if things turn really ugly. Other
airlines, such as Lufthansa, which are stacking up to be privatised, will be
watching closely. If Qantas cannot be successfully sold then other airlines
have no chance.
British Airways, which has already secured a 25 per cent shareholding, will
be keen to aid the issue's success to validate its investment. Qantas's
privatisation should also enable BA to forge closer links with a more
commercially-minded carrier. BA is still aiming to plug a hole in its global
alliance by linking up with a carrier in the north Pacific. That could
benefit Qantas, too. But BA will have to proceed warily given the worries
swirling around its involvement with the troubled USAir.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's sharp rise in many building material companies' share prices
rests on rather flimsy foundations. The 13 per cent real increase in sales
in May on a year-on-year basis, as recorded by the Builders Merchants
Federation, is certainly good news. But the share price responses - Caradon
up over 2 per cent, Redland and RMC up more than 3 per cent, and Wolseley
and Blue Circle rising over 4 per cent - look overdone.
Drawing conclusions about the future from monthly figures is always risky.
It is doubly so when the indicator is a lagging one, as is the case with
sales through building merchants. These reflect construction decisions made
earlier in the year, principally by house-builders. The snag is that though
the housing market started the year in fine fettle, the recovery has
recently seemed to falter. Some of the market weakness is undoubtedly
seasonal. Housing market activity and prices may perk up again in the
autumn. But that remains to be seen.
In the meantime, an important determinant of building material companies'
share prices will be interest rate prospects. The best news for the housing
market would be if long-term rates fell, bringing down those for fixed-rate
mortgages in their trail. That could follow today's meeting of the Fed Open
Market Committee and the G7 summit later this week. But it would be rash to
count on it.

The market took a curiously grudging view of yesterday's results from
Scottish &amp; Newcastle. If there was a reason for marking the shares down by
nearly 1 per cent it was probably the 11 per cent fall in brewing profits.
But if that was the worry, it was scarcely logical to mark up Bass by a
similar amount. The weak beer market is a problem for everybody. A more
plausible explanation is that Scottish has outperformed the sector recently
on the back of its purchase of Chef &amp; Brewer. Having presumed that the deal
would be made to work, investors were unlikely to be excited by news that
everything is going according to plan.
The 5 per cent like-for-like increase in turnover at Chef &amp; Brewer is
certainly encouraging, but that probably flowed naturally from the economic
upturn in the south of England and a better motivated management. The harder
part is yet to come. In particular, Scottish will have to raise the profile
of some its brands in the south if it is to reap the full benefits from the
deal. McEwan's is not yet highly-prized by beer drinkers in Surrey.
Scottish has other things going its way. There is still lucrative scope to
increase food sales in its pubs; continental recovery and heavy bookings at
its new Center Parc at Longleat promise to underpin growth in leisure
profits. But it will take a year or so to prove that the Chef &amp; Brewer deal
was as canny as its decision to get out of hotels and buy Center Parcs. The
market does not look in a mood to countenance failure.

ICI has developed a taste for floating off unwanted assets. Unlike the
demerger of Zeneca, though, its decision to make a graceful exit from PVC is
no surprise. The joint venture with Enichem never looked like a permanent
solution. By transfering manufacturing assets into what was originally a
marketing alliance three years ago, the partners paved the way for eventual
sale. One can only assume that the recent recovery in plastics prices has
improved EVC's operating performance to the point where it can stand alone.
Without a prospectus it is impossible to put a value on the business. The
only clues to EVC's trading performance are buried in the associates line of
ICI's results, and even these are muddied by transfer pricing. The state of
the balance sheet can only be guessed at. Comparable US companies - such as
Geon, the PVC specialist floated by its parent last year - are valued at a
modest discount to annual turnover. If EVC can convince investors of its
determination to cut costs and raise margins towards the US norm, a
valuation of over Pounds 500m might therefore be achievable. Investors
should welcome the chance to own a specialist company rather than the
chemicals conglomerates which dominate the European scene.
If such figures prove to be correct, the exercise will leave ICI with next
to no net debt. How it plans to flex this financial muscle remain unclear.
Investment projects such as building new plants in Asia are laudable but
will barely dent free cash flow in the upturn. Having resisted the
temptation to sell out at the very bottom of the economic cycle, ICI must
avoid reinvesting near the top.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Building suppliers provide evidence of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh signs that the recovery is spreading across the UK economy emerged
yesterday, after building suppliers said an improvement in the housing
market had created a surge in the sales of construction materials this
spring.
Meanwhile, official figures also showed that retail spending remains
relatively buoyant in spite of April's tax increases - although hints have
emerged that consumers may be becoming more cautious in the way they use
credit cards.
Shares of building material suppliers rose nearly 3 per cent on the London
Stock Exchange yesterday after a 9.05 per cent rise in merchants' sales
during the three months to the end of May, compared with the corresponding
period last year.
The jump was led by a big increase in sales to housebuilders, reflecting the
improvement in the housing market earlier this year, according to the
Builders Merchants Federation which published the figures.
Mr Peter Gill, federation director, said sales had risen by 7.9 per cent
over the previous three months, the highest annual increase since 1987.
However, he warned: 'Reports from building societies, and some house
builders that the pace of the housing recovery is faltering are worrying.'
In another sign of economic pick-up, the Central Statistical Office said
consumers spent a record Pounds 3.06bn on credit cards in May, pushing the
total level of new consumer borrowing to near record levels of Pounds
5.16bn.
The level of credit card repayment, however, was also sharply higher, as
more consumers sought to settle their credit card debts. Net lending fell
sharply during the month to Pounds 203m, down from Pounds 412m in April.
This fall disappointed the City, which had expected a figure of about Pounds
350m. But the Treasury pointed out that the underlying trend remained
upwards, with net lending in the three months to May higher than in the
three months to February.
Any disappointment was also offset by a strong June figure for M0 - the
narrowest measure of money supply, chiefly notes and coins. This showed it
growing by 6.8 per cent last month compared with the previous June.
Some analysts suggested the figure indicated that June's retail sales data
would be strong. The Treasury pointed out, however, that the recent growth
in M0 also reflected the fact that lower interest rates were encouraging
consumers to hold more cash.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Berlusconi's grip tightens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Silvio Berlusconi, as he prepares to host the G7 summit in Naples later this
week, still benefits politically from an aura of novelty. But the euphoria
in business circles which greeted his election victory in March is beginning
to wear off. The markets are waiting with some anxiety to see how Mr
Berlusconi, who in his election campaign rashly promised tax cuts, will deal
with Italy's crippling burden of public debt.
The government's first official planning document on economic and financial
policy is due next week. Meanwhile, it continues to give out signals that it
is internally divided, and that its members are more concerned with
maximising and perpetuating their political power than with taking the kind
of economic decisions the markets are looking for. The Northern League, one
of the three main coalition parties, is now on almost as bad terms with
Forza Italia as it has been all along with the rightwing National Alliance,
and Mr Berlusconi's lieutenants have been threatening it with new general
elections.
Two things the government was able to agree on last week seem likely to make
things worse rather than better. First, it sought to give itself power to
reject the accounts and fire the board of the state broadcasting
organisation, RAI; then it asserted its right to control appointments to the
directorate of the Bank of Italy. Ironically the latter statement was issued
by Mr Berlusconi's office just as the government spokesman, Giuliano
Ferrara, was assuring the Financial Times that the two bodies were entirely
different and that the government would make no attempt to influence the
choice of a successor to Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, in his
previous job as the bank's director-general.
Special position
The two bodies are indeed different, but not quite in the way Mr Ferrara
thought. The government is right in saying that top officials even in some
of the world's most famously independent central banks, such as the
Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve, are appointed by the executive. But
the Bank of Italy is in a very special position as the one Italian state
institution which, alongside the judiciary, managed to preserve its dignity
and reputation during the wave of corruption scandals which led to the
collapse of the old political system. This position was acknowledged last
year when its then governor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was named prime minister.
He was judged the only figure with the necessary authority and impartiality
to govern the country during its political and economic transition.
Deeply suspect
As prime minister, Mr Ciampi won golden opinions from economists which,
perhaps unfortunately, were endorsed by the left in its attempt to gain
respectability. That dragged him into an argument with Mr Berlusconi which
the voters may be said to have arbitrated in the latter's favour, but which
left Mr Berlusconi's own fiscal orthodoxy deeply suspect. Mr Berlusconi
cannot now afford to appear to be trying to seize control of the central
bank, any more than Mr Dini can afford to appear to seek revenge for the
fact that he was himself passed over when the present governor was appointed
last year.
The RAI, in which jobs under the old regime were cynically shared out
between the main political parties, has no such claim to virginity. But the
board of five professors which resigned last Thursday had been put in to
reform it during the transition. They can fairly complain that they were not
given a chance to complete their work. More seriously, the government which
has now gained the right to appoint the new board, albeit through the
speakers of the two houses of parliament (both drawn from the governing
coalition), is headed by the man who in his private capacity owns all three
commercial TV channels. It is naive in the extreme for Mr Berlusconi to
think he has resolved this conflict of interest by handing over the
management of his commercial empire to a trusted lieutenant. He owes it to
himself and his countrymen to correct this anomaly as fast as possible, by
introducing a broadcasting law to guarantee the independence of both public
and private broadcasting, and then selling his own holding at a price fixed
by the international market.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Robin Hood or just a hoodlum: David Buchan says
investigations into Bernard Tapie's business affairs raise questions about
corruption in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Bernard Tapie, Gaul is again divided into three.
To some French - and their number can be judged by the 2.5m who voted for
his Radical Movement candidates in the European elections - he is a Robin
Hood figure who defends the poor. To others, he is a scoundrel who deserves
'the 162 police inspectors and seven investigating magistrates' whom he
claims are hounding him for alleged tax evasion, fraud, misuse of corporate
funds and football bribery.
And there is a third category of spectators, the largest of all, who just
chuckle at his latest brush with the law. On Wednesday last week Mr Tapie
was dragged out of bed at dawn by police to be taken before a magistrate who
put him under formal investigation for tax evasion and fraud. Clearly,
matters are becoming serious for Mr Tapie. But the saga so far retains a Tom
and Jerry quality, in which the mouse bites back and has still not been
finally snared.
Mr Tapie greeted police at dawn last week with a string of oaths, which
earned him an extra charge of 'insulting representatives of the law'. Later
in the day he left the magistrate's office, though without his passport,
which had been impounded to prevent him leaving the country. A month
earlier, there had been another piquant episode, this time at midnight: Mr
Tapie spirited some of his 18th-century furniture and works of art into a
suburban Paris warehouse, pursued by private detectives in the employ of his
biggest creditor, Credit Lyonnais, which claims Mr Tapie's valuable chattels
as security for the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 142m) he owes the bank.
But the Tapie affair raises two wider issues. First, it reinforces the
impression that France resembles Italy in terms of corruption. The suspicion
has been fostered by allegations of improprieties in the financing of
political parties and of systematic political kickbacks by construction
companies and utilities to obtain public contracts. 'France does not seem
like Italy,' says Mr Antoine Gaudino, a former financial police investigator
in Marseille, 'but only because French magistrates have not generally been
given the same independence to pursue corruption that their Italian
counterparts have had in recent years.' Yet yesterday saw evidence of
increased activity by the fraud police, who detained for questioning Mr
Pierre Suard, president of Alcatel-Alsthom, the electrical engineering
group.
Second, Mr Tapie's success in winning for his populist, left-wing movement
12 per cent of the Euro-election vote and 13 Euro-seats in last month's
European Parliament election has destabilised the left, just as Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front threatened to do on the right. Conspiracy
theorists see in these developments the hand of President Francois
Mitterrand, who introduced proportional voting in 1986 and gave Mr Le Pen
his big electoral break and who, in the Euro-election campaign, reserved his
praise for Mr Tapie rather than Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader. Mr
Rocard was ousted as party leader after gaining only 14.5 per cent of the
Euro-vote.
This leaves the Socialists in a quandary about how and whether to effect a
rapprochement with Mr Tapie and the Radical Movement (MRG) party. Until Mr
Tapie joined the MRG last year and effectively took it over, it was an
obedient - because not very successful - ally of the Socialists. In last
Tuesday's National Assembly vote to lift Mr Tapie's parliamentary immunity
on charges of tax evasion and fraud, the Socialists chose to abstain rather
than confront the man whose young and working class following they
desperately need to regain.
But the Socialists face stiff competition from Mr Tapie's populism, which is
not wholly without principle. He is widely admired for his strong opposition
to the far-right National Front. Apart from that, however, he gives the
impression of opportunism. Last Tuesday, for instance, to distract
fellow-deputies before they voted to lift his immunity, Mr Tapie tabled a
bill to make youth unemployment illegal.
During the debate on his immunity, Mr Tapie raised the political stakes as
high as he could, warning deputies they might provoke a backlash among 'his'
2.5m voters if they supported the authorities' 'lynching' of him. The
conservative government says it is just letting the judicial and tax
investigations run their course.
It is, however, striking that these investigations have accelerated since
March 1993 when the Socialists and Mr Tapie lost power. In 1992 Mr Tapie
became minister for cities in the Beregovoy government, resigned because of
a row over his alleged short-changing of a business partner in importing
electronic equipment, but got his ministry back on Christmas Eve of that
year. As striking has been the widespread leaking to the press of
magisterial, police and tax reports on Mr Tapie.
But some cases against Mr Tapie have been initiated by disgruntled managers
of his companies. One involves Testut, a small weighing-machine maker, whose
manager filed charges against Mr Tapie for using Testut to get out of debts
contracted by another Tapie company, Trayvou, and to fund a fellow MRG
politician's campaign. Mr Tapie has not fulfilled his early promise of the
1970s as a white knight galloping to the rescue of stricken firms.
According to Mr Christophe Bouchet, who has written a business biography* of
the man, the way Mr Tapie typically worked was to target family companies in
difficulty, often run by heirs not up to the standard of the founders but
anxious to save the family honour. Ideally, such companies would have
relatively little preferential debt on whose repayment the tax and social
security administrations would have first call, but often substantial
commercial debt which Mr Tapie would then buy at a big discount. The final
rule was to sell the companies as quickly as possible. Some relatively quick
sales produced relatively good book profits - FFr260m from the Look ski wear
company (held for six years), FFr470m from the Wonder battery company (held
for five years), FFr280m from Adidas, the sports goods manufacturer (held
for three years).
But, Mr Bouchet notes, the longer Mr Tapie held on to companies, the worse
they have done. This is the case with companies such as Terraillon (bought
in 1981), Testut (1983), and Trayvou (1983). All three are (curiously given
Mr Tapie's problems with the 'lady of justice' symbolised by a pair of
scales) in the weighing machine business. All are, also, still on Mr Tapie's
hands, as is La Vie Claire, a chain of diet shops bought in 1980.
Ironically, in view of Mr Tapie's latest plan to outlaw youth unemployment,
all have shed jobs over the years. The Terraillon workforce, for instance,
has shrunk from 560 to 30 in its 13 years under Mr Tapie.
It is, of course, equally true that the worse these companies have done, the
longer Mr Tapie has had to hold on to them. He tried to interest Booker, the
UK food distribution group, in buying a stake in 1986 in La Vie Claire, but
ended up in 1989 having to buy back all the shares. He actually got Mr
Pierre Botton, the son-in-law of the mayor of Lyons, to buy La Vie Claire,
but took it back again in 1992 when Mr Botton complained of being misled
about the company's true debt.
After the sale of Adidas in 1993, Mr Tapie withdrew his holding company,
Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) from the Paris bourse, and the separately quoted
Testut and Terraillon were withdrawn from the Paris and Lyons Bourses. BTF
is 62 per cent owned by Groupe Bernard Tapie (GBT). This last company, and
Financiere et Immobiliere Bernard Tapie (FIBT), a property company that owns
his houses in Paris and Marrakesh and Marseille-moored yacht, are wholly
owned by Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, as personal unlimited liability
companies. This has the disadvantage of making Mr Tapie and his wife
personally liable for all their possessions, but the convenience of not
having to publish accounts.
It was on Olympique-Marseille football club that Mr Tapie lavished the time
he might better have spent managing his other companies. He produced
extraordinary results. The club won five consecutive French championships
and was the first French team to win the European cup. But in his quest for
soccer success, Mr Tapie also used extraordinary methods, according to
allegations by police and a Lyons accountancy firm.
To get to the top, O-M needed the best players, and to afford them the club
allegedly resorted to a variety of ruses including 'fictitious loans'.
Instead of being paid a salary which would have the inconvenience of
attracting income tax and social security charges, players were given
'loans' which, at the end of their contracts, were then forgiven. More
sensational, however, was the allegation that, just before their victory
over Milan, O-M officials offered money to players for Valenciennes, a
northern French team, 'not to play too hard' against O-M. A cache of
FFr250,000 was later found in the garden of the parents of a Valenciennes
player.
The case is still under investigation. O-M is said to have large debts,
including tax and social security arrears, and is staggering on under
judicial supervision. Meanwhile, the French football authorities have
demoted the club to the second division and banned Mr Tapie from holding any
post in soccer once he has found a buyer for his controlling stake in O-M.
Until this year, Mr Tapie had the good fortune to have a loyal bank, the
Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO). This is a subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais, the large state-controlled bank which under the stewardship of Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer piled up big losses and bad debts. But Mr Tapie's links
with SDBO predated the 1988 arrival at Credit Lyonnais of Mr Haberer, who,
however, seemed happy to ignore a relationship of which his Socialist
political masters evidently approved.
As late as 1992 SDBO lent FFr80m to ACT, the company set up by Mr Tapie to
manage his four-masted yacht, the Phocea, as a commercial enterprise. The
allegation that some FFr55m of this loan actually went to other parts of the
Tapie empire, including FFr9m to increase Mr Tapie's capital in O-M,
constitutes one of the two cases opened against Mr Tapie so melodramatically
last week. The other allegation, leaked in its entirety to the French press,
is that Mr Tapie underbilled ACT for his personal use of the Phocea, and
used its deficits to underpay income tax by FFr12.4m in 1989-91.
Last year's replacement of Mr Haberer by Mr Jean Peyrelevade at the top of
Credit Lyonnais spelled trouble for Mr Tapie, though this was not
immediately evident. In March, Mr Peyrelevade reached an agreement with Mr
Tapie, cutting him off from further credit but giving him five years to pay
off his FFr1.2bn debt to SDBO. One of the conditions was that Mr Tapie
furnish a detailed valuation of his furniture and paintings, which SDBO had
earlier loosely agreed would be security for its loans; Credit Lyonnais says
the 'friendly' agreement in March was vital to tightening its mortgage on
the furnishings.
In the event, Credit Lyonnais claimed it did not get the valuation, got
police help to enter forcibly Mr Tapie's house in May to do its own
valuation and has tried to call in some of its loans. However, Mr Tapie
claims that he has honoured the March agreement by supplying a valuation.
The dispute awaits resolution in court in the autumn.
So far, media attention has been focused on Mr Tapie, and on how or whether
he will get out of the legal labyrinth into which he is now plunged. But the
broader question is one posed by Mr Gaudino, the former police investigator
in Marseille: will French magistrates, so galvanised into action against Mr
Tapie, tackle other forms and sources of corruption?
Mr Gaudino's case is instructive. In 1988 he uncovered the Socialist party's
system of financing itself through the Urba network of 'bureaux d'etudes';
socialist politicians throughout the country asked companies seeking public
contracts to pay a commission to Urba offices, which were supposed to
evaluate the bids but in fact simply paid the commissions into the party's
central coffers in Paris. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, who has just become the
Socialist party's leader but who in the late 1980s was its treasurer, is
still under investigation for his role in the Urba network.
Following his investigative diligence, Mr Gaudino was struck off the police
roster, to which he was formally reinstated last year by the new
conservative government. But, like many other professional investigators, Mr
Gaudino is convinced that 'corruption exists on the right, except that it is
more atomised, with individual right-wing politicians taking money, usually
in cash, for themselves and a bit for their party'.
One of the magistrates who investigated Mr Emmanuelli over Urba is now
trying to trace an allegation that a commission paid by Pont-a-Mousson, a
pipe-making company, to win a contract in Nantes may have ended up in the
pocket of Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister and Republican party
president. Mr Longuet has denied any knowledge of the commission.
Decentralisation over the past 10 years, and granting greater powers to
French regions, departments and communes to award public contracts, has
certainly increased the potential for corruption. French elections,
particularly at the presidential level, also remain very expensive in
European terms.
If the problem is indeed general, then nothing would do more to prove Mr
Tapie's charge of hypocrisy against the French establishment than selective
pursuit of him.

However, it's time to move on to bigger things. Wellcome, BOC, Prudential

The Wellcome job sounds the most challenging. But North is an ambitious sort

The puzzles include a 'three-card trick'; 'clip-the-queen'; the 'stubborn

playing card without breaking the seal.
'It's a marketing tool with a psychological edge, which is designed to show
the creativity of the KPMG approach,' says a staffer. Given some of the
twisted minds populating the marketing world, mind twisters seem an entirely
appropriate way of getting a foot in the door.

Another gamekeeper savours the delights of poaching. Word is that the
ubiquitous John Wriglesworth, the media-friendly housing analyst at UBS, is
set to join one of Britain's largest building societies, the Bradford &amp;
Bingley, to hunt for suitable mergers and plan its strategy.
Though Wriglesworth's knowledge of the sector is encyclopaedic, he may have
to fine-tune some of his more forthright views. After all, the
B &amp; B is the largest society to act as an independent financial adviser and
only last year Wriglesworth was dismissing IFA status as an inferior option
for a society. Much better to be a sexy 'bancassurer' and devise your own
financial services products, or link with a single life insurance company,
opined Wriglesworth.
The Yorkshire building society is proud of its independent status, and young
Wriglesworth may have to swallow his words if he wants a seat on the board.
He won't be the first ex-stockbroking analyst to do so.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bjorn Wolrath's claim to have his finger on the pulse of Sweden's investor
community looked a little less than convincing yesterday, when the first
issue of government stock - a SKr6.5bn tranche of 7-year and 15-year bonds -
to be auctioned since his announcement of a bond boycott by Skandia, was 100
per cent over-subscribed.
What upset debt office officials in Stockholm was not Wolrath's anxiety
about the state of the public finances, but his bald assertion that there
was a risk that state debt might not be paid back. 'Wolrath is out on his
bicycle,' was the inventive suggestion of one angry official. That won't
bother him - Wolrath loves controversy.
Last November, he played a very public part in knifing Pehr Gyllenhammar, as
the former Volvo boss was desperately fighting to keep the merger with
Renault - and his job - on the road. As Volvo shareholders, including
Skandia, began giving the thumbs down to the merger, Wolrath and a colleague
wrote a devastating critique of the merger plan in Sweden's top-selling
quality newspaper.
Cynics of Swedish corporate pond-life suggested Wolrath was settling an old
score, as Gyllenhammar, himself a former Skandia chief executive, had been
less than supportive when Wolrath was battling against a joint takeover
attempt by Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia. Wolrath won that
battle, thanks to Skandia's strange share structure, obstructing any
shareholder from exercising more than one vote.
But though Uni and Hafnia were seen off - and broken in the process -
Skandia's remaining institutional shareholders have since forced the
adoption of a more regular system, as the price for stumping up for a share
issue earlier this year.
Even Bjorn Wolrath needs friends some times.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Leading Article: The wages of inequality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the 1970s, there has been a large increase in the inequality of male
earnings in the UK. This experience has parallelled that of the US and, to
an extent, Canada, but not that of continental Europe. A big component of
the future political battle, both within and between the parties, concerns
how best to respond.
According to a report on wage inequality published last week by the
London-based Institute for Fiscal Studies, the ratio of the earnings of men
in the ninetieth percentile of the distribution to those in the tenth (a
percentile being a hundredth of the total number, ranked by earnings) in the
early 1970s was 2.48 to one. By the late 1980s, this ratio had risen to 3.39
to one. While much more unequal than in Sweden or Norway, this distribution
was still roughly the same as in France and far more equal than in the US,
where the ratio was 5.58 to one.
The increase in male earnings inequality is only part of the story. There
has also been a huge decline in the number of men in employment, from 14.1m
in 1970 to 10.9m at the end of last year. Meanwhile, female employment, much
of it part-time, has risen over the same period from 8.5m to 10.6m. This
shift in the sex-composition of the employed labour force is associated with
the inexorable decline in the number of those employed in manufacturing,
from 39 per cent of the workforce in 1969, to 23 per cent in 1990.
In the UK, therefore, the decline in the demand for relatively unskilled
male labour has shown itself in an increase in earnings inequality and a
decline in employment. But, as the Secretary of State for Social Security,
Mr Peter Lilley, has also noted, the increase in the number of single-parent
households, is not independent of the declining prospects for male workers.
It should not be too difficult to accept that this pattern - unattached
males, on the one hand, and lone-parent females with inadequate income, on
the other - is socially undesirable.
More training
What is to be done? The standard call is for more education and training.
But this is far from a panacea. According to the IFS, even though economic
returns from education have risen over time and across generations, much of
the rise in earnings inequality has been driven by increases in inequality
among those with apparently similar education and experience. Furthermore,
it takes a long time to make large changes in the distribution of skills
across a population.
This leaves a mixture of carrots and sticks. One essential measure is to
eliminate the taxation of low wage jobs. Changes in national insurance
contributions have gone some way towards this, but not yet far enough.
Similarly, raising thresholds for income tax is a better way to encourage
people into work than the 20 per cent tax band unfortunately introduced by
Mr Norman Lamont.
Improved incentives
The abolition of all benefits would, no doubt, reduce unemployment, but it
would also increase earnings inequality. What is needed, instead, is to make
the benefit system more job-promoting. Mr Kenneth Clarke has, in fact,
raised expectations that in the November budget tougher benefit rules for
the unemployed might be accompanied by improved incentives for people to
take low paid jobs. The probable route would be an extension of family
credit.
At present, that credit encourages some family arrangements over others and
provides no help to those without children. The social security system also
discourages the spouses of unemployed people from taking work. What is
needed is to provide an incentive to all adult individuals to seek work. To
do this, family credit should become a more generalised earned income
credit. In the context of such a policy, the Labour party's beloved minimum
wage might become defensible.
Any reform to promote employment and raise family incomes of the poor will
be costly to the Budget, though the more successful the attempt to encourage
people into work the less that cost will be. But a small proportion of the
large increases in income that have accrued to the better-off majority could
be usefully spent in this way. There are ways forward. What is needed now is
not more tinkering, but systematic development of a more job-promoting tax
and benefit system.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incentive to make ships safer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HELEN B BENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's article, 'US 'black list' worries world shipowners'
(June 27), quite rightly pointed out many of the problems associated with
the black list approach to controlling sub-standard ships. While not denying
the value of the work done by some port state bodies, the escalation of
regulatory zeal embodied in the black list approach unfortunately is not the
solution to this world wide problem.
A better approach is the development of a 'white list' mooted by Paul Slater
of First International last year. This approach overcomes many of the
problems raised by Captain Joyce of the International Chamber of Shipping,
referred to in Charles Batchelor's article.
The white list would include only ships that meet clearly specified safety
criteria. Thus there would be substantial pressure on sub-standard owners to
ensure their ships are in a suitable condition to secure charters, to lower
insurance premiums etc.
Large-scale charterers could establish an inspection service, the results of
which they could share for a fee.
This alternative to the black list would be more effective as there is a
positive incentive for shipowners to achieve and maintain a position on the
white list rather than doing just enough maintenance to avoid being detained
if the ship is unlucky enough to be inspected by port state bodies.
As with the port state control solution there are costs of developing such a
data base, but these would be minimal in comparison since the onus is on the
shipowner to meet white list criteria by offering his ship for inspection.
The white list is a lower cost market based solution to the charterer's
problem of avoiding unsafe ships. Absence from the white list should
automatically attract the attention of regulators.
The list has an inbuilt positive incentive for compliance rather than
creating an expanding regulatory structure which can be abused by the true
targets of the legislation as easily as current legislation is avoided.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to try harder on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C R KEMP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In connection with the government white paper on pensions ('Pensions -
the white paper', June 24), dare one pose two questions?
1) Is the Treasury happy that social security secretary Mr Peter Lilley's
white paper (specifically on the minimum solvency standard) could have the
effect of depressing UK equity stocks for years to come, while being able to
write new government debt without fear of political reprisals for decades?
2) Is the actuarial profession so despicably greedy for fatter fees that it
has to devise age specific asset/liability solvency standards?
It is time to knock a few heads together (or off). Encouraging governments
to issue more gilts is, I contend, not a socially responsible policy.
Although actuaries are the best equipped to measure risk, their ability for
getting it wrong for UK plc is plain to see. One example is the unnecessary
pension surplus built up in the 1980s as a result of assumptions that were
too conservative and damaged corporate UK recovery from the early 1950s
recessions. Why should they take away the fairly basic commercial decision
from trustees, who can come to their own conclusions on what risk profile to
adopt, including actuarial advice?
Any minimum solvency standard would not have stopped Robert Maxwell; it
merely places an extra burden on employees' and employers' purses and the
only gainers are the actuaries, benefit consultants and the government's
borrowing requirement.
Thank you, Mr Lilley: now please try harder.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Bit more pain for future gain: New Zealand's economic
reformsare starting to bear fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, meets Paul Keating, his
Australian counterpart, this week, they are likely to discuss closer
economic ties between the two countries. But Mr Bolger might be tempted to
offer his neighbour a few tips about how to turn a highly protected welfare
state into a deregulated market economy.
Last week, Mr Bill Birch, New Zealand's finance minister, presented a budget
which showed a NZDollars 527m (Pounds 203m) fiscal surplus for the 12 months
to the end of June, the first by New Zealand for almost 20 years. The figure
surpassed the government's forecast a year ago, and its predictions now
suggest rising surpluses for the next three years. The first use for them,
said Mr Birch, was the repayment of foreign debt, which accounts for about
38 per cent of total net public debt.
Contrast that with Australia. There, as in New Zealand, recovery has come
more quickly than expected, and the economy is growing at a similar rate -
close to 5 per cent a year. So, like New Zealand, Australia has had the
benefit of higher than expected tax receipts, giving the government fiscal
leeway.
But in his May budget, Mr Ralph Willis, Australian treasurer, announced a
ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) deficit for 1994-95 (2.5 per cent of gross
domestic product), after ADollars 2.4bn of asset sales. Much of the 'growth
dividend' would be used to fund a jobs programme, costing ADollars 6.5bn
over four years. It will be the late 1990s, according to official estimates,
before Australia moves into surplus.
The comparison is only relevant because the two countries started from
similar positions a decade ago. Both had economies which were protected
behind high tariff walls; both labour markets were regulated and depended on
centralised awards; and industrial sectors such as telecommunications were
dominated by public sector monopolies.
The greater speed of New Zealand's reform process has already won
international praise. But there is no secret about the way in which the
budget surplus has been achieved - and no hiding the price. During the past
10 years, unemployment has soared as former government activities were
privatised in the interests of efficiency, and the new profit-minded owners
pared away unnecessary services. New Zealand's jobless rate peaked at more
than 11 per cent in early 1992, and currently stands at about 9 per cent.
Union power has been broken with the Employment Contracts Act, and wage
levels have fallen in real terms over the past decade. Schools and hospitals
have been reformed, welfare spending, including unemployment benefits, has
been slashed as the government has sought to lower its costs.
All this has led to substantial savings in government spending. Now that
recovery is under way, a virtuous circle is also taking effect, augmenting
the gains. The improving economy is leading to a sharp increase in tax
receipts as people rejoin the workforce. Lower wage bills are boosting
company profits, with the result that these are rising, again lifting tax
receipts.
In deciding how to use New Zealand's hard-won rewards, the economic
reformers, centred mainly in the Treasury, have coined one central word:
responsibility. Mr Birch said it would not be responsible to yield to the
demands of the three opposition parties which want more of the money used to
help the under-privileged - or, as they term it, a 'social dividend' in
return for the years of pain.
So Mr Birch has promised only minor increases in financial support for the
low-paid, the disabled and to schools.
It is easy to understand why Mr Bolger is being tough. The size of the
public debt, which stood at 39.6 per cent of GDP last month or NZDollars
35bn, is a nagging reminder that New Zealand's economic health is still less
than robust. Its external debt remains the main concern of the international
financial community. It was the main reason, for example, cited by New
York-based ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, for not upgrading New Zealand's
debt ratings earlier this year.
Tackling the debt problem would put New Zealand near the top of the OECD
league table, rather than near the bottom, as at present. As if to emphasise
the debt problem, the budget was prepared under the terms of a new fiscal
responsibility bill, which came into force on July 1, the day after the
budget. An important requirement of the legislation is a steady reduction in
net public debt. The government has set a target of reducing net public debt
to between 20 and 30 per cent of GDP by the year ending June 1997.
Mr Birch offset the tough budget by offering the prospect of NZDollars 1.6bn
in tax cuts in 1996-97. That would equal an extra NZDollars 980 in the
pocket of every wage and salary earner in that fiscal year.
The budget has been received well by the business community, both inside and
outside New Zealand - in marked contrast to Australia, where the
government's looser fiscal stance has prompted a furious public debate. Mr
Douglas Myers, the chief executive of Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in
Australia and New Zealand, said the budget would stimulate private sector
growth, while Mr Roger Kerr, head of the Roundtable, the influential big
business pressure group, said the budget gave New Zealand the best prospect
for years.
The New Zealand government must overcome several problems, however, to
succeed with its debt reduction strategy. First, as a trade-dependent
economy with a population of only 4m, it is counting on a continuation of
the improvement in the world economy.
Second, it must also negotiate the fluid domestic political situation. Mr
Bolger's government narrowly retained power in the general election last
November, and the next election will almost certainly be held under a system
of proportional representation rather than first-past-the-post. This is
likely to lead to some form of coalition government.
Mr Birch may be showing political astuteness, however. Polls conducted by
the Roundtable claim that 80 per cent of New Zealanders are prepared to
accept some pain for ultimate gain. Minimal social spending might be
acceptable if there is financial reward in the form of tax cuts down the
road. Mr Birch may be successfully wooing the 'middle ground' and isolating
the main opposition Labour party.
But voters proved impatient for change at the last election, and there are
hints that the next election may be little more than 12 months away. The
extent of the electorate's appetite for change may determine whether Mr
Bolger is still in the prime ministerial chair, offering more tips to his
Australian counterpart.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The centre of attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
The true dividing line in British politics runs through the Conservative
party. There are the Bastards, and there are the rest. The hallowed centre
ground lies between the two. The big Bs, so-named by the prime minister,
preach minimalist government, unregulated free markets, and the erection of
a huge stone wall, 50 miles high and 20 wide, along the length of the sea
channel that divides continental Europe from its most troublesome offshore
islands. Transferred to the United States, the Bastards would doubtless join
the conservative wing of the Reaganite faction of the Republican party. Some
of us would wish them luck as we waved them goodbye.
Nearly everyone else would be comfortable as a European Christian Democrat
or, in the US, a New Democrat. This includes the UK Liberal Democrats led by
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Labour party as it will be if and when Mr Tony Blair
takes charge, and the bulk of Mr John Major's cabinet. Funny about that last
lot. Several non-Bastard ministers have spent the last few days shuffling
towards the centre. It is their customary nervous reaction to rightwing
speeches.
The effect could be alarming. It has been calculated that if we all breathe
in and stand very still, the entire population of the world will fit on the
Isle of Wight. That is the condition of the centre ground in contemporary
Britain. Everyone is snuggling up to everyone else. Few dare to move, saving
an occasional upwards jump by Mr John Prescott. Certainly nobody, the Bs
aside, says anything truly controversial. Mr Ian Lang, secretary for
Scotland, warned his Conservative colleagues in his Swinton Lecture on
Sunday that 'ideology can become a substitute for thought, and an
ideologically driven party ultimately becomes a pastiche of itself, entirely
in the grip of ideologues applying uncritically yesterday's answers to
today's problems'. That is no way to talk of Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Michael
Howard, Mr Peter Lilley or Mr John Redwood.
Mr Lang left no phrase-of-the-centre unuttered. Conservatives work for an
'enabling ' society, an 'opportunity' society. They 'empower' people. The
'community' matters to Tories. What is more, 'there is a balance between
rights and responsibilities'. Some Labour leaders, not least Mr Gordon
Brown, might feel that they had a patent on such pragmatism. These are the
notions of the post-communist '90s, conceived after the heady triumphalism
of Reagan-Thatcher liberalism had begun to fade. Mr Ashdown has written a
book on the subject. All parties are groping for solutions in a
fast-changing world in which, as you and I know, there are none. It has to
be said for the shadow chancellor that his non-solutions are beginning to
sound better than they used to, and perhaps better than others on offer.
Put this down to political convergence. You can savour its effect by
studying Mr Blair's recent speeches. Last Thursday he spoke on the economy,
rephrasing Mr Brown's known ideas. On partnership between government and
industry he sounded like Mr Michael Heseltine. As to dividend policy, he was
the very model of the Treasury's Mr Stephen Dorrell. Training? Step forward
Mr David Hunt, who will promote exactly that in a speech to the TUC today.
Full employment? There is hardly a cigarette paper between the putative
Labour leader and our very own cheerful chancellor and putative prime
minister, Mr Kenneth Clarke. On education Mr Blair's speech yesterday was
equally encouraging. It offered a sensible execution of the proposals on the
national curriculum, standards, assessment and parent involvement implicit
in Mr Kenneth Baker's Tory education act of 1988.
This is not to deny the significant differences of detail between the
parties. Labour backs the minimum wage and accepts European labour
regulation; the Conservatives do not. One of Mr Brown's 'flagship proposals'
is a 'university of industry', a contemporary form of worker education. It
is so far unmatched by Mr Hunt. Labour would spend money on pre-school
education. The prime minister has spoken in favour of the idea, but not the
cost. The Tory education minister, whatsisname, has infuriated the teachers.
Mr Blair offered an olive branch - a General Teaching Council to
self-regulate the profession.
The similarities in the broad direction of economic and social policy are,
however, greater than the distinctions. In particular, Mr Blair has
acknowledged the relative impotence of demand management. Mr Brown has
disowned high taxation, devaluation, high spending and a quick dash for
growth. The Labour modernisers have become the apostles of sound money. Can
they do more? Yes. They might dare to criticise the railway signalmen, while
castigating the Railtrack management and the government. 'Tough on strikes,'
they might say, 'and tough on the causes of strikes.' Whether or not they
take up this friendly suggestion, they have done enough to assure us that
the creative aspects of Thatcherism would be safe in their hands. Now they
need to show what they can add.
The answer lies in Mr Blair's favourite word, renewal. This is where
Britain's Labour centrists differentiate themselves from their Tory
counterparts. The Conservatives, carefree dispensers of patronage, are deaf
to evidence that their network of quangos is an open invitation to
corruption in government. Their marketisation of health and education is a
good idea badly implemented. They will not hear of administrative or
constitutional reform. Mr Blair will shortly remind us of Labour's
commitment to civic reconstruction in local government, the regions, the
House of Lords and elsewhere. The theme of renewal of our democratic
mechanisms should provide an attractive wrapping to his economic and social
statements of values.
No wonder thinking Conservative centrists are scrambling to catch up on
Labour. The parties may not have starkly different ideologies to offer, but
Mr Blair's has the advantage of freshness, something new, different where it
counts, and safe. Above all, Labour is united. With Tories you get both
centrists and Bastards. You never know which lot is on top. The prime
minister appears to have been corralled by his predecessor's faction. At the
next general election Labour will therefore have a cogent story to tell. It
may even be believed.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beholden to no one but the client
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R D CORLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article of June 11 ('When he dies my dear, all this will be
yours'), Peter Marsh wrote: 'Although many independent advisers ensure that
clients get good value for money from respectable organisations, there are
many others who are forced to sell poor quality products because they are
tied agents trapped in a commission structure which requires them to sell or
starve.' I feel that the construction of the sentence could cause confusion.
The problem is with the use of the word 'many' twice. If this word is
deleted the confusion disappears.
To correct any confusion caused, it should be stated that 'independent
advisers' and 'tied agents' are distinct categories, and no one can be in
both camps; that independent advisers cannot be forced to sell poor quality
products - they are wholly independent of producers; and, to make the
difference even more plain, that independent advisers, alone, are the agents
of their clients and beholden to no one else.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM G POETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How interesting to read Mr Derek Sach's call (Letters, June 20) to
improve British banking through the abolition of the floating charge - the
sword of Damocles which hangs over so many excellent businesses in the UK.
Every meeting held by small business organisations is dominated by the lack
of confidence in the UK's banking arrangement for the small and independent
business sector. The perceived wisdom in the corridors of power in the Bank
of England these days is that banking for small business is much improved,
but sadly the real situation is the reverse 'out in the sticks'.
Mr Sach's recommendations should be carefully considered not only by the the
Department of Trade and Industry, but by the financial secretary to the
Treasury - as a matter of urgency.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: S Africa budget good first step to
let both rich and poor prosper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE GUISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your front page caption concerning the South Africa budget (June 23)
should not have used the phrase wealth tax, which sets exactly the wrong
tone in describing what the budget is attempting to achieve. Your leading
article ('South Africa's balancing act') is far clearer. The device of a
levy on normal income tax has been used by the South African government in
the past and to good effect. In this instance, the budget recognises the
legitimacy of a one-off call on the pockets of those with high incomes for a
specific step change in the economic infrastructure. The fact that those
with high incomes tend to have high wealth could be used to describe any
progressive income tax as a wealth tax, and this is not what South Africa is
trying to achieve. The new government is clearly determined to develop an
economy where both rich and poor prosper and this budget is an excellent
first step.
However, there is a major pitfall in the principle of increasing dividend
distribution tax while simultaneously reducing corporation tax. This will
encourage corporate managements to retain surplus earnings rather than
distribute them to shareholders. There is mounting criticism of the
interlinked and takeover-proof nature of South Africa's major corporations
which therefore have no true accountability to their owners as they would in
Britain and the US. This has already led to a tendency for reinvestment of
shareholders' funds in self-aggrandising projects with low marginal return
on capital, and there is danger that the increased dividend tax will be seen
as government support for this tendency.
Any such criticism could be rapidly nailed by trade and industry minister
Trevor Manuel's forthcoming review of investment policy. A more deregulated
capital market, with open competition for corporate control as exists
elsewhere, would enhance the return on capital of existing assets and
encourage inward foreign investment, which is currently restricted to froth
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Major corporations are only going to
come to South Africa with serious capital if they perceive a proper market
for corporate control.

<TEXT>
The passionate heretic who cries 'You fools] Why can't you see?' is a
fascinating and attractive figure. History shows that such people can be
right. Everyone from the Pope down insisted Galileo was wrong and godless,
literally a heretic, in backing the Copernican theory. Yet they were all
wrong and Galileo was right. It will be interesting to see how many of the
subjects of Heretic we end up believing. This new BBC2 series features six
men whose ideas have frightened others because they do not match established
patterns. (Goodness knows why they excluded the most glaring example, Peter
Duesberg, the main opponent of the HIV-Aids hypothesis. Surely not because
television has so much invested in the 'Equal fear for all' campaign?) The
first is Jacques Benveniste whose experiments appear to show that the theory
of homeopathy is right: the more you dilute a medicine, the more effective
it becomes (10.00). Documentaries about the Irish troubles are never
enjoyable, but during the years some have been striking. Creggan is one of
the best. Made in 1979 it is repeated by C4 in 'The Long War' season
(midnight).

FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: Intrepid impro and talent - Glasgow Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow itself may not be the most prepossessing of places, but it knows how
to put on a jazz festival. For the first ten days of July corners of the old
merchant city like the Old Fruit Market and the Ramshorn Kirk as well as its
innumerable friendly bars and cafes, resound to a canny mix of local
mainstream talent, intrepid impro and big budget, sure fire sell-outs.
This year we had the extraordinary reeds and bagpipes partnership of Dick
Lee and Hamish Moore occupying the same stand on different days as
experimentalist Lol Coxhill. Hardy perennials BB King and Al Green mingled
with hard-as-they-come boppers Horace Silver and Max Roach.
Like all proper festivals, Glasgow has a composer in residence. This year's
choice, altoist Bobby Watson, is at first an unusual one coming after grand
strategists George Russell and Carla Bley. But Watson is an accomplished
arranger - he was musical director of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers - and is
someone who can juggle several projects at one time.
Glasgow was clever enough to get the lot: the 29th Street Saxophone Quartet,
Horizon and also Watson as featured soloist with the Strathclyde Youth Jazz
Orchestra. On top of that Taylor Made, a seventeen piece conjunction of 29th
Street and Horizon, performed a suite commissioned by the Scottish Art
Council. Afroisms - The Spoken Word, a series of sweet running movements
which reflected the composer's key influences, featured swooning horns and
bright toned solo spots from trumpeter Melton Mustafa to baritone saxist Jim
Hartog. Watson, wiry and angular in appearance as in alto technique,
maintained momentum with his (apparently) breathless and beseeching
choruses.
Earlier in the day, a collective breath of the Fruit Market was being taken
away by the live guitar playing of Martin Taylor's Spirit of Django, a
return to the group's setting for the virtuoso guitarist. It is impossible
not to be hypnotised by Taylor on Reinhard - his links with the gypsy
guitarist are strong through a long association with Stephane Grappelli.
Accompanied by John Goldie on rhythm guitar and Alec Dankworth on acoustic
base guitar (not a base fiddle as is usual for 'Danktone') and the
mellifluous tenor sax of Dave O'Higgins, Taylor's treatment of classics like
'Nuages' and 'Minor Swing' is transcendental. Look out for a new album in
October on Linn Records.
In the dark of the Ramshorn Kirk a different kind of meditative exploration
was going on. Clarinettist, saxophonist Tony Coe and pianist John Horler are
two of our best but most illusive musicians. Putting them together for an
hour or two of sparse, gentle invention demonstrates inspired programming.
Coe, looking deceptively shambolic in his old cardigan, has a blue, burred
tenor sound and an intelligent, sneaky way with the clarinet that hooks the
listener and won't let go. Horler, missing an E flat on the keyboard,
sprinkled gold into improvised standards such as 'Blue N'Green'.
That duo's sympathetic insinuation was a far cry from the bombardment put up
by Herbie Hancock's new band at the Royal Concert Hall. Keyboards are a
strong feature of the Glasgow Fest with Ahmad Jamal, Horace Silver, Joe
Zawinul and Bheki Mseleku all at the ivories at sometime. Hancock, the Water
Melon Man, had three playing simultaneously in his highly funked outfit.
Heavily electronic, crushingly percussive new material from Dis is da drum
sees Hancock returning to pop territory.
The pianist has always had an ear for the deep groove and his tunes of 30
years back are sampled by today's hip-hoppers. Now he plays them at their
own game using samples to beef up his own afro-Latin sizzlers. In keeping
with the mood of the moment the new numbers take no prisoners, but where
Hancock's playing could be disinterred from the rhythm overkill, it sparkled
still.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: A 'Matter' of moment - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the South Bank's 'Meltdown' jamboree, the dire new Butler/Pruslin opera
last Wednesday might have been a burn-out. On Sunday, however, it recovered
for a sensational finish, with the British premiere of Louis Andriessen's
massive De Materie ('Matter'); the determinedly public terms of Andriessen's
magnum opus answered ideally to the 'Meltdown' brief - accessible to
non-specialist ears, powerful as music-theatre, but still uncompromisingly
new.
This Dutch composer has just turned 55. Like many another, he passed through
serialism to something else, inspired by the example of American minimalists
but not much like them. Though his work has enjoyed some currency among even
British avant-garde circles - where it made itself noticed by its roots in
jazz and 'street music', its abrasive colours and attack, its rigorously
formal patterns - it was always caviar to the general. De Materie (1984-88)
was conceived, however, almost from the start as a large music-theatre
piece, and in 1989 Robert Wilson staged it with eclat.
We heard it in the Queen Elizabeth Hall as a concert work. Its four
movements stood up admirably as a quasi-symphonic whole, but the Wilson
component might have been a bonus; most of the score is big-boned and stark,
without chamber finesses, and visible human detail would have filled out its
severest spans. For the 'Matter' of its title really invokes the
'materiality' of the human spirit - historical, communal and personal; and
Andriessen has used human documents both as blueprints for his structures,
pre-planned at 25 minutes each before he wrote the notes, and as texts.
The first movement begins with 144 shattering chords from the orchestra
(shrill at the top, with dirty snarls far below: very Andriessen) which
prove to evoke ship-building in in newly independent, industrious Amsterdam.
On the same chords the chorus chants part of the Dutch declaration of
independence from Spain (1588), and later a catalogue of ship's-carpentry
tools, after a solo tenor delivers a manifesto by an atomist philosopher of
the time. The proportions of the second movement, which sets mystical-erotic
words from the Seventh Vision of the poetess Hadewijch, are mathematically
derived from the dimensions of Rheims Cathedral.
The third - 'De Stijl', a gigantic boogie-woogie fantasy - is mapped upon
the dimensions of a Mondrian painting. The fourth and last is an elegiac
pavane: for a long time nothing but plangent alternating chords, then a
lyrical descant on a sonnet by Willem Kloos, and at last Madame Curie's
touching messages to her deceased husband.
But the heart of the whole sequence lies in the 'Hade-wijch' movement, where
Andriessen uses a ballad of his own as cantus firmus for a serenely
beautiful construction: a long chorale for vibrato-less strings leads to a
rapturous soprano solo (here Susan Narucki) with a sweetly inconsolable
close. That, at least, should compete with Gorecki, Tavener and Arvo Part
for popularity beyond the 'classical' norm. The whole work, nonetheless, has
a gritty, imposing integrity that makes it a kind of landmark amid the
current wasteland of uncertain experiments. Reinbert de Leeuw conducted the
Asko and Schoenberg Ensembles in it to sure effect.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: A desirable 'Manon' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first sign that something was wrong came when Manon cried out, 'I hear
the voice of my cousin approaching'. The trouble was that she did not. A
gaping silence ensued and in the following scene singers found themselves
addressing an empty space where the missing baritone should have been.
The unfortunate singer was Anthony Michaels-Moore, who had collapsed
backstage, leaving the opera without one of its three principals. It is the
regular practice of opera-houses to dismiss understudies on the morning of
the performance if all looks well, but the Royal Opera might consider a new
arrangement after this unhappy experience - the only blight on an otherwise
fine revival of Massenet's Manon.
Everything that was dear to Massenet can be found in Manon. The composer had
a fondness for beautiful women and beautiful sopranos in particular, which
finds its highest form of expression in his portrayal of the Abbe Prevost's
siren of femininity, the shallow but dazzling Manon Lescaut. So intimate was
his love for her that the opera seems like an amorous conversation secretly
overheard.
At one point the Royal Opera production captures that feeling to perfection.
As Manon and Des Grieux are swept away with uncontrollable desire, entwined
on the floor of the vestry at St. Sulpice, some of the clergy look on with
barely-disguised delight. It is hard to see anybody resisting the charms of
Leontina Vaduva's Manon. Sparkling, fragile, singing with sensitivity and
unabashed sexual dynamism, she is near ideal for the role.
These days, Vaduva could carry the opera by herself, but she is partnered by
a more than worthy Des Grieux. Giuseppe Sabbatini's stage persona may be
uncharismatic (a smile would help) but his singing makes up the lost ground.
He has enough reedy tone for the big moments and turns on the poetry for the
soft ones: a floated high A in his Dream solo melted into the air.
Although Sabbatini's French leaves a lot to be desired, there were signs of
schooling among the smaller roles. Robert Lloyd plays the Comte des Grieux
with aristocratic paternal authority. Richard Van Allan made a distinguished
De Bretigny and Philip Doghan a suitably fussy Guillot, while the three
good-time girls of Rosemary Joshua, Yvonne Barclay and Leah-Marian Jones
play their parts with zest. After so many spartan productions of late, the
old-fashioned sets for this Manon, courtesy of Fragonard, look almost
lavish. It is amusing, too, to see the crowd at the Cours-la-Reine buying
lottery tickets (a crafty in-house plug for the Royal Opera's case for
lottery money?)
Nevertheless, the architect of this revival's success was not to be found on
the stage. After a lifetime's championing of Berlioz, Colin Davis showed
that this cultivated opera thrives on the same kind of precision and energy
 -no sloppy rhythms allowed. It might seem a backhanded compliment to
commend Davis as a master of Massenet style, but there are precious few
conductors who are. On the first night this tender and passionate Manon was
an (almost) complete performance.
Further performances until July 21

FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: Masters turn to bronze - William Packer welcomes the
new foundry at Wimbledon Art School
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time of year when the students seem to take over with degree shows, it
is some considerable relief to find the masters' work exhibited. But Bronze
Works, at the Burlington New Gallery, is something else again. Wimbledon
School of Art is one of the few free-standing art schools left in the
country independent of any parent polytechnic or soi-disant university -
although its degrees must be validated by the Surrey University. Still, it
prides itself on being virtually unique as a degree-awarding institution in
retaining the designation 'school'; long may it continue.
Do we find some symptom of that independence of spirit in this present
project? Every art school, college or department of fine art must have its
sculpture school, which, one would have thought, would enjoy the facility of
a foundry. But it is not always so. I remember a foundry of sorts in my time
at Wimbledon over 30 years ago, but it was a small affair more for
demonstration than regular use.
Several factors have tended to conspire against the foundry, on grounds of
both practice and principle. Casting is expensive, in bronze especially so,
and any association with the old tradition of modelling from life would have
made its case less urgent, not more. But Wimbledon stands unregenerate - it
has even reintroduced the life-class as standard and is toying with the idea
of making its use an absolute requirement once more.
So with the foundry. A proper working foundry has been installed, which will
be available not only to the students but, for a fee, to working artists
from outside the school. In times when commercial foundries have been badly
hit financially and even forced to close, this is an important initiative.
To celebrate its inception, the staff of the fine art department and artists
associated with the school have been invited to try their hand. Hence the
show.
Some 20 artists have taken up the challenge, and all but two have employed
the lost-wax process of casting, which is about as traditional as you can
get. The technique was perfected by the Greeks in the days of their glory,
and was revived in the Renaissance with equal sophistication.
The artists here stick to the ideas and preoccupations that inform their
main work. To return to the figure or an academic image for the sake of the
old process would have been arch and inappropriate. But the painters
especially seem to have been stimulated by the opportunity and the fresh
cast of mind that an unfamiliar medium requires. Michael Ginsborg, for
example, with his 'Convolute', takes the sprung, linear tension of his
abstract imagery - so elegant, lyrical and refined in his paintings - and
transforms it into something no less elegant, but so much more active,
physical and robust in its three-dimensional presence.
For John Mitchell, the shift has not been so great, for his paintings have
long been set on the volumes and perspectives of the basic geometric figures
 -the cone, the cube, the pyramid and the rest - but here again the physical
weight of these elements, set now in the real, utterly transforms the
imaginative experience.
Other painters, by contrast, have been somewhat reluctant to leave the
safety of the wall in their venture into three-dimensions, but the relief,
with its pictorial properties and its sculptural presence, is an authentic
and fascinating form that plays both ends, as it were, against the middle.
Prunella Clough plays for real, for once, the formal games she has long
played so beautifully in her paintings, setting up a plane or field against
which more active elements or figures then come and go, elements that might
as well be abstract or descriptive - here, as it happens, a cloth that is
both at once. And Colin Painter, more obviously theatrical, shows a relief
that must have been a tour-de-force of casting, with its lace curtains drawn
aside to show shallow protruding planes. There is, of course, much else
besides.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Waste regulation sustained - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An action brought by the European Parliament against the European Council
challenging the legal basis of the council regulation on the supervision and
control of shipments of waste in the European Community was rejected by the
European Court of Justice last week.
In 1990, the European Commission put forward an initial proposal for a
council regulation dealing with the supervision and control of waste
shipments within, into and out of the EC. It was based on provisions of the
Rome Treaty relating to the internal market and the common commercial
policy. The European Parliament was consulted.
In 1992, the Council decided the correct legal basis for this legislation
was in fact the treaty provisions dealing exclusively with the environment.
Those gave the European Parliament fewer powers of influence in the
legislative process.
In spite of protests from the Parliament, the Council adopted the regulation
on February 1 1993 with the changed legal basis.
The Parliament brought an action against the Council for annulment of the
regulation. It argued the parts of the regulation dealing with the shipments
of waste between member states, exports and imports, plus transit of waste
from outside through the EC for disposal or recovery outside the EC, should
have been based on the single market and common commercial provisions in the
Rome treaty.
The Council, supported by Spain, argued the proper legal basis for the
regulation was the environmental provisions of the treaty even though the
regulation did have an impact to an extent on competition in the Community
and trade with third countries.
The Court ruled the Parliament's submissions on the provisions relating to
the common commercial policy were not admissible as those provisions did not
foresee any decision-making role for the Parliament. Parliament was only
entitled to bring actions such as the present case in order to safeguard its
own powers. This was not the case with regard to the common commercial
policy.
The Court then dealt with the question of the legal basis. It said the
choice of legal basis for any given Community act had to be founded on
objective factors which were amenable to judicial review. Those factors
included in particular the aim and content of the act in question.
It found from examination of the regulation's recitals that the system
established for the surveillance and control of shipments of waste between
member states was based on the need to preserve, protect and improve the
quality of the environment, and that the system envisaged that the
authorities would take all measures necessary to protect human health and
the environment.
It also found that the organisation for such surveillance and control of
waste shipments came within the Community legislative framework on waste
generally, the aim of which was to reduce the movement of waste.
As to the regulation's content, the Court found that it set down certain
conditions and procedures for authorising the inter-state transfer of waste.
The conditions and procedures were adopted in order to guarantee
environmental protection and, in particular, they allowed member states to
prohibit waste transfers.
The Court thus ruled the regulation came within the framework of
environmental policy rather than that relating to the internal market in
that it did not seek to regulate the free circulation of waste within the
EC.
The Council had therefore been right to base the regulation on the
environmental provisions of the Rome treaty. This was so even though the
operation of the regulation could have an impact on the working of the
internal market.
The mere fact that the establishment or operation of the internal market was
somehow affected through the operation of a given act was not sufficient to
justify that act having as its legal basis the internal market provisions of
the Rome treaty. It was only when there was more than just an incidental
impact on the internal market that the position might change.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Fraudbusters' unsure future - Robert
Rice on the possible merger of two UK prosecution organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six years after the UK's Serious Fraud Office was set up to tackle serious
and complex fraud, its future is in the balance. A government review has
recommended the merger of the SFO and the Fraud Investigation Group (Fig) of
the Crown Prosecution Service.
No decision will be taken until feasibility studies into whether the SFO and
CPS should become executive agencies, outside the civil service, have been
completed. Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, will then decide whether
the SFO should be expanded to incorporate Fig, or whether the merged body
should be placed under the control of the Crown Prosecution Service.
His decision will determine whether responsibility for the fraudbusters
should remain with Mr George Staple, current director of the SFO, or pass to
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions and Mr Staple's
predecessor.
The review, chaired by Mr John Graham, a Treasury official, and published
last week, favoured subsuming the SFO into the CPS. If the government opted
for that solution, it would raise questions about why the SFO was
established as a separate body in the first place.
Mr Paul Phippen, a fraud lawyer at City solicitors Macfarlanes, pointed out
the SFO had been set up as a discrete office because Fig was considered
incapable of providing the specialist service required. But a number of
high-profile failures by the SFO, such as in the Blue Arrow, Levitt and
Nadir cases, means many lawyers now believe Fig is doing the better job.
The review, which was set up to investigate the cost-effectiveness and
efficiency of the two organisations, carried out a comparative study. The
SFO and Fig have different powers and approaches to combating fraud: the SFO
was set up to investigate and prosecute serious fraud; Fig advises the
police on investigations and handles subsequent prosecutions. Both deal with
complex or serious fraud, although the SFO handles only cases involving at
least Pounds 5m.
The SFO's budget for the current year is Pounds 21m and it employs 21
lawyers. Fig has a budget of Pounds 10m and employs 30 lawyers. At the end
of November last year, the SFO had 51 cases on its books and Fig had 450.
However, more than 40 per cent of Fig's case load was not considered serious
or complex by the group's own lawyers, and the review concluded that such
work should be devolved to the CPS.
The review also found considerable overlap in the work of the two bodies -
so much so that it said it was anomalous to apply such different methods to
what in many instances were similar cases.
This similarity has increased in recent months, as the SFO's case load has
declined and it has taken on smaller cases that it might otherwise leave to
Fig. The Maxwell prosecution is the only large case now on the SFO's books.
The review warned that, unless this issue was addressed quickly, the SFO
would have increasing spare capacity.
The review found scope for improvements in management information and case
management systems. Fig had few useful systems in place, while the
effectiveness of the SFO's systems was not being fully exploited. Some SFO
investigative work had been undermined by the absence of clearly defined
responsibilities for the investigation. In both organisations, there was no
formal management overview of important prosecution decisions, and in the
SFO no overview of vital investigation decisions.
The SFO's powers under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 to compel
those under investigation to answer questions, removing the right to
silence, had proved effective, said the review, and should be extended to
the police and to Fig.
It also noted the SFO had expressed concern about the lack of effective
control over the police officers seconded to work on cases, and endorsed a
review of current arrangements between the police and the SFO.
Both organisations needed to make better use of outside barristers to
improve efficiency. They could make greater use of in-house lawyers for
pre-trial work, and generally bring in counsel to advise at a later stage
than at present.
Overall, the lack of consistent comparative data about case loads, costs and
results meant the review was unable to draw firm conclusions about the
cost-effectiveness of either body's approach.
However, the available evidence suggested that, although the SFO dealt with
the largest and most complex cases, its superior resources and section 2
powers had not produced a consistently better conviction rate than Fig.
The review recommended short-term improvements in management and
organisation, and in the longer term a merger of the two bodies. In spite of
its finding that section 2 powers had not improved the SFO's success rate,
the review said the chief advantage of merger would be the extension of
these powers to all serious fraud cases.
Establishing the new body under the SFO could be done immediately, but
subsuming the SFO into the CPS would require primary legislation, which
would be impossible until 1996. Nevertheless, the review team felt that
placing the SFO within the CPS would offer most benefits. These included the
support structure in the CPS, reduced administrative costs and greater
ability to vary resources to meet changes in case load.
It recognised, however, that establishing a new body with an investigative
role as part of the CPS would be a big departure from present policy. The
new body would need to be 'ring-fenced' in a separate group within the CPS
to prevent any further extension of such powers to the prosecution of other
crimes.
Do these recommendations provide the answer to the present difficulties of
the SFO? Most fraud lawyers are sceptical. Mr Phippen said he could not see
them making any difference to the issue of how to prosecute substantial
frauds efficiently and cost-effectively.
'If I was very cynical, I would say it was a way of getting rid of the SFO
'tag', which has been an obvious target for poor publicity,' he said.
Mr John Clitheroe, senior partner of Kingsley Napley, said the proposals
might produce efficiency improvements, but he was alarmed by the proposal to
give section 2 powers to the police. 'I think that would be a very material
step in the wrong direction,' he said.
The original purpose of the section 2 powers was to enable the SFO to obtain
information on the background to a case. They are very different from the
procedures followed by the police under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
codes, which had been designed to ensure fairness in interrogations, he
said.
'I fear this is part of the seemingly inevitable process of diminishing the
protections given to the citizen in criminal investigations,' he said. 'It
would establish a momentum towards compulsory interrogation as a matter of
course. The police will say: 'Why can't we have section 2 powers?' I would
have thought the dangers of that have been amply demonstrated by the
miscarriages of justice we have seen over the past 20 years.'
Whatever happens to the SFO, the real question is whether it will make any
material difference to the battle against serious fraud. Lawyers remain
unconvinced. Much may depend on the outcome of the Maxwell trial this
autumn.

directly to court - Legal Briefs

<TEXT>
Individuals will be able to apply directly to the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg from October 1. This follows ratification of Protocol
Nine to the European Human Rights Convention by Romania, bringing the number
of nations that have done so to 10 - the number required for it to come into
effect.
Under article 25 of the convention, any person claiming a human rights
violation can bring an action against the state responsible by applying to
the European Commission of Human Rights. If the commission cannot reach a
friendly settlement of the issue, it makes a finding on the facts as to
whether there has been a violation. At present, only the commission or the
state concerned can refer a case to the court.
Under the new system, the individual concerned will be able to apply to the
court. A panel of three judges will then decide whether the case should be
heard. From October 1, the protocol will come into force in the 10 states
that have ratified it: Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Romania and Slovakia.

FT  05 JUL 94 / People: TSB's Smallwood joins Makinson Cowell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Smallwood, 46, the TSB's strategic development director and
Sunday Express columnist, is on the move again. He is becoming a partner in
Makinson Cowell, the City investor relations firm which helped Lasmo defeat
Enterprise Oil's unwelcome takeover bid last week.
Smallwood fills a slot left by John Makinson, one of the founders of the
five year-old firm, who was appointed managing director of the Financial
Times earlier this year. Smallwood will be one of four client partners who
each look after half a dozen big companies.
Smallwood, who is also the TSB's chief economist, differs from the rest of
the partners in that he does not have a stockbroking background. He started
out as an Oxford academic and joined the Cabinet Office when Harold Wilson
was prime minister. He then moved to the Treasury as an economics adviser,
followed by two years as policy director of the now defunct Social
Democratic Party, before joining BP Finance International as head of
financial strategy. He was economics editor of the Sunday Times between 1986
and 1989.
When Smallwood joined the TSB five years ago it was intent on becoming a
broadly-based financial services group. However, the group has reversed its
acquisitive strategy and is now concentrating on just two core businesses,
retail banking and insurance. Having completed his task of helping refocus
the TSB's strategy Smallwood says it is time to move on.
Archie Kane, 42, director of operations at the TSB's retail bank, will take
over as the TSB's head of strategic development when he leaves in September.

Quin joined Seeboard five years ago from Emap, where he was group finance
director. In that time he helped usher the electricity company through
privatisation and the big shake-out that followed. Seeboard has been one of
the most aggressive of the regional electricity companies in tackling costs
and this is now paying off in rising profits.
Headhunters have been called into find a successor for Quin, who will retain

FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Clark's chemistry for overseas development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commonwealth Development Corporation, the UK's overseas development
finance institution, is getting a new director of managed business, Bob
Clark, 56, (right) who is retiring at the end of June from his post with
ICI, where he was chief executive of ICI Explosives. He is replacing Colin
Gatt, 59, who is retiring after 23 years with the CDC.
Part of the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), the CDC engages in
all sorts of project financing, ranging from Pounds 7.9m for an orange juice
plant in northern Costa Rica, announced earlier this month, to a seed farm
in Malawi.
A year ago, the CDC was given UK government approval to start operating in
Vietnam. The CDC is now looking to open an office in South Africa later this
year; it is likely to be the conduit for some Pounds 40m of funding to the
newly-democratised South Africa over the next three years.
The CDC has been operating for 46 years, initially as the Colonial
Development Corporation but in 1963 adopting 'Commonwealth' in place of
'Colonial'. It is now involved in some 240 projects in more than 50
different countries. Most of the projects are agriculturally-oriented;
investments exceed Pounds 1.6bn, with 85 per cent of the projects now in the
private sector.
The CDC has an enviable managerial record, for a government-backed
institution; it employs fewer than 500 staff to run its worldwide projects,
with annual running costs well below many other international financial
institutions. Britain's Mergers and Monopolies Commission gave the CDC high
marks in June 1992, for, among other things, its cost controls and cash
management. Cash-generative from its own past investments, it is currently
able to invest some Pounds 200m annually in new projects; it does not any
longer have 'fresh funds' from the government.
As director of managed business, Clark will be responsible for administering
those operations - some 30 of the largest - in which the CDC takes a
managerial role, by having a seat on the board as well as investing funds.

FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Harwood leaves UBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Len Harwood has resigned as head of debt capital markets at UBS in London, a
post he had held since November 1991.
Simon Crisp and Tim Streeter will continue to act as joint heads of the
bank's Eurobond syndicate desk.
They will now report directly to John Giannotti, head of syndicate and
origination for the European region. It has not yet been decided whether to
replace Harwood. UBS rose to 4th position in the league table of Eurobond
arrangers compiled by Euromoney for the first half of 1994, up from 8th
place a year ago. The debt capital markets unit is part of the debt and
treasury division run by Richard Briance, who was hired from CS First Boston
in 1991.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Leave it to the other guy
 -Richard Gourlay looks at two extreme examples of outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
Behind the World Cup competition in the US lies an unusual organisation.
Using a dazzling array of computers, it provides adminsistrative and
information support for all aspects of the games through network links
between the 12 football grounds.
This organisation did not exist before the games and will be disbanded after
the winners' victory parade. While the competition is in full flow, however,
World Cup USA 1994 is the ultimate virtual company from which all functions
are contracted out to specialists.
Meanwhile, as of yesterday, London has its own virtual company, in the form
of the Parking Committee for London. The body takes over responsibility for
parking enforcement on behalf of London's 33 local boroughs from the
Metropolitan Police and traffic wardens.
Both World Cup USA 1994 and the Parking Committee are extreme examples of
outsourcing - the sub-contracting by companies of non-core activities to
outsiders - that is being adopted by businesses of all sizes. International
Business Machines says the market for outsourcing is worth Pounds 7bn a year
in the UK.
There is clearly an opportunity for companies - often small ones - that take
over other businesses' chores. But smaller companies also have an
opportunity to outsource some of their own back-office functions.
'The question is: do you want to do a certain function yourself or is it a
non-value adding activity that you want to buy as cheaply as possible,' says
John Goble, financial administration business manager for IBM UK, which has
just launched two companies to tap the outsourcing market. 'The question
applies to a 20-person company as much as to a 20,000-person company but
there is a reluctance in smaller companies to approach people like us.'
Ultimately, the theory goes, companies will perform only those functions
where they add greatest value. Goble says IBM could consider taking over
functions as varied as customer order taking, distribution, invoicing, and
the management of car fleets and payroll.
The World Cup USA 1994 organisation is a particularly hi-tech example of
outsourcing; a network of Sun Microsystem computers is linked by Sprint
fibre optics and co-ordinated by EDS, the computer services company owned by
General Motors. But the Parking Committee for London is outsourcing not only
its IT needs but also more mundane tasks.
Although the organisation expects to process Pounds 200m worth of fines and
charges a year, Nick Lester, the chief executive, decided that he only needs
a handful of staff - chief executive, finance director, appeals adjudicator,
a public relations co-ordinator and a skeleton support staff. EDS, which won
the Parking Committee for London contract, will do the rest.
The contract itself was relatively novel. EDS was simply told what the
Parking Committee wanted and asked to provide everything to make that
service possible. 'The contract with EDS was based entirely on a performance
specification,' says Lester. 'We said don't supply us with bits of hardware
that will do this and that but provide us with the service.'
The specified tasks include telephone reception services for drivers whose
cars have been clamped or removed; administrative support for the appeal and
adjudication service; a common computer link with the 33 boroughs; liaison
with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority and the County Court in
Swansea; a clearing house system for payments; and management of the
persistent offender database.
Why did London's boroughs not contract out management of the entire
ticketing operation? In the first place, the Parking Committee for London is
a statutory requirement of the 1991 Road Traffic Act. Also, says Lester, 'We
are making certain we get the policy right and make sure others do their
jobs according to the policy.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): JCB's venture offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to corporate venturing, the practice of big companies
making equity investments in private businesses?
It is in rude health in the US, less so in the UK, is the verdict of
University of Southampton researcher Kevin McNally. But it is not as
moribund in the UK as its recent absence from the limelight might suggest,
he says.
Supporting this assertion last week was an unusual open offer to engineers
from JCB, one of the UK's biggest private companies and maker of the
ubiquitous yellow construction equipment.
Sir Anthony Bamford, JCB chairman, has invited designers, inventors and
companies with under-funded engineering projects to contact his company with
ideas which need backing*.
Based partly on altruistic interest in the development of a stronger
manufacturing base in the UK and partly on self-interest, Sir Anthony
believes many more companies have the potential to follow JCB's successful
path if given an early and understanding leg up.
He is coy about the total cash on offer. But he suggests up to Pounds 1m
could be available for the right projects.
JCB, he says, is not looking for a quick return. It would also lend the
services either of an executive director or a nucleus of recently retired
directors to pass on JCB experience.
JCB's move appears to be going against the trend towards concentration on
core businesses that has so far marked the 1990s. Indeed, several companies,
notably BP and Hillsdown, have closed their corporate venturing arms in
recent years. But there is a sign of renewed interest, McNally says,
particularly from some UK utilities seeking to diversify.
However, past experience suggests converting that interest into a cheque may
yet be a hard struggle.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Know your customer -
Manufacturer Cumana nearly learnt the hard way about the dangers of
guesswork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By rights Cumana, a maker of floppy disc drives for the BBC Acorn
microcomputer, should not have survived the 1980s. Rarely since slide rules
were swept aside by pocket calculators has technological change dealt such a
sudden blow to a company's fortunes.
Sales of Cumana's biggest-selling and most profitable product fell by about
two thirds in 1991 as demand for the Acorn microcomputers requiring floppy
disc drives fell sharply.
Toy and fashion designers may be used to handling such violent swings in
demand. But how do manufacturing companies survive such a sudden loss of
market, particularly if they lack the resources to back a risky change of
direction? And how can companies anticipate and avoid some of the pitfalls?
Cumana's fall followed a decade in which the BBC Acorn had been one of the
more successful early mass market computers. Launched in the early 1980s,
the Acorn quickly took off in primary and secondary schools, where it was
ideal for the rigours of the classroom.
Guildford-based Cumana designed and built peripheral disc drives and became
a near-monopoly supplier. It was a small company in the right place at the
right time.
Even after Acorn collapsed in the mid-1980s and was rescued by Olivetti of
Italy, sales of its microcomputers remained firm. Cumana saw that its
dependence on Acorn made it vulnerable but it continued to enjoy healthy
margins.
Then, processor technology changed quickly. The old 8-bit technology was
fast replaced by 32-bit processors in computers, where typically floppy disc
drives were integrated into the machine. Sales of Cumana's floppy disc
drives fell dramatically.
'In round figures, sales fell from Pounds 3m of the company's Pounds 4m to
less than Pounds 1m in one year,' says John Simnett, Cumana's managing
director who arrived in 1991. 'Our customers were moving on to more recent
systems that did not require our type of product - mainly the Acorn
Archimedes which did not require external (floppy) disc drives.'
Adding to Cumana's problems, the company had also made two unfortunate
diversifications. It had tried to reduce its dependence on Acorn by making
other products; first there were drives for Atari - profitable until Atari
was hit by rival Commodore - and latterly for Omega Computers, where demand
was strong but margins were continuously squeezed.
However, Cumana also started developing newer technologies, such as early
CD-Rom and magneto-optical disc drives. The problem was that its customers -
the schools - were not interested. 'Cumana's history can be summed up as
going into a product too early,' admits Don Bolton, the company's founder
and largest shareholder who has since withdrawn from an executive role.
'The company never linked the development to customer requirements,' says
Simnett. 'It was on a suicide path. It was building up an awful lot of
stock.'
While anticipating where markets are going is essential, racing too far
ahead of customer needs is dangerous. It is also a common mistake, according
to Liz Clarke, consultant and author of a book on change management. 'There
is a danger in not listening to your customers and getting over-excited with
the technology,' she says.
Next, Cumana moved away from its known customer base in the schools and
started trying to sell CD-Rom drives to utilities and to brewers who wanted
a way of updating games in their pubs. 'We pushed away from traditional
customers - educational budgets were constrained - and tried to get into
utilities and some leisure customers, but we did it as recession took hold,'
says Bolton.
Cumana's rehabilitation since Simnett's arrival has been partly successful.
Sales have recovered to Pounds 4.7m, two manufacturing sites have been
combined and the company is working closer than ever with Acorn.
The transition to a new product line required some radical surgery. The
first thing Simnett did was write off nearly Pounds 500,000 of stock that
was obsolete or not wanted by customers. He then had to deal with the bank,
which had extended facilities of Pounds 650,000. Almost overnight the bank
saw the balance sheet slashed to nothing as the stock was written off, at
the same time as the main market was collapsing and the company was still
groping for a new direction.
Ten percentage points disappeared from gross margins in Simnett's first year
as the company cranked up production of Omega disc drives to keep the
skeleton workforce employed. And, not surprisingly, Simnett and Bolton had
to put up personal guarantees and cash to support the company's banking
facilities.
Simnett then gathered most of the remaining staff together in a room with
flip charts to brainstorm how the company could go forward. After
considering pursuing interactive video, magneto-optical drives, karaoke
drives, and even general distribution, Cumana decided to focus on the
handling of stored data through CD-Rom technology.
It also determined to get back in touch with its customers. Distributors
were dropped, which not only improved margins but just as importantly helped
Cumana gain a clearer idea of what customers wanted. 'Guessing where the
market is going is one thing we have tried to avoid like the plague,' says
Simnett.
The strategy had an early payoff when Cumana won part of a Pounds 500,000
government contract to supply CD-Rom drives to primary schools. 'It was the
first contract defining who the players were going to be. There was Toshiba,
Sony, Hitachi and little Cumana,' Simnett says.
The company is not entirely off the hook. It remains highly dependent on one
customer, Acorn, and one product, the CD-Rom drive. While it is developing a
networked multimedia product and hopes to do OEM manufacture, the fact
remains that it could be significantly damaged if Acorn were to decide to
fit its own CD-Rom drives.
But Simnett feels Cumana is now better equipped to avoid past mistakes. The
company will now embark on product development only on the back of orders
from a known customer, he says. And any technological development has to be
firmly backed by demand from an existing market rather than based on their
estimates of what the market might one day become.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Technology: The games and how to play them
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stranger's face was familiar. It was Peko-chan, a popular character who
has advertised sweets for Fujiya, a confectionery maker, for as long as most
Japanese people can remember.
'Hello,' Peko-chan said. 'Glad to meet you.'
'Glad to meet you too,' the monster-like character we had chosen to
represent us on screen said. 'Where are you right now?'
'I'm at home,' Peko-chan replied 'Where are you?'
'We're in Akihabara,' we replied. 'In Fujitsu's showroom.'
We had met Peko-chan at the Oracle Fountain, a popular meeting place in
Habitat, a virtual world of the computer screen where humans meet behind
digital masks to socialise anonymously.
Habitat is accessible through a multimedia network Nifty-Serve, operated by
a subsidiary of Fujitsu. The virtual society boasts an active community on
computer with a population of 9,000 at the latest count, many of whom have
come to know each other well, but only on screen.
The idea of creating a virtual society came from the studio of George Lucas,
the US film director of Star Wars fame, but was licensed and marketed for
the first time by Fujitsu.
The goings on at Habitat, a society whose citizens can assume whatever sex,
name, history or personality they want and where nobody has to disclose his
true self, have offered such a revealing illustration of human behaviour
that many behavioural scientists have joined the community for their
studies, says Takashi Ochiai, general manager of Fujitsu's personal services
division in
Tokyo.
Everyone who becomes a citizen in the Habitat community gets an avatar, or
computer figure, which is either male or female, as well as several hundred
tokens as spending money.
The avatar's head is interchangeable and heads can be purchased in vending
machines throughout the community. His pockets are large enough to store
several heads.
If a citizen of Habitat wants to assume several personalities he can do so
simply by keeping a stock of heads in his pocket and pulling out a different
head whenever he wants to become someone else.
In the initial stages of Habitat, the heads presented one of the biggest
social problems. Unscrupulous characters would run away with other people's
heads left briefly on the road as they were changing them.
More happily, several Habitat citizens have been married on screen, though
so far only one couple has been united in real life.
Residents' tax for Habitat citizens is Y300 (Pounds 1.90) a month and
communications costs are modest at a little over Y10 a minute.
But the attractions of life in Habitat, which offers 400 locations for
inhabitants to roam, are such that enthusiasts can spend hours and several
tens of thousands
of yen living in this virtual
world.
Peko-chan, a citizen of Habitat for the past four years, told us that he
comes to Habitat, or logs on to the system through his computer, every day
for about one to five hours at a time.
'I usually come at night,' Peko-chan says. 'I like to talk to people in
Habitat, because I can express myself better,' he explains.
Peko-chan has met several people through Habitat. He has met some of his
Habitat friends outside the computer world and chats regularly with them on
the telephone. 'My phone bills are my biggest problem,' he says.
Chiaki Sonoyama has been invited to the country home of Senshu Sakuragi, the
head of a famous family which has been carrying on the tradition of Japanese
dance.
But before Chiaki arrives at the Sakuragi home, Yosen, the eldest of the
three Sakuragi children and heir apparent, is poisoned and dies.
A writer of mystery novels herself, Chiaki sets out to try to solve the
puzzle of who murdered Yosen and why. Like the popular American computer
game, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, the player of this multimedia
game must choose his own clues and follow his own instincts to solve the
mystery murder. The drama takes different twists and turns depending on the
player's judgment about what may have happened.
What is appealing to a Japanese audience is that 'The Murder at Kurama' uses
live video footage, with popular stars playing the parts and filmed
settings, including scenes of the ancient capital Kyoto, where the drama
unfolds. In order to add depth and motivate players to try different
options, the producers of the game have provided different conclusions
depending on how the game is played.
As with this mystery, live video footage is increasingly being used in
advanced video games. Matsushita's 3DO Real boasts clear moving video images
that are made possible with the use of a 32-bit Reduced Instruction Set
Computing (Risc) chip, and two especially powerful semiconductor chips that
have been incorporated into the machine to process the graphics.
Compared with semiconductor chips in conventional games machines, 'the
difference is similar to that between having a tunnel dug by three normal
people and having it dug out by three body-builders,' explains Kenichi
Tsumura at Matsushita. 'The power that 3DO Real has to make pictures is
about 50 times as great as normal games machines.'
Unfortunately, crisp video graphics are difficult to attain in full motion
so the effect is somewhat jarred pictures when characters are in action. But
Tsumura notes that this will be improved when Matsushita brings out an
adaptor to bring the full-motion video up to the MPEG-I standard.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Technology: Not at all quiet on the home front - Multimedia
means different things to different people but, everybody wants to be
involved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's electronics industry, with its leading-edge technologies and
manufacturing capabilities, is expected to play a major role in ushering in
the age of multimedia.
Some companies, such as Toshiba and Sega, are already involved in multimedia
tests in the US or, like Matsushita and Sony, have forged strategic deals
with US leaders in the field.
But when it comes to their own plans to bring multimedia to the masses,
Japanese electronics makers display an uncharacteristic lack of confidence.
'I don't think ordinary citizens need so much information,' says Tsuzo
Murase, an executive vice president of Matsushita who has played a key role
in the company's multimedia strategy.
Privately, many admit that they still do not have a very clear idea of what
multimedia is all about and where it is heading. 'The word multimedia covers
so many things that it is difficult to define,' says Takashi Ochiai, general
manager of the personal services division at Fujitsu. 'Telecommunications
companies, broadcasters and manufacturers each have different views of what
multimedia is.'
Opinion is also divided over whether multimedia will take off first as a
business tool or as a high-tech entertainment gizmo. But if there is one
thing that everyone agrees about it is that whatever multimedia turns out to
be, they will want to be involved in it in some way or another.
So, overcoming their instinctive reservations, the forerunners in the race
to bring out multimedia machines are taking a two-pronged approach of
attacking both the home and the business markets at the same time.
In the home market, many equipment makers are convinced entertainment games
and educational software programs will provide them with an entry into the
multimedia market. 'Games are the easiest form of multimedia,' says Mikio
Higashi, Matsushita executive in charge of information equipment.
The approach taken by this camp has been to bring computing and
communications capabilities to the television set. Matsushita, for example,
has launched 3DO Real, a machine based on technology developed by 3DO, a US
company in which it has a stake. The machine can play CDs, CD-Roms and CD
Video.
The 3DO Real machine can be connected to cable TV and phone lines.
Matsushita plans to enable users to hook up to communications networks in
Japan as well as to the Internet. It will also be able to serve as the
terminal for multimedia services, such as home shopping and video-on-demand.
And once Matsushita comes out with a keyboard for 3DO Real, later in the
year, the machine, which Higashi notes has the capabilities of a
workstation, will be able to serve as a PC in the home. 'There are so many
applications that we don't have to worry about what to do with the machine,'
Higashi beams.
For the time being, however, Matsushita is hoping that a steady increase in
its games titles (see below) and the launch of a game based on the popular
film Jurassic Park will boost sales of 3DO Real, which has suffered from
having to compete with lower-priced conventional games machines made by
Nintendo and Sega.
'Multimedia is a software business,' Higashi says. It will provide
Matsushita with an attractive way to use its software assets, acquired
through MCA of the US, and most of the profits from 3DO Real will come from
the software. 'We want to make 3DO Real a practical product that every
family will want.'
As services and technologies advance, Matsushita will incorporate the CD-Rom
drive and PC board that give 3DO Real its intelligence, directly into the
TV, Higashi says. Meanwhile, Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, has
adopted a different approach, using a multimedia PC, called FM Towns, and a
more consumer-oriented cousin, called Marty, as entries into the home
market.
The original idea behind FM Towns was to make the PC easy enough for anyone
to use. Some 55 per cent of sales have been to home users, 35 per cent to
schools and just 10 per cent to businesses. Marty, which was launched last
year, connects to a TV and plays the same software as FM Towns.
Both FM Towns and Marty use CD-Roms and, in addition to CD-Rom games and
data, play music CDs, karaoke CDs and photo CDs. Users can create their own
data on screen which can then be captured on a floppy disk. Both also serve
as terminals to access a variety of communications networks.
In Air Warriors, one of the games applications that can be used either on FM
Towns or Marty, the player connects into the communications network and
flies his aeroplane through the landscape that appears on screen. If other
players connected to the communications network want to join in, they can
form a team and 'talk' to each other in much the same way that PC users on a
network send messages.
Eventually, as advanced telecommunications networks, such as integrated
services digital networks, become more widespread, players on the network
will be able to hear each other speak, rather than send messages on screen,
says Ochiai.
FM Towns and Marty will also serve as terminals for services such as screen
shopping and video-on-demand. In future FM Towns and Marty are likely to
offer the capability to link up with cable TV.
Fujitsu emphasises the potential of its multimedia products as an
educational tool rather than just a games machine. It also believes they can
be used more widely as marketing tools, in showrooms, for example.
Meanwhile, both Fujitsu and Matsushita have kept their options open for the
business multimedia market. Fujitsu has an installed base of 40,000 FM Towns
PCs in the office market while Matsushita recently introduced a PC that can
show video and TV on screen.
But given the currently low penetration of basic PCs in the Japanese office,
the home market in Japan may be a more promising starting point for
multimedia. Murase, for one, has put his PC away. 'I never used it and it
was taking up too much desk space,' he says.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (5): Gemport blazes a trail -
Industrialists are calling for more infrastructure projects in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As you enter Turkey's first privately run port, the potholes on the roads
suddenly disappear. Even the noxious orange fumes from the nearby state-run
fertiliser plant seem part of another world.
For Gemlik Port and Warehousing Administration - or Gemport - with its
modern infrastructure, smartly painted loading bays and contract labour
force, is a good example of the efficiency gains to be made where private
sector initiative takes over in an area traditionally monopolised by the
state.
Privately owned by Mr Mohamar Agim, a local textile manufacturer, the port
is managed and run by Capt Ziya Alkan, a former head of the state-run ports
authority, who was pulled out of retirement to do the job.
Gemport in many ways typifies the developments now sweeping through the
Marmara region, as private sector developers who have a direct stake in
seeing the area sustain its impressive growth rate take the initiative.
For the local authorities, deprived of funds, are no longer able to meet the
needs of local industry. Tofas, the Fiat car subsidiary in Bursa, has
installed its own water treatment plant and may now invest in its own
dual-fired power unit to ensure supplies to its factory. The Sabanci group's
Kordsa tyre cord facility at Izmit is looking at a similar proposal.
Drive to the area from Istanbul and the challenges are not hard to see. The
journey to Bursa takes at least 2 1/2 hours on badly maintained roads,
choked with heavy goods traffic, and includes a 45-minute ferry crossing.
The journey to Izmit is less onerous, making use of the Ankara motorway.
However the real problems are apparent when you arrive in the city, a place
of subterranean gloom, with petrochemical factories belching forth, and a
paper pulp plant right in the heart of the town centre.
'All the pollution you can imagine: we have it here,' says Mr Yuksel Baser,
head of the Izmit chamber of commerce. 'Fifty years ago, if we had a new
factory everyone was celebrating. Today we would be happy to see some of the
business move away to an industrial zone where you can control it.'
For the Marmara is a regional trading hub, a choke point on the main axis
between Turkey and Europe, intersected by the principal supply arteries,
such as the gas pipeline from Russia, the trans-European highway and the
shipping routes from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and the newly
independent countries of the former Soviet Union.
The Gemport facility is now Turkey's fourth largest container handler -
after Hydarpasa in Istanbul, Izmir and Mersin, Turkey's main transit port -
and handles a variety of cargo from steel and steel scrap to cars and timber
and coal.
Gemport is in direct competition with the state-run ports at Bandirma and
Izmit to supply the fast-growing industrial area around Bursa, home to the
Turkish textile and car industries.
Currently, activity in the complex is running at reduced levels because of
the economic downturn affecting Turkey. Last year, bananas from Ecuador were
one of Gemport's main import items. Today the number of banana boats has
dropped dramatically as the economic crisis bites. Last year the quayside
was also crowded with imported cars, as Turkey's consumer boom boosted the
imports of European and Asian autos. Today the only item which is visible is
the black coal and a vast tangled nest of tropical timbers.
The coal, Capt Alkan explains, is a high quality South African product which
the Bursa municipality is using to fuel industrial and residential housing.
Even coal could soon be a thing of the past as the region, like many others
in Turkey, converts to gas, supplied by the pipeline which is now linking
Turkey with fields in Russia.
The general economic slowdown, particularly the drop in the volume of
imports resulting from the economic squeeze, will certainly affect the
tonnages that Gemport and other ports handle in 1994. Many of the local
industries, however, hope to boost their exports this year. At the nearby
Tofas car plant - a joint venture between Fiat and the local Koc Holding -
Mr Jan Nahum, the general manager, proudly points to the crates of CKDs
(completely knocked down car assembly kits) all ready and packaged for
delivery to Egypt, and other destinations via the Gemlik terminal.
Much will, of course, depend on an early resolution of the crisis, but many
local industrialists believe top priority should be given to infrastructure
projects in the Marmara region. The projects include:
A new gas terminal at Tekirdag, taking liquefied natural gas from Sonatrach,
the Algerian state-run company, commissioned by Botas, the state-run
pipeline company last month.
The next spur of the inter-city gas pipeline which is already supplying
Bursa is also being constructed by Botas.
A Dollars 700m water supply and dam project at Izmit, in which Gama, one of
Turkey's best known contractors, is linked with Thames Water in a project
part-financed by Japanese funds. It is one of two deals which Gama hopes to
clinch by using the Build Operate and Transfer method of private financing,
in which a private developer runs the plant for a concession period, taking
financial and other risks before eventually handing it over to the state or
government utility.
A dual-fired gas power station which Gama hopes to construct with the UK
engineering group Enron, at Marmaraeregli, near Tekirdag, is the other
project. This has been masterminded by the John Wing Group, one of the
world's leading private power developers.
A crossing of Izmit Bay from Gebze to Orhanghazi is planned. A design
project was awarded in December to Canada's Delcan group and the local Dap
consultants. The bridge would have a 3.5km span and incorporate a large
2-3km viaducts on each side.
Bursa city municipality has a number of projects, including a water supply
and sewerage contract under a Dollars 117m loan from the World Bank. The
first phase of the city's gas conversion project is under way with around
90,000 homes or almost half the city's population to be linked up by the end
of 1994. British Gas and other contractors await the municipality's decision
to tender for the second phase. The city authorities announced in early June
the cancellation of the planned Metro project, which was estimated to have
cost around Dollars 400m, after warnings from the Treasury in Ankara to
limit new foreign borrowings.
There is even talk of a bridge to span the Dardanelles near Cannakale in a
bid to divert some of the traffic now transiting Turkey for destinations in
the Middle East and which currently creates such congestion around the
Istanbul peninsula.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (7): Tuna from a distant ocean - Profile
of the country's leading processed seafood manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's the shoes that give him away. Most Turkish executives would not be seen
dead in a pair of brown loafers in an office in the heart of Istanbul. But
then Mr Haluk Arpad of Onen Sirketler Grubu is different from other
businessmen. And as general manager of Turkey's leading processed seafood
manufacturer, he probably feels more comfortable dressed as a seadog than a
city slicker.
The company, based in Canakkale on the Asian side of the Dardanelles, is
Turkey's largest producer of canned tuna. It hopes for a stock exchange
listing later this summer, under the name of Dardanel, its most famous
brand.
Audited figures are not available, but the company is estimated to have
turned over Dollars 51m in 1993, more than double the sales of two years
before. The company is the first entrant to the canned tuna market, and has
an established brand name. Domestic markets for the product remain fairly
immature, while the export opportunities seem vast. In addition the company
has invested in state-of-the-art technology - the main reason for the
flotation of what could be as much as a 20 per cent stake.
All this may be a little surprising. For the tuna is not actually caught in
the Dardanelles, which with the pollution of the Marmara Sea is not one of
the region's cleanest stretches of water. The tuna is bought from Spanish
and French deep sea fleets fishing the Indian Ocean.
Mr Arpad makes a point of buying what is called EU origin fish - essential
if the product wants to hit supermarket shelves in Europe, where the group
makes 40 per cent of its total sales.
The company is in many ways a pointer to the future. In contrast to the
region's heavy industry, the Onen group represents the sort of medium-scale,
labour-intensive industry which many analysts believe will be the big
winners when Turkey eventually opens its markets and finds its real
comparative advantage. 'There is no machine in the world that can clean a
fish,' says Mr Arpad, pointing out the line of operators, most of them
women, busily reducing massive chunks of tuna to the perfectly shaped fish
wedges with which most consumers are more familiar.
Location is important. The company has its own loading pier near the
factory. There is also the advantage of low wage costs, which Mr Arpad
estimates are probably a tenth of European levels. The workers he employs
are paid on a premium basis, an incentive system which would probably not be
allowed if the industry were unionised - another important commercial
advantage.
The company was started in 1983. It concentrated on frozen produce: shrimps
for the Spanish market and baby clams and mussels for Italian buyers - all
the seafood coming from local waters.
While canned tuna is a relatively new line, the company has been exporting
frozen produce for more than a decade and has good contacts with European
traders.
In 1994 the company expects its exports to be worth Dollars 35m, 65 per cent
of which will be from the canned tuna factory. 'The European Union is a very
big market,' says Mr Arpad. 'There's no quota and no import duty.'
Unlike other processed food products such as tomatoes, seafood products do
not suffer from EU quotas. Indeed, the company is selling canned tuna to
France, Italy, Germany and the UK - it is selling under its own brand name
to the French.
A labelled product, which is canned with olive rather than vegetable oil and
carries the words 'prodotto en Turchia' is now sold in Italy. Mr Arpad says
penetrating the Italian market with own brands is all but impossible. In
Germany and the UK, the company varies the strategy again, adding brine to
the fish. The Germans, Mr Arpad says, tend to concentrate on price, not so
much on quality. 'For that reason we prefer to sell there using their
brands.'
The company is now negotiating with a large Italian food distributor. 'In
tuna we want to sell brands. Our Dardanel brand is now registered in all the
European countries,' says Mr Arpad. It is also registered in Turkey,
although he is less confident about being able to protect his intellectual
property in his home market.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (6): Why the car factory is at a
standstill - Reduced shifts and lay-offs at Tofas spotlight the problems of
the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the only sign of life - a security guard in uniform and peaked hat,
pedalling his bicycle around the factory floor, like a character out of a
silent movie.
Normally, the plant would have been drowned by the hum of machinery, but
today Turkey's car industry is entombed in silence, at a virtual standstill,
perhaps the most conspicuous casualty of the current economic crisis.
The scene at one of the car plants in Bursa is today almost commonplace
throughout the industry, as managers are forced to send workers home and the
economic downturn takes its toll.
It's not all misery, says Mr Jan Nahum, general manager of Tofas, a joint
venture between Fiat of Italy and the local Koc group. He believes the car
market can bounce back if the government adopts a more accommodating
attitude. Last year's sales figures, he concedes, were a little abnormal -
abnormally good. However, he believes the market is still barely penetrated,
the road network is being extended every year and the long-run picture for a
country of Turkey's size must be positive for a car producer.
Nonetheless, the slowdown could hardly have come at a more awkward time.
Turkey is preparing to enter a customs union in 1995 and the auto sector in
particular has been striving to get ready for the loss of protection once
tariff barriers come down.
The issue is of national importance, not just for the number of workers
whose jobs could be threatened if a precipitate rush to freer trade results
in loss of market share for the domestic car producers. The car industry,
with the two main industrial families - the Kocs and Sabancis - now
involved, represents a powerful lobby. According to Prof Ercan Tezer of the
Automobile Manufacturers Association (OSD), the private sector umbrella
group, the industry invested around Dollars 1bn last year to upgrade plant,
increase capacity, make progress in automation and efficiency and launch new
models.
Bursa, more than any other city in Turkey, is dependent on the car industry
 -with the country's two largest producers - local subsidiaries of Fiat and
Renault - located there. Together with the components industries, Mr Erdem
Saker, the Bursa mayor, estimates the car sector accounts for around 50,000
jobs.
The crisis is nowhere more dramatically illustrated than at Tofas, which has
been on reduced shifts since the beginning of the year, and on June 1 was
forced to terminate the contracts of 2,400 workers, around a quarter of its
labour force.
Tofas says its management had looked at all other options. Workers had had
their annual holiday brought forward. Almost 800 jobs had been lost through
natural attrition - early retirement and military service, while temporary
work contracts were not renewed.
It was a double blow for the company. In February, after the government
decided to make an international offering of its 21 per cent stake in the
car company, Tofas was forced to open its books to the sort of audit
scrutiny which would make most Turkish executives uncomfortable.
Tofas has since seen its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) lose up to half
their value and, at home, its market has been devastated as the car sector
became the most visible victim of the crisis. International investors who
subscribed to the issue, on the advice of J Henry Schroder Wagg and the US
bank Lehman Bros, must be wondering whether they made the right decision.
The switch in fortunes has certainly been dramatic. 'You should never see a
factory like this,' says Mr Franco Grimme, who has been plant manager for
nine years, surveying a empty shopfloor where the machinery and jigs are
caught in suspended animation during one of the company's recent shutdowns.
Last year, production by contrast, was in a state of almost perpetual
motion, with three eight-hour shifts - Tofas even worked on the August
Independence Day.
In 1993, on the back of a general consumer boom in Turkey, car demand grew
by 30 per cent. Tofas produced almost 200,000 units, with 40 per cent of its
sales financed by consumer credit. Local producers were unable to meet the
demand, leading to a surge in imported vehicles, with around 100,000
vehicles shipped to Turkey, according to industry estimates - mainly Skodas
from the Czech Republic and Russian Ladas.
Today, however, the picture has changed. Mr Nahum predicts that total car
sales in 1994 will be around 250,000, including imports, compared with over
350,000 last year. In December, for example, the company's output was 774
cars a day in three shifts. Last month the number was 450, much the same
volume that the company produced in 1991.
'We'll be doing well if we can return to last year's levels by 1996,' says
Mr Nahum, whose father Bernard helped establish the Koc car empire in the
1950s. 'But we believe we can keep our market share.'
This, it seems, is now the bottom line for the car companies. It explains
why even in a deep sales trough, the market has seen the launch of new
models. Toyota, with which the Sabanci group is in partnership, is speeding
up plans to put its first locally manufactured Corolla on the road later
this year. Renault's local joint venture, in which the French company is in
collaboration with Oyak, the armed forces pension fund, has just launched
its RI9. 'Everyone is preoccupied with launches to prevent sales shifting to
the competition,' says Mr Nahum.
There have also been moves to increase production inside the factory by
reducing the outsourcing of components. In a normal year this exercise helps
to reduce costs and take advantage of economies of scale.
Today, however, the management's main concern is to look after its immediate
workforce. The fuel tank construction which Tofas was to subcontract to an
outside producer is now being made on site - all part of the official effort
to maximise job hours in these straitened times.
Nonetheless, some of the investments which would have gone ahead have been
put on hold. Also, many of the investments which have been made to introduce
new lines are underutilised as a result of the slowdown. 'This will remain
idle and empty and waiting for an upsurge in demand,' laments Mr Nahum, as
the company visit reaches one of the new production facilities.
Overhanging the industry is concern about the customs union, which, barring
upsets, should be in place in 1995. A report by McKinsey's, the US
consultants - which the car industry commissioned - suggests that the local
manufacturers need an additional five years to be ready for the import
competition.
Senior car executives have been in discussions with the government on
possible tax breaks in a bid to help reduce costs and boost sales. But with
the bureaucrats in Ankara also suffering from the absence of air
conditioning and other indignities inflicted by the austerity programme,
there is little sympathy for their cause.
'We are only now at a critical mass to be able to compete,' says Mr Nahum.
His prediction is simple enough. 'If the Turkish car industry has problems,
the Turkish economy will continue to have problems.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (3): Thermal baths and grass skiing - The
region's attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can no longer swim in many parts of the Marmara. Indeed, the Union of
Marmara Municipalities even produces a map designating which areas are safe
 -and they are rapidly shrinking in number. But there are other attractions
in the region:
Bursa
Once one of Turkey's grandest cities, Bursa has suffered slightly from the
pace of development. Nonetheless, you can wash off the grime of the city in
one of the thermal baths. The best is the well-preserved Ottoman 'hamam' in
the Kervansaray Thermal Hotel, where for less than Dollars 5, you can soak
in a marble pool and have a massage. There is even an outside pool fed from
the same spring, with water at a pleasantly tepid 32 degrees.
Gallipoli
The Commonwealth and Turkish war graves in the Dardanelles peninsula remain
a popular destination, particularly for Australian and British tourists. The
graves are wonderfully tended by a young Australian botanist, Mr Jeffrey
Mish and his Turkish wife. 'We try to plant a combination of local flora and
also flowers associated with the countries who lost men here,' he says.
Iznik
A sleepy town now, this ancient centre was the site of the Council of 325
which has set the ground rules and was a landmark in western ecclesiastical
history. Iznik is also famous for its tiles.
Uludag
The slopes of Mount Olympus, or as the Turks call it, the great mountain of
Uludag, attract an increasingly international set of ski fanatics. Mr Erdem
Saker, the new Bursa mayor, is a keen ski enthusiast and represents Turkey
on the grass ski committee of the FIS, the international ski federation.
Bursa hosted the world grass ski championships in 1991.
The Bears of Bursa
No, this is not an American football team, but a project co-ordinated by the
local university veterinary faculty to create a sanctuary for the Ursus
Arctos, the dancing brown bear, once all too familiar to tourists on the
streets of Turkish cities. The scheme is being aided by experts from the
London-based World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). The project
managers are currently looking after 19 bears, all of whom were rescued from
the streets and their gypsy minders. Now the bears are being trained to
recognise electric fencing before being sent to the newly constructed
25-acre sanctuary at Karacabey, near Bursa.
Other curiosities
Constantine died near the Ankara road, although there is little to mark the
spot today. Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, committed suicide near
Iznik.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (4): Tyre cord company sees potential in
exports - Kordsa is cutting costs to improve efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'You won't find this in any factory in Europe,' says Mr Akif Azizoglu, the
plant manager, pointing to a strange arrangement of strip lighting suspended
above the looms at the Sabanci group's Kordsa tyre cord factory, just
outside Izmit on the northern shores on the Marmara.
Cost savings are a principal preoccupation of the company, as it prepares
for Europe and the approaching customs union with the European Union, which
is scheduled to come into effect in 1995.
Ms Guler Sabanci, the 39-year-old general manager of Kordsa, talks of almost
nothing else. 'Sales and profits may be reduced but by improving our
efficiency we can more than make up for it. Looking at our cost, we have
done everything possible to be ready,' she says from her office in the new
Istanbul headquarters of this family-run conglomerate.
Kordsa - the 'SA' being the signature of all Sabanci companies - is the only
tyre cord factory in Turkey, the first company to be located at Kentsa, the
Sabanci industrial complex near Izmit, and the first Sabanci company to list
shares on the Istanbul stock exchange.
The company has been going through a tough patch in recent years, with new
investments raising financial costs. Kordsa reported pre-tax profits of
TL105bn in 1993, a decline of 21 per cent in real terms. Sales were up by 63
per cent, although this was barely in line with inflation.
Ms Sabanci believes the market is undervaluing the company. Certainly, the
share price has underperformed the market, increasing by 272 per cent in
1993, compared with a rise of more than 400 per cent for the index as a
whole. In the first quarter this year, Kordsa has fallen by 57 per cent,
again rather worse than the rest of the market.
The main problem has been heavy borrowing expenses, which accounted for 12
per cent of costs. There was also a cash squeeze early in 1993, related to
payment arrears on business with Iran, which forced the company to make
short-term bank borrowings.
The company, like others dependent on the health of the car sector, is
likely to be hard hit by the downturn in automotive demand in Turkey's
current economic slowdown. However, brokers believe the long-term picture
looks fairly robust, with the company enjoying an apparently impregnable
position in the domestic market and a growing presence as an international
supplier.
Kordsa is a 100 per cent Turkish company, unlike the other companies on the
site - Brisa, a tyre joint venture with Bridgestone of Japan; Dusa, a
polyester link-up with Du Pont of the US; and the most recent arrival Beksa,
a steel cord collaboration with the Belgian steel cord maker Bekaert.
The Sabanci group is in good company - both Pirelli and Goodyear are located
nearby. Uniroyal, which used to have a link with Sabanci's industrial
rivals, the Koc family, has since pulled out of Turkey.
Starting with technology provided under a licensing agreement with Goodyear,
Kordsa has now developed home-grown technology for a wide range of
processes. Indeed, Kordsa is selling know-how under a joint venture
agreement with the Egyptians called the Nile Kordsa company. The Sabanci
group's 40 per cent equity stake represents the machinery, supplied to the
Egyptian venture which started production in 1993. 'It's Kordsa technology,
both the process and product technology,' explains Ms Sabanci.
Kordsa now produces 24,000 tonnes of tyre cord a year, as well as a number
of other industrial fabrics including conveyor belt liners. The company uses
a variety of suppliers apart from Dusa, including Allied Chemical and
Hoechst.
'We are operationally quite independent,' insists Ms Sabanci when asked
about the allegations of transfer pricing with the other group companies.
'Each makes its own five-year plan. We're independent and self-sustaining.
However, we're never alone.'
The vertical integration of related production facilities is a vital part of
the Sabanci business strategy. Kordsa has a captive market in Brisa's tyre
production. Equally, the more recent investment in the Du Pont joint venture
provides the group with a reliability of supply in what is a fairly
specialised market. On the surface, the arrangement is not that cosy. As Ms
Sabanci explains: 'For example, we sell to Goodyear, Brisa's biggest
competitor.' But as she is the first to admit, 'we need to protect Kordsa.
We have to have a reliable supply with a reliable cost.'
Kordsa's cost-cutting programme is now in its third year. Company officials
estimate it has reduced costs by 25 per cent, shrinking the workforce,
introducing new machinery such as the new German-built yarn twisting machine
and improved team work, saving scrap material.
Like many Turkish companies, Kordsa was spoilt by the low cost labour
environment enjoyed in the 1980s. 'We were too relaxed,' Ms Sabanci
concedes. With such high domestic borrowing costs, companies were forced to
become over-capitalised.
Ultimately, Kordsa's real strength lies in its export potential. Despite the
collapse of the Soviet market, where the company enjoyed a growing presence,
Kordsa expects to increase its export share this year, with more than half
of the production now destined for overseas markets.
A large slice of that will go to Iran. Mr Azizoglu estimates that 30 per
cent of Kordsa's exports are for that market, although trade continues to be
disrupted by Tehran's recent payments crisis, resulting in some stock
build-up at the plant.
However, he is realistic about being able to make up for the loss of the
local demand. 'We think we can compensate for some portion, but to cover it
all, that's impossible.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (2): A canny move by Koc - Processed
tomatoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beating the Italians at football - well, Turks can only dream of that.
Beating them in the production of peeled tomatoes, however, is a much more
realistic prospect. That, at least, is the prediction of one Turkish company
 -Tat Konserve Sanayii - which believes that Turkey could one day supplant
Italy as Europe's best known tinned tomato producer.
Tat, despite its slightly unfortunate name, is the shining light in Turkey's
processed foods firmament, a market leader in tomato paste manufacturing and
trading and one of the most dynamic companies in the Marmara region.
Turkish food concerns are proving some of the most attractive equity
investments for foreign institutions. Apart from natural advantages such as
soil and climate, Turkey is seen to enjoy relatively cheap labour, a large
and growing consumer market and good export potential. Tat leads the pack.
Floating a 10 per cent stake on the Istanbul exchange last year, Tat's
shares have advanced by leaps and bounds and now stand at almost six times
the issue price - and this against a background where many stocks have
faltered in the wake of the currency collapse. Analysts say the company
appears to be relatively sheltered from the impact of Turkey's economic
crisis. 'It hasn't yet shown its face in our industry,' says Mr Ahmet
Toygar, the deputy general manager. 'The farmers planted their seeds long
ago, and now they're harvesting the produce.'
What the farmers planted last autumn, the company is now selling as a
processed product. With as much as 70 per cent of production now destined
for export, the company is earning handsome profits. Global Securities, one
of Istanbul's biggest broking houses, forecasts earnings could rise to
TL850bn in 1994 from TL109bn last year - a phenomenal growth rate given the
contraction of many economic sectors in the wake of the lira crisis and the
austerity measures instituted by the government.
Things are even said to be looking up at the frozen products arm where the
company has been suffering from growing inventory costs, with some reports
that the factories were refusing to take fruit and vegetables from
suppliers. Brokers say the market anticipates a sharp improvement in
performance if Tat is successful in its bid for Sek, the government-owned
dairy concern.
Sek has a distribution network delivering daily to some 35,000 grocery
stores, which Tat can use to expand the market for its own range of
products. However, after submitting a bid of TL520bn for the Istanbul-based
dairy a couple of months ago, the company is still awaiting a decision from
the government in the wake of union objections that the state-owned
enterprise was being sold off too cheaply.
Tat is the brainchild of Mr Vehbi Koc, Turkey's best-known industrialist,
the founder and at 93 the honorary president of this eponymous Turkish
conglomerate. Mr Koc is said to have first developed the idea for Tat after
a visit to the citrus groves of Israel in the 1950s. A decade later, with
some help from a Mr Fuller of Heinz - remembered by one company official
simply as 'Mr Tomato' - Tat was launched.
The company has three factories, processing about 7,000 tonnes of raw
vegetable a day. The plants include the one at Mustafakemalpasa in the farm
belt near Bursa - the original investment. Tat then acquired the Karacabey
factory, in partnership with Oyak, the army's pension fund. In 1989, Koc
swapped its Aymar vegetable oils company for Unilever's Dosan plant near
Iznik. Tat is today considering a new investment at Balikesir which, being
further south, will allow the company to diversify its production cycle and
thus improve plant utility rates.
The company's success derives from a number of factors - the backing of a
strong Turkish parent which brings a good domestic franchise; an equity
link-up with a major international buyer offering access to one of the
fastest growing world markets; and an approach to manufacturing which gives
the company control of the product from seed quality to the tomato delivered
to the factory.
Mr Toygar says the company has one other key advantage over its rivals - its
hands-on relationship with the farmers. Unlike in California, the world's
most concentrated tomato production area, the level of mechanisation remains
fairly modest, which Mr Toygar says results in better quality and colour of
the fruit. The farmers, all of them smallholders, are contracted to Tat, and
provided with seeds fertiliser and most important, finance. 'Everyone of our
farmers has his own computer number,' says Mr Umit Guvenc, the sales
manager, with pride.
Rivals commend Tat's management approach, pointing out that 'the factory
boss is quite likely to find himself raised to the group production
manager,' as one Istanbul fruit company executive put it.
The input is not all homegrown, however. Tat now uses a processing
technology called reverse osmosis, which was first developed by the US
Pacific fleet during the second world war to extract salt from sea water.
'It's very near to the fresh flavour,' says Mr Toygar. Traditionally tomato
processors used an evaporation technique. The main advantage of reverse
osmosis is that the enzymes and vitamins remain in the fruit and are not
burnt away as they were under the traditional evaporation technique for
processing tomatoes.
The decision to link with Kagome - which controls over half the Japanese
tomato paste market - gave Tat its big break. Tat has an exclusive
arrangement and is Kagome's largest supplier. Tat has even persuaded its
Japanese partner to relocate part of its Italian peeled tomato facilities to
Turkey - perhaps the most telling measure of Turkey's growing international
reputation as a supplier.
It all started in the 1960s. In 1967, in a typically canny move, Koc sought
out the government-owned sugar beet factory as a partner. Seker Fabrikasi's
stake in Tat was sold only last year, as part of the government's
privatisation programme. Originally a national company, Tat had a sourcing
arrangement with Heinz of the UK. The company then invited the Swiss Migros
group to take a 3 per cent stake in 1977, which was later sold in the wake
of prime minister Bulent Ecevit's anti-foreign investment drive.
In 1987, the company sold a 7 per cent stake to Kagome, a well-established
foods group famous in Japan for introducing (the now ubiquitous) Worcester
sauce. When in 1992, the state-owned Sugar Beet Factories sold its 8 per
cent share, the Japanese - Kagome and Sumitomo - increased their collective
stake to around 15 per cent.
Today, apart from its branded products which are sold in the wholesale
market in Japan, Tat's main customers are the big food groups. 'We're
supplying Nestle in Malaysia and Unilever in Brazil. We don't sell to the
trade,' says Mr Toygar.
After the US and Italy, Turkey is now the third largest producer of tomato
paste. Tat controls 35 per cent of the domestic market. The company reported
exports of TL393bn in 1993 - about Dollars 30m at the prevailing exchange
rate. Its main market is Japan, but Tat also sells to North Africa and
Middle East and despite quotas on tomato paste and peeled tomatoes enjoys
quite big sales to some EU countries. Mr Toygar believes with the lifting of
quotas, Turkey's share of the EU market could increase tenfold.
Now is perhaps the time to invest. After the initial public offering last
August at TL7,500, Tat trades at around TL42,000. And as one broker
enthused: 'Foreigners are now buying and they're buying to keep.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (1): Bustle in a former backwater -
Turkey's fastest-growing region and industrial heartland is an important
export centre that still needs to resolve infrastructural and pollution
problems. This survey was written by John Murray Brown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is 10am and Bursa's silk bazaar is starting to stir, as farmers empty
baskets full of tightly-spun white balls onto wooden trestle tables. Today,
the cocoon auction, which in former times would have attracted the city's
most powerful business names, lasts barely an hour and seems little more
than a tourist curiosity.
For across the Marmara region, as industries come of age, tradition is
giving way to modernity. An area, which 30 years ago was a quiet back -
water where Ankara civil servants took their well-earned summer holidays,
has today become Turkey's fastest- growing region, an important export
centre, the home of Turkey's best-known brand names, and a nursery for some
of the country's most innovative public infra- structure projects.
The reasons for the decline of the silk industry are not just that the
region has cut down many of its mulberry trees. Merchants in the Bursa cloth
arcades are doing a lively trade selling material from China. However, the
real heart of the city's textile production is no longer to be found under
the vaulted ceilings of the Koza Han, but in modern facilities on the dusty
plains below the city.
The Ottomans, before capturing Constantinople, established Bursa as their
first capital, attracted by its thermal springs and good air. The
environment may have suffered somewhat, but the city is now the centrepiece
of Turkey's auto and textile industry, and the focus for the rapidly
developing food processing sector. It is also the uncrowned centre of a
region which abuts the Marmara sea, stretching from Istanbul to the
Dardanelles to the west, and encompassing the vast indefensible Thracian
plains on its northern shore and the orchards of Mustafakemalpasa on its
southern reaches.
Istanbul is not dealt with in detail here. Nonetheless, some mention of
Turkey's largest city is vital to understanding the region. For what the
authorities in Istanbul do, particularly in the disposal of their sewage,
vitally affects the towns and villages which border on the Sea of Marmara.
The Marmara, or the Propontis as the ancients called it, is caught like a
bubble between the Black Sea and the Aegean. Its waters are already
dangerously polluted. A project has been launched, with funding from the
European Union, to monitor pollution levels using a mobile measurement and
monitoring system.
Attempts are also being made under the auspices of the Union of Marmara
Municipalities to co-ordinate the policies of the region's 280 town halls,
which encompass 10 provinces. But as Mr Fikret Toksoz, the union's secretary
general sees it: 'The main problem is that no one knows what anyone else is
doing.'
The instances of co-operation between local authorities are all too rare. In
Izmit, Thames Water, the privatised UK utility, is looking at a scheme to
provide potable water not just to the Izmit municipality but also to
Istanbul, where the supply of water has taxed city planners since Byzantine
times. Agreeing terms has so far proved difficult.
In Bursa, the municipality's main grumble is over tax. Mr Erdem Saker, the
mayor, says that many of the industries in his region have their head
offices in Istanbul. As a result, their tax payments, on which municipality
funding is based in Turkey, go to boost the coffers of the Istanbul mayor
instead of the Bursa city hall, which has to foot the bill to provide the
infrastructure for these industries.
At Izmit, there is another equally pressing problem. Mr Yuksel Baser, the
head of the local chamber of commerce, says the region's economic growth
rate, which is twice as high as the Turkish average, is providing a magnet
for large-scale migration and putting a great strain on the city.
Izmit, which was elevated to the status of a greater municipality last year,
is a sprawling port town of 1m inhabitants. Mr Baser estimates the city will
need an additional 100,000 new homes in the next five years. 'Normally,
people come from other areas of Turkey but we are afraid that migrants will
start arriving from Istanbul,' he says.
Take the road east from Istanbul, the evidence is all too clear as the
countryside is rapidly submerged by the onslaught of ramshackle development
and new industry. The route skirts around the northern coast and past the
old weaving centre of Hereke, a town which seems to have disappeared
underneath cement factories and motorway flyovers.
If Bursa is the region's private sector dynamo, Izmit by contrast has some
of the qualities of a state sector sloth. According to the chamber of
commerce, around 30 per cent of the city's working population is on the
government payroll.
Izmit bay is today the centre for Turkey's petrochemical industry and the
site of one of the first paper pulp factories - government concerns which
are now the target for Turkey's efforts to privatise some of its extensive
public enterprises.
Mr Baser is sceptical about the success of the privatisation programme. 'The
problems will not be solved if the bureaucrats close this plant here so they
can buy limousines in Ankara,' he says acidly.
The contrast with the nearby Kentsa complex could hardly be more emphatic.
Just on the outskirts of the town, on a piece of reclaimed marsh land, the
Sabanci group, Turkey's second largest industrial conglomerate, has
constructed one of the world's largest integrated tyre plants. The factories
provide a striking reminder of the role of private sector capital in
Turkey's recent development. As does the Koc group, Turkey's other big
industrial player, which is also well represented in the region in a joint
venture with Fiat in the car sector, and blazing a trail in the processed
foods sector.
But the Marmara region also has also thrown up its own generation of
business tycoons. Although locally raised, many of them are first or second
generation immigrants from Bulgaria and Greece, such as the textile magnates
Ali Osman Sonmez, a Turk from Bulgaria and Mr Cavit Caglar, the former state
minister whose parents came to Turkey from Greek Thrace in the 1940s.
It is with the same entrepreneurial drive that local businessmen are now
addressing the problems of the region's infrastructure. The development of
the privately run port at Gemlik is a prime example of the endeavours of
private sector initiatives in an area traditionally dominated by the state.
The government is now looking at a series of privately franchised power and
water projects using the Build Operate and Transfer model.
For the region is a major energy corridor, carrying the gas pipeline from
Russia to Turkish Anatolia. It is the site of the newly opened liquefied
natural gas terminal at Tekirdag, the port town where Voltaire's Candide and
Pangloss retire to cultivate their garden.
It is on the crossroads of the region's principal highways. The sea itself
is part of the vital trade route for the tankers taking oil from central
Asia and for the newly independent Black Sea states, for which this is now
the main route to western markets.
The Istanbul peninsula is a choke point for transit and other truck traffic
making its way eastwards. The congestion is again forcing planners to
reconsider long-standing proposals to build a bridge across the Dardanelles
to divert some of this heavy goods traffic.
All the pieces are there. Some jobs have been lost, particularly in the car
industry during the current economic crisis. But industrialists are
confident they can switch production lines for exports and provide a cushion
through this difficult period. When the recovery does come, Marmara will be
the first region to take advantage of the change of climate.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Conference papers gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several of the papers submitted to the TUC's conference are realistic to the
point of pessimism.
Mr David Marsden of the London School of Economics says that while too much
regulation at the bottom of the labour market might destroy jobs,
deregulation in the middle could destroy the potential for the 'co-operative
exchange' between employer and employee.
Mr Ewart Keep of Warwick University and Mr Ken Mayhew of Pembroke College,
Oxford, say that training is not the sole answer to Britain's industrial and
employment failings. They believe that Britain has a skills shortage, not
because of insufficient supply of skilled labour, but because of
insufficient demand.
Ms Patricia Hewitt of the Institute of Public Policy Research says that full
employment in 1994 must include women as well as men. But the unemployed are
trapped between a flexible labour market and an inflexible social security
system.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Hunt for broader role sparks
dissent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's conference is not just a debate about unemployment. It is also an
important moment in the politics of the Trades Union Congress, David
Goodhart writes.
The idea for the conference - and the plan to invite business leaders and a
cabinet minister - was floated when Mr John Monks took over as TUC general
secretary last year.
It appeared then to be part of a widely supported plan for the TUC to reach
across the political spectrum to promote social partnership at work. But a
demonstration outside Congress House, and the absence of several senior
trade union leaders from the conference, shows that the TUC's attempt to
establish a more pluralistic trade unionism is facing teething trouble.
The plan to streamline the TUC's internal organisation has been implemented
 -at the price of some turmoil. But the invitation to Mr David Hunt, the
employment secretary, to the conference has been the last straw for many
unions.
The disapproval of a left-led union such as the TGWU general union may not
be that surprising, nor an alternative event at Conway Hall organised by the
Camden Trades Council. Leftwing trade unionists will, in any case, find
little to cheer in the cautious background papers at the official
conference. There are no instant plans for full employment and there is a
great deal of orthodox economics.
But even the GMB general union has objected to the invitation to Mr Hunt,
and Mr John Edmonds, its moderate general secretary, has other business
today. Unison, the public-service union, has also expressed its disapproval.
This may be no more than an irritation to Mr Monks. After all, Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, spoke at
the 1992 TUC congress and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the
Treasury, appeared at a TUC conference earlier this year.
But it does appear to show that some of the big Labour-affiliated unions do
not acknowledge that their enthusiasm for Continental-style social
partnership requires a less partisan attitude.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: 'Glib and irresponsible talk'
leads the debate on cause and effect - David Goodhart weighs the
contributors' arguments on the reasons for and costs of unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Perry, joint chairman of Unilever, recently said that 'glib talk
about full employment is alarmingly irresponsible'.
Most of the contributors to the TUC debate are 'irresponsible' in that they
believe full employment is possible, albeit hard to achieve.
Most of the writers who address the causes of unemployment point to the
economic 'shocks' of the 1970s and early 1980s - notably the sharp rises in
oil prices - as well as the strains caused by structural change which have
led to job losses in traditional industries and a reduction in demand for
unskilled workers.
Some papers, such as that by Mr Chris Freeman of Sussex University, stress
the effect of information technology, while that by Mr Richard Freeman of
Harvard University examines competition from low-cost countries.
Mr Freeman concludes that globalisation has had an impact on some unskilled
workers - but not as great as some people believe.
Ms Christine Greenhalgh and Ms Mary Gregory from, respectively, St Peter's
and St Hilda's colleges, Oxford, emphasise the loss of industrial capacity
and skills which creates a large group of long-term unemployed people who
are not re-absorbed into the jobs market even during periods of recovery.
Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research
says that full employment in the 1950s and 1960s was not the result of the
government intervention to finance extra spending, nor flexibility in market
mechanisms which were considerably more rigid than today.
What characterised the period was a condition of persistently high, and at
times excess, demand. Mr Britton suggests that what prevented wages and
prices from rising faster was the continued regulation of credit, foreign
exchange and investment, but also 'responsibility and public spirit' as a
restraint on inflationary pressure.
On the costs of unemployment, Mr David Piachaud of the London School of
Economics finds that the number of people living in poverty as a result of
unemployment tripled between 1979 and 1991 to more than 2m.
According to census studies unemployment raises the chance that a man will
die in the next decade by one-third, and by 50 per cent for those in middle
age. Mr Piachaud also finds a clear correlation between unemployment and
both crime and racism. Combining social security benefits and taxes forgone,
the cost of unemployment to the exchequer is put at Pounds 26bn per year, or
more than Pounds 9,000 per unemployed person. This is equivalent to
unemployment imposing a tax of 10 pence on basic rate income tax.
But none of the writers defines in any detail what full employment might be.
Several imply that, with fewer 'jobs for life' and a more competitive
economy, short-term unemployment might even rise. Mr Richard Layard of the
London School of Economics comes close to saying that full employment is the
absence of long-term unemployment - defined as people who have been
unemployed for more than one year.
Most agree that growth is not enough to create full employment, and nobody
supports protectionism or restrictions on the use of technology. Mr John
Philpott of the Employment Policy Institute says that 'supply-side problems
would seem to contribute more to unemployment in 1994 than was the case in
1944'. But that does not mean that either training or deregulation is the
answer.
Britain's labour market seems to reflect the worst of both the US and the
European systems, according to Mr Philpott. This means more relatively poor
people in work but also implies a high level of unemployment and welfare
dependency.
The most concrete proposals come from Mr Richard Layard and Mr Dennis Snower
of Birkbeck College, London University. Both favour big subsidies to
employers to take on the long-term unemployed. Ms Patricia Hewitt of the
Institute of Public Policy Research, and Mr Paul Ormerod, of the University
of Manchester, call for more innovative ways of sharing work around, but Mr
Philpott warns that changing the pattern of work will not in itself expand
its volume.
Several ideas for reforming the benefit system are floated, including a
lump-sum 'Back to Work' payment.
But Mr Britton concludes that society gave up full employment because the
cost in terms of other objectives was too high. He warns that returning to
it now will be costly - in terms of extra taxes or public expenditure
forgone - and will require a shift towards more social solidarity.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: New consensus rethinks the
unthinkable - The TUC today hosts a conference on employment to mark the
50th anniversary of the wartime white paper on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full employment, or at least talking about it, is back in fashion.
Today's Trades Union Congress conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the
wartime coalition government's white paper on employment policy - with its
commitment to 'maintain a high and stable level of employment' - would have
been unthinkable a decade ago.
The attendance at Looking Forward To Full Employment of Mr David Hunt, the
employment secretary, is testimony to a new consensus about the urgency of
reducing unemployment which spreads far beyond the labour movement.
Mr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy Institute think-tank,
contrasts the annual 1984 Mais lecture by the then Mr Nigel Lawson - now
Lord Lawson - which blamed unemployment on rigid labour markets and
relegated it to a 'residual' of economic policy-making - with the 1994 Mais
lecture by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Clarke not only said that unemployment must now be the 'main
preoccupation' of economic policymakers but added that he shared the white
paper's commitment to maintain a high and stable level of employment.
In 1984 registered unemployment was rising rapidly towards 3m, yet by the
time of this year's lecture the figure was still high - at 2.6m - but was
falling rapidly.
The apparent lesson of the 1987 and 1992 general elections, that mass
unemployment had ceased to be a central political issue - especially when
the trend was downward - no longer seems to apply. This may have something
to do with the demise of the jobs-for-life expectations of the middle
classes.
The agenda is, in any case, now open. A decade ago the papers for such a
conference would have been peppered with calls for a massive expansion in
demand and huge state-backed employment programmes.
The conference papers - mainly by centre-left academics but representing a
wide range of views - scarcely mention such things. Indeed, the introductory
paper by Mr John Philpott indicates that supply-side measures are the most
appropriate form of attack.
He says the conference should be seen as a contribution to the 'middle way'
 -between the deregulated US model with high job creation but meagre social
protection, and the regulated European model with low job creation but more
generous protection.
This is where the consensus usually breaks down - with the left believing
that the European model can still create jobs even with high costs, and the
right saying that there is a trade-off between protection and job creation.
But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, now says there are
limits on how far Britain can go in reducing unemployment by allowing
incomes to fall sharply.
Similarly, the TUC papers propose a range of employment-friendly reforms to
the tax and benefit system while trying to take account of how radically the
pattern has changed since 1944.
But several TUC papers reject the idea of topping up low wages in favour of
a high minimum wage and a hefty dose of labour market re-regulation.
The tension between such policies and rapid private-sector job creation is
not discussed, however. Also no paper looks at job creation from an
employer's point of view, and there is little acknowledgement of the wider
dimensions of full employment.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Companies put low value on high
skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EWART KEEP and KEN MAYHEW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summary of paper by Ewart Keep and Ken Mayhew:
Britain's skill problem is at least as much one of low demand for skills as
one of inadequate supply. The current employer-led training policy ignores
the deep-seated reasons for lack of employer demand. Thus its effectiveness
is likely to be limited.
It has been a commonplace assertion that Britain is faced with a fundamental
choice about the basis on which the economy meets international competition.
One significant strand of the official prescription for economic development
has embraced a competitive strategy based on high-quality, technologically
advanced, flexible production.
Coupled with this have been frequent references to the altering structure of
employment, the decline of manual occupations and craft-based occupations,
the reduction of manufacturing jobs, the rise in demand for technicians, and
the growth in white-collar and professional employment.
Just how realistic are these presumptions? It is true that there have been
significant structural shifts in UK employment since 1945. In broad terms
there has been a dramatic decline in the numbers employed in primary and
manufacturing industries and a big increase in employment in the services
sector and a growth in 'higher-level' occupations.
Yet there have also been shifts in the structure of employment that may
point to a rather different view of skill requirements in the economy, in
particular the growth of small business employment, self-employment and
part-time work.
Many people assume that the job structures that pertain in professional
occupations are also found in other forms of employment. Yet to talk about
careers, in any meaningful sense, for many employees is to ignore reality.
Training for the majority of process and non-craft skilled workers in many
sections of manufacturing industry has traditionally been non-existent. Job
security is lacking, opportunities for progression minimal with the current
employer, and still limited in the sector.
In the clothing industry, for example, the situation is that a typical
female machinist enters the industry in her early 20s and retires from the
industry maybe 40 years later - as a machinist.
Retailing, cleaning, distribution, hotels, food and tobacco, clothing and
textiles, catering, and leisure and tourism would be examples of sectors
where well-developed career structures frequently do not exist. These
sectors employ a significant proportion of the national workforce. In order
to progress, workers employed in such sectors must take the risk of changing
jobs and employer.
Producing high-tech, high-quality goods and services that require high
levels of skill is not intrinsically important to a company. The issue of
overriding concern is whether its product market strategy allows it to
survive and to make adequate profits.
If companies can achieve these ends through production of low-cost,
low-quality, high-volume goods and services that require minimal skill
levels, then there is little reason for them to change strategy.
Investment is still seen as a cost, not a benefit by most companies and the
cost-benefit information on training is weak. A low-training environment is
reinforced by the volatility of the UK economy, the legacy of low-trust
industrial relations, and the 'short-termism' of company decision-making.
The problem for public policy is that many of the factors determining the
low demand for skill come from the internal workings of companies and these
remain firmly 'off-limits' to outside influence.
One of the few admissions that the internal workings of the company have to
be addressed if training policy is to succeed, comes in the Investors in
People initiative.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Old assumptions fail to fit in
the modern world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA HEWITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summary of paper by Patricia Hewitt:
The assumption behind the 1944 white paper was that full employment meant
full-time jobs for men, and that the working life stretched from the
completion of compulsory education to retirement.
This model does not fit the modern world. It seems safe to assume that by
the end of this year women will already be half the British workforce, and
their numbers will continue to grow as women now at home with children
re-enter employment and those now in employment take shorter breaks when
they have children. In future, full employment must mean employment for
women as well as for men.
With most women working part-time for part of their lives - and a growing
minority of men doing the same - full employment must include part-time as
well as full-time employment.
The crisis of unemployment in the European Union has awakened interest in
shorter working hours as a route to job generation. It is frequently argued
by economists that such proposals suffer from the assumption that the total
amount of work to be done is fixed and that, therefore, the only way to
employ more people is to share the work out more frequently. The
alternative, they argue, is to increase output.
But this is itself fallacious. It ignores the impact of productivity gains.
In the sectors where technology is driving productivity upwards most
rapidly, very large increases in output can be achieved with no growth in
employment - or even a continuing fall.
Second, the argument ignores the fact that, for any given level of output
and demand - and for any given level of increase in demand - the number of
hours worked by each person will determine the number of people employed.
Unemployed people and their families are trapped between a flexible labour
market and inflexible social security. But instead of creating incentives,
the benefits system locks claimants out of those jobs which form the
majority of vacancies.
There are several examples. Employment of 16 hours a week or more
disqualifies a claimant from income support. Family credit is available only
to low-paid workers with children. It can take several weeks to establish a
claim and loss of a temporary job can mean further delays in re-establishing
a claim.
If the partner of an unemployed claimant keeps, or gets, a job, benefit is
cut once earnings exceed the permitted threshold. This is one reason why the
wives of unemployed men are so much less likely to have jobs than the wives
of fully employed men.
Instead of locking people out of part-week and part-year employment, the
social security system should encourage and enable people to work part-time.
In some cases part-time employment will be preferred. In others a part-time
job may be all that is available for someone who wants full-time employment.
Such a person should be able to combine part-time employment with part-time
unemployment benefit.

FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Flexible work practices can be
more appropriate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summary of paper by David Marsden:
Much of the debate about regulation of the labour market is made unduly
confusing because the main arguments and policies proposed are more relevant
to some sections of the labour force than to others.
The deregulatory path may prove effective at the top and bottom of the
earnings scale, but its effect on the middle is less clear-cut. In effect,
it relies on a strengthening of managerial authority and a concentration of
decision-making initiative in the management hierarchy.
In some work environments this may still be effective, but the success of
'lean production' in attaining new standards of productivity in
manufacturing casts strong doubt on the future competitiveness of systems
which concentrate control in the management hierarchy.
The alternative path is that of 'co-operative exchange'. This approach
stresses the importance of flexible work arrangements and
information-sharing among workers and their managers in the middle,
skilled-professional, section of the workforce. The grounds for believing
that this leads to better productivity and quality - compared with the
management-control model - are strong.
In so far as commercial success in world markets now seems to depend more on
co-operative exchange taking place, it is important for European countries
to make the right choice for regulation in the labour market.
Deregulation and reinforced management control would seem to be a recipe for
lower productivity and more unequal societies.
Co-operative exchange has much to recommend it, but it does depend on trust
relations, and these are vulnerable in periods of major economic change,
such as the implementation of the single European market and the general
internationalisation of business.
To sustain co-operative exchange the European Union's social dimension - and
in particular the social dialogue between unions and employers - has an
important role to play in enabling businesses to signal their continued
commitment to co-operation.
Germany comes closest to achieving co-operative exchange in large parts of
its industry, but in other European countries many individual companies
achieve this, albeit on a more fragile basis.
Where relations are of a more confrontational nature the increase in
competition associated with the single market could in fact provide an
opportunity for developing co-operative relations.
The problem of commercial survival forces both management and workers to
reappraise their practices, and the model of an effective social dialogue
offers a framework within which this can take place.
However, recent work in game theory suggests that it is difficult to achieve
mutual co-operation without the presence of trust - a mutual expectation of
co-operative behaviour - and without some social or institutional framework
to sustain that trust.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Black economy blurs M0 message: Gillian Tett on why the
reliability of the money-supply measure is being questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If an economist from Mars had picked up a copy of yesterday's money supply
figures he or she might have had cause to blink.
The annual rate of growth in June of M0, the narrowest measure of money
supply, was 6.8 per cent. For more than a year the government and the Bank
of England have been solemnly proclaiming that M0's 'monitoring' range
should be zero to 4 per cent.
So the question that an onlooker might ask, as M0 has been soaring out of
its target range for several months, is why the rise has not prompted more
outcry from the City or the Bank itself?
The main reason, economists say, is a new scepticism about the reliability
of M0 as an indicator of high street activity. Many analysts suspect the
data are being skewed by low interest rates, changes in banking technology
and even the growth of new black-economy activities such as car boot sales.
M0, which chiefly comprises notes and coins in circulation, has
traditionally been of interest to economists for two reasons. First, the
figures have been a useful guide to future inflation. Second, they have
often provided an early guide to retail sales because more spending creates
a greater demand for cash.
In the past six months this relationship has broken down as M0 has surged at
a much faster rate than high street spending. The Bank blames the rise
primarily on low interest rates. If consumers are not receiving much
interest on their bank accounts, the argument goes, they will tend to hold
more cash, and so the 'velocity' at which money circulates will slow.
This analysis has been accepted by many City economists, who point out that
a similar pattern has occurred in the US. Some analysts are resorting to
recalculating the target band to take account of the low velocity. Mr John
Marsland of the UBS bank believes that if interest rates are considered, the
'real' target limit should be 6.5 per cent.
But as a recent Bank of England research report on the subject admitted:
'Gauging the extent to which this fall (in velocity) arises from recent
changes in interest rates is difficult.' The guesswork is made harder
because interest rates are only one of the factors that influence how
consumers use cash. Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets believes another
influence on M0's growth may be the recent shift towards part-time work,
where employees are more likely to be paid in cash.
Meanwhile, the growing use of large-denomination bank notes may indicate
that consumers are spending more in the cash-based, black-market economy. Mr
Bernard Tennant, retail sales director at the British Chambers of Commerce,
says its research shows there has been an 'explosion' in the number of car
boot sales, with at least 1,500 taking place every week.
But calculating whether this kind of factor affects M0 is extremely
difficult because of the lack of information about the black economy.
Meanwhile, changes in banking technology may be affecting the use of cash.
The fact that the number of Pounds 20 notes has risen by almost 30 per cent
in the past three years and overtaken the Pounds 10 note as the most common
denomination, for example, is presumed to reflect their popularity in bank
cash-dispensers.
In spite of this uncertainty the Bank shows no sign of abandoning its
emphasis on M0 yet. As the Bank's report pointed out, comparisons between
retail price inflation and M0 in the past 25 years show that M0 has been an
accurate predictor of inflation up to six months ahead.
Nevertheless, the same report admitted that it could 'find no convincing
explanation' why M0 should have these predictive powers. Indeed, with the
government committed to maintaining inflation well below the level predicted
by the current M0 data, the Bank has every reason to hope that the current
mis-match between M0 and retail sales will produce another statistical
discrepancy in six months - this time between M0 and retail price inflation.

The number of companies entering receivership or administration last month
rose 4 per cent to 163, figures published yesterday show.
The rise reflected a large number of appointments by banks to companies in

But Touche Ross, the accountancy firm that compiled the figures from the
official London and Edinburgh Gazettes, said the increase was not
significant and there continued to be a general downward trend.

British exporters are more confident about their prospects in the long term
than in the short term, says the latest DHL Quarterly Export Indicator.
The balance of responses from 501 directors of manufacturing companies whose
export expectations for the next three months are excellent or good, minus
those whose expectations are fair or poor, was 28 per cent, down from 42 per
cent in the previous quarter.
The balance of expectations for the next 12 months is 61 per cent, up from
59 per cent last time and the highest for 2 1/2 years.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Mobile phone users up by 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile phone operators have gained 1m new subscribers in the past year,
taking the number of mobile phone users in the UK to nearly 2.6m, Andrew
Adonis writes.
Vodafone and Cellnet, the two largest operators, reported a far higher
growth rate for the second quarter of this year than for the same period
last year, in spite of the launch of two new cellular networks - Orange and
Mercury One-2-One - since last September.
Vodafone recorded a net increase of 155,000 subscribers between April and
June, up from 57,000 in the same period last year. Cellnet increased its
user base by 128,500 in the three months, up from 54,750 last year.
One-2-One, which operates only in the London area, has gained about 100,000
subscribers since its launch last September. Orange, owned by Hutchison
Microtel, has been operating for barely two months and has yet to release
subscriber figures.
Industry sources said that June saw a slower rate of increase in new
subscribers, with indications of a slowdown after the heavy publicity
accompanying the launch of Orange.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Figures from Bank confirm housing market recovery fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears about the slowing pace and fragility of the recovery in the housing
market were confirmed yesterday after the release of figures which showed
new net mortgage lending in May broadly similar to the level in April and
May last year.
While the statistics published by the Bank of England showed a slight rise
in the number and amount of loans approved - which is seen as an important
forward-looking indicator - the reaction from the Council of Mortgage
Lenders was gloomy.
The council, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders,
said that the data did not amount to proof of sustained recovery.
On a seasonally adjusted basis new net lending in May totalled Pounds 1.5bn,
compared with Pounds 1.7bn in April and Pounds 1.4bn in May last year.
Within that total, the fall in new net lending by societies was particularly
notable, falling from Pounds 1.1bn in April to Pounds 934m in May, while
lending by banks rose from Pounds 443m to Pounds 710m. Apart from April the
monthly figure for new net lending by banks was the lowest since October
last year. The monthly figure for societies was the lowest since last
November.
The figures also disclosed a withdrawal by centralised lenders, after two
months of re-entering the mortgage market.
There were more encouraging signs in the figures for loans approvedhowever,
with about 86,000 approvals given in May totalling Pounds 4.7bn.
The May figures are just higher than those in April - 82,000 loans approved
for a total of Pounds 4.6bn - and those in May last year.
Some lenders have sometimes seized on even relatively small increases to
point to improving prospects for a recovery in the mortgage market, but
yesterday Mr Adrian Coles, CML director-general, struck a more downbeat
note. He said that mortgage lending statistics had moved within a narrow
band for some months.
'There is little evidence for anything other than a painfully slow recovery
from the recession. It is not clear that even the modest growth seen over
the last year will continue,' he said.
Concern about the weakness of the housing market recovery was underlined by
Halifax building society in its monthly house price index.
It reported a month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent in house prices in June -
the first increase after two monthly falls - leading it to calculate an
annual rate of house price inflation of 1.5 per cent.
Halifax said that the lower-than-expected levels of mortgage lending and
house purchases in recent months seemed to be a result not only of the April
tax rises and higher fixed-rate mortgages, but a reflection of generally
weak consumer confidence and widespread lack of recognition that the economy
was recovering.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Bargaining deal for Revenue staff: Non-union US computer
group to sign recognition agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue Staff Federation will tomorrow sign a formal union
recognition agreement with Electronic Data Services, the US computer
services company which has never dealt with unions in its home country.
The deal preserves the union's right to collective bargaining for the 1,900
staff of the Revenue's information technology office who are being switched
to EDS in Europe's largest information technology contract from public to
private sector extending over 10 years and worth more than Pounds 1bn.
After six months of negotiations IRSF members are to be offered a choice
between two employment contracts - an 'image contract' to replicate civil
service terms and conditions as closely as practicable, and the standard EDS
company contract.
Transferring staff will be able to switch to the standard contract if they
wish, and the two contracts will run in parallel for the foreseeable future.
New staff will be hired on the standard contract. The standard package
offers perks such as free medical and dental care and company cars for
certain grades. The image contract is the only one covered by collective
bargaining arrangements.
Mr Clough said that the most difficult hurdles in negotiating the image
contract were in making pension arrangements equal to those available in the
civil service, and in providing a formal appeals procedure.
The company, which has a number of pension schemes in place, has had to
construct a new one to reflect the civil service terms. Mr Roger McNulty,
the division's human resources director, said, however: 'If people decided
to transfer out of the union scheme into the standard scheme we wouldn't
want them transferring back again.'
Tupe - the transfer of undertakings protection of employment - legislation,
which protects the terms and conditions of public-sector employees whose
contracts are transferred to the private sector, meant that EDS had to make
a commitment to work with the union, which currently represents the majority
of the 1,900 staff affected.
Mr Peter Clough, managing director of EDS's Inland Revenue division, said:
'We came at it from the point of view that we needed to recognise the
unions.'
Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF, said: 'We believe that a
particular strength we can bring is the job security we are offering staff.
I think this is where unions will have an increasing role to play.'
Mr Clough said: 'Here is an opportunity where we can demonstrate how unions
can add value to an organisation.'
The next stage of what Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, has described as a 'strategic partnership' between EDS and the
Inland Revenue will be developing a working relationship between a public
body and a corporate operation. EDS is hoping that its methods will rub off
on the Revenue.
The company says it has an open-ended view of how long the side-by-side
contract arrangements will last.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Mortgage lenders may adopt code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A voluntary code of practice of mortgage lending is being considered by the
mortgage lenders' trade association and could be in place by next summer.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies
and other lenders, is looking at the idea of introducing a code, and is
likely to take a decision in principle by the autumn.
The adoption of a code would help to pre-empt any suggestion that there
should be new legislation to cover the sale and marketing of mortgages, and
would offer a response to some recent criticism of the way mortgages are
sold.
The CML envisages two options. One would merely cover a 'reason why' letter
to a mortgage borrower, setting out the type of mortgage recommended and
explaining why it was appropriate for the customer.
A more general and ambitious option would deal with the marketing of
mortgages, including the use of annualised percentage rates of interest.
It might also incorporate existing CML statements of practice on arrears and
repossessions and the transfer of mortgages.
One potential disadvantage is that the code could not bind intermediaries,
such as independent financial advisers, who introduce a large minority of
new mortgage business. Lenders might, however, agree to apply the code on a
discretionary basis to such business.
Last month Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, called
for 'greater transparency and choice' in mortgage lending, saying that
lenders should give customers more information about mortgage 'packages' in
which loans are marketed with associated services such as life or general
insurance.
Even more recently, the annual report from the building societies ombudsman
scheme showed that complaints about the treatment of mortgage customers
taken up by the ombudsman rose 15 per cent in 1993-94 compared with the
previous year.
The CML emphasised yesterday that it was merely exploring the possibility of
a code in a tentative way. But raising the prospect publicly in the CML
monthly newsletter will make it more difficult for the idea to be rejected.

<TEXT>
M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent last month compared with May,
Bank of England figures showed yesterday, Gillian Tett writes.
But measured on a yearly basis, the figures indicated that the rate of
growth slowed slightly last month. M0 was 6.8 per cent higher last month
than in June 1993. That compares with an annual growth rate of 6.9 per cent
in May and 5.9 per cent in April. The figures were slightly stronger than
the City had expected - it had predicted no monthly growth. Although a
strong figure for M0 has traditionally been interpreted as a sign of strong
retail spending, analysts yesterday warned against interpreting too much
from last month's data.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Credit card repayments bring fall in net lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big net repayment of credit-card debt resulted in a sharp fall in the
level of net lending in May, official figures showed yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said net lending to consumers through finance
houses, bank Visa and Mastercard credit cards and non-mortgage building
society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 203m in May.
That was sharply lower than Pounds 412m of net lending in April and below
market expectations of Pounds 350m.
Analysts pointed out yesterday, however, that the underlying message in the
three-monthly figures, which are considered a better guide to the trend than
the volatile monthly data, was that consumers were continuing to borrow in
spite of tax increases.
Net lending in the three months to May was Pounds 1.13bn compared with
Pounds 1.11bn in the three months to February.
Most of the fall in May's net lending figure came from increased credit card
repayment, the CSO's figures showed. Although consumers spent a record
Pounds 3.06bn of new credit on their cards in May, there was a net repayment
of Pounds 104m as consumers settled their credit card bills faster.
This compares with credit-card net lending figures of Pounds 98m in April
and Pounds 78m in March.
Lending through building society loans fell to Pounds 3m in May from Pounds
14m in April. However new credit advanced by building societies rose to a
record Pounds 218m. The CSO said this might reflect a greater level of
building society lending 'following the transfer of business from a bank to
a building society'.
The level of finance house lending - used for car and store credit deals -
remained relatively flat at Pounds 304m in May, from Pounds 300m in April.
This surprised some analysts, in light of the recent rise in car sales and
the relatively strong performance of the white goods sector in May.
New borrowing for vehicles fell to Pounds 858m, down from Pounds 871m in
April and Pounds 968m in March. New borrowing for the home improvements
sector rose to Pounds 67m in May, from Pounds 59m in April.
New borrowing on store goods rose to Pounds 238, from Pounds 214m in April.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Doctors will hold summit on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Britain's doctors are to meet later this year to discuss the
future of healthcare against the background of continuing anxiety about the
government's National Health Service reforms.
The meeting would be the first such gathering of leaders of the health
professions for more than 30 years.
The undiminished level of concern about aspects of the reforms, three years
after they were introduced, was demonstrated at the annual conference of the
British Medical Association which opened in Birmingham yesterday.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the BMA council, received a standing ovation
when he spoke of a mood of despair, alienation and demoralisation in the
NHS, and announced the BMA's 'unswerving determination to reform the
reforms'.
The planned meeting will be attended by representatives of the Royal Medical
Colleges, deans of university medical schools, representatives of the
General Medical Council and BMA leaders.
It will consider the implications of a range of radical changes - such as
the shift of much treatment from hospitals to family doctors' surgeries and
patients' homes - that are starting to transform traditional patterns of
healthcare. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for many of the
profession's leading figures to consider the effects of the government's
market-style reforms.
Dr Macara told the conference that as a result of the reforms, co-operation
had been supplanted by commercial competition in 'an uncontrolled,
ill-managed internal market' driven by the 'perverse philosophy' of winners
and losers.
Business plans now overrode clinical priority and treatment, except in
emergencies, had become a national and local lottery. There was no longer a
single national service but 100 purchasing consortia and 400 provider units
battling for survival.
BMA leaders say Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and other
ministers have shown increased willingness to meet them during the past
year. But they are frustrated that, even when they believe they have
specific evidence of problems - such as complaints of patients of
fund-holding doctors receiving preferential treatment at hospitals -
ministers have always defended the reforms rather than taken action.
Dr Macara yesterday set out a seven point plan on which the BMA will build a
campaign to reform the reforms.
This includes finding better ways of determining healthcare priorities more
clearly, better assessment of needs and outcome of treatment, restoring
strategic planning which the BMA feels has been lost in the reforms and
improving co-operation between purchasers and providers of healthcare.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Howard acts on racial disputes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A quicker, cheaper way of resolving racial discrimination disputes between
employers and staff was announced by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
yesterday.
Employers who recognised that a practice might have inadvertently
discriminated against one group would be able to make a legally binding
undertaking to change.
Mr Howard told a race relations conference in London that the new procedure
would provide 'an effective and voluntary solution to many disputes and
would avoid unnecessary confrontation'.
Taking companies to court 'does little to encourage sensible co-operation
and much to set in concrete ill feelings between the parties'.
Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, welcomed
the announcement.
He said: 'This will save time and money.'
The Home Office said the measure would mean that disputes could be settled
without a tribunal hearing or the costly, contentious process of a formal
investigation under the Race Relations Act.
Mr Howard highlighted other recent measures to improve race relations,
including the proposal to introduce a new offence of causing intentional
harassment, and to make publishing and distributing racially offen-sive
material an arrestable offence.
But, in what was seen as a reference to the recent Commons home affairs
committee call for a new offence of racially motivated violence, Mr Howard
said the existing law was adequate to deal with offences of racial violence
and harassment.

Northern Ireland republicans who want a peaceful way forward in the province
are 'probably, just probably, in the ascendancy,' Royal Ulster Constabulary
chief constable Sir Hugh Annesley said yesterday.
He said when launching the force's annual report: 'On balance I am
optimistic, because I still very firmly believe that the Downing Street
declaration has pushed the Provisionals into a cul-de-sac.' The accord had
led to the British and Irish people being ranged against the IRA.

FT  05 JUL 94 / University year move may be rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Universities yesterday seemed likely to reject a plan to shift the beginning
of their academic year from October to January, John Authers writes.
The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which co-ordinates
applications to all higher-education colleges, said this would be necessary
to accommodate the vastly expanded number of applicants.
Students would not make applications until after their exam results were
known at the end of August, it suggested, while the practice of making
offers conditional on A-levels should be abandoned. Universities would then
be able to plan with certainty to ensure that they did not exceed government
targets, while potential students would be able to make more realistic
applications.
But vice-chancellors fear this would involve too much upheaval for a system
which is also planning to introduce a new degree structure.
Instead the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents
university managers, said it was likely to campaign for exam results to be
released earlier. The year could then start in September, allowing
universities to run three 15-week semesters each year.
The committee said two-thirds of its members wanted the marking of public
exams to be accelerated. They thought this was plausible because marks for
the equivalent baccalaureat qualification in France are available six days
after the exams have been completed.

FT  05 JUL 94 / MoD admits failure on cost controls: RAF refurbishment to be
probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence last night announced an independent investigation
into how almost Pounds 400,000 was spent on refurbishing the official
residence of Air Chief Marshal Sir Sandy Wilson.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, minister for the armed services, said the total cost of
Pounds 387,000 - Pounds 127,000 more than he indicated in March - implied a
failure of the govern-ment's financial control system.
In a reply to a question from Sir James Spicer, Dorset West, Mr Hanley said
the external investigation would 'recommend appropriate action to ensure
there is no repeat' of the spending which took place in the past two years.
A further Pounds 9,000 was spent on routine maintenance.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'There appears to be one
rule for the top brass, who get away with spending so much money on
themselves, and another for the rest of the forces, many of whom are
threatened with the sack.'
The results of the defence-cost study, which started after the November
Budget, is expected to lead to thousands of redundancies when it is
announced in the next few weeks.
The study is aimed at helping the ministry save about Pounds 1bn in its
annual spending from the 1996-97 financial year. Labour fears it will lead
to the loss of about 25,000 jobs.
The MoD said an apparent failure of its financial control system could not
be linked to the defence-cost study, which aimed at cutting costs without
affecting the forces' effectiveness.
Mr Clark said he feared a misuse of government funds in refurbishing
official residences of other senior military officers.
The government has set up a separate audit of expenditure on official
residences to ensure that there are no other breaches of its financial
control mechanisms.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Swoop on BCCI leaves victims still in the dark: Depositors,
creditors and employees are waiting for redress three years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On July 5 1991 customers, staff and passers-by watched with varying degrees
of horror and surprise as the doors of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International were closed in a sudden sweep by global regulators.
Three years later many hundreds of thousands of depositors, creditors and
employees of BCCI around the world are still awaiting some signs of redress
following one of the biggest bank frauds in the world - totalling more than
Dollars 12bn.
Many of the employees have been hit three ways. They have lost their jobs,
they have lost their salaries and they haved been under pressure to repay
their subsidised mortgages and other loans with the bank. The stigma
attached to BCCI has made it difficult for many to find other employment.
For UK-based sterling customers of the bank the depositors' protection
scheme provided compensation of three-quarters of their savings up to Pounds
15,000. Equivalent schemes have been triggered in some other countries.
Creditors, however, are likely to have to wait well into next year for any
payout from liquidators. Depending on a Dollars 1.8bn contribution under
negotiation with Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, they may
receive a payout of about 15p to 20p.
Further payments will depend on continued attempts to trace assets and to
settle litigation launched by the liquidators against bank regulators,
auditors, directors and related parties involved in transactions with BCCI.
The prediction remains an ultimate 30p to 40p in the pound.
The primary beneficiaries so far have been the professionals - several firms
of lawyers, consultants and notably the partners at Touche Ross, the
accountants, who have been liquidators to the bank.
For some of the main protagonists involved, criminal justice has been a
little swifter. Last month the authorities in Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in the bank, sentenced 12 former executives to pay Dollars 9bn
in compensation and serve a total of 61 years in prison.
One of these, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the chief executive, is now in the US where
he may be tried on a series of state and federal charges. Mr Agha Hasan
Abedi, BCCI's founder who was sentenced in his absence, continues to live in
Pakistan.
Meanwhile, a number of changes to regulation and banking supervision have
been made following the report in October 1992 by Lord Justice Bingham into
BCCI's supervision.
A new law in Britain has made it compulsory for the first time for auditors
to report suspicions of fraud to the regulators. Under previous rules they
were merely protected if they decided to do so.
Draft banking legislation proposed for the EU would give supervisors power
to refuse to authorise banks which are organised in a way that impedes
effective super-vision.
The Bank of England has set up an in-house legal unit and a special
investigations unit designed to help investigate matters.
It said yesterday: 'Undoubtedly there has been a change of emphasis. We have
become clearer on when we need to change gear from a trusting, supervisory
to a regulatory approach.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Views sought on rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pro-Share, the London Stock Exchange-backed group which promotes wider share
ownership, has launched a survey to assess the requirements of small
shareholders under a 'rolling settlement' share purchase system.
In particular, Pro-Share wants to find out how much direct contact
shareholders want to have with the companies they invest in if they are
forced into the use of so-called nominee companies.
Starting on July 18, the traditional two- to three-week settlement period
will end and shares will have to be paid for or delivered within 10 business
days of the bargain being struck.
The move to rolling settlement is expected to increase the use of nominee
companies which will hold customers' shares in the nominee's name, although
beneficially for the client. That means all communication the company
formerly had directly with the shareholder will be held instead with the
nominee company.
Pro-Share has helped to devise a proposed code of conduct for nominees which
would require that 'non-asset related' materials from the company is sent to
actual shareholders. These are materials such as annual reports which do not
suggest actions on 'matters affecting the value of the company'. But on
matters such as takeover bids, the code will not require nominees to
ascertain the preferences of actual owners before voting on their behalf.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Retention of two-tier Staffs urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme should come together to form a
single unitary authority but the rest of Staffordshire should retain two
tiers of local authority, the Local Government Commission for England
recommended yesterday.
The commission will seek the views of county residents in the next 11 weeks
before making its final recommendation to Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary.
The commission's willingness to retain both the county council and district
councils, albeit over a reduced area, is at odds with the government's
preference for unitary authorities.
It follows a similar approach to that adopted in Kent, Hampshire and
Leicestershire, although the majority of commission recommendations so far
have been in favour of scrapping county councils.
All the district and borough councils in Staffordshire favoured the creation
of unitary authorities, although Lichfield and Tamworth wanted to merge. The
commission's preferred option is closest to the view of the county council,
which suggested a unitary authority for Stoke with a two-tier structure
elsewhere.
Union of Stoke and Newcastle, the north Staffordshire conurbation, would
create a community of 375,600 people. There is already 'a degree of
community interdependence', the commission concluded on the basis of a MORI
poll.
Newcastle Borough Council is against merger with Stoke, however, and
organised a petition that gained more than 11,500 signatures supporting
independence.
The commission said the financial implications of its preferred option were
'relatively minor'. Implementation would cost up to Pounds 10m and
administrative costs would be Pounds 4m a year less than current spending.

FT  05 JUL 94 / 'Miscarriage of justice' body faces delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has signalled that legislation to set up a body to
investigate alleged miscarriages of justice will not come until 1995-96 at
the earliest by excluding it from its list of core bills for the autumn.
A further criminal justice bill is not among the 10 or so measures the
cabinet has decided definitely to include in the Queen's Speech in November.
Supporters of the new body think the bill could still 'sneak under the wire'
if ministers decided against pressing ahead with more controversial
legislation - such as a Post Office privatisation bill - or if the bills on
the list were unexpectedly short.
One alternative being considered is to publish a draft bill setting out the
government's proposals for the new body, which was recommended by last
year's report of the royal commission on criminal justice. This would have
the advantage of enabling the government's plans to be discussed in advance
in some detail.
Earlier this year Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said it was important
not to rush proposals involving such significant constitutional change.
The government came under attack in December for not including the creation
of the Criminal Cases Review Authority in this year's criminal justice bill,
which is currently before parliament.
Ministers were accused at the time of ignoring those royal commission
recommendations which did not suit its immediate purpose.
Under government proposals presented in March the authority would act as a
body of last resort after normal avenues of appeal had been exhausted and
would have the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Dockyard David battles for contract against Goliaths: Chris
Tighe reports on the small shiprepair company slugging it out with the
industry's giants for the Pounds 30m Sir Bedivere refit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the battle for the Pounds 30m Sir Bedivere landing ship refit, which the
Ministry of Defence will award this month, Mr Eric Welsh is playing David
against the Goliaths of British shipbuilding.
His six-year-old shiprepair company, Tees Dockyard, is slugging it out
against most of the industry's biggest names: Yarrow, Swan Hunter, the
Rosyth Royal Dockyard, and a joint tender from Devonport Royal Dockyard and
VSEL.
Against a background of dwindling defence spending, the 21-month project to
lengthen and extensively modify Bedivere is well worth fighting for.
The future of Swan Hunter, in receivership since May 1993, hangs on the
order: without it the Tyneside company's only prospective buyer,
French-based Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, will back off, making
closure highly probable.
Other contenders are desperately keen to win Bedivere to maintain employment
and get a foothold in the ship conversion marketplace.
There is in this bitter contest a grim satisfaction for Mr Welsh - it
vindicates his conviction, demonstrated at Tees Dockyard, that ship
lengthening is a promising market in these cost and speed-conscious times.
'We identified this as a damn big niche in the market, the other people have
just realised it,' he says. 'The last 12 lengthenings in this country have
been done by this group, and the big ones have been done here.'
Vessels are cut in half and a new section inserted, returning the ship to
service in as little as 30 days. Tees Dockyard has adapted offshore
fabrication industry practices, mounting the ship on wheeled trailers, to
speed up the task of dragging the severed vessel apart.
Bedivere, a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) vessel built on the Tyne at Hawthorn
Leslie in 1966, is the first MoD vessel to be lengthened. A 12-metre section
is to be inserted, to bear the additional weight of replacing her aluminium
superstructure - found in the Falklands War to be a fire risk - with steel.
Her sister ships, Geraint and Percival, may be similarly modified and
whichever bidder gets Bedivere should be strongly placed to compete.
Mr Welsh, managing director of Tees Dockyard, has spent two years gearing up
for Bedivere - gaining the BS 5750 Part 1 quality standard to meet MoD
requirements and improving his facilities, in which he has invested more
than Pounds 5m since 1988.
A labourer's son, he served his apprenticeship as a shipwright at Smith's
Dock on the Tees, rising to become managing director of now defunct
Sunderland Shipbuilders. He reopened Smith's Dock's disused shiprepair
facilities in late 1987, in partnership with Mr Albert Le Blond,
Sunderland-based chairman of the Wear Dockyard Group.
Tees Dockyard has since carried out nearly 400 jobs, 26 of them for the MoD,
including voyage repairs on the Bedivere in May.
Mr Welsh is daunted neither by his competitors' size nor the value of the
Bedivere contract, worth at least twice Tees Dockyard's current annual
Pounds 16m turnover.
'We consider in this type of work we have more experience than the other
people and we're the most competitive.'
Rivals contend they too are highly competitive. Although most have done no
ship lengthenings before they argue their shipbuilding experience gives them
the necessary expertise. Privately however one describes the Bedivere as 'a
pig of a job'.
While most yards have been slashing workforce numbers - VSEL is down from
14,000 in 1990 to 6,000 now and Devonport has just announced a further 850
redundancies - Mr Welsh has been recruiting. His core workforce is now 300.
For Bedivere he would hire another 500, on contract.
His initial workforce of 27 came from 1,300 who lost their jobs with the
closure in early 1987 of Smith's Dock, Teesside's last shipyard. Of these 25
are still with him, the other two retired at 67.
Engineering manager Mr Ian Smailes, one of the 27, attributes Tees
Dockyard's growth to sheer determination. 'This yard got back on its feet on
sentiment, there was no way anything was going to stop us. The lads had been
out of work, they were sick and wanted to work. We pushed ourselves to
limits we didn't know we had.' The same applies to Mr Welsh: after a car
accident in mid 1988, he ran the company from his hospital bed for months.
Winning Bedivere would be a personal coup for him and his team. General
manager and director Mr Ken Raper was the RFA's marine superintendent for 10
years, a job in which he looked after Bedivere.
The MoD, says Mr Welsh, has insisted that value for money, not politics,
will be the deciding factor. But the behind-the-scenes political lobbying
for the contract is intense. Should Tees Dockyard not win there will be
disappointment but no hand-wringing, he says. 'We'll just go and get some
more work.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Traffic across the Firth of Forth is likely to grow by 50 per cent between
1990 and 2010, says an independent study into plans for a privately financed
second Forth road bridge.
The report for the Scottish Office said that neither a new bridge nor public
transport improvements in isolation would resolve the problems of increased
traffic which could lead to regular 10-mile tailbacks.
The study was carried out by MVA Consultancy, Oscar Faber TPA and
Environmental Resource Management.

A campaigner against Sunday trading yesterday failed in a High Court bid to
stop parliament seeking royal assent today for the Sunday trading bill.
Mr Roy Edey told Mr Justice May that it would be unconstitutional to advise
the Queen to break her coronation oath as defender of the faith by assenting
to the bill.
The judge ruled that the courts had no power to interfere with the passage
of a bill through Parliament.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Health insurance is one of the fastest growing areas of consumer spending
with an 80 per cent increase to Pounds 1.16bn in the five years to 1993,
market research group Mintel says.
Private medical insurance accounts for the majority of health insurance
spending - Pounds 759m last year - but critical illness cover has grown the
fastest, from Pounds 12m in 1989 to Pounds 145m last year.
Mintel reports that 80 per cent of those interviewed said their parents
should spend money on looking after themselves in old age rather than
storing it up to be passed on in inheritance.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Urban policies blamed for smog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday attacked the government's environmental and
transport policies which it blamed for the rise at the weekend in pollution
in towns and cities, James Blitz writes.
As smog levels in several parts of the country, especially London, remained
well above official guidelines Labour accused the government of pursuing
urban policies which threatened health, particularly that of the elderly and
children. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection,
said the government's transport policy was at the heart of the problem.
He said that pollution could be reduced only by adopting three approaches: a
shift in transport policy away from road building and towards public
transport; a reduction in emissions from cars; and the setting of air
quality targets for local authorities.
Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said: 'There are differing views on
what causes pollution. As soon as we get definitive advice, we will be in
the right position to find a solution.'
The rise in pollution levels has been aggravated by the hot weather. The
lack of wind left a blanket of warm air over the capital, trapping high
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons.
In central London the ozone level hit 95 parts per billion at the weekend -
the World Health Organisation recommends a maximum level of 70 ppb.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Blair aims to shift Labour stance on schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair began yesterday to reposition Labour's education policy by
stressing the party's commitment to higher standards, greater parental
involvement in schools and published assessments of children's progress.
The front-runner for the party leadership also unveiled a range of ideas
designed to underpin the case for putting a radical extension of educational
opportunity at the heart of the party's political prospectus.
In the latest of a series of speeches setting out his agenda, Mr Blair said
the key to modernising the education system was 'high investment, high
expectations and high performance for all and by all'.
Describing education as the foundation of a healthy society and of a wealthy
economy, Mr Blair said Labour would make a reality of lifetime education and
training to equip individuals to meet the demands of economic and social
change.
He gave strong backing to universal nursery education and floated a new
scheme under which 'teacher associates' from business and local communities
would inject more expertise into school classrooms.
Mr Blair also called for the development of 'individual learning accounts'
to draw a single thread through a continuous process of education and
training between childhood and retirement.
But the political significance of the speech lay in a strong emphasis
throughout on the importance of discipline and high standards of teaching
and a responsive attitude to the preoccupations of parents.
Acknowledging implicitly that Labour has traditionally been seen to
represent the interests of teachers more than of children and parents, he
said the profession must recognise the need for a partnership with parents.
Labour 'must stand up for the highest standards in all schools, with good
discipline, highly motivated and highly performing teachers and the maximum
involvement by parents'.
Accusing the Conservatives of discrediting the process of testing, Mr Blair
insisted that Labour must nonetheless provide a 'proper basis of both
assessing pupils and allowing parents access to the greatest amount of
information'.
Mr Blair brushed aside in a single paragraph the debate within his party
over whether it should restore grant-maintained schools to local authority
control.
He said the interest of local communities must be balanced against the
desire of parents, teachers and governors to have the power to make
decisions for individual schools.

FT  05 JUL 94 / MPs unite to urge child agency changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative backbenchers joined opposition MPs in the Commons last night in
calling for the Child Support Agency to apply a less rigid formula when
setting the level of maintenance payments to be made by absentee fathers.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, ruled out significant
changes in the agency's operations before the next report by the Commons
social security committee due in October. He said improvements were already
evident after changes introduced by the agency in April.
Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, Sir Donald Thompson, MP for Calder
Valley, and Mr John Horam, MP for Orpington, were among Tory backbenchers
who pressed for changes designed to ensure that the agency operated with
greater flexibility.
After describing the demands made by the agency on one of his constituents
with a net income of Pounds 127 a week, Mr Horam said: 'No wonder he came to
me and talked about suicide.'
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead, who is chairman of the
cross-party social security committee, said it had not yet reached a
position where it could say that the agency was working successfully and
achieving its objectives. He urged Tory MPs to impress on the government
that the 'jury was still out', and to be ready to support any changes
advocated by the committee.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said those dissatisfied
with the agency's decisions should have some possibility of securing
redress. While reaffirming Labour's backing for the principle that it was
the duty of parents to support their children, he said public support for
the agency was vanishing at an alarming rate.
Mr Lilley underlined his opposition to the introduction of an appeals system
which would result in a return to an 'open-ended' discretionary system.
A Labour motion calling for an urgent and fundamental review of the child
support agency was defeated by a government majority of 38 (311-273).

FT  05 JUL 94 / Party electorate seeks some light in land of the bland:
Kevin Brown finds there is little difference between the manifestos of the
three leadership candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So now we know what they stand for. Or do we?
The launch yesterday of Mr John Prescott's personal manifesto for the Labour
leadership completes a trio of election statements from the candidates to
succeed John Smith.
As expected Mr Prescott promised to establish a Commission for Full
Employment which would recommend a jobs programme to next year's party
conference. This body would be on the lines of the Social Justice Commission
set up by Mr Smith.
If there was a surprise, it lay in the reticence of the normally ebullient
shadow employment secretary. He was unwilling to set targets for achieving
the full employment policy he has set at the heart of his political
programme.
In that, however, he was following the lead given by Mr Tony Blair, the
modernising shadow home secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's
traditionalist interim leader who, with Mr Prescott, is also contesting the
deputy leadership.
None of the candidates has felt able to challenge the Labour convention that
only the party's annual conference may make policy.
As a result the manifestos have been bland to the point of banality, leaving
the 4.5m voters in Labour's three-part electoral college to scrutinise the
candidates' style and language to put some light between them.
There are differences, but they are not great. Mr Blair's manifesto is about
opportunity and security for individuals in a world where the global economy
has demonstrated the limits of government. Mrs Beckett's is about unity and
social cohesion. Mr Prescott offers a robust defence of collective action
and the state's role in employment creation.
With the race half over Mr Blair has a clear lead, assuming that the 154
Labour MPs who nominated him actually vote for him. Mr Blair is keenly aware
that he needs to maintain his image as the candidate best placed to win a
general election. That means avoiding mistakes between now and the
announcement of the result on July 21 - hence his infrequent public
appearances and his virtual absence from the cauldron of prime minister's
question time in the Commons.
Mr Prescott has not given up hope of capturing the leadership, although he
thinks he will have to come from behind to win. He believes that the media
has misjudged opinion in the constituency and trade union sectors of the
electoral college, which together control two-thirds of the votes.
There really is no evidence on this either way. There have been few polls
and although they have backed Mr Blair they have not distinguished eligible
voters from party supporters.
Friends say that Mr Prescott has been buoyed by the enthusiastic reception
he has received at campaign meetings around the country. Sceptics point to
Mr Michael Foot, the former Labour leader, who said much the same thing
during Labour's disastrous 1983 election campaign.
Mr Prescott's strategy is to win credit by bludgeoning the Conservatives and
by arguing for specific policy pledges to build credibility with the
electorate. He has a contempt for airy generalisations and freely uses such
words as socialism. But his willingness to offer specific commitments has
declined during the campaign. Full employment meant no more than 2.5 per
cent to 3 per cent of the workforce unemployed - now it is a matter for
debate.
Mrs Beckett stood for the job because she was annoyed, in part on feminist
grounds, that no-one took her seriously as a candidate after Mr Smith's
death, even though she was then his deputy. Her campaign has focused largely
on her competence as a former minister for schools in the Callaghan
government and as the party's deputy and interim leader.
The argument has some force. Mrs Beckett performed creditably in the
difficult weeks after Mr Smith's death. But there have been poor
performances in the Commons, notably after the prime minister's return from
the Corfu European summit.
Mrs Beckett started by shoring up her support on the left. Lately she has
sought broader support by presenting herself as the only candidate able to
unify the party's modernising and traditionalist factions. But critics say
her decision to run for both the leadership and deputy leadership was a
blunder which could lead to defeat in both contests.
She has appeared devious in refusing to say whether she really wants to be
deputy leader, and ungenerous in refusing to say whether she would serve in
the shadow cabinet under the rival candidates.
Mr Prescott, by contrast, has been keen to talk about the deputy's job,
which he has contested twice before. He has made the tactically astute
gesture of affirming that he would be honoured to serve in any post under
any leader.
Friends of all three candidates say they are confident that the campaign is
moving their way. But no-one knows how the union and constituency electors
will vote. The assured predictions that Mr Blair will be crowned leader
assume that they will follow the MPs' lead.
Friends of Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett say this is a rash assumption. If
they are right, Mr Blair will not be the only one with egg on his face.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Growers force poll on potato board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potato growers have forced a poll of the 15,000 producers in a campaign for
the immediate abolition of the 60-year-old Potato Marketing Board.
The board said yesterday that 420 growers, led by the Scottish Potato Trade
Association, had called for the poll.
The potato marketing scheme is due to be wound up in three years under
proposals announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, but there
could be a successor body to continue potato promotion and research. However
growers are unwilling to continue paying a levy of Pounds 48 per hectare now
that the board's principal function of intervention buying to support prices
has ended. Mr Bob Doig, who heads the abolition campaign, yesterday
described the board as 'an archaic talking-shop'.
Mr John Heading, board chairman, urged growers to oppose abolition. He said:
'The industry needs continuing funds for research and development as it
becomes more market-led and technical.'
The board would be scrapped if growers representing a majority of the UK's
150,000 hectares of potato production vote in favour. the result of the poll
should be known by the end of next month.
The board has been planning a survey of growers to find out what sort of
organisation they wanted from 1997.

FT  05 JUL 94 / First CSA annual report published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Child Support Agency failed to meet almost all its main targets on costs
and services, says the agency's first annual report published yesterday,
John Willman writes.
The agency assesses and collects maintenance payments from absent parents to
support parents caring for the children. In its first year it took on
850,000 cases and made more than 200,000 maintenance assessments. However,
it fell Pounds 112m short of its target for saving the Treasury Pounds 530m
in the cost of benefits paid to parents caring for children. The agency also
achieved barely half its target of arranging maintenance for 60 per cent of
parents making eligible applications.
In spite of the controversy surrounding the agency - and a fierce campaign
against it by absent fathers - 61 per cent of clients regarded the service
as satisfactory in an independent national survey. This was only a little
short of the agency's target of 65 per cent.
On customer service, only 30 per cent of assessments were provided within
five days of receiving all the information needed - the target was 100 per
cent.
Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive, blamed the failure to meet targets on
problems in bedding in the new system and campaigns against the agency's
work.
The agency is to take on an additional 700 staff to deal with the growing
workload, to add to the existing 5,300.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Rwandan rebels defy France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rwandan rebels said yesterday they would press ahead with their military
advance across the central African state despite France's order to its
troops to halt them.
In an interview in London, Dr Theogene Rudasingwa, secretary-general of the
Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), said French troops had no business in Rwanda
and if they stood in the way they would be seeking confrontation.
'There is no reason for the French to be in Rwanda. It is a partisan force
only there to support the evil forces that have unleashed terror and are
responsible for the genocide. They must withdraw or we shall fight them for
as long as possible.'
The rebels have seized control of much of the capital Kigali and are poised
to take government-held Butare, Rwanda's second city. However, French troops
in Gikongoro, south-west Rwanda, have received orders to stop any warring
faction from capturing the town or going beyond it.
The French Foreign Ministry said France was setting up a 'safe humanitarian
zone'. France had insisted it would maintain neutrality in its mission, for
which it is seeking a United Nations mandate, but now says its troops must
stand in the way of rebel advance to protect refugees in the south-west.
Dr Rudasingwa said: 'The fact the French government has given orders to stop
us is proof their role is military and political, not a humanitarian effort
as they have claimed.' He added that the RPF had plans for forming a broad
based government and start making plans to establish a democracy in the
country. But all this could only happen with the departure of the French.
French Colonel Didier Thibaut, based in Gikongoro, said he had orders to
stop the rebels from capturing the town or going beyond it: 'No one will go
any further. We will not allow anyone to bother the population - whether
they are militias, the Rwandan army, or the RPF.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Mitterrand promises French assistance to South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French president Francois Mitterrand yesterday told South Africa's
parliament that the country's transition to democracy was an example for
Africa to emulate and promised French assistance as its new government
sought to translate ideals into reality.
Speaking on the first day of a two-day visit to South Africa, Mr Mitterrand
paid tribute to South Africans for their successful democratic elections and
said he hoped the occasion would mark the building of closer ties between
the two countries. He is the first foreign head of state to address
parliament since the then Mr Harold Macmillan, British prime minister of the
time, delivered his famous 'winds of change' speech in 1961.
Although some critics have suggested that Mr Mitterrand's visit is merely an
attempt to boost his international image, the speech is seen as an attempt
by France, which has long maintained involvement in its former colonies in
West and central Africa, to stake out its position as the pre-eminent
western power in Africa. It hopes to secure South Africa's support for its
involvement in Rwanda and on economic development policies in Africa.
On South Africa's side the visit represents an opportunity to build up
support from an important member of the European Union, particularly in
light of current trade talks between the EU and South Africa. In addition,
both countries will be seeking to expand bilateral trade and investment
links.
Mr Mitterrand called on French industrialists, several of whom are
accompanying him on his visit, to 'do the right thing' and invest, but
announced no specific aid or investment package. However, he said that he
expected conventions to be signed during his visit in the electrification,
water and rural development sectors.
In addition, several French companies are expected to announce partnership
deals with local black businesses over the next few days, and an agreement
on some aid from the French Development Bank is also expected to be
concluded before Mr Mitterrand leaves tomorrow night.
Introducing him to parliament, South Africa's President Nelson Mandela paid
tribute to his French counterpart for his anti-apartheid support and cited
the French revolution as inspiration for the South African struggle. In a
ceremony earlier, Mr Mandela awarded Mr Mitterrand its highest award for
non-South African citizens for his services to South Africa.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Taiwan tries to buy time for its push to rejoin UN: Taipei
is expected to advocate a slow development of its cross-strait ties with
Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fearful of becoming irretrievably ensnared in China's web, Taiwan is
attempting to slow development of cross-strait ties to win time to build
support for its attempts to rejoin the international community.
In its first white paper on China policy, to be released today, the
government is expected to advocate a go-slow approach to the rapprochement
launched with historic talks between the two sides in Singapore in April
1993. After seven years' detente, the paper comes amid a sharp escalation in
cross-strait tensions since the March 31 deaths of 24 Taiwanese tourists in
China's Zhejiang Province.
While Taiwan business backs closer ties with China, most Taiwanese remain
profoundly distrustful of Beijing's leaders. The tourist killings played
into the hands of President Lee Teng-hui, who is using the incident to
further his agenda of getting the world to recognise Taiwan as an
independent sovereign state, observers say.
It is rumoured among Taipei politicians that shortly after Mr Lee became
president following the death of Mr Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988, opposition
leaders asked him to seek formal Taiwanese independence from China. Mr Lee
is said to have replied: 'Just give me time'. The story may be apocryphal,
but Mr Lee's record speaks for itself.
The Taiwan-born agricultural economist built up a power base from virtually
nil, presided over a transition to democracy and in early 1993 shoved off
the political stage the military-backed mainlanders who ran the country for
over 40 years.
Weeks later, he launched a campaign to rejoin the UN, which Taiwan left in
1972, after that body switched recognition to Beijing.
In the past year, he and his ministers have globe-trotted constantly, trying
to drum up international support for entry into the UN and other
multilateral bodies from which Taiwan has long been excluded because of
China's objections.
Taipei maintains full diplomatic relations with 29 countries. Beijing
threatens to break off ties with any country which formally recognises
Taipei. As a permanent member of the UN security council, it can veto
Taiwan's entry. But Mr Lee's tactics are causing consternation, not only in
Beijing, which views the island as a renegade province, but also in
Washington, Taiwan's closest ally and benefactor.
'Taiwan has turned into a kind of Frankenstein's monster,' observes Mr
Parris Chang, a lawmaker from the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP). 'The US fostered Taiwan's democratic development
and some might say the policy worked too well. Now the US has to live with
the consequences.'
The US strategy seems to be simply to wait. The Clinton administration
recently completed a comprehensive review of US policy toward Taiwan, the
first in 15 years. Minor though symbolically important changes in the US
stance are expected to be announced shortly. But there will be no change in
the US's 'one-China' policy dating from the late 1970s acknowledging
Beijing's claim over Taiwan.
Taiwan now experiences a cacophony of views on the island's identity and
future. The debate is further shrouded by a haze of rhetoric emanating from
the government. Because China threatens to use force should Taiwan declare
independence, the ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, persists in
larding its assertions that 'the Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign
state' with dubious claims that its 'transitional two-China policy' is a
interim measure whose ultimate goal is reunification.
'The Republic of China on Taiwan is already an independent nation by
whatever definition,' says Mr Hanson Chien, the KMT spokesman. 'There's no
need to antagonise the PRC and invite a war.'
Public opinion is divided. A government-commissioned survey in late June
found 12 per cent of Taiwanese support independence, 21 per cent support
reunification, and 56 per cent prefer to maintain the status quo. A Gallup
poll conducted shortly after the tourist killings showed support for
independence at an all-time high of 27 per cent.
'China should realise the only reason more people don't openly support
Taiwan's independence is because they are afraid China will attack, not
because they want reunification,' says Ms Maysing Yang, head of the DPP's
foreign affairs department.
About the only matter on which there is a national consensus is that Taiwan
should rejoin the UN, and is it on this aim that President Lee appears to
have staked his hopes.
Ultimately the US will play a decisive role in Taiwan's future, says Mr Wang
Chien-shien of the KMT-breakaway Chinese New party. 'It is in the US's
long-term interest to have an independent Taiwan. Some day, when it suits
their purposes, the US will play the Taiwan card against China. Now the time
is not mature.'
By March 1996 at the latest, Taiwan will hold direct presidential elections
for the first time. Mr Lee's popularity makes him likely to win should he
run. It is easy to dismiss a country whose leader was installed by a waning
military dictatorship, but harder to exclude one whose leader is
democratically elected.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran Palestinian leader who made a triumphant
homecoming last week, was expected today to fly from Gaza into Jericho, the
West Bank town which is the capital of Palestinian self-rule and a vital
foothold for Mr Arafat in the West Bank.
Jewish settlers, who fought police throughout the weekend in protest at his
arrival, were last night making plans to disrupt the visit.
Mr Arafat is expected to be brought by helicopter into Jericho. He will
swear in the Palestinian National Authority, the cabinet which will run the
self-rule areas, and inaugurate a Palestinian broadcasting station.
PLO officials said Mr Arafat would return to live in the Gaza Strip from
Saturday after attending a farewell ceremony in Tunis which will mark the
end of the organisation's 30-year exile from the land it calls Palestine.
In between Mr Arafat will meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, in
Paris tomorrow where he will press for the release of Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel and the speedy implementation of the next phase of the peace
process: the extension of Palestinian self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across the
rest of the West Bank.
Frantic preparations were under way in Jericho last night to receive Mr
Arafat - or 'The Traveller,' as he is known locally.
A street-party atmosphere overtook the central square last night where Mr
Arafat will address Palestinians from the West Bank. Palestinian workers
were putting the finishing touches to a stage and boys were busy erecting
flags, bunting and posters of Mr Arafat emerging phoenix-like from an air
crash in the Libyan desert in 1992. Two bullet-proof black Mercedes
limousines, which Mr Arafat used to cross from Egypt to Gaza, stood out in
the quiet oasis town.
Security preparations were also being tightened following threats by Israeli
settlers to disrupt the visit.
One report said demonstrators planned to seize Orient House, the PLO
headquarters in Arab East Jerusalem.
Mr Aharon Domb, a settler spokesman, refused to confirm the report but said:
'There will be a range of new protests, all kinds.'
Aides said the 65-year-old Mr Arafat, who recovered his voice yesterday
after a series of engagements left him speechless, was fit and elated by the
welcome Palestinians have given him.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Kuwait plans spending cuts to curb deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuwaiti government and the parliament's finance committee have for the
first time tabled specific plans for eroding the Gulf state's high benefits
in an attempt to curb the budget deficit, officials in Kuwait City say.
The two sides have agreed to plans for raising KD100m (Pounds 218m) from
increased customs fees on 200 currently exempted imports, along with higher
mail, telegram and telephone charges. They also propose a KD250m cut in the
government's original spending plan for 1994-95, made by cancelling
construction and transport projects, and slicing KD178m from 'miscellaneous
expenses'.
Officials said the proposed cuts were modest, but it was the start of an
'educating' process for Kuwaitis, accustomed to cheap government-run
services and, for more than 90 per cent of Kuwait nationals, high-paid
government jobs. 'This is the first acknowledgment that we have to be not
quite so generous,' one official said.
The budget proposal now goes to the National Assembly for debate and final
approval this month, even though formally Kuwait's fiscal year began on July
1.
The proposed cuts follow pressure from the parliament finance committee to
cut the original projected deficit of KD1.8bn for 1994-95 by 20 per cent,
amid growing concern in Kuwait over fiscal deficits after the Gulf war. They
show increased resolve within the government to attack what are seen as
unsustainable state spending.
The formula would leave Kuwait with a budgetary gap of KD1.5bn for 1994-95,
based on targeted spending of KD4.14bn and revenues of KD2.63bn. The revenue
figure is understood to assume Kuwaiti crude oil prices will average about
Dollars 12 a barrel for the fiscal year. Kuwait's fiscal deficit for 1993-94
was budgeted at KD1.2bn and is expected to turn out at about that figure,
with revenues buoyed during the last quarter by the upturn in crude prices.
For the first time, the 1994-95 budget includes an item for defence
expenditure, an inclusion which largely results from National Assembly
pressure, and which renders difficult direct comparisons between this budget
and those of previous years.
The proposed budget savings, if approved by parliament, will relieve rather
than remove pressure on the government's coffers. In July next year, Kuwait
will have to begin repayments on the Dollars 5.5bn foreign loan to pay for
Gulf war costs. The first Dollars 2.5bn principal repayment falls in the
next fiscal year, with a Dollars 3bn payment in the one thereafter.
Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, finance minister, has said he does not rule out an
attempt to reschedule repayments of this debt. He and other officials are
understood to believe that Kuwaitis, in any case, eventually face far deeper
cuts into their welfare state than at present proposed.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Fragile Mideast peace awaits next step: Much depends on
whether momentum can be sustained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could just work.
This was the assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process among
Israeli government ministers and officials as the triumphant homecoming of
Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran Palestinian leader, went into a fourth
peaceful day.
Much depends on whether the momentum can be sustained and the next phase of
the process - the extension of Palestinian self-rule from Gaza-Jericho
across the rest of the West Bank - can be swiftly concluded.
Will Israel confront the 120,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and
give Mr Arafat enough room to consolidate the fragile Palestinian support
base for the agreement? The summit between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israeli prime minister, in Paris tomorrow will provide much of the answer.
For Mr Arafat, keeping the peace process moving is vital. The PLO leader
needs to show opponents and sceptics that Gaza-Jericho is merely the first
step on the road towards an independent Palestinian state in all of the
Palestinian lands seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A quick
extension of Palestinian self-rule to the West Bank will vindicate Mr
Arafat's negotiating gambit of incremental assumption of land and power and
will confound critics who have warned the Gaza-Jericho deal was an Israeli
ploy to leave Palestinians with a virtual apartheid-style 'bantustan'.
Without such an extension of self-rule the economic arrangements between
Palestinians and Israelis will quickly flounder because the heart of the
Palestinian economy - agriculture, commerce and tourism - is centred in the
West Bank towns of Ramallah, Nablus and Bethlehem and among the 1.1m West
Bank Palestinian population. Furthermore, Mr Arafat will not be able to hold
national elections and so prove his determination to meet Palestinian
demands for democracy without extending his rule over the West Bank.
Under the peace accord Israel is committed to redeploying its military
forces out of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank three months
after the assumption of self-rule in Gaza-Jericho and no later than the eve
of elections, due on October 15. Israel is also pledged to transfer
responsibility in five areas to Palestinian authority: education and
culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism - and any
other additional powers and responsibilities agreed between the two sides.
The Palestinians have said, however, that the Israeli withdrawal should be
completed at least six weeks before the elections to allow Palestinians to
organise a free and disciplined ballot.
Mr Riyad al-Zanoun, Palestinian health minister, said Mr Arafat would ask
Israel at the Paris summit 'to implement the redeployment of the Israeli
army in the West Bank, to evacuate the populated cities in accordance with
the agreement and to hurry up the transfer of authority . . . by August'.
Israel is much more likely to be willing to listen now. Mr Arafat's
conciliatory speeches about honouring and defending 'the peace of the brave'
against extremists and opponents and the firm security grip the Palestinian
police force have established on Gaza-Jericho, have bolstered Israeli
confidence.
'All the doomsday prophesies about Arafat's return and Gaza erupting into
violent civil war have not come true,' Mr Uri Dromi, Israeli government
spokesman, said yesterday. 'We feel Arafat has shown political restraint and
wisdom. He . . . is keeping his word. His visit has been a triumph of common
sense and pragmatism and taking the success of the first phase we will be
armed with more confidence about the potential of the next phase to
succeed.'
However, Israel has said no dates are sacred and has stressed the technical
difficulties of the next phase of negotiations. There are 150 Israeli
settlements in the West Bank housing 120,000 Jewish settlers. The
painstaking negotiations about security for 4,500 Jewish settlers living in
16 Gaza settlements delayed implementation of the first phase for four
months and will have to be repeated for the West Bank.
More important, the West Bank is a much more sensitive domestic political
issue in Israel than Gaza, which many Israelis were glad to give up. The
prospect of Palestinian police spreading out across the West Bank will be
met by fierce domestic opposition from the settlers and the Israeli right
wing.
Although Mr Rabin on Sunday bitterly attacked the 'radical right', vowed to
strengthen peace with Palestinians and acknowledged the need to shore up Mr
Arafat's political base, he is unlikely to move as quickly as Mr Arafat
wants or needs despite the fact that a narrow majority of Israelis continue
to support the peace process and direct negotiations with Mr Arafat.
Another sensitive issue due to be discussed in Paris tomorrow is Israel's
failure to honour its commitment to release 5,000 Palestinian prisoners,
another emotional issue which gives fuel to Mr Arafat's critics.
Mr Arafat can argue he has kept his side of the agreement. Attacks on
Israelis are down by half since the implementation of Gaza-Jericho; the
Palestinian police force is functioning well; the national authority is to
be sworn in today; the Palestinians are getting down to tackling day-to-day
problems; a plan for the October 15 elections is in place.
Now it is Mr Rabin's turn to deliver.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Rising imports bring Japan's surplus down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's politically contentious current account surplus shrank by an annual
6.7 per cent in May, proof it is on a downward trend, according to the
Finance Ministry.
Yesterday's figure will be seized on by the new three-party coalition as a
sign that efforts to make the Japanese market more open to imports are
starting to bearing fruit, when it meets an anxious US at the Group of Seven
summit in Naples at the end of this week.
Tokyo will have little other evidence to offer the summit that it is
stimulating its domestic economy. It plans to present an already-published
deregulation package and commit itself to cutting income tax, without giving
a figure, senior officials said yesterday.
The surplus, a measure of trade in goods and services, reached Dollars
8.72bn last month, after having grown by an annual 22 per cent to Dollars
13.98bn in April. A revival in previously weak Japanese demand for imports,
up 14.7 per cent in May, was one factor, though a seasonal rise in exports
inflated the surplus in the previous month.
A 279-point package of deregulation measures is due to be adopted by the
cabinet today, said Mr Kozo Igarashi, the socialist chief cabinet secretary.
This deregulation plan was proposed by the previous government last week,
but delayed by another round in Japan's recent series of power struggles, in
which the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party joined forces
to seize power.
The package aims to increase competition and reduce business costs in
housing, telecommunications, imports and distribution. While more concrete
than the two previous deregulation packages of the past year, it has been
criticised for excluding measures - such as easier entry to the
telecommunications service market - which foreign business lobbies had been
seeking.
Japan's new minister of international trade and industry, Mr Ryutaro
Hashimoto of the LDP, aims to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, at the G7 summit to discuss the US-Japan trade dispute, said
a government official.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: EU quotas will backfire, Beijing warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China condemned recent quotas imposed by the European Union on its exports
of products including toys and silk and warned yesterday that the curbs
would ultimately backfire.
Mr Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, speaking in
Germany, said the EU restrictions did not send the right signals to China,
which expects to import goods worth Dollars 1,000bn between now and 2000.
'If you want China to import more from Europe, then you should make it
possible for China to export more to Europe,' Mr Wu said. 'But if you
introduce import quotas you will suffer ultimately.'
Trade between Germany and China totalled Dollars 10bn in 1993 and rose 41
per cent in volume in the first quarter of this year, Mr Wu said.
He was speaking after Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, had begun a
week-long trip to Germany to foster diplomatic relations. His delegation is
planning to sign contracts worth Dollars 1bn and letters of intent worth
another Dollars 2.5bn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany would use its presidency of the European
Union to improve trade between the EU and China. He vowed to press for
China's readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and earned
Mr Li's 'special thanks' for German efforts to 'further lower or totally
remove' restrictions on high-technology exports to China.
The EU quotas, covering five categories of Chinese exports, have been
criticised by many European importers since they were hastily imposed this
year. The British government is challenging restrictions on toys in the
European Court of Justice after failing to block them in the Council of
Ministers.
The curbs were imposed as part of a package deal designed to persuade EU
members to agree to abandon national quotas on about 6,500 other products
that were preventing free movement of goods in the single market.
Chief executives from 30 leading state-owned enterprises are accompanying
the Chinese premier on his visit to Germany, where the delegation will
conduct negotiations on a variety of steel, chemical and transport projects.
In the first of many ceremonies this week, the electronics company Siemens
closed a deal for a coal-fired power station to be built by a joint venture
in which Siemens has a 40 per cent stake worth around DM500m (Pounds
201.6m).
Siemens, which will bring its tally to 16 joint ventures in China after
signing agreements this week, said there were letters of intent for more
power stations, steel rolling mills and digital telephone exchanges.
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is expected today to
announce several power station deals.
Mr Horst Teltschik, a senior executive at BMW and former top adviser to
Chancellor Kohl, also said a Sino-German group was working on several
transport projects to be built between 1996 and 2010 including a 600km
railway line in northeast China and an airport in Shanghai.
Mr Li also said tenders would be issued to build the world's biggest
hydro-electric dam on the Yangtze river. Preliminary work has begun on the
project, which is forecast to cost about Dollars 10bn, and is hotly
contested because of the amount of flooding involved. However the Chinese
premier gave no further details.

The likely membership of the ACS has a combined population of 200m people,
an estimated Dollars 500bn gross national product, and estimated annual
merchandise exports and imports of Dollars 80bn and Dollars 100bn
respectively, Caricom said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: China sets out car industry vision - Three
to four 'internationally competitive' manufacturers planned by 2010

China plans to establish three to four 'internationally competitive' vehicle
makers by 2010 and to encourage private purchases that would make cars a
'part of Chinese family life'.
Under the new policy announced yesterday, China emphasised its determination
to build an industry in which the development of large-scale manufacturers
would be encouraged in a now fragmented industry. 'The immediate target is
to allow, within this century, two to three auto-manufacturing groups to
grow into large corporations with considerable capacity, (including) six to
seven manufacturers who would become the backbone of the industry,' the
policy stated.
It added that, by 2010, three to four 'internationally competitive' vehicle
makers should emerge as part of a policy that would 'link the strong with
the strong'.
Foreign manufacturers yet to secure a foothold are relieved that the policy
will offer fresh opportunities after the present freeze on new entrants
expires in 1996.
Foreign involvement is welcomed, but foreign ownership in joint ventures
will not be allowed to exceed 50 per cent and manufacturers are to be
limited to two joint ventures.
The policy document, prepared by the state planning commission and approved
by the state council, or cabinet, is clearly aimed at rationalising China's
chaotic vehicle manufacturing sector.
The new policy says significant tax advantages will accrue to big-volume
producers as part of efforts to provide inexpensive vehicles, including
motorcycles, to a mass market. Imports of vehicles and components will be
discouraged.
China plans annual production of 3m motor vehicles by the year 2000. In
1993, it produced 1.31m, including 300,000 cars.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Foreigners scent fresh opportunities

China's long-awaited automotive industry policy drew generally favourable
reviews from foreign automotive representatives, but they warned that the
policy could unravel under political pressure, writes Tony Walker.
Mr Donald St Pierre, president of the newly-established China Automotive
Components Corporation, said the key to the policy's success would be the
ability of the authorities to consolidate the sector into three or four
conglomerates.
Mr St Pierre noted signs of smaller Chinese producers among China's 120
vehicle manufacturers seeking co-production ventures with foreign carmakers
outside the scope of the new policy.
'I hope they can make the new policy stick and ensure that the industry
doesn't fragment,' he said. 'It's important they are really able to develop
economies of scale and not allow local manufacturers to find a way around
that.'
Japanese motor industry representatives also reacted positively to the new
policy which clearly leaves the door open to the entry of up to four
carmakers, including two from Japan, after 1996, when the freeze on new
entrants expires.
Last month China told international vehicle makers that before they become
involved in vehicle assembly in China they must show their commitment by
investing in the components sector.
The Japanese, who were left out in the cold in the first round when the
Germans and the French were becoming established in China, now see
opportunities in the second round. Toyota is regarded as the frontrunner
among the Japanese with possibly Honda and Nissan fighting for the remaining
slot.
US manufacturers also believe the door has been left ajar to their entry
after 1996. Ford and General Motors are positioning themselves for a more
determined push in the next year or so. As a preliminary step both are
becoming involved in components manufacturing with Ford announcing two
ventures last month.
Existing producers are led by Volkswagen, which built some 130,000 passenger
cars in China last year, including Santanas, Audis and Jettas.
Other foreign manufacturers include Citroen, which produced 13,000 of its ZX
small cars at a plant near Wuhan in central China, and Peugeot, which is
involved in the assembly of its 504 at a factory near Guangzhou in southern
China.
China's automotive manufacturing strongholds are located in Changchun in the
north-east, Shanghai in the Yangtze Delta and in Hubei province in central
China. However, Beijing and Tianjin in the north, Guangzhou and Nanjing,
west of Shanghai, are all bidding to be included in the plans for a
restructured industry.
Mr St. Pierre said China's aim was 'fairly realistic' of satisfying 90 per
cent of its passenger car demand of some 1.5m vehicles from local production
by 2000. 'They really are aiming to develop their own automotive industry,'
he said in reference to the tax incentives for both economies of scale and
research and development.
Mr St. Pierre, who helped launch American Motor's Jeep manufacturing venture
in China in the mid-1980's, likened the involvement of foreign manufacturers
in China to General Motors' experience in Europe. 'GM Europe became a
European company. If a foreign manufacturer wants to operate in China they
are going to have to become a Chinese company.'
While the new automotive policy referred to the need for Chinese carmakers
to compete internationally, much less emphasis was given to this than in
previous documents. In the 1980's, China was insisting that 70 per cent of
production should be exported.
Now that living standards have risen sharply and car ownership is a reality
for increasing numbers of Chinese, policymakers recognise that the industry
will be hard-pressed to meet domestic demand.

Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean leaders to set up trade bloc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Leaders of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) meeting in Barbados are set to
approve the establishment of a regional group which will be the forerunner
of a trade bloc in the Caribbean Basin.
Prospective members of the proposed Association of Caribbean States include
the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela), Cuba, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, the Central American states, Suriname and members of the
Caribbean Community. About 15 dependent territories will be offered
associate membership.
The likely membership of the ACS has a combined population of 200m people,
an estimated gross national product of Dollars 500bn, estimated annual
merchandise exports of Dollars 80bn and annual merchandise imports of
Dollars 100bn, Caricom said.
The leaders of Caricom, which has a combined market of 5.5m people in 13
English-speaking countries, including Belize in Central America and Guyana
in South America, are reviewing prospects for the 20 year-old community
following the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Several Caricom members - Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago - have
requested the US to list them as potential Nafta members.
There is concern, however, that Caricom could be split if some members
became Nafta signatories or established formal links with the trade group.
The annual Caricom summit will also review the region's banana market in the
European Union amid continuing concern about competition from Latin American
fruit.
The leaders will also consider whether to admit the first member from
outside the English-speaking group. Suriname, a former Dutch colony in
north-eastern South America, has applied for Caricom membership.

Developing countries should not be afraid of liberalising their service
sectors, according to a report published today by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development in conjunction with the World Bank.
However, countries need to pay close attention to the manner and timing of
reform, and to their regulatory frameworks, before embarking on
liberalisation, it says.
The report is intended as a practical guide to developing countries in
creating policies to improve the efficiency of their service industries
through the easing of curbs on international transactions.
Service industries are making a growing contribution to employment and
output generation in both developed and undeveloped countries, the report
notes, and many of the latter have become keenly aware of the role of
services in the development process.
Indeed, the report says, there is growing evidence suggesting that the
development of some service sector activities may not be the result of
growth elsewhere in an economy, but one of its preconditions.
Opening of domestic markets to foreign service providers is a major way to
ensure increased efficiency in the provision of services and, by fostering
competition, tends to enhance the efficiency of domestic producers, the
report says.
Liberalisation is often attacked as opening the door to foreign domination
and putting local jobs at risk.
The report cites beneficial results from opening up the financial sector in
both developed and undeveloped countries. 'Concerns that foreign banks might
dominate the domestic market typically have proved unwarranted. Instead a
complementary role has developed between foreign and domestic banks . . .'
the authors say.
Developing countries should also look at the arguments for and against
liberalisation in an economy-wide perspective, rather than a single-industry
approach. For example, excluding foreign insurance companies may protect
domestic insurers, but could lead to increased dependence on foreign
re-insurers, higher costs for industry and an outflow of re-insurance
premiums.
The report urges developing countries to be sceptical of arguments in favour
of increased barriers to trade, such as the need to protect an infant
industry. However, where a sector is thought too economically or politically
sensitive to allow foreign majority ownership, it recommends allowing joint
ventures in preference to outright prohibition of market access.
The timing of reform is important too, the handbook says. Stabilisation
efforts, particularly mechanisms to avoid the overvaluation of the domestic
currency, should precede liberalisation.
The handbook was prepared by staff of the Unctad programme on transnational
corporations and the international trade division of the World Bank
international economics department.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Soaring ratings for shots of the orange
crazies - TV coverage has pleased viewers and sponsors, but annoyed purists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a cramped television production booth at the ESPN studios deep in rural
Connecticut, Dennis Deninger leans forward from his seat and says into a
microphone: 'Do you think you can cut in a shot of the crowd? We haven't
seen any orange crazies in a while.'
Moments later, the scene on the TV monitor showing the Holland-Morocco World
Cup game switches from the field of play to the stands, where thousands of
face-painted, flag-draped Dutch soccer fans - 'orange crazies' - are eagerly
cheering their team.
Moments later the cameras return to the action, and Deninger, co-ordinating
producer for ESPN, the leading US cable sports channel, sits back in his
chair apparently satisfied.
ESPN is broadcasting 41 of the 52 World Cup games during the month-long
tournament, and it has been the job of people like Deninger to bring the
World Cup to life for an American viewing public which has traditionally
regarded soccer as about as much fun as an Idaho potato-picking contest.
Judging by the ratings, and the comments of critics and fans, ESPN and ABC -
the latter is showing 11 World Cup games - have been doing a remarkably good
job so far, thanks in part to crowd shots of crazy Dutchmen, kilted Irish,
robed Saudis and scantily-clad Brazilians, all of whom have brought the
colour and passion of the world's biggest sporting event into America's
living rooms.
Millions of living rooms, in fact. The first four games shown on the ABC
network averaged a 4.7 rating, which translates into 4.4m homes. That is a
larger audience than often watches baseball on summer weekends - certainly
larger than ABC expected. The showcase game prior to last night, the US vs
Romania, earned a 6.8 rating (6.4m homes), the biggest audience ever for a
soccer game on US television.
On ESPN, the first 24 games broadcast averaged a 2.2 rating, or 1.4m homes,
an impressive audience for a sports cable channel. Its biggest audience, for
US-Colombia, was larger than for ESPN's opening baseball game of the 1994
season.
If the numbers have been impressive, the quality of ESPN and ABC's coverage
of the World Cup so far is best described as solid if unspectacular. There
have been few mistakes, and neither broadcaster has missed a goal, an
improvement on the 1990 World Cup when US viewers were unable to enjoy
Italy's lone strike against Ireland because of a commercial break. (Having
learned an important lesson, ABC and ESPN are showing the games without
commercials).
The quality of the commentaries has been patchy, although that is
understandable given the inexperience of the mostly American commentators,
whose unfamiliarity with soccer has been occasionally exposed, most notably
in their inability to anticipate developments in the flow of play, a key
element in live sports commentary.
Jack Edwards, presenter of ESPN's daytime World Cup coverage and a
knowledgeable soccer enthusiast, says the biggest weakness so far has been
'the announcers' failure to understand what's about to happen before it
happens. Most announcers were weaned on mainstream sports in America where
things happen in a grid with very defined segments of action.'
But there are other flaws in the World Cup coverage that cannot be blamed on
ESPN and ABC, which have been receiving the main television feed for the
World Cup from the European Broadcast Union (EBU), an alliance of European
broadcasters. Although ESPN and ABC supplement that feed with their own
cameras and replays, the bulk of what viewers see comes direct from the EBU.
The EBU feed has come in for plenty of criticism, mostly for its
poorly-timed use of replays and its uninspiring selection of crowd shots.
Mike Hill, the British-born soccer expert on ESPN's World Cup Today show,
says of EBU: 'They've missed some good action. It's been disappointing, and
not up to the standard we saw in Italy.'
Richard Sandomir, the TV sports critic for the New York Times, has also been
critical. 'The on-screen choices need better judgment on the time of replays
and close-ups. At least three scoring chances by my count were nearly missed
because of a replay.'
Andreas Cantor, the commentator for Univision, the Miami-based
Spanish-language network which is also broadcasting the World Cup in the US,
has described the EBU feed as 'horrendous', saying: 'I knew they'd try an
American-style broadcast, with a lot of close-ups, head shots and going to
the crowd every three minutes.'
Jose Ramon Diez, vice-president of production for the EBU, denies that they
are trying to appeal to American viewers. 'We try to satisfy not only the
European audience but also the full international audience. So we are
working with a very tough compromise, between the European style and the
South American style, with more close-ups and replays.'
Ultimately, the success of the World Cup coverage depends greatly on the
quality of the soccer itself, and - at least in terms of maintaining high
ratings - on the performance of the home team.
The US national team's passage into the second round was a bonus for the
broadcasters, but they knew it would not be long-lived.
The impact of the home team's departure from the tournament yesterday,
however, need not be disastrous for television, says ESPN's Jack Edwards. 'I
think we'll lose about a quarter of our audience. But there could be a
silver lining. If the Brazilians play beautiful soccer they will have done
us all - and the game - a service.'
It remains to be seen whether US viewers thought Brazil's play yesterday
sufficiently beautiful to keep watching.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Mexico's anti-trust law put to test: Ted Bardacke finds a
pragmatic approach on enforcement of competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Santiago Levy is the man charged with enforcing Mexico's year-old
anti-trust law, in an economy dominated by large companies, which use their
strength to limit competition, but which need to be strong to fight off
foreign competitors.
Mr Levy has approached the task with delicacy, attacking monopolistic
practices, but leaving the monopolies intact.
'People in Mexico generally confuse bigness with monopoly ..but we're
neutral with respect to size,' he says. 'If you say that because of
economies of scale you need to be big to compete in the world market, I say
fine, just make sure you don't use that power to fix prices or write
contracts that are anti-competitive. Our law is behaviour-oriented.
'We're also looking at the structural characteristics of the market,' he
adds. 'There are some markets where even if you are very large and produce
something that is traded on the world market without tariffs, the chances of
exercising any kind of market power are small. Our concern is to make sure
that regardless of size, and regardless of the number of companies in a
particular market, they all avoid monopolistic practices.'
To bear this out, the Federal Competition Commission last week announced a
series of moves, which included:
Fining five financial institutions around Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 390,000)
for manipulating government securities auctions between October and November
of last year. This co-ordination, which involved two of the market's biggest
operators, Banamex and Operadora de Bolsa Serfin, generated an artificial
discount.
Prising open the system by which the state-owned oil giant, Pemex, awards
petrol station franchises. In the past, Pemex awarded these franchises on a
discretionary basis, limiting the number of petrol stations and raising the
possibility of corruption and favouritism. Pemex will now have to award
franchises and deliver petrol to anyone who meets municipal land use and
federal environmental regulations.
Forcing the country's main credit card operators to end the practice of
setting unitary interest rates for their customers and a flat-rate
commission for all retail outlets. Retailers will now be able to negotiate
individual contracts in an effort to cut commissions which, at their current
5 per cent level, are about double those charged in the US. Retailers will
also be able to offer cash discounts.
Fining the national associations of dry cleaners and launderers for price
fixing.
Objecting to a proposed merger between copper wire maker Condumex, owned by
principal Telmex shareholder Mr Carlos Slim, and one of its competitors,
Conductores Latincasa, which would have created a company controlling almost
70 per cent of the copper wire market and dominated raw material purchasing.
Each of these cases seems to have been strategically chosen to set some form
of precedent. Fining financial groups for insider trading established the
right of the commission to undertake its own independent investigations of
financial transactions. Similarly, taking on Pemex upheld the jurisdiction
of the commission over the non-strategic areas of state-sanctioned
monopolies.
The price-fixing cases against credit card operators and launderers
confirmed the consumer advocacy orientation of the commission. And finally,
standing up to Mr Slim, possibly Mexico's most powerful businessman, is a
sign that the commission will not play favourites.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A criminal court judge has issued arrest warrants against executives at
eight pharmaceutical companies in Venezuela for alleged fraud in product
pricing, writes Joseph Mann.
Executives, some of them foreigners, from subsidiaries of four international
companies, Ciba-Geigy, Rhone-Poulenc, Sandoz and Servier, were among those
cited. According to Judge Cristobal Ramirez, the eight companies supplied
'padded' price lists when the previous administration was preparing price
controls.
One drug company executive said the judge's decision was based on a
'misunderstanding' and could be clarified. News of the warrants came as the
government seeks to convince private companies they should feel confident
about investing in Venezuela.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuelan security forces have carried out a wave of raids in recent days
using the special powers assumed last week by the government of President
Rafael Caldera.
The raids have been directed at retailers, to prevent what the government
calls 'hoarding and speculation'; slum city dwellers, to round up violent
criminals; and prominent individuals, in connection with alleged efforts to
destabilise the government.
On June 27, Mr Caldera announced the suspension of six constitutional civil
and economic rights, giving the police broad powers of search, seizure and
arrest only previously used during uprisings.
Since last Thursday, security forces have visited the homes of Mr Orlando
Castro, who owns a radio station that has been critical of the Caldera
government; retired army general Carlos Santiago Ramirez; and Mr Anibal
Romero, a political science professor and a sharp critic of Mr Caldera,
among others.
Maj-Gen Rafael Montero, the defence minister, said at the weekend that the
raids were part of an intelligence operation that would be continuing.
Appearing before a congressional committee recently, the general said the
security forces were investigating groups on the left and right that were
trying to destabilise Venezuela's democratic system.
Press reports suggest at least 10 prominent individuals are being held by
security forces and that hundreds of youths have been detained following
raids on the slum cities.
Mr Romero, whose home in Caracas was visited at night by a group of
heavily-armed state security (Disip) agents, said he later met the Disip
director and answered some 'general questions'.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Soccer 'has lost to violence' says paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the murder of Colombian soccer star Andres Escobar, the sport had lost
out to violence, the Vatican newspaper said yesterday. An editorial in
L'Osservatore Romano said: 'Sports, which above all on the occasion of great
intercontinental events . . . ought to be the transmitter of universal
concepts of peace, brotherhood and loyalty, have become instead the occasion
for new violence.'
Escobar was gunned down in Medellin, Colombia. Escobar scored an own-goal
during a 2-1 loss to the US.
The memory of the 1994 World Cup, said L'Osservatore Romano, 'won't remain
that of a trophy gloriously raised to heaven, but that of a player, on the
ground, down-hearted after the own-goal, symbol of both desperation and of
death.'

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Nigerians upbeat against off-form Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's second-round clash between Italy and Nigeria pits the old against
the new.
The winners of the game at Foxboro stadium near Boston take on Spain in the
quarter-finals. Italy, three-time World Cup winners, have struggled to reach
the second round. Their leading playmaker, Roberto Baggio, hasn't scored in
eight games and has been bitterly criticized for his performance.
The Nigerian team, making their debut in the World Cup finals, boosted their
popularity and chances by winning Group D, ahead of Argentina and Bulgaria.
Italy finished third in Group E with one win, one draw and one loss, scoring
two goals and allowing two.
The Nigerian 'Super Eagles', who have picked up the banner of African soccer
from Cameroon's 'Indomitable Lions', beat both Bulgaria and Greece and lost
2-1 to Argentina.
They play a fast, physical game, with a sometimes suspect defence that is
compensated for by a swift counter-attack led by Rashidi Yekini and Daniel
Amokachi.
Dino Baggio, who scored Italy's winning goal against Norway, was dropped
from the lineup yesterday with a light left thigh strain and replaced in
mid-field by Roberto Donadoni.

FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Holland outclass Irish to end Charlton's
dream
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shrugging off criticism of their first-round form, Holland stirred memories
of their heyday a generation ago by beating a bedraggled Ireland 2-0 in
Orlando yesterday to take their place in the World Cup quarter-finals.
Bergkamp and Jonk scored the first-half goals for Holland which ended
Ireland's low-scoring run. The Irish tried to rally in the second half - a
late goal by McGrath was disallowed - but their limitations had been exposed
by a far sterner and more imaginative Dutch side.
Bergkamp scored in the 11th minute and Jonk blasted home the second in the
41st. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper - extending his record of Irish caps to
77 - grappled with Jonk's searing 25-metre drive but failed to stop it.
Holland's two-goal advantage was the least they deserved as their forwards
constantly out-paced the Irish defence. Manager Dick Advocaat had flirted
with the idea of fielding just two men up front but changed his mind.
Overmars, whose place on the Dutch right flank had appeared most under
threat, more than justified his inclusion.
In the quarter-finals Holland meet the winners of last night's Brazil-US
clash in Dallas.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Poor response to Argentine pensions plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than half of Argentina's estimated 5.8m pension contributors have
opted to switch from the existing state scheme into the country's new
private pension system, following the disorganised and confused launch of
the scheme.
The poor response comes as a disappointment for economy minister Domingo
Cavallo, who had hoped the private pension fund system would simultaneously
raise Argentina's low savings rate, reduce its dependence on foreign capital
and provide long-term finance for industry.
Employees had from May 1 to July 1 to decide whether to continue
contributing to the state's pay-as-you-earn scheme or to choose one of 22
private fund managers to handle their individual pensions plans.
Mr Francisco Cabrera, general manager of fund managers Maxima, estimates
that about 1.8m people have entered the private system with about 2m
remaining in the state scheme.
A further 2m people have had their pension savings parked at a fund manager
run by state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), following an order by
Congress that the July 1 deadline be put back for 90 days.
Mr Cavallo rejected the demand for a delayed deadline, but compromised by
allowing pensions to be held at BNA for the 90-day period.
Mr Cabrera said: 'We are disappointed by the successive changes in the rules
of the game which have confused the public. But there is a good side to all
this. The concept of private pensions has been established. This is a
long-term activity and it is good that people should have plenty of
(investment) choices.'
He said he expects just under half the 2.0m accounts at BNA will eventually
move into the private system and the remainder will return to the state.
However, he still believes the private system can generate the originally
forecast Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) annual cashflow. Under the original rules
drawn up last October, contributors would have their pensions automatically
transferred to a private fund manager unless they opted in writing to remain
in the state system.
Those who had joined the private system could not later return to the state
system. Furthermore, Congress stated that BNA's fund must provide a
government-guaranteed dollar-linked yield. However, President Carlos Menem
vetoed this requirement in May. Later he decreed savers would be allowed to
return to the state system until mid-1996.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Latin America: exports hit by slow pace of reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America's export performance in the last half-century has been
miserable. According to Mr Moises Naim, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment in Washington and a former Venezuelan industry minister, the
region's share of world exports sank from more than 12 per cent in 1950 to
3.6 per cent in 1992, the lowest this century.
'Years of under-investment, protectionism, and technological backwardness
have made Latin America's manufacturing firms utterly inadequate to meet the
exacting requirements of international markets,' he argued in an article in
Foreign Policy journal last year.
Exporters have been hobbled by poor infrastructure, high labour taxes, weak
financial systems and unreliable contract enforcement. 'Most of these
obstacles are slowly being removed. But the lag in the reforms crimps the
international competitiveness of Latin American exporters.'
New studies, for example a report published last month by the consultancy
McKinsey, suggest that economic reform is helping to improve the
competitiveness of Latin American companies.
This is supported by trade statistics showing some shift away from
traditional dependence on raw material exports, and rising exports of
manufactures. Yet the rise in manufactures is often from a low base, and
imports have been soaring.
Poor trade figures have widened the region's current account deficit, and
although this was financed easily last year by capital flows, this year
capital inflows have been more uncertain - underlining the continued
vulnerability of some countries in the region to payments problems.
In the long term, the sustainability of these payments imbalances will hang
on how the capital inflows are used. If capital inflows are financing
productive capacity (as they emphatically did not in the 1970s), then
exports should grow. But it is as yet unclear what proportion of the capital
inflows is financing consumption and what is financing investment.
The quality of investment is also unclear - though with capital importers
now largely from the private sector, investment may well be more efficient
than the state-driven investment of the 1970s.
Even if investment is substantial, the time lags before the benefits flow
through to exports and growth could leave economies vulnerable either to a
financing crisis or a change of direction politically.
Governments throughout the region are under strong pressure from domestic
business to adopt policies to help local industry, despite the poor record
of similar policies in the past, which, according to Mr Naim, did little
more than 'enrich the few shareholders of companies in 'priority' industries
and a few bureaucrats'.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Argentina struggles in world league: High costs and poor
quality compound widening deficit - The new economic order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's trade balance has been deteriorating relentlessly since 1991.
Economists say the deficit could double to Dollars 7bn or Dollars 8bn this
year - not large for an economy with a gross domestic product of Dollars
285bn but worrying given exports last year of only Dollars 13.12bn.
The deficit raises doubts about whether Argentina will be able to sustain
its fixed dollar-peso parity, a central feature of economy minister Domingo
Cavallo's currency convertibility plan. Economists and industrialists
ascribe the rising deficit to an overvalued currency, a strong expansion in
domestic demand, heavy inflows of foreign capital, weak export markets, and,
at least until recently, low commodity prices.
But it has been compounded by the high cost and poor quality of Argentina's
products, and the country's heavy reliance on low value-added commodities -
grain, oilseeds and oil accounted for three-quarters of the 1993 exports.
Argentina has few world-competitive companies. No more than a handful can
meet world quality levels, conform to international safety and design
standards, or promote their products professionally.
Yet, because tariffs have been dramatically lowered and important quotas
largely abolished, companies can no longer rely on captive domestic markets
to buy their goods.
In the past, Argentine companies exported only at times of crisis in the
domestic market and abruptly ceased when domestic markets recovered.
Argentina had a Dollars 8.28bn trade surplus in 1990, a year it was battling
hyperinflation. When Mr Cavallo resuscitated the economy in April 1991 by
making the currency convertible, the surplus halved. In 1992, Argentina
registered its first trade deficit in 11 years and has not been in surplus
since.
Mr Cavallo says the deficit does not worry him, because it shows companies
are installing export-oriented capacity. He points to the growing imports of
capital goods - which rose by nearly half to Dollars 6.54bn in the four
months to April - and imported with zero tariffs, as the main reason for the
surge in imports.
However, at about 19 per cent of GDP, investment, though growing, is widely
considered inadequate. Furthermore, it is heavily angled to sectors such as
infrastructure, privatised utilities, consumer finance and housing - none of
which generates foreign currency earnings.
Mr Oscar Vicente, vice-president of Perez Companc, a conglomerate which
bought important stakes in privatised companies, argues that 'Argentina is
not competitive in industry because it had bad ports, roads, electricity,
telecommunications (when these) services were controlled by the state.' Now
managed by private companies, they are undoubtedly improving in efficiency
and reliability, if not always in cost.
Yet even where investment in industry is taking place, it seems
insufficient. Mr Bernardo Kosacoff of the UN's Economic Commission for Latin
America, says: 'Everyone is investing something. But they are very selective
investments at those points where there are bottlenecks.'
'We are not seeing investments to gain economies of scale to compete with
imports and meet export demand.'
There are a small but growing number of greenfield expansions, but they are
generally concentrated in protected sectors - notably the car industry - or
in industries targeted at the domestic market, such as breweries.
However, says Mr Cavallo, exports are increasing. Last year, exports were
nearly a tenth more than in 1991, with the growth coming from a big rise in
manufactures.
But this increase is from a low base and due primarily to privileged access
to the large Brazilian market through the Mercosur trade pact. Trade
barriers between the two countries have gradually fallen and should all but
disappear by next January, to be followed later by Paraguay and Uruguay.
Already Brazil is Argentina's main supplier and one of its principal export
markets. Brazil exports manufactures to Argentina and imports mainly
commodities.
But full exposure to Brazil's bigger and better-managed companies will
severely test Argentine industry.
Mr Jorge Mostany, president of Autolatina Argentina, the joint venture
linking Ford and Volkswagen in Argentina and Brazil, says his Buenos Aires
plant 'is the most inefficient VW/Ford plant in the world'.
Each worker turns out 14 cars a year, he says, nearly as many as at
Autolatina's much bigger Brazilian plant. But wages in Argentina are more
than double those in Brazil. An Argentine motor industry worker costs more
than Dollars 2,000 a month, including tax, overtime and social security
contributions.
Executives at other Argentine companies say the same thing: they pay close
to first world wages but get third world productivity. Productivity has
improved - Autolatina's output per worker in Argentina has tripled in three
years - but from a low level.
Mr Cavallo has negotiated special agreements into the Mercosur pact to
protect certain industries, notably cars. As a result, Argentina's car
companies more than doubled exports to Brazil to Dollars 500m last year.
Mr Cavallo has also intervened to protect other industries most threatened
by import competition - particularly from Brazil and south east Asia - by
raising import tariffs, imposing quotas or granting tax breaks.
He is also encouraging companies with subsidised loans and export incentives
to specialise in sectors where they are competitive, rather than making a
broad range of goods inefficiently for local consumption. The danger is that
this risks opening the door for demands for yet more protection as foreign
competition intensifies.
Mr Francisco Macri, owner of Socma, one of Argentina's most powerful
industrial groups, warns that underemployment and unemployment - which now
affects nearly 20 per cent of the labour force - could rise to 50 per cent
unless industry gets more time to reconstruct.
He recalls that a previous experiment with free market policies 15 years ago
collapsed under the weight of an overvalued currency and unsustainable
external deficits. That government, he says 'thought (trade liberalisation)
would make industry efficient but destroyed it. It took 15 years to
restructure.'

Italy's inflation rate dropped last month to its lowest for 25 years.
Consumer prices rose by only 0.2 per cent in June, giving an annual rise of
3.7 per cent. June's figure will help ease worries that the decline in
inflation is slowing. The industrialists' organisation Confindustria
expressed concern last month, with consumer price increases moving only
slightly from 4.2 per cent in the first quarter to 4.1 per cent in April and
May. However, the Bank of Italy's governor, Mr Antonio Fazio, said in May
that the implementation of government programmes and the new agreement on
labour costs reinforced expectations of price stability. Consumer price
inflation in Italy was 4.5 per cent last year, against 5.3 per cent in 1992
and 6.3 per cent in 1991.
Turkish inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in June compared with 10 per cent in
May. The government envisages that the annual rate, which is now running at
115 per cent, will fall to 20 per cent by mid-1995.
German wholesale sales rose 4 per cent to DM84bn (Pounds 34.3bn) in May from
April and were up a real 5 per cent year-on-year. Sales in the first five
months rose 1 per cent to DM401bn.
Spain's trade deficit rose for the second consecutive month in May, compared
with last year, to Pta233.7bn (Pounds 1.16bn), up almost 7 per cent. The
deficit for the first five months was Pta896.2bn, down 4 per cent. The
deficit to May with the rest of the EU narrowed by 40 per cent, thanks to a
38 rise in exports.
Norway's current account surplus to April rose to NKr8.086bn (Pounds 755m),
down from NKr9.965bn in the same four months last year.

The conservative Le Quotidien, one of France's leading newspapers, announced
yesterday that it will suspend publication this week because of financial
troubles. The daily, edited by Philippe Tesson, will not appear from
tomorrow and the management said in a statement that a shareholders'
assembly on July 18 would decide whether to close it down or restart
publication in the autumn. The daily, which has a tabloid format but counts
among France's quality newspapers, was revamped recently to mark its 20th
anniversary. It was suspended briefly in 1979 but returned.

Belarus and Russia signed a free trade agreement in a further move to draw
together the economies of the two former Soviet states. The signing took
place at the weekend during a visit to Belarus by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
the Russian prime minister. Economic union has been opposed by some
political groups in Russia because of the proposal to exchange the Belarus
currency at 1-to-1 for the rouble, though it exchanges at 10-to-1 on the
free market. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy,
said the trade agreement was 'an important step', but he was cautious on
prospects for full unification of the economies. The ministries of finance
and the central banks of the two states had been told to finalise plans for
the union by the end of July. The agreement paved the way for similar talks
with other states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The current strength of the D-Mark points to investors' confidence in the
Bundesbank monetary policy, Mr Otmar Issing, the German central bank's chief
economist and member of its policy-making council, said yesterday. Mr Issing
blamed the explosion in the growth of M3 money supply since last year on
'special factors' such as tax changes and market turmoil. Following the cut
in the German discount rate in May, circumstances were such that there would
probably be a gradual reduction in the 'liquidity blockage' which had given
rise to the high M3 growth, he said. His comments suggest that the
Bundesbank is not likely to change its reliance on M3 at its July 21 review
of monetary developments, although some economists have cast doubt on the
credibility of the central bank's monetary policy as it has cut interest
rates at a time when M3 growth is running at more than twice its 4-6 per
cent target rate for the year. In May M3 grew at an annualised, seasonally
adjusted rate of 13.7 per cent.

<TEXT>
Privatisation of Italy's Enel state electricity corporation must aim to
liberalise the sector if it is to safeguard and promote competition, the
country's anti-trust authority said. Mr Francesco Saja, the authority's
chairman, has written to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, pressing for
radical reorganisation. 'The presence of a company with a massively dominant
position in the market could seriously obstruct the entry of new operators
and the development of real competition,' said Mr Saja. The anti-trust
authority believes Enel should be broken up and its constituent activities
then sold. Privatisation represented a unique and unrepeatable opportunity
to encourage competition, said Mr Saja. The present public monopoly must not
be transformed into a private monopoly, he added. It is widely thought that
the privatisation of Enel in its present form may not occur before next
spring. Reorganisation along the lines sought by the anti-trust authority
would probably put back Italian electricity privatisation by two years.

Ukraine's Communist party said it would back Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former
prime minister, in the race for the presidency against Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
the incumbent. The party's support could be crucial in the run-off poll on
Sunday. Mr Kuchma trailed Mr Kravchuk by only 6.5 percentage points in the
first round last month , when the Communist vote gave 13 points to another
Socialist candidate. Mr Kuchma favours closer relations with Russia while
his rival appeals to more nationalist sentiment in the country. Ukraine's
Communists are the single largest bloc in parliament and have attracted
enough independents to create a clear legislative majority. 'The Communists
are the only well-organised political party in Ukraine,' said a western
diplomat. 'Their support could be a significant factor.'

The troubled French bank Credit Lyonnais has secured the agreement of two of
the largest banking unions to shed 1,124 jobs from its workforce in the
first phase of a rationalisation programme. Overall, the bank plans to cut
3,500 jobs over three years, representing nearly 10 per cent of its staff in
France. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, announced details of the package
earlier this year following the conclusion of negotiations with the French
government for a FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.34bn) state-backed rescue plan.
Mr Peyrelevade's management team has since been embroiled in tense
negotiations with the banking unions. The bank has promised to seek no
forced redundancies until next April. Credit Lyonnais is now awaiting
publication of an official parliamentary report into the cause of its
present financial problems. The final document could come out within the
next few weeks.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Bonds boost for Sweden: Finance minister hits back at the
critics of fiscal policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and GRAHAM BOWLEY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, yesterday warmly welcomed heavy
investor interest in a big new state bond issue and hit back strongly at
critics of the government's fiscal policies.
'The reaction to the national bond issue today was very satisfactory,' she
declared.
'This government has done much more than was expected to cut public spending
and much more than has ever been done before in Sweden.'
She was speaking after the National Debt Office announced that a
keenly-anticipated auction of 7-year and 15-year bonds worth SKr6.5bn
(Pounds 550m) had been 100 per cent oversubscribed, with strong overseas
interest.
The yield on the 7-year bonds was 10.51 per cent and the yield on the
15-year bonds was 11.05 per cent.
News of the auction's success knocked long-term interest rates back below 10
per cent and halted a slide on the Stockholm stock exchange.
There had been worries that the auction would not be fully taken up
following the announcement last week by Skandia, the Swedish insurance
group, that it was boycotting government bonds in protest at Sweden's record
budget deficit and fast-rising debt. Gross government debt is set to rise to
93 per cent of GDP this year.
Mrs Wibble said Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, was not 'as
well informed as he should have been' in criticising the right-centre
coalition government for not taking the state of the public finances
seriously enough.
'I don't think I have opened my mouth in the last couple of years without
addressing the problem of the budget situation,' she told the Financial
Times. She said the budget deficit in the just-completed 1993-94 July-June
budget year was slightly less than the previously anticipated 13 per cent of
GDP. It was expected to fall to 9.5 per cent in the current budget year. The
aim was to reduce this to within the 3 per cent target set under terms of
the European Union's plans for a European monetary union by 1998.
'This will be done mostly by reducing expenditure,' Mrs Wibble said. 'The
scale of our medium-term programme is sometimes forgotten . . . The
situation is serious. But the government is very firm in its policy to
reduce expenditure and thus the deficit,' she said.
She said the government has already cut SKr90bn in expenditure - equivalent
to 6 per cent of GDP - in its three years in office and planned a further
SKr60bn over the next four years if it won the general election in
September.
Mrs Wibble blamed high interest rates - long-term rates are three points
ahead of German rates - on uncertainty ahead of the election. She called on
the opposition Social Democrats, who hold a firm lead in the opinion polls,
to outline a clear budget reduction programme. 'We would be most happy if
those on the other side of the political debate would tell investors what
they will do it they get into office.'
But Mr Goran Persson, the Social Democratic economy spokesman, said the
success of the bond auction was due only to the high rate of interest on
offer. The Social Democrats have said it is absurd for the government which
presided over the rise in the deficit to try to blame the opposition. Mr
Persson repeated his call for an emergency meeting of parliament's finance
committee to discuss the issue, but this has been resisted by the coalition
parties.
Analysts were sceptical about how long the rally would last.
'These yields were high enough to tempt domestic private investors and
foreign institutional investors back into Swedish bonds, particularly out of
Danish bonds,' said Mr Theo Hilen, investment director at Lombard Odier in
London. 'But the problems with the public finances remain and we could be
faced with another crisis if these investors decide to take their profits
and run,' he said.
'The relief is likely to be short-lived,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international
economist at SG Warburg.
'We could find ourselves in the same position at the next auction in two
weeks' time. With campaigning for the elections under way it is impossible
for the government to introduce new savings measures and so the turmoil
could last until well into November,' he said.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Treuhand sues bank: Agency seeks to recover communist cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency for eastern Germany has launched a civil
court action in Zurich against the Swiss subsidiary of Bank Austria to
recover Sch1.76bn (Pounds 101m) plus interest. It claims the money was
deposited there by agents of the former East German Communist party in the
spring of 1991 as the German Democratic Republic (GDR) collapsed.
The 359-page suit also accuses Bank Austria of co-operating fully with the
east Germans, particularly in destroying the trail the funds followed.
A Bank Austria spokesman said that a series of transactions managed by a
prominent Austrian communist party official was examined by the Austrian
authorities nearly two years ago when the Treuhand first made its
accusations and found nothing illegal.
The bank contends that it had - and still has - no knowledge that the funds
came from two Berlin companies, Novum Handelsgesellschaft and Transcarbon
Handelsgesellschaft.
The Treuhand claims both were known for their close dealings with the GDR
government. For their part, lawyers for Novum and Transcarbon say their
companies belonged to the Austrian Communist party, and that the money does
not belong to Germany.
What is known is that in May 1991 Ms Rudolfine Steindling, an Austrian
Communist party leader, opened two accounts with Bank Austria (Schweiz),
then called BFZ Bankfinanz.
Ms Steindling was a key go-between in deals between Austria and the former
East bloc countries. She is believed to exercise control over most of the
businesses owned by the Austrian party.
In the months after May 1991 some Sch1.76bn was transferred into the
accounts, a sum that was larger than the bank's balance sheet. The money was
then drawn out gradually between June 1991 and February 1992 in amounts
varying from Sch20m to Sch60m in cash.
The Treuhand suspects that most of it was used to buy Austrian savings bonds
and then deposited in several anonymous numbered accounts in Austrian banks.
All documentary evidence of these fund movements appears to have
disappeared.
Mr Dieter Jann-Corrodi, the Zurich prosecutor, said that when he made
initial investigations in 1992, he was told by BFZ that the funds were
dispersed among various accounts 'for tax reasons'.
The Treuhand's use of civil proceedings is unusual. Money laundering is a
criminal offence in Switzerland and many other countries.
Mr Jann-Corrodi said that if the case were to succeed, the bank itself would
be responsible, not just one or more of its officers.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Smokescreen hides lost Spanish revenue: Cigarette smugglers
are earning millions and staying ahead of the customs men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Seville and Malaga the pitches have all been allocated: one
cigarette-seller at every traffic light. When each has sold his quota of
contraband packets he goes to a telephone and another hawker is sent to take
over.
They are known as los winstoneros, after Winston cigarettes, the RJ Reynolds
brand which is Spain's favourite illegal smoke. 'If everything in this
country worked like the contraband network in Seville, we would be very well
organised,' commented a representative of Tabacalera, the semi-state tobacco
company.
Tabacalera controls the legal distribution of cigarettes in Spain and has a
manufacturing monopoly, including American brands made through joint
ventures. Right outside its main office in Madrid is a metro station, where
illegal cigarettes are sold at the entrance. Until a few months ago,
contraband cigarettes were mostly sold through bars and restaurants. Then
the authorities cracked down. Now street sales have shot up.
Tobacco smuggling has been on the rise in other parts of Europe, too,
especially Germany. But in Spain the problem is serious. Last year the
contraband trade is reckoned to have risen 47 per cent to 650m packets,
almost 23 per cent of total sales of Virginia-tobacco cigarettes and
overtaking Italy as Europe's largest illegal market.
These sales, with a street value of almost Dollars 1bn, are reckoned to have
deprived the treasury of Dollars 750m in revenues, Tabacalera of about
Dollars 320m and retailers Dollars 100m.
The reason is tax. Special tobacco taxes, levied in addition to value-added
tax, have increased in the past two years from 46.8 per cent to 55.4 per
cent. Spain has to bring its rates into line with a 57 per cent EU minimum
next year. This rules out taking the same path as Canada, which has slashed
taxes to discourage a flourishing tobacco racket (Canadian cigarettes are
sent to the US and then smuggled back en masse through Mohawk reservations
straddling the border).
Higher Spanish taxes have hit Tabacalera's sales, at the same time offering
bigger margins for the contraband trade. A packet costing Pta270 (Pounds
1.30) at a tobacconist's or Pta300 legally in a bar now sells on the
pavement at Pta200.
Until recently, the main route was the Atlantic coast of Galicia in
north-west Spain. Consignments would be transferred offshore on to 25ft
launches, each with up to six outboard motors, and concealed in mussel farms
and old canneries. Customs took the smugglers on with boats, aircraft and
helicopters.
'At sea I think we have won. But now it's getting in more easily by land,'
says Mr Joaquin Bobillo, director of Spain's customs department. 'The people
who used to run launches now run trucks.'
The lifting of border restrictions within the European single market has
opened up the contraband route by motorway across the French-Spanish
frontier. American cigarettes are landed at Antwerp or Rotterdam. Officially
destined for Morocco or Cyprus, many of them never leave the EU. For Spain,
the traffic is mostly Winstons, for Italy, Marlboros.
There is now also a flow of cigarettes coming through Germany from Russia
and eastern Europe, again supposedly in transit. Mr Bobillo says there has
up to now been no effective way of monitoring the fake papers sent back to
Germany declaring that the goods have left Spanish ports. Other sources are
Andorra and by speedboat from the British colony of Gibraltar.
The recent growth in smuggling is based on solid tradition and a structure
that has long been in place. There is no stigma attached to a contraband
product. It may even be preferred. Spaniards still tend to assume that
foreign is best. 'It is a problem of culture,' says Mr Bobillo, 'and a hard
one to solve in the short term.'
A recently-dismantled operation in Madrid worked by telephone under the
trade name Servitabac, offering discounts for large purchases. The offices
it would call in search of clients included government departments.
Last autumn Spain introduced special stickers on packets of tax-paid
cigarettes and tough penalties for bars and cafes caught selling contraband.
The measures have evidently had some effect. Tabacalera's sales of premium
Virginia brands, which last year fell by almost 21 per cent, have recovered
sharply. More people are buying their Camels, Chesterfields, Winstons and
Marlboros legally.
But Mr Bobillo says it would be impossible to round up all the illegal
sellers. 'What would you do with them?' he asks. 'We know we can't wipe it
out altogether. You cannot pick up and imprison everybody for a few cartons.
We have to work on the people who are getting the tobacco to them.'
It is a frustrating job for customs and police. They have followed trucks
all the way to the southern port of Algeciras without success. They have
carried out 35,000 inspections in bars. Of these, 8,000 have produced
positive results, but even then the average haul is only 20-25 cartons.
Under the law, bars face closure on the second offence. But none has been
closed.
Measures against big contraband operators can have undesired side-effects.
They have led to a growing connection between tobacco and drug traffic. To
compensate for setbacks in their tobacco trade, Mr Bobillo says the same
operators are increasingly moving into higher-profit items - hashish from
North Africa and cocaine from Latin America.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Auditors hit at lending by Deutsche

<TEXT>
Four senior executives of the Deutsche Bank resigned yesterday following the
publication of a critical auditors' report into the bank's lending to the
Jurgen Schneider group, the property empire which collapsed in April with
debts of more than DM5bn (Pounds 2bn).
The auditors concluded that Deutsche had been the victim of systematic
deception and that there was no evidence of dishonourable conduct at the
bank, the biggest creditor to Schneider, and owed DM1.2bn. But, they found,
Deutsche was lax in the way it dealt with its loans to Schneider and 'more
critical processing should . . . have brought the deception to light'.
Deutsche invested too much trust in Mr Jurgen Schneider, the entrepreneur
whose disappearance in April triggered the company's collapse, the auditors
said. 'Not least because of the level of trust invested in Mr Schneider, the
level of information and controls (at the bank) were not commensurate with
the risks entered into,' the Wollert-Elmendorff Deutsche Industrie-Treuhand
accountancy firm concluded.
Acknowledging the justice of the criticism, Deutsche said that it had
implemented changes in its internal processing and control systems to
prevent similar mistakes being made again. 'Throughout the group the rules
for real estate financing have been strengthened,' the bank said, 'in
particular concerning the criteria for valuation (of properties) and
disbursement (of loans).'
The executives leaving the banking group as a result of the affair are: Mr
Jurgen Huvendick and Mr Detlev Rode, both board directors of Deutsche
Centralbodenkredit, the Deutsche property lending subsidiary through which
the bulk of the group's DM1.2bn loan to the Schneider group was channelled.
Mr Klaus Peter Fischer, a senior official at Deutsche's Baden-Baden branch,
and Michael, Prince of Sachsen-Weimar, a senior official at the Mannheim
branch, were said to have resigned from the bank by mutual agreement.
The admission of mistakes and the resignations contrast with the bank's
reaction in the immediate aftermath of Schneider's disappearance when Mr
Georg Krupp, Deutsche Bank main board director and chairman of the
centralbodenkredit supervisory board, said the bank had not made any errors.
But as the scale of the alleged fraud mounted, the bank hinted that there
would be personnel consequences.
The report gave some comfort to Deutsche, which lent money to Schneider
based on property valuations and estimates of space to be let which turned
out to be dramatically optimistic. Schneider's properties - prestige
developments in historic city centres - were different from others and
therefore difficult to value, the auditors said.
The whereabouts of Mr Schneider remain unknown. Reports that he attempted to
make contact with Frankfurt-based prosecuting authorities via a Swiss lawyer
have not been confirmed.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Two Irish state groups face financial crunch

Financial crises in two loss-making Irish state enterprises came to a head
yesterday.
All 560 employees in Cork-based Irish Steel were laid off and the remaining
1,100 employees in Team Aer Lingus in Dublin, the aircraft maintenance
subsidiary of the state airline, Aer Lingus, were warned that the company
could close 'within days' if unions do not accept an ultimatum on
cost-savings.
Both companies are losing an estimated IPounds 1m (Pounds 989,000) a month,
but efforts to find a compromise between managements and unions in recent
weeks have failed. Talks at the weekend broke down. The government has taken
a hard line with the unions, although the growing prospect of closure of
both companies and the impact on unemployment figures in Dublin and Cork is
causing growing nervousness on the backbenches of the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition.
Four backbench Labour MPs voted against the government last week over the
Team Aer Lingus dispute, in the first sign of serious strains within the
coalition since it came to office 18 months ago.
Some 850 employees at Team Aer Lingus have already been laid off, and the
parent company yesterday announced it will no longer support its loss-making
subsidiary. An Aer Lingus spokesman said that the remainder of Team's
workforce would have to be laid off next week.
'We appear to be at the end of the road,' he said. Redundancy payments for
the 2,000 Team employees could cause renewed financial problems for the Aer
Lingus parent.
Mr Pat Dineen, chairman of Irish Steel, said yesterday his company was now
insolvent and was calling in a liquidator. Its Cobh plant produces around
300,000 tonnes of steel per annum, more than 90 per cent of it exported. A
company spokesman said that up to 200 voluntary redundancies were being
sought to lift productivity to around 1,000 tons of steel per man-year.
Union negotiators at both companies have argued that management survival
proposals will not guarantee their financial viability. The Team Aer Lingus
workforce is insisting on having its own union survival plan for the company
on the table, while the management - backed by the government - is insisting
that a pay freeze and revised working conditions be accepted before further
negotiations can take place.
The deadlock is such that closure of both companies now appears increasingly
likely. The Labour party, which campaigned in the 1992 general elections in
support of the country's state enterprises, is likely to suffer the most
from the political fall-out.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Alcatel chairman questioned over use of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, one of France's largest
companies, was detained for questioning yesterday by magistrates
investigating alleged misuse of corporate funds and over-billing by a
subsidiary of the telecoms and electrical engineering group.
Alcatel described the detention as 'scandalous' and said Mr Suard did not
exercise any functions at Alcatel CIT, the subsidiary under investigation.
Alcatel shares plunged on the news, falling 8.3 per cent to FFr541 and
pulling the Paris stock market lower. The CAC-40 index of leading shares
closed at 1,866, compared with the day's high of 1,907.
The detention of the Alcatel chairman, who was being questioned at
Versailles, is the latest blow to France's industrial establishment.
In May, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the
electrical engineering group, was arrested in Belgium and detained for 12
days as part of an investigation into alleged fraud concerning the treatment
of minority shareholders in two of the group's subsidiaries. Mr
Pineau-Valencienne, who has been released on bail, has denied the
accusations.
Mr Suard is one of France's best-known businessmen, credited with the rapid
expansion of the group since 1986 when he took the helm of Compagnie
Generale d'Electricite, later Alcatel Alsthom.
The company, with 196,500 employees and reported profits of FFr7.1bn (Pounds
844m) last year on sales of FFr156.3bn, is one of the world's largest
telecoms and engineering groups. It has a joint venture with GEC of the UK
and manufactures the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse.
Mr Suard's detention, which can last for 48 hours, is the latest step in an
investigation into alleged over-billing of France Telecom, the state-owned
telecommunications operator, by executives of Alcatel CIT.
The origins of the investigation date back more than a year to an inquiry
into two former employees of Alcatel CIT who were accused of manipulating
prices for equipment ordered by France Telecom for their own benefit.
According to Alcatel, the employees accused senior executives at the
company, including Mr Suard, of having work done at private properties at
the company's expense.
Alcatel Alsthom has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In a letter to employees
in May, Mr Suard condemned what he described as 'a campaign of defamation'.
He said he had paid for all personal work at his home, except security
measures, and Alcatel had never engaged in over-billing, false billing or
double accounting.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Rail union threatens to step up signal staff strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's railway network faces further weeks of widespread disruption after
the RMT transport union's executive decided last night to escalate the
signalling staff dispute if a settlement of their grievances is not achieved
by July 24.
This would involve moving from the current one day a week stoppages to two
days of action a week. In the meantime, tomorrow's one-day strike will go
ahead as planned and this will be followed by further 24-hour stoppages on
the Wednesdays of July 13 and 20.
The RMT's general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said after a five-hour meeting
of the executive that it was 'about time we resumed serious negotiations to
end this dispute on a basis which my members will recognise as fair and
reasonable'. He added that over the weekend signalling staff had made it
clear to the union that they thought the current three-stage productivity
offer from Railtrack was a 'very poor deal'.
The union said that the signalling staff who had contacted the RMT had been
'overwhelmingly hostile to Railtrack's offer'.
'The responses we have been getting today make it clear that members are
still solidly behind the union and I am confident this will be demonstrated
on Wednesday,' said Mr Knapp.
However, he suggested that the union had left Railtrack with time to
reconsider its position.
A company spokesman said last night that Railtrack was 'disappointed that
the RMT had stuck to an unrealistic demand and refused to consider the offer
that will substantially benefit signalling staff'.
Railtrack added that its phones had been 'red hot' all day with signalling
staff who wanted to hear about the offer.
The company believes there is no more than a 'hair's breadth' between the
union demand and the Pounds 28 to Pounds 34 a week the signalmen would
receive in their pay packets between now and October when their final
productivity deal would come into force.
Railtrack believes that the RMT executive is becoming more interested in a
political confrontation than reaching a deal.
Mr Knapp said the company must address the demand for a pay rise for
signalling staff for past productivity achievements and to restore their
earnings position on the railways relative to other workers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday condemned recent quotas imposed by the European Union on
Chinese exports and warned that the curbs would ultimately backfire.
The warning from the Chinese foreign ministry came as Mr Li Peng, the
Chinese prime minister, began a week-long trip to Germany designed to cement
improving relations.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl (pictured with Mr Li Peng at a welcome ceremony in
Bonn) said Germany would use its presidency of the EU to improve trade
between the EU and China.

FT  05 JUL 94 / Cabinet plan to reform Whitehall pay bargaining: Top civil
servants to be put on personal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Cabinet Office white paper due out this month will propose ending
centralised pay bargaining in Whitehall, giving individual departments
control over civil servants' pay and conditions.
In addition, about 2,000 top mandarins at grade five (assistant secretary
level) and above will be put on to personal contracts, with pay linked more
closely to their success in cutting civil service costs.
There is also likely to be a reduced emphasis on annual targets for
market-testing, the process by which civil servants compete against outside
bidders for their work.
The Treasury has become concerned over the cost of market-testing, while
many contractors are reluctant to bid because most contracts are won by
departments' own teams.
There will be increasing encouragement for privatisation, with departments
encouraged to get out of 'non-core' activities such as information
technology and buildings maintenance.
The Treasury wants to see much greater use of 'benchmarking', through which
managers compare costs with the most efficient comparable organisations and
restructure their own to achieve similar levels.
The white paper has been drawn up amid great secrecy by Mr William
Waldegrave, the public services minister, and approved by the prime minister
and a group of senior cabinet colleagues. Those include Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
It foresees a decline in civil service numbers from 554,000 last year to
below half a million over the next four years, the lowest level since the
second world war. When the Conservatives came to power in 1979, there were
732,000.
The main driver of change will be the freeze on running costs, which forces
departments to operate on declining real budgets until 1997. Ministers
believe permanent secretaries and agency chiefs will have to cut costs
radically to stay within targets.
To give them greater flexibility over pay, the biggest element in civil
service costs, departments will take over all personnel functions, including
pay bargaining.
Ministers, however, have rejected fixed-term contracts for senior civil
servants, because of fears that that would politicise Whitehall. Such
contracts have been advocated by civil service critics such as Sir Peter
Kemp, the former permanent secretary responsible for many of the
government's public-service reforms.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said last night that the CBI would welcome the end of national pay
bargaining in the civil service.
'It would be a natural consequence of the freeze on running costs,' he said.
'Without that sort of flexibility, the civil service will soon run up
against skill shortages and local recruitment difficulties.'
But Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the FDA top civil servants'
union, said her members would judge the white paper on three criteria: 'Will
it promote civil service effectiveness rather than the dogma of the
marketplace? Will it sustain ministerial accountability and the political
neutrality of the civil service? And will it make the machinery of
government more open to public scrutiny?'

FT  05 JUL 94 / Bonn dispels prospect of G7 support for US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL, PHILLIP GAWITH and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government moved yesterday to dispel expectations that the summit
of the world's seven leading industrial countries this weekend would try to
strengthen the weak dollar.
Although financial markets were generally quiet, a tightly compressed week
of policymaking meetings - today's session of US Federal Open Market
Committee, the policymaking body of the Federal Reserve; a Bundesbank
council meeting on Thursday; and the G7 summit in Naples beginning the next
day - has intensified speculation that some effort may be made to support
the US currency.
The dollar finished in London at Y98.9 and DM1.5965, barely changed from
Friday's close of Y98.705 and DM1.5946. US financial markets were closed for
the July 4 holiday.
Last week the dollar fell against the yen to a post-1945 low of Y97.68 and
concerns about the US currency contributed to general financial market
volatility.
But the most senior German official involved in the preparation for the G7
summit in Naples said yesterday he did not understand 'the recent excitement
about the dollar, especially in relation to the European currencies'.
Mr Gert Haller, state secretary in the finance ministry and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's personal 'sherpa' for G7, said: 'The developments of recent
weeks have fortunately had no significant effect on European exchange rates.
I cannot see any reason for excitement in that.'
At about DM1.60, the dollar/ D-Mark exchange rate fitted its long-term
average rate, he added.
Mr Haller said a special difficulty existed in the yen-dollar exchange rate,
stemming directly from the 'difficult relations' between the US and Japan
over trade.
Analysts in London said the FOMC faced a dilemma today in that a rise in US
interest rates was likely to push US and European markets lower and might be
seen as a precursor for more concerted action at the G7 meeting. Yet keeping
rates at their present levels could cause a further bout of dollar-selling.
Despite Mr Haller's apparent lack of concern at the dollar's weakness, the
state secretary said trends in the long-term capital markets, particularly
rising US interest rates, were indeed a worry for Germany.
He said that did not reflect the progress made by the German government in
bringing its deficit spending under control, nor the steady decrease in the
German inflation rate, most recently to under 3 per cent. 'If you look at
the short-term interest rates today, I believe there is room for further
reductions in long-term rates,' he said.
Mr Haller said he expected the general improvement in the world economy,
combined with concern at the continuing high level of unemployment, to
dominate the G7 economic agenda.
Germany will also be pushing at the summit for a firm commitment to more
financial assistance to help with nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union
and eastern Europe, including cash to help Ukraine close down all the
reactors at the stricken Chernobyl plant.
Mr Kohl was concerned that closure of Chernobyl should be seen as a step
towards dealing with all the other unsafe nuclear reactors in central and
eastern Europe.

Anthony Forbes, 56, who stepped down as joint senior partner of Cazenove &amp;
Co at the end of April, has started to collect his first non-executive
directorships.
He has joined the board of Carlton Communications and will join Royal
Insurance Holdings on August 10.
Forbes, who joined Cazenove in 1960 after Eton and the Coldstream Guards,
was one of two men who ran the city's best-connected firm of stock brokers
for 14 years. His colleague John Kemp-Welch, 58, takes over as chairman of
the London Stock Exchange on July 14.
Kemp-Welch has already been appointed a non-executive director of Sun
Alliance. Forbes knows Carlton Communications well; Cazenove is one of the
firm's brokers. He soon expects to collect another couple of non-executive
directorships.

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild to put Sizewell case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generation company, is to hire
NM Rothschild to help it make a case for building a second pressurised water
reactor at Sizewell.
Yesterday the group described the merchant bank as 'market leader in all
areas of utility financing'. It added that the funding of another reactor
would be kept separate from the issue of privatisation, for which it has
already hired Morgan Stanley.
Nuclear Electric, which will tomorrow report operating profits of about
Pounds 760m for the year, said that privatisation remained its priority. But
in the light of the government's nuclear review it needed to look at the
future needs of the UK.
One PWR at Sizewell in Suffolk would replace all six of the old Magnox
reactors that will be taken off line in the next 10 to 12 years.
Last week the group outlined an option for financing a new Sizewell power
station which would require an initial government subsidy of up to Pounds
1bn. This would help it to offer a rate of return, between 11 and 12 per
cent, that would attract private sector investors to fund the rest of the
Pounds 3.5bn cost.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Spot the director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Early days yet, but stock market players might want to consider Observer's
latest stock selection toy. It's called a Paddy Linaker, after the boss of
the M&amp;G fund management giant, who steps down at the end of the month.
It works on the principle that Linaker is dead set against companies cutting
their dividends and would not join the board of a company which he thought
might do so. Thus Linaker's joining a board implies it is most unlikely to
cut the dividend.
So far he has joined the boards of the TSB and Fisons. Admittedly, Fisons
shares should have risen on the announcement of Linaker's appointment - not
fallen. Maybe that just shows the stock market has got it wrong again.
Any more of this contrarian thinking and we'll all be in the soup.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday the Italian hotels group holds its annual shareholder meeting
in Milan, amid continuing uncertainty about the intentions of ITT Sheraton
of the US, which holds more than 14 per cent of the company's shares. ITT
tried to win control of the heavily indebted group earlier this year, edging
out the previous front-runner, Forte of the UK. But that plan failed when
shareholders unexpectedly subscribed to a rights issue, which was supposed
to fail and deliver Ciga into ITT's hands via its creditor banks. The
Italian stock market authorities must now decide whether the US company has
effective control of Ciga.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Mannesmann faces shareholder
grilling - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, is likely to face
some testing questions from shareholders on Friday concerning Mr Werner
Dieter, the chief executive who is being investigated by the state
prosecutor for 'activities likely to harm the company.' Mr Dieter allegedly
obliged Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy hydraulic machinery at
inflated prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by his family. The state
prosecutor in Dusseldorf last week opened an investigation and Mannesmann,
which reported a 1993 turnover of DM28bn (Dollars 17.1bn), has commissioned
KPMG, the auditors, to conduct a separate enquiry. There are growing doubts
that the 64-year-old Mr Dieter, chief executive since 1985, will now be
elected chairman of the supervisory board as planned. Mr Dieter has
described the charges as 'laughable' and said they were leaked by the
company to wreck his election to the supervisory board.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Rwandans fire on French
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUTARE, RWANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French marine commandos came under fire from Rwanda Patriotic Front
guerrillas for the first time yesterday as they evacuated nuns and orphans
from the besieged university town of Butare.
'The RPF came over a hill and fired at the convoy leaving town,' Col Didier
Thibaut of the 11th Parachute Regiment of Toulouse said. 'Some of the
bullets lodged in our vehicles, and we returned fire. There were no
casualties on our side.'
Col Thibaut said this was the closest his soldiers had got to the front line
in Rwanda's civil war, perhaps too close for comfort. The brief exchange of
fire underscores the difficulty of the French mandate to protect civilians
while not intervening in the Rwandan conflict.
'Our mission is not to fight the RPF, or to help the Rwandan government
fight the RPF,' Col Thibaut said.
The nuns and orphans, including Europeans, Hutus and Tutsis, were rescued in
a lightning operation as the rebels closed in on Butare. The capture of the
town, which is strategically located between the main roads south to Burundi
and west to Zaire, would be a big victory for the Tutsi-led rebels.
Col Thibaut confirmed last night that the town was expected to capitulate
within hours.
Yesterday afternoon, Butare's leafy boulevards were deserted, while
thousands of civilians streamed out of the town. The route to Burundi was
choked with overloaded vehicles and a mass of people on foot, fleeing with
their mattresses, cooking pots and clothes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is poised to boost formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan after its first
policy review of bilateral ties in 15 years, amid congressional calls to
rescind a ban on high-level exchanges between the two countries.
The move would be the first official recognition from Taiwan's biggest
longstanding ally of its transformation from a military dictatorship to a
democratic state.
The US has funnelled billions of dollars in aid to Taiwan since the ruling
Nationalist government lost China's civil war in 1949.
Observers said changes were likely to be subtle but would enhance the
international profile of Taiwan, which is struggling to counter incessant
diplomatic bullying by China, and pushing to join the United Nations.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, told the Senate foreign
relations committee on Friday that improvements in ties would be made in
line with a 'broad and deep review' of Taiwan policy by the Clinton
administration to be published soon.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, arrived in Germany yesterday at the start
of a six-day visit likely to focus on boosting bilateral trade, Reuter
reports from Bonn.
Mr Li, travelling with more than 30 officials and businessmen, will hold
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He will also meet Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
economics minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, and German business leaders.
During the visit, the two sides are expected to sign accords on
co-ordinating German and Chinese efforts to develop China's railway network
and the transport and telecommunications sectors. Mr Li will also travel to
eastern Germany, including Berlin, and to Munich.
There has been little sign in Germany of the controversy which dogged Mr Li
in Austria, where Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek refused to see him in protest
at China's human rights record, and demonstrations were banned. However,
German human rights groups have called several protests, including one in
Bonn today.
Some members of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic party, including Mr Heiner
Geissler, a leading liberal, and Mr Horst Eylmann, chairman of the
parliamentary legal committee, yesterday urged Bonn not to let Mr Li forget
human rights.
They noted in a statement that Mr Li was widely seen as responsible for the
bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests on Beijing's Tiananmen Square
in 1989. 'The talks must not only be about economic co-operation; above all
there must be demands for human rights in China to be respected,' the
statement said.
But Mr Heinrich Weiss, chairman of the China section of the Federation of
German Industry's East Europe Committee, said human rights and trade should
not be linked.
'You can't use the one to force the other,' he said on German radio. He said
China's record would automatically improve if it was bound into the
international community through trade links.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The reluctance of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, to run for
the European Commission presidency was reinforced at the weekend in the form
of a warning from his most powerful political ally about the problems it
would create if Mr Gonzalez left Madrid for Brussels.
Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan regional president whose party holds the balance
of power in the Spanish parliament, said Mr Gonzalez would be 'a good
candidate' for the Commission post following the deadlock at the Corfu
summit. But he said that if Mr Gonzalez accepted the job it would create 'a
very difficult problem for Spanish politics'. It was therefore logical that
Mr Gonzalez should decline. 'There is a lot of work to do in Spain,' Mr
Pujol said.
Mr Gonzalez last week denied that he was interested in the Brussels post.

FT  04 JUL 94 / FBI takes anti-Mafia doctrine to Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Louis Freeh, the FBI director who arrived in Moscow yesterday as part of
a central and East european tour, said the mounting crime wave in Russia
posed 'common threats' to all.
In an interview with NBC television, he repeated a warning first made in the
US that there was a threat of large-scale theft of nuclear materials inside
Russia.
Mr Freeh, who today opens the FBI's first office in Moscow, was challenged
over a suggestion by Russia's counter-intelligence chief, Mr Sergei
Stepashin, that he had no firm evidence to support these fears.
Mr Freeh, who is to meet Mr Stepashin, conceded no significant cases had yet
come to light, but he cited the finding of some enriched weapons-grade
uranium in Stuttgart, Germany, as indicative of a very serious threat.
Mr Freeh arrived in Moscow from Kiev where he signed a communique on
co-operation between the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine and the US. Mr
Freeh said Ukraine was becoming a main transit zone from Asia to western
Europe in the multi-billion-dollar international drugs trade. 'There is
concern that what we call in international narcotics enforcement, the Balkan
route, from Turkey, Bulgaria, Austria to the west, may be moving north and
using Ukraine as a transit point,' Mr Freeh said.
Russia's deputy interior minister, Mr Mikhail Yegorov, who met Mr Freeh at
the airport, said last month that the Mafia had declared war on the state.
His ministry registered five crime-related bombings a day, while the number
of kidnappings in Moscow alone had soared to 118 in the first six months of
this year from 16 in 1993.
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered a crackdown against Mafia-style gangs.
Yet Mr Yeltsin's decree, which gives police greater powers to hold suspects
and to investigate bank accounts, was highly controversial. Parliament's
lower house said it violated the constitution.
Mr Freeh made it clear that he saw the burgeoning organised crime wave in
Russia as being as much a threat to the US and the west as to Russia itself.
He cited the recent example of Russian organised gangs working with the
Italian Mafia to funnel a big drug consignment into the US.
'We have to go where the crime is . . and not do what we did with respect to
Italian organised crime and that was wait for 50 years before we got
involved,' Mr Freeh said.

Li Peng's trip to the Rhine
Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, will attend a joint Chinese-German
economic conference in Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, at the start of a
week-long visit to the federal republic, including trips to east Germany and
Bavaria, and a boat trip down the Rhine.
Caricom summit: Leaders of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) hold their
annual summit in Barbados (to July 7). There is growing concern at the
economic impact on their small economies of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta).
Some members, led by Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, are hoping to
be listed by the US administration as eligible for Nafta membership. But the
issue appears to be splitting the 20-year-old community, as other members
think that all Caricom members, should seek links with Nafta.
French President Francois Mitterrand launches a French trade and diplomatic
initiative in South Africa, starting with talks in Cape Town with Nelson
Mandela. His visit is the first by a western head of government since
Mandela's inauguration as president. Mitterrand, accompanied by over 100
officials, businessmen and journalists, will also become the first foreign
leader to address the South African parliament for over 30 years.
UK economy: The release of June's M0 data, will be watched for signs of
inflationary pressures. The Bank of England's favoured inflation target, M0
has been growing well outside the government's target band of 0-4 per cent
in recent months. Markets expect today's figure to show a slowdown, with the
annual rate of growth predicted at 6.6 per cent in June, compared with 7.1
per cent in May.
UK building societies: The Treasury is expected to reveal some time this
week the results of a review of building society law which it announced
earlier this year. Interest in any relaxation of merger and takeover rules
for societies has been sharpened by Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn (Dollars
2.73bn) cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
Holidays: US (Independence Day).
TUESDAY 5
Delors pays a visit to Bonn
Jacques Delors and the European Commission visit Bonn for a joint session
with the German cabinet, marking the start of Germany's six-month presidency
of the European Union.
At the top of the European Union's in-tray is the question of the successor
to Mr Delors. It is hoped a candidate acceptable to all will emerge at the
emergency summit called on July 15.
Bosnia: Foreign ministers of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany are
expected to confer in Geneva over ways to implement their newly formulated
partition plan for Bosnia by putting pressure on the warring parties. The
map has already been criticised by Serbs and Moslems, but international
negotiators are describing it as the last chance to avoid all-out war.
Puffing into the sunset:
The last set of accounts for British Rail as a nationalised organisation,
for the year to March 1994, appear today. BR, which spent 45 years under
government ownership, was formally privatised on April 1, though it will
take another two to three years to put the programme into effect. The latest
figures are expected to show some success in holding down costs, leading to
a drop in the level of government subsidy.
Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents meet today and tomorrow to
discuss US monetary policy. Many analysts expect the Fed to react to dollar
weakness and signs of domestic economic strength by raising interest rates
again, either after the meeting or following key employment figures on
Friday.
Full team ahead: Britain's Trades Union Congress, the umbrella for organised
labour, stages a one-day conference in London to discuss full employment. It
is being held to mark the 50th anniversary of the Churchill wartime
coalition government's landmark white paper on the subject.
TUC general secretary John Monks wants to see a renewed national commitment
to the idea of full employment.
Tokyo's District Court is due to hold the first hearing in the case of
former Liberal Democratic construction minister Kishiro Nakamura. He is
charged with taking a Y10m (Pounds 64,000) bribe from Kajima, a construction
company.
FT Survey: Marmara Region of Turkey.

WEDNESDAY 6
Clinton goes to Latvia
President Bill Clinton holds talks with the leaders of all three Baltic
republics on ways to promote economic reform and prospects for trade and
investment.
US officials say the trip is a 'highly symbolic' affirmation of the US's
commitment to the independence of the Baltic countries. Clinton will meet
Latvian president Guntis Ulmanis, and will then be joined by Estonian
President Lennart Meri and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.
Peace prize: Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, foreign minister Shimon
Peres and Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat are due
to be awarded the 1993 Felix Houphouet-Boigny Peace Prize at Unesco
headquarters in Paris.
German unemployment statistics for June are released. They should see a
further seasonal reduction in unemployment, although the underlying trend
remains negative.
UK economy: May's output figures are expected to provide further evidence
that the UK recovery is spreading into the industrial sector. The consensus
is that industrial production and manufacturing output will rise 0.2 per
cent on the month, after surging unexpectedly in April. Measured on a yearly
basis, manufacturing output is expected to be 1.6 per cent higher than last
May.
Pay talks will be held in London for 1.5m local government workers. This
will be a key test for the UK government's public sector pay bill freeze.
Saleroom: Sotheby's in London this morning is offering The Immaculate
Conception by Velasquez (detail below) in its auction of Old Masters. The
attribution of this previously unknown painting has divided the experts, but
Sotheby's is confident enough that it is by the Spanish 17th century artist
to put a Pounds 6m estimate upon it.
Also today, Christie's in London is auctioning a 3,000-year-old Assyrian
sculpture, discovered painted-over in the tuck shop of a school in Dorset.
It is the missing piece of a bas-relief from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II
(883-859 BC) and may fetch Pounds 1m.
Golf: The Scottish Open begins at Gleneagles (to July 9).
THURSDAY 7
Scott inquiry resumes
Lord Justice Scott's inquiry about illegal exports of British arms to Iraq
resumes briefly in public in London to hear evidence from Paul Henderson,
former managing director of Matrix Churchill, the machine tools
manufacturer. He has asked for a hearing in public to respond to allegations
made against him by the former trade and defence minister Lord Trefgarne at
an earlier oral hearing. The Scott inquiry report is due to be published at
the end of the year.
South Africa's vice-president, FW De Klerk, begins an official visit to
Germany, his first since the transition to majority rule in South Africa and

Germany's Bundesbank holds its regular fortnightly council meeting, although
no significant moves on interest rates are expected at the moment.
Faroese election: Inhabitants of the Faroe islands, a self-governing
province of Denmark, vote for their parliament, the Lagting. The poll, which
comes in the midst of an economic crisis, was called when the sitting
coalition government of the Social Democratic Party, the Republican Party
and the Home Rule Party, lost its majority in May.
Pamplona Bull Run: A group of bulls are released to run through the narrow

FRIDAY 8

Leaders of the Group of Seven big industrialised nations gather in Naples

will colour Saturday's discussions on the world economy, although the
meeting is scheduled to focus on how to reduce persistently high
unemployment.
North Korea and the US begin high-level talks in Geneva in an attempt to
resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The US is expected
to offer some form of diplomatic recognition and economic aid in return for
North Korea allowing full international inspections of its nuclear
facilities.
Mad cows and Englishmen: Germany's Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament,
is due to vote on whether to approve the government's proposed six-month ban
on British beef because of mad cow disease BSE.
Stonehenge - The Great Debate: The monument's future is discussed by
international experts at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre.
Transport minister Steven Norris, will face several learned professors in
road economics and engineering, including world experts in engineering
tunnels. Backed by English Heritage they are arguing for an ambitious road
tunnel beneath the Stonehenge stones while the government is proposing a
cheaper by-pass.
WEEKEND 9-10
Ukrainian election run-off
Sunday sees the run-off round of the Ukrainian presidential election. The
top two contenders are President Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma. In the
first round, the incumbent, popular with west-Ukrainian nationalists, had 38
per cent of the vote to the 31 per cent of the eastern missile plant
manager, who is urging friendlier ties with Russia.
Public Services Day is celebrated in the UK on Saturday by the main trade
union grouping, the TUC. It is organising marches and rallies in protest at
the government's public sector pay bill freeze. Among other events, public
sector workers will swell the ranks at the traditional Durham Miners' Gala.
The fragile truce between Bosnia's warring parties is expected to be
extended following its expiry on July 9.
Cricket: Warwickshire play Worcestershire in the final of the Benson and
Hedges knock-out cup at Lord's.

Monday: As the world's leaders prepare for the G7 meeting on Friday, they
can mull over a feast of policy meetings and statistics this week.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan's branch managers meet today. Meanwhile, May's
trade figures are expected to show a small fall in the Japanese trade
surplus - though analysts doubt that this will provide much support for the
dollar against the yen.
Tuesday: After French unemployment hit a record high last week, output
figures today should be more comforting for the government. Analysts expect
to see a small monthly rise, suggesting the recession has bottomed out.
Meanwhile, German manufacturing figures, expected today or tomorrow, are
likely to also point to a slow industrial pick-up, ahead of the Bundesbank's
council meeting on Thursday.
Friday: A spate of US data at the end of the week will be watched with
interest by the markets in light of any decision that the FOMC may have
taken on Tuesday to raise US interest rates. June's non-farm payroll is
expected to show a strong 250,000 rise on the month, while May's consumer
credit is expected to fall.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Third quarter starts with modest rally -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market is looking forward to this morning - effectively the start
of the third quarter of 1994 - with more optimism than seemed possible only
a week ago. Indeed, it could hardly be worse than the April - June quarter,
but there was more than that to the rally in equities at the end of last
week.
So far, the rally has been modest enough and concentrated largely on the
FT-SE 100 list; the Mid-250 stocks have been on the sidelines, sometimes to
their advantage. Charterhouse Tilney Securities says the fall of around 0.8
per cent in the Footsie 100 in June contrasts with falls of 4.2 per cent and
5.1 per cent in the FT-SE Actuaries 350 and FT-SE Actuaries Small Cap
indices respectively.
Markets across Europe have begun to move out of the shadow of the US dollar.
For the first time for many weeks, European bonds, and therefore equities,
held steady as the dollar/yen rate was hammered lower and US Treasuries fell
away. It is not easy to see exactly what the stock market wants from the G7
meetings this week. But fears that the dollar will only be saved by brutal
increases in US interest rates seem to have abated.
'If something can be done about the dollar, then this will ensure the
chances of stabilising markets . . . ' says NatWest Markets. Other analysts
might express themselves more strongly. If the dollar can be stabilised,
bond markets will settle down, and the way will be open for UK equities, in
particular, to respond to recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings
and dividends.
SG Warburg calculates that 'top-down' corporate earnings, having grown by 50
per cent last year, seem set to increase by a further 30 per cent this year.
The flow of new issues and similar share placings continues to mop up a good
part of the liquidity hanging over the stock market. Although liquidity is
likely to increase now that fund managers can move into third-quarter
planning, the new issue flow will have to slacken if shares are to stage a
significant rally.
Unfortunately, there seems little sign of this. Recurrent rumours that the
Kuwaiti authorities would like to place the stake in British Petroleum,
together with Enterprise Oil's purchase of the Lasmo shares held by Philips
&amp; Drew Fund Management, suggest a wealth of potential placing activity in
the background.
This week may be spent waiting for the meeting of the Group of Seven
ministers but there are signs that some fund managers are unwilling to let
UK shares drift any further.
One overseas fund tried, but failed, to put a sizeable sum into the London
market last week. Market traders expect the same fund to reappear this week
and will be watching eagerly for its traces.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Pessimistic mood likely to depress prices -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With pessimism running so high on Wall Street, stocks are likely to stumble
again this week, whether or not the Federal Reserve decides to lift
short-term interest rates.
'Even though the economy, inflation and corporate earnings remain
favourable, the money at the margin is in a nasty mood,' says Mr Byron Wien,
Morgan Stanley's portfolio strategist, in a recent investment advisory.
But bearishness has reached such a crescendo that Mr Wien and other market
observers are taking the contrarian view that the market is poised for a
sustained rally. 'The balance of power, we hope, will shift back to
long-term investors over the summer.'
In the meantime, investors will have to be quick on their feet when they
return from the long Independence Day weekend tomorrow morning. The central
bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin a two-day
policy-making session in Washington. It is anyone's guess whether the year's
fifth move to tighter money is imminent.
For Wall Street, it appears to be a lose-lose situation. If the Fed stands
pat despite the dollar's steady erosion, share prices are likely to slide in
sympathy with the plight of the greenback.
With the US currency hitting a series of record lows against the yen last
week, the bellwether Dow Industrial index could only manage a net gain of 10
points last week.
To a lesser degree, the subdued trading was a reaction to the perception of
mounting inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector. A lack of
response to these signals by the Fed could drive long-term bond yields even
higher, especially with June employment data, the month's most important
economic release, due on Friday. Share prices, in turn, would probably
swoon.
On the other hand, if the Fed opts for higher rates, more investors are
likely to pull out of equities in favour of cash, fearing an autumn of
cooling economic activity and withering corporate earnings.
Mr James Solloway, senior vice-president at Argus Research in New York, is
one of a minority of Wall Street analysts who believe the Fed will hold off
on higher rates. He says the central bank is reluctant to link monetary
policy with currency fluctuations, and dismisses the perception that a surge
in inflation is on the horizon, despite the recent upturn in commodity
prices.
However, he admits to uncertainty on how the market will react to whatever
tack emerges from the FOMC session.
'Right now, this market is driven by emotions, not by the fundamentals,'
says the Argus analyst.

Equity investors remain focused on movements of the yen, writes Emiko
Terazono.
While US government officials have called for a concerted move on interest
rates along with Japan and Germany, the Japanese cabinet would not commit
itself last week to lowering the official discount rate, currently at a
record low of 1.75 per cent.
With the US FOMC meeting and the G7 summit this week, volatility in the
currency markets may increase.
If the yen rises further, the Nikkei index may test the June low of
20,168.53.

Remy Cointreau is due to report final results this week and analysts are
uniformly upbeat about the prospects.
The Estimates Directory quotes a consensus forecast of a 22 per cent rise in
net profits. That would be in line with the performance at six months when
profits were up 24 per cent.
Despite slower growth in the third quarter, due mainly to tax changes in
China, turnover for the nine months to December was up 6.2 per cent. The
last quarter traditionally benefits from higher sales in south-east Asia,
particularly over the Chinese new year.

General Electric of the US is to launch a public bid tomorrow for some 10
per cent of stock held by investors, other than the Italian state holding
ENI, in its Nuovo Pignone turbines subsidiary.
GE will offer L7,149 per share, compared with Friday's closing L7,065, with
the bid ending on August 17.
Last month, the US group bought 99.83m Pignone shares, equivalent to 69.33
per cent of its capital, from ENI, which held on to 20.25 per cent.
Under Italian law, GE is obliged to make a public offer for the remaining
10.42 per cent, which is widely dispersed.

The first 20 per cent tranche of Cimpor, the state cement group is to be
publicly offered on the bourse today.
The offer is seen as a test of investor interest in Portuguese
privatisations, ahead of sales of stakes in the telecommunications and power
utilities planned for the next 12 months.
Foreign institutions, led by Baring Brothers, have underwritten 47 per cent
of the public offer and the remaining 53 per cent has been underwritten by
Portuguese institutions led by Banco Fomento e Exterior.
A second tranche of between 20 and 25 per cent is to be sold to foreign
investors in an offering on foreign exchanges later this year.
The final tranche of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent is scheduled for
sale in the first half of 1995, giving private shareholders control of the
company.

The Bundesbank Council's regular meeting on Thursday will provide a focus
for trading this week.
UBS thinks that in the event of further dollar weakness, speculation about a
supportive gesture by Buba is likely to increase.
'We feel, however, that domestic factors and concerns about its credibility
should prevent the Bundesbank from performing such a step too early.'
UBS adds that since the last cut in headline rates, inflation has only
slowed by 0.2 percentage points and M3 growth argues for caution.
Generally positive statements are expected from Lufthansa, ahead of its
rights issue, and Phillip Holzman at their annual meetings on Wednesday, and
from Mannesmann on Friday.
Meanwhile, the market will be eagerly awaiting news of lucrative contracts
for German companies as Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, makes an
official visit to the country this week.

Oce-van der Grinten, the office equipment maker, will kick off the Dutch
second-quarter reporting season on Friday when it publishes results for the
three months to May 31, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The figures are expected to underline the company's return to the path of
stronger growth first detected in the fourth quarter of last year and
confirmed in the first quarter of this year, when net profit jumped by more
than 60 per cent.
In the latest quarter, Oce is again expected to show a marked rise in net
profit compared with the particularly weak second quarter of 1993, when
results plummeted by 47 per cent.
The beleaguered stock exchange will be hoping Oce-van der Grinten's higher
trend will be matched by better results from other Dutch companies reporting
second-half figures over the next four weeks.
The bourse has been dragged lower so far this summer by the decline in
worldwide equity markets and has given up all the gains recorded early in
1994.
It is particularly weak because of the steady fall in the value of the
dollar, a factor that tends to augur badly for the profits of many Dutch
companies.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Italian investors show signs of issue
fatigue - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
July marks the beginning of the summer holidays for many Italian companies.
But this year it also marks the end - or nearly the end - of a frenetic four
or five weeks of globe-trotting presentations by Italian executives, trying
to sell their new issues of shares to international investors.
The surge in activity on the Milan stock market, prompted by the victory of
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing political grouping in March's general
election, was the spur for a series of rights issues and share offerings by
Italian companies.
Such has been the density of Italian issues - analysts estimate more than
L10,000bn is being raised on the market in July - that some roadshows may
well have collided at big London or Frankfurt banks during June.
Among the biggest forthcoming issues is the L1,650bn sale of shares in
Cariplo, probably the world's biggest savings bank, which is seeking a stock
market listing for the first time, while at more than L4,800bn, last week's
sale of Ina, the state-owned insurer, is Italy's biggest privatisation so
far.
However, evidence is beginning to emerge of 'issue fatigue' on the part of
retail investors in Italy. The public offering of Ina shares, which begin
trading on Wednesday, was oversubscribed, but enthusiasm was muted compared
with previous privatisations. Advisers put part of the blame on the sheer
size of the sale.
The smaller issue by Finanza &amp; Futuro, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's financial
services operation, which has so far raised about L130bn, had to be re-
jigged to account for disappointingly low demand by the Italian public.
However, turbulence on world markets has not substantially dampened
international fund managers' interest in Italian share issues so far, partly
because the strong performance of the stock market this year, particularly
relative to other markets, has buoyed demand.
In addition, 'Italy was completely under-owned by UK fund managers,' before
the start of the privatisation programme, according to one fund manager.
However, the fatigue noted among Italian investors is also beginning to
become apparent in Europe and the US. 'People have overdosed on European
paper in general and on Italian names in particular,' said one observer.
Salomon Brothers, lead manager of the 200m share international tranche of
the Cariplo deal, has decided against targeting the US specifically, given
the relatively small size of the international portion and the relatively
unenthusiastic reception to earlier issues. The deal has a 144a option,
allowing placement among US institutional investors, but there will be no US
roadshows.
Insurance and bank stocks are likely to suffer most, given that the
financial sector is falling out of vogue. The pulling of Mediobanca's
L1,500bn rights issue last month was viewed as a bad omen by some
international investors.
But the more pressing question for the Italian government is whether
international investor appetite will be sufficient to help consume the much
larger state sell-offs to come.
The results of the Ina sale - and early trading in the issue this week  -
should give indications of the prospects for selling shares in Stet, the
state telecommunications company, and Enel, the electricity generator, in
the autumn.
Stet seems likely to attract the strongest interest, given the enthusiasm
for telecommunications, although the stock is already readily available in
the secondary market.

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Merrill Lynch races to top spot -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dramatic about-turn in sentiment in fixed-income markets this year from
bull to bear has been accompanied by a changing of the guard among the top
eurobond houses.
The most notable development has been Merrill Lynch's charge up the league
table from ninth position in mid-1993 to top position, capturing almost 10
per cent of the market on the way.
According to data supplied by Euromoney Bondware, Merrill Lynch lead-managed
the equivalent of Dollars 18.6bn worth of eurobonds from January to June,
compared with Dollars 7.3bn at the same stage last year. In spite of
difficult market conditions, total volume in the first half of this year
only fell to Dollars 195bn from Dollars 210.6bn at the same stage last year.
News last week that Italy had appointed Merrill as the global co-ordinator
of its Dollars 4bn floating-rate note offering denominated in dollars, yen
and D-Marks highlights the efforts the bank has made to expand the number of
currencies in which it can underwrite offerings. For example, Merrill
recently arranged a Pounds 200m offering of 10-year eurobonds for Austria,
its first eurosterling mandate since becoming a market-maker in UK gilts
earlier in the year.
Changes in personnel have also contributed to the higher profile at J. P.
Morgan, up five places to seventh, at SBC, up from 15th to ninth place, and
at ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank, which has risen from 23rd to 16th position.
Mr Jon Greenwood, who left Goldman Sachs in February to join ABN-Amro as
head of syndicate and new issues, says the increased primary market business
has come about as a result of the unification of the fixed-income, equity,
derivatives and treasury departments into one group.
The bank also wants to establish its reputation as a multi-currency house
rather than as a domestic guilder operation. Mr Greenwood says the bank's
target was to become one of the top dozen eurobond houses.
Among the casualties in the first half were the German banks, with Deutsche
Bank falling from first position to sixth, and Dresdner Bank, which has slid
a staggering 13 places to 18th. Syndicate managers blame Dresdner's
performance on its dependence on the D-Mark sector, which only accounted for
7.7 per cent of total volume in the six months, down from 14.6 per cent in
the first half of 1993.
Nomura, the powerful Japanese securities house, has dropped from sixth to
10th place, though over-dependence on the yen would be a poor excuse since
the currency accounted for 13.5 per cent of the total volume, up from 9.9
per cent last year.
Salomon Brothers has failed to build on the success of last year when its
return to the top 10 confirmed its rehabilitation with borrowers and
investors after the Treasury auction scandal of 1991.
Its fall from seventh to 14th position reflects a certain degree of bad
luck, since volatile market conditions scuppered mandates from Hungary and
the Japanese Development Bank, while hopes of doing a deal for Turkey were
blown by a deterioration in investor sentiment towards the country.
However, some observers have interpreted Salomon's lower profile as a
confirmation that, despite its recent efforts to promote itself as a
long-term player, it is still a trading house at heart and therefore
reluctant to pitch for business in a bear market.
Syndicate managers are hopeful that the second half of the year will
continue to produce the large mandates which have persisted despite the
fall-out in the bond markets. Although several frequent borrowers, such as
the Province of Ontario, are well ahead in their funding programmes, others
are not yet in such an enviable position.

The scene is set for a volatile week in the bund market. Sandwiched between
the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday and the G7 session on
Friday comes the meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council on
Thursday.
This is the penultimate meeting before the summer break and possibly the
last opportunity for the central bank to deliver a cut in the discount rate;
the July 21 meeting will be taken up with the annual review of money supply.
Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets Research thinks that in the
context of foreign exchange market turmoil there is a chance of a
co-ordinated move on interest rates - with the Fed raising rates while the
Bundesbank does the opposite. If both move by  1/4 percentage point the
impact would be 'economically insignificant but psychologically important,'
she says.
Following last Friday's weaker than expected west German industrial output
figures, this week's manufacturing orders are likely to confirm the pattern
of a flattening recovery path, says Mr Adolf Rosentock at the Industrial
Bank of Japan in Frankfurt.
In theory this should be good news for the bunds, but the market has long
stopped being driven by domestic fundamentals.

Japanese government bonds have failed to react to the appreciation of the
yen, which is usually seen as a support factor for the market since a
stronger currency depresses imported inflation.
Instead, investors have focused on a possible increase in supply due to the
fiscally expansive stance of the new Murayama administration.
The new government has made clear it will continue to cut income taxes,
while postponing the consumption tax increase, lobbied by the powerful
Ministry of Finance.
The government, however, is running Y2,000bn behind its minimum financing
requirement for the current business year, indicating the downward pressure
on prices will increase later in the year.
Market participants this week will be looking at the quarterly Bank of
Japan's branch manager's meeting, and possible easing of monetary policy in
reaction to the yen's record highs.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has been calling for a co-ordinated
interest rate move - cuts in the official discount rate by Germany and
Japan, and a rise in US interest rates - to stop the dollar's decline.
However, while short-term money market rates may respond to such a move,
bond prices are expected to remain depressed as investors remain cautious
over the possible pressures of extra supply.

If the Federal Reserve felt inclined to intervene on behalf of the battered
dollar with an interest rate rise, tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee
meeting would be the time to do it.
More likely, though, is that the two-day meeting will end without event as
policymakers dwell on the state of the US economy, in particular whether the
spring lull was followed by a rebound in June - a situation far more likely
to prompt monetary tightening in due course.
While the dollar continued its collapse against the yen last week, its
trade-weighted index remained generally stable.
Nor does the Fed seem likely to be panicked by higher commodity prices. Dry
weather in the mid-west is one factor behind the rising commodity prices
index: as Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette pointed out, monetary policy is a
powerful tool, 'but it is difficult to find any examples of higher interest
rates prompting precipitation'.
The event of the week for the bond market is likely to be Friday's
employment report for June. Job numbers are generally expected to be up by
around 250,000 but some estimates put the rise at as much as 350,000. A
figure at the top end of that range could well set the clock ticking on the
next interest rate rise (the following FOMC meeting comes on August 16).

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Fear of increased issuance in Japan -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it has not been hit as hard as other countries, Japan has not been
spared during this year's worldwide tumble in bond prices.
Signs of economic recovery, currency volatility, heavy supply of new bonds
and political uncertainty have combined to push bond yields up by about 1.5
points since January to a high of 4.6 per cent last week.
Evidence that the recession is at last coming to an end - the Bank of
Japan's latest tankan survey showed the first upturn in business confidence
for five years, and gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.9 per
cent in the first quarter of 1994 - has triggered fears of rising inflation.
But with most analysts expecting inflation to fall during the remainder of
1994 and growth expected to be less than  1/2 per cent in the year, the
fears are hard to justify.
What investors in the Japanese bond market really fear is that economic
recovery will be so strong that short-term interest rates are unlikely to
fall much further and, more importantly, that the recovery will increase the
supply of bonds from the corporate sector.
'It is clear from the level of bond yields that the financial markets are
pricing in a sharp recovery, while the economic data only suggests a
bottoming out,' says Mr Eric Fishwick, analyst at IBJ Research.
'They are expecting this recovery to follow previous recoveries, which have
been quick and largely investment-led,' he says. 'So for them, bottoming-out
is synonymous with recovery and will mean a surge in demand for capital.'
Fears of an oversupply of bonds have also been fuelled by Japan's political
troubles. The resignation of Prime Minister Hata has led to a new
socialist-led coalition government less committed to controlling the budget
deficit.
It has pledged a further cut in income taxes to boost the economy, while
postponing a planned offsetting rise in consumption taxes. The markets have
taken this to mean the government will have to increase bond issuance to
finance the deficit.
It is these concerns which have prompted bond dealers to mark prices down to
such an extent, and hedge funds and foreign investors to sell JGBs. Overseas
investors have also been tempted by the strength in the yen to sell Japanese
bonds and take profits.
Equities have been one of the main beneficiaries of the sell-off in bonds,
with investors attracted by the prospect of economic recovery.
'Throughout the bond market decline, however, Japanese investors have been
buying their own bond market. They are cash-rich and with so much currency
volatility they really have to stay with assets denominated in yen,' says Mr
Sanjay Joshi, chief economist at Daiwa Europe.
The recent rise of the yen should, in theory, offset some of these sources
of weakness in the bond market. Its strength should repress inflation and is
likely to hold back the fragile recovery, and so reduce the likelihood of a
rise in interest rates. If the yen remains strong the Bank of Japan will
come under increasing pressure to relax monetary policy.
'There is usually a strong correlation between the strength of the yen and
rises in the JGB market,' said Mr Joshi. This time, however, that
relationship seems to have been broken.
'After the recent appreciation there was no reaction from bonds, which means
they are now vulnerable to any downward correction in the currency,' he
said.
The reason for this, analysts say, is that investors think the current level
of the yen is unsustainable so they prefer to liquidate their holdings of
bonds and take profits now before the yen falls back again.
Views about the outlook for JGBs are divided. Some analysts believe yields
have risen too far and that as it becomes increasingly evident that a strong
recovery is not imminent, a correction is inevitable.
Mr Jim Vestal, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, predicts the
benchmark yield will fall below 4 per cent during the next two months.
Other analysts think the market may stabilise as more domestic institutional
investors are attracted by high long-term yields. Some Y440bn of public
pensions and welfare funds are expected to be allocated to fund managers in
the next few weeks.
Yet others believe the markets have been expecting an imminent, strong
recovery for so long they are not about to change their view now.
Mr Fishwick sees yields rising as high as 6 per cent by the beginning of
next year.
Meanwhile, the bond market will be cheered if the G7 countries move to
support the dollar by raising US and lowering Japanese interest rates.
Whether the Japanese bond market recovers will depend on a number of
factors, not least the pace of economic recovery and international
sentiment.
Worries about oversupply and the credibility of the new government's fiscal
programme are likely to continue to depress the market and in the longer
term, the strength of the yen will probably dominate. But as long as Japan's
politics remain uncertain and the yen volatile, its bond market is unlikely
to settle.

International economic developments, rather than domestic fundamentals, are
likely to dominate the fortunes of the gilts market this week.
With meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Bundesbank council
and the G7, traders will be looking to see if the dollar's recent weakness
leads to any co-ordinated changes in interest rates. However, Wednesday's
monthly meeting of the chancellor and the governor is not expected to lead
to any rate change.
Last week's trading was again volatile, with a Wednesday rally on the
successful floating-rate note auction, followed by a plunge on Thursday as
the markets absorbed disappointing inflation implications in the purchasing
managers index.
According to Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, the
current situation has 'very much the feel of a market which is unable to
sustain upward momentum. The best one can say is that it is in a
consolidation phase.'
Economic data this week could create some inflationary concerns. While the
annual rate of M0 growth in June is expected to fall, it will still be well
outside the government's 0 - 4 per cent monitoring range.
The consensus is that the annual rate of manufacturing production growth
will drop from 3 per cent in April to 1.6 per cent in May.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's equity market gave a negative reaction to the new economic and
monetary measures announced by the government last week, writes Joseph Mann
in Caracas.
The Caracas stock exchange lost more than 10 per cent in the days following
the announcement, which included controls on foreign exchange transactions
and prices as well as the executive's assumption of extraordinary powers.
Further bad news for investors came last Thursday when the administration of
President Rafael Caldera assumed direct control over the country's financial
system.
A 47 per cent devaluation of the bolivar since the start of the year has
pushed prices of strong Venezuelan industrials down to the level of 'penny
stocks'.
Over the first half of the year the Caracas stock index rose nominally by 24
per cent, however inflation remains a problem and could reach well more than
60 per cent by the year end.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquittal of Sia (Tycoon) Song, an influential stock market speculator
has prompted Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission to consider
setting up a task force to investigate the trading of suspected share
cheats.
The Police Department's economic crime suppression unit, which investigates
the activities of market manipulation, is felt to be technically weak and
too open to political influence.
The two-year-old stock market watchdog lost its first prosecution case when
one of the local courts - which are always reluctant to find against the
socially well-connected - said last week that there was insufficient
evidence to show that Mr Song Watchararirong and eleven associates had
ramped the price of Bangkok Bank of Commerce shares in 1992. The House of
Representatives committee looking into stock market regulation has suggested
a task force similar to Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department, which has
the power to subpoena witnesses and to confiscate evidence.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Market watches for dollar support -
Currency markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets look set for a bumpy ride this week as traders
watch anxiously to see whether G7 countries come up with a concerted plan of
support for the dollar.
While the release of US labour market data on Friday will be closely watched
as usual, the prior focus will be on a plethora of important policy meetings
around the globe.
In Japan the Bank of Japan branch managers meet today and tomorrow, the
Federal Open Markets Committee in the US meets tomorrow and Wednesday, the
UK chancellor meets the governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday, and
the Bundesbank council meets the following day.
Crowning it all is the G7 summit which starts in Naples on Friday and
continues over the weekend.
The weakness of the dollar, and its impact on financial markets and economic
growth, will certainly be high on the agenda in Naples. But dollar-bulls
will be hoping for good news from the central banks before then.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of global research at SBC in London, predicts erratic
trading. He says the market has convinced itself that the G7 will try to
help the dollar, and is likely to react sharply to any dollar sensitive
information.
Mr O'Neill says a key issue is how the market is positioned. Based on the
view that the market is probably reasonably square, he predicts that the
dollar will trade in a DM1.56-DM1.61 range, while it could fall as low as
Y95 against the yen.
The market will be looking for clear evidence that leading industrial
nations are prepared to take active and concerted measures to bolster the
dollar. Some analysts have raised the prospect of co-ordinated interest rate
changes.
The chances, however, are slim. In particular, few analysts would bet on the
FOMC raising rates. Late last month Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said the inflation outlook was reasonable.
Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, commented:
'Although dollar weakness does not help, this is as much product of
expectations about Japan and Germany. The Fed may feel that raising US rates
alone will not change these expectations and only risk harming a
decelerating economy.'
The Bank of Japan has repeatedly said that it is not planning to cut its
discount rate from 1.75 per cent. While the Bundesbank may be more keen to
cut rates, it is likely to want to do this at a time of its own choosing.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Low prices and timelags fuel Budapest -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungarians, Budapest's brokers among them, call the summer the cucumber
season, when nothing much happens.
But Hungary's securities houses are far from vegetating. Since April hardly
a week has gone by without a new public offering or private placement of
shares.
Fotex, the private retail group, raised Dollars 70m in April from
international institutions in the largest equity issue ever by a Hungarian
company. In June there were four significant offerings: Egis and Pharmavit
in the pharmaceutical sector, Global TH, the retailer, and Graboplast the
artificial leather producer.
In total, Hungary has seen new issues worth about Dollars 300m since April.
That may not sound a lot in western terms, but it represents more than a
quarter of the Budapest market's capitalisation of Ft113.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
at the end of May.
The burst of new issues, also, for the first time, has lifted portfolio
investment flows above foreign direct investment.
Hungary, more than any of its east European neighbours, had put the focus of
privatisation on trade sales of state companies to western multinationals.
Foreign direct investment was Dollars 2.3bn in 1993, taking the accumulated
stock to more than Dollars 7bn, about half of the total for the region.
However that success has, to some extent, crowded out financial investors.
The Budapest Stock Exchange, the only bourse in eastern Europe when founded
almost four years ago, is now dwarfed by its Warsaw and Prague counterparts.
The wave of new share issues offers Budapest the chance to catch up.
Mr Andras Simor, managing director of CA Securities, the local Creditanstalt
subsidiary and lead manager of the most new issues, said: 'It is high time.'
In a sense, it was just a matter of time. 'Four years have passed since
companies became aware of the stock market,' said Mr Jozsef Rotyis, managing
director of the BSE. 'It is less and less of a problem to have the necessary
three years of audited figures.'
Western industrial investors have also improved the results of many
Hungarian companies to the point that the state can float its remaining
stake. A core western owner with management control provides reassurance to
passive investors.
It does not always work that way. The new issues this spring were to have
led up to a flagship public offering this autumn, of a stake in Matav, the
telecommunications monopoly. But Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, the German
and US telecoms companies which bought 30 per cent of Matav last December,
blocked the transaction.
There are, however, several cases of successful public offerings after a
trade sale, like the brewery, Soproni Sorgyar, controlled by Brau of Austria
and offered this April. And a growing number of private start-up companies
like Pharmavit are mature enough to attract equity finance.
Hungary, in time, has also come round to the need to win popular support for
privatisation by offering more state shareholdings to the public. A
particular stimulus to the conservative government was the parliamentary
election in May, which it eventually lost to the Socialist party.
However, this spring has not been the most propitious to tap equity
investors. Falls in bond markets and in the US dollar have dampened equity
markets throughout the world.
The allure of eastern Europe's markets has faded, too. Warsaw, Prague and
Budapest have all plunged from the dizzy heights they reached in February
and March, proving that the region's bourses can submerge as well as emerge.
The BSE index, which leapt 78 per cent in a month to an all-time high of
2,190 on February 2, has since fallen back by a third. Nor do last month's
three point increase in Forint interest rates and rising yields on
government bonds augur well for domestic demand for shares.
So why the increased activity?
One reason is the time it takes for new issues to get to market. The boom at
the start of the year powered the burst of new issues but the issues
themselves were only able to follow after a timelag. Hungarian transactions
have a long lead time and issuers have to wait until the spring so that they
can present fresh annual results to investors.
In spite of the worsening environment, none of the planned offerings was
derailed. 'We were on the wave of the bullish market and technically there
is no way of stopping a transaction once you start,' said Mr Lotfi Farbott
of the Austrian-owned broker, GiroCredit. 'There is a loss of prestige if
you pull out.'
Moreover, all the issues were fully subscribed and only one, the placing of
Fotex, was scaled back, from a planned Dollars 100m to a eventual Dollars
70m.
Underpinning demand for new issues are the emerging markets funds set up at
the peak of the equity boom. Foremost among them is CS First Boston's
Dollars 200m Central European Growth Fund, launched in February. Quantum,
controlled by the Hungarian-American speculator, Mr George Soros, has
invested in an expansion of the First Hungary Fund.
Other active investors include funds managed by Templeton, John Govett and
Fidelity. 'There are huge funds on the market. They have to spend the money
and they buy everything,' said a broker with a leading firm.
But the institutions say that they can take their time. 'We are not going to
pour the money in,' said Mr Janos Bartha, chief executive of CS First Boston
Budapest. The CSFB fund plans to be only 60-70 per cent invested after the
first year.
More clinching is the argument that Budapest, after falling from
unsustainable heights, is cheap again. The Budapest market is valued at 14
times prospective earnings and many of the new issues have been made at a
substantial discount.
Egis, for instance, was sold at a p/e ratio of just 7.3. All of the main new
issues, except for Fotex, are trading above issue price.
The prospect for further gains is limited in the immediate term, however,
precisely because of the new issues. They have siphoned off capital from the
secondary market. Turnover in shares fell to a 1994 low last week and the
index remains static in the 1400-1500 range.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: Protectionist standards - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ink was not even dry on the agreement closing the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations before the Clinton administration came
forward with a new agenda, one that is entirely its own. At the top of the
list, alongside trade and the environment, come labour standards. Mrs
Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's redoubtable trade minister, promptly responded that
the linkage of trade with labour standards 'would, in effect, provide a
convenient cover for trade protectionism'.
Mr Robert Reich, US secretary of labour, has justified US demands in an
article in the Washington Post, in which he argues that 'some labour
practices simply place countries outside the community of civilised nations.
A consensus list of 'core' labour standards will certainly proscribe goods
produced by prison or slave labour and by very young children'. To this is
added the right to form trades unions and bargain collectively. Action
against countries that violate such standards is, he insists, justified on
humanitarian grounds.
Is it? Slavery is a red herring in this debate. Prison labour sounds equally
dreadful, but what of the argument that prisoners need to learn useful
skills and help support their families? What better way can there be than
for them to produce goods for export? Provided wages and conditions are in
line with those in the market, this seems better than for inmates to rot in
useless idleness.
Should the small children of a destitute Bangladeshi widow be forced to beg
or starve, rather than work? Parents want what is best for their children.
But if the children of the poor are to be educated, resources must be found
to support them and their parents. So one test of US sincerity is the scale
of its aid effort. At one fifth of 1 per cent of gross national product, it
is, in fact, the worst among all industrial countries, except for little
Ireland.
This leaves by far the most significant 'right', that to bargain
collectively. Stripped of its progressive gloss, however, collective
bargaining is merely cartelisation of the labour market. Why is this a
fundamental right, to be placed alongside free speech, the vote, or habeas
corpus?
Mr Reich accuses critics of the sin of 'laissez-faire dogmatism'. On the
contrary, they base themselves on experience. The chart shows the astounding
rise of real wages in the export-oriented economies of east Asia. Does this
perhaps reflect the ability of trades unions to push up wages, thereby
producing what Mr Reich desires, 'the emergence of middle-class economies'?
The answer is no.
As the World Bank says in the study from which the chart is drawn, 'Korea,
Singapore, and Taiwan, China, suppressed independent unions. Malaysia has
independent unions but highly restrictive labour laws. Hong Kong and Japan
do not intervene in labour relations. However, in Japan most unions are
company based'. Mr Reich talks of the expectation that labour standards
should improve as economies develop. So they did, not because of unions, but
because of rapid growth, full employment and specialisation on the basis of
comparative advantage.
In the early stage of development, when massive migration of workers from
the countryside to modern industry is required, strong trade unions
virtually ensure, instead, the emergence of narrow labour aristocracies.
Which country did better in raising labour standards in the 1970s, Korea,
which repressed trade unions, but had export-oriented industrial growth at
15 per cent a year, or India, where a highly unionised, but stunted,
advanced industrial sector grew at only 4.5 per cent.
Mr Reich does more than call for basic rights. He suggests, as a further
test of a country's probity, that 'low-wage workers should become better
off, not worse off, as trade and investment boost national income'. This is
a peculiarly ill-judged suggestion, since the US is one of the few countries
to fail this test over the past two decades. Indeed, by continental European
standards it falls short on many criteria of how an advanced economy should
treat workers. This demonstrates how intellectually fragile labour standards
are, not that the US should sink in the European quagmire.
If the supposed rights are debatable, action against alleged abuses will be
more questionable still. Most of these abuses will, after all, occur in
areas that have little to do with trade. Action might be taken against Sri
Lanka, but we know it will not be taken against China. Furthermore, before
action there must be international agreement on the content of labour
standards. Otherwise, it would just be bullying.
Is there anyone so naive as to suppose this issue has come to the fore
because of concern for the poor? It is, instead, a response to the
adjustments imposed by the rapid growth of developing country exports,
itself among the most effective ways to reduce destitution. If people doubt
that this is the origin of the demand for imposition of minimum labour
standards, they need only know that it is being pushed jointly by the US,
where real wages have stagnated for two decades, and France, most
outspokenly protectionist of major industrial countries.
It is a demand that lacks justification, will not be honestly enforced and
would not significantly improve the lot of developing country workers if it
were to be. Under the pretence of helping the poor, the industrial countries
propose either to undermine their competitiveness or impose protection
against their exports. From the point of view of developing countries, this
appears, inevitably and rightly, to be pure hypocrisy.
