FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: Managing a bull market - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of coffee producing countries will gather in Brasilia, the
Brazilian capital, on Thursday to undertake the relatively pleasant task of
deciding how to manage a bull market.
Delegates from the host country, Colombia, central America and Africa will
be joined at the three-day meeting by US officials in talks prompted by the
record-breaking surge in coffee prices that followed news a week ago that
beans for the 1995-96 crop in Brazil, the world's biggest producer by far,
had been damaged by frost.
Producer stocks available to dampen down the ensuing market surge - London
futures prices rose by more than 40 per cent - are mostly held in Brazil,
estimated at 17m bags (60kg each) and Colombia, 5m bags.
The chief task of the meeting will be to decide how much of this should be
released to the market and on what time scale.
Related questions are expected to concern the degree to which future
consumption may be damaged by the rise of prices to 7 1/2 -year highs and
how to head off an excessive build-up in production that could quickly send
the market from boom to 'bust'.
Before that meeting the world's coffee traders will be looking out for an
official assessment of the extent of the damage to Brazilian bushes.
Analysts' 'guesstimates' last week ranged between 5m and 9m bags out of a
crop previously projected at about 24m bags. The higher figure would
represent about 10 per cent of world coffee production.
With Brazil's coffee frost 'season' having five weeks to run, weather
forecasts for Brazilian growing areas will also be of more than usual
interest. The most damaging frost ever to hit the Brazilian coffee industry
was in 1975, on July 19. That reduced the following year's crop by nearly
three quarters, but since then the bulk of the country's coffee planting has
moved further north, and is therefore less likely to be affected.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: All eyes on the yen - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo had everything last week: the country that once set global standards
for political stability saw the resignation of its third prime minister in a
year; his successor turned out to be the first socialist in the office for
nearly fifty years; and the government he formed on Thursday is perhaps the
oddest coalition of unlike minds ever to sit in cabinet together. And
despite all that the yen finally reached parity with the US cent.
The markets paid little heed to the country's increasingly surreal political
developments, but the yen was another matter. Attention was focused on the
Bank of Japan, which spent more than Dollars 10bn in an attempt to prop up
the dollar.
The BoJ does not wish to ride to the US currency's rescue with an interest
rate cut. This week the Japanese bond market is nervously awaiting the
outcome of the struggle between the bank and the currency markets.
Behind the bank's reluctance to raise rates is a belief that the yen's
strength is a temporary phenomenon. It has repeatedly argued that the
economy is recovering from the recession. Favourable figures for first
quarter GDP growth seemed to support that view. If the recovery continues,
the Japanese trade surplus, the key to the dollar's difficulties, will
decline as imports recover. Inflation, though not an immediate risk, is
still around the corner, says the bank.
The bond market has shared the BoJ's analysis. Bond prices have slumped
since the start of the year. Even last week, as the dollar fell, bond prices
eased again slightly, and the yield on the 10-year bellwether bond reached a
one-year-high at 4.6 per cent. But there are two reasons to be sceptical
about the bank's prognosis, and to be bullish on bonds.
Unlike other currency crises this one is less about speculative flows in the
yen's favour and more about real economic flows. The Japanese economy is
running huge surpluses on both its current account and its capital account.
Though the current account surplus shrank slightly in the first quarter -
down from Dollars 32bn to Dollars 30bn - it was more than offset by the
capital account, which recorded a surplus of Dollars 47bn in the first
quarter, against a deficit of Dollars 6bn in the first quarter of 1993.
Investors have been pouring money into Japanese assets as other countries'
stock markets have plunged. Though this cannot be sustained in the long
term, it explains why demand for yen is so strong.
The recovery is far from guaranteed, especially with the yen obstinately
high. Consumer spending is recovering anaemically. The current account
surplus represents the excess of domestic savings over domestic investment,
and while savings are falling slightly, investment is still in deep decline.
Moreover, despite the central banker's typical caution, inflation is
non-existent in Japan. International pressure will intensify for a monetary
easing. Though the dollar's difficulties are global, it is the US-Japan
bilateral trade relationship that is the greatest source of its weakness. A
further cut in Japanese rates would assist the economy and reduce the
imbalance.
Equities
While the rest of the world's bond and equity markets have moved in tandem
this year, Japan's have become uncoupled. The country is at the stage of the
business cycle where the two can, for a while, move in opposite directions,
as investors believe the as-yet-unrealised profits recovery will offset the
impact of higher interest rates.
So far this year, the Nikkei has been driven upwards almost exclusively by
foreign money. In the first three months of the year, foreign net purchases
of Japanese equities were greater than in the entire previous two years.
Domestic investors remain uninterested. But in the past two months, the flow
from abroad has dried up, and foreigners became net sellers in May, tempted
by profit-taking.
And no wonder. The wise investor who exchanged US dollars for Japanese
equities on December 31 last year would have gained more than 30 per cent in
the six months since, as equities have risen by 20 per cent and the yen has
climbed by 10 per cent. The even wiser investor who liquidated UK equities
in order to buy the Japanese stocks would have made a total opportunity gain
of more than 40 per cent.
With that sort of profit in six months, the foreign-led charge looks like
fading. Optimists are pinning their hopes on domestic investors to take up
the slack. But if they continue to stay away it is hard to see where the
market's gains are coming from. Too many of the institutions had their
fingers burnt last summer, when, having missed out on a similar Nikkei rally
in the first half of the year, they plunged in late only to find the market
drop through the floor for the rest of the year.
Individual investors, the motor behind much of the market's ascent in the
so-called 'bubble years', are still too shell-shocked by the subsequent
collapse to venture away from safety of their deposit accounts. Even if
there were a further cut in interest rates, it is unlikely that savings
rates can fall much lower, and it is unlikely that individuals would be be
tempted back into equities.
Banks
Japan's banks have made strenuous efforts recently to convince investors
that the worst of their difficulties are over. This year they are claiming
that an aggressive policy of writing off bad debts in the past two years has
paid off. More than half the main 'city' banks claimed that their total
problem loans had peaked in the year to end-March.
One of the few problems they face which is not of their own making is the
regulatory approach of the Ministry of Finance. Concerned about the effect
of tax-deductible provisions on fiscal revenues, the MoF has in the past
taken a miserly view of provisioning, requiring banks to justify in detail
every loan they plan to write off or provision.
But the MoF has now confirmed that in the past few months it has taken a
more liberal approach to bad debt provisions, and banks' write-offs are
expected to increase sharply this year.
Banks' declared problem loans are, however, only a proportion of the total,
since they do not include loans to companies in trouble which have not
actually defaulted. Nonetheless, the MoF's new-found leniency will improve
the longer-term earnings outlook for the stronger banks.

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: BankAmerica pays Dollars 50m to
cover losses at fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BankAmerica has paid Dollars 50.5m to cover losses at one of its money
market mutual funds, taking to Dollars 67.9m the cost of compensating
investors for losses on volatile derivative-type securities.
On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a letter in which
it indicated that several other money managers have shouldered losses on
securities which the regulators viewed as unsuitable for money market funds.
Money market funds seek to beat normal bank deposit rates by investing in
short-term debt instruments.
There is an implicit understanding that investors' principal will not be put
at risk - a factor which has encouraged some banks and others to bail out
their funds in recent weeks.
BankAmerica said its funds had held structured notes issued by US government
agencies. The return on such instruments is tied to an external factor - for
instance, the return on a stockmarket index, or the difference between short
and long-term interest rates.
Depending on their structure, such instruments can result in a leveraged
exposure to movements in financial markets.
BankAmerica did not provide details of the particular securities which led
to losses in the two funds, the Pacific Horizon Prime Fund and Government
Fund.
However, it said that these instruments, while permitted under the rules of
the funds, had been unsuitable for the funds.
The bank said all of the funds' structured notes had now been sold. The sale
was prompted by quickly rising US interest rates, 'a significant level of
redemptions' by investors and indications from regulators that structured
notes may be inappropriate for money market funds, it added.
In a letter at the end of last week to the Investment Company Institute, the
mutual funds trade association, Mr Barry Barbash, director of the SEC's
investment management division, outlined types of structured securities that
could be unsuitable for all such funds.
These include inverse floaters (interest on which falls as market rates
rise), leveraged floaters (which give a geared exposure to rate changes),
range floaters (which cease to pay interest when a certain level is
reached), and dual-index floaters (the return on which is tied to the
relationship between two indices).
Recent interest rate rises have 'caused the value of many of these
securities to fall below par,' Mr Barbash said.
The SEC urged all managers of money market funds to develop a plan to
'dispose of the securities in an orderly manner, consistent with the
interests of the fund's shareholders'.

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mexico in telephone
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's government has proposed a sweeping liberalisation of its
long-distance telephone market from January 1997, promising to remove the
most important barriers to competition.
The ministry of communications and transport has agreed not to limit the
number of carriers that can offer long-distance services from 1997, after
the exclusive concession enjoyed by Telefonos de Mexico, the monopoly
provider, expires. Any carrier that complies with government-established
requirements will be granted a licence.
Long-distance carriers will be allowed to establish their own local networks
that will enable them to bypass Telmex altogether when offering
long-distance telephone service. Telmex had strongly opposed this.
'The Mexican government has come down on the side of competition,' said
Bette Massick, an analyst with SG Warburg 'Telmex did not get what it
wanted.'
Telmex earned Dollars 4.23bn from long distance and international calls last
year, over half its revenues. It is by far Mexico's largest quoted company,
with investors acutely concerned about the impact of competition on
revenues, says Ricardo Peon of Baring Securities.
In recent months MCI/Banamex, Iusacell/Bell Atlantic, Motorola/Protexa,
Grupo Domos, and Alfa among others have announced plans to offer
long-distance services in Mexico.
The requirements for carriers to obtain long-distance licences have yet to
be established, and officials predicted tough negotiations. Over the next
few months it will be decided whether carriers will pay a fee for the
licence, whether they will have any non-commercial obligations, and what if
any regulations will govern tariffs.
The prerequisites for domestic long-distance and international long-distance
concessions are likely to be different, with Telmex fighting for tougher
conditions for concessions to international services.
'The core issues are decided,' says Mr Santiago Levy, head of the government
competition commission 'We have a good start to constructing a competitive
telecommunications market in Mexico.'
Under the proposed interconnection plan:
Telmex will initially have to permit interconnection between long-distance
and its local service in 60 of the country's largest cities, and in 200 by
1999. Telmex will set interconnection fees according to the cost of
providing the service, not discriminate against competitive carriers and
separate the accounting of its long-distance arm from its local service
unit.
Users will be able to pre-subscribe to any long-distance telephone service,
rather than choosing one by dialing a specified code, as Telmex had
proposed. Allowing pre-subscription will enable Telmex's competitors to
build up a solid client base, and establish a reputation for service,
according to Mr Levy.

Italian-Thai Development, which dominates the Thai construction sector, has

company at Bt175, valuing the company at Dollars 1.72bn.
Analysts say the price, at the top of the indicated range of Bt150 - Bt175,
leaves little room for immediate trading gains after listing. Nevertheless
Italian-Thai, south-east Asia's biggest construction company based in a
country requiring decades of infrastructure development, will prove
attractive to foreign and local investors. Subscription is on July 6 - 8.
Last year Ital-Thai made a net profit of Bt1bn (Dollars 40m) on turnover of

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Minneapolis bank buys rival in
Dollars 750m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Bank System, a fast-growing Minneapolis-based bank, capped a string of
recent acquisitions with an agreed takeover of local rival Metropolitan
Financial in a deal valued at Dollars 750m.
The acquisition in part signals the growing pace of US bank mergers ahead of
interstate banking legislation expected this year.
'We think the pace of consolidation will accelerate - that has had an effect
on our acquisition strategy,' First Bank said.
Metropolitan strengthens First Bank's position in the central corridor of
the country, adding to its network in states like Minnesota, North and South
Dakota and Wisconsin while extending its reach into additional states such
as Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming.
The all-share deal values Metropolitan at between 1.6 and 1.7 times book
value, depending on the final terms.
Based on its assessment that the merger will result in cost savings of 35
per cent at Metropolitan, First Bank said the deal would add marginally to
its earnings per share in 1995 and 1996.
First Bank has made four acquisitions in the past 18 months to bring it
additional assets of Dollars 9bn, taking its total to Dollars 25.6bn.
Metropolitan will bring a further Dollars 8bn of assets.
Like other regional bank mergers, the transaction is intended to bring down
overall costs by reducing combined overheads and applying common technology,
while extending a broader range of products to the combined customer base.
Metropolitan, a savings bank, has traditionally relied on domestic
mortgages, although it has expanded recently into consumer lending, which
now accounts for Dollars 1.6bn of its Dollars 5.5bn of loans.

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Biogen says drug will reduce
disability in MS sufferers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biogen, the US biotechnology company, expects to announce clinical trial
results within the next four to five weeks which should demonstrate one of
its drugs can reduce disability in multiple sclerosis patients.
It would be the first time a drug has been shown capable of reducing
disability caused by MS, a degenerative disease, which affects about 300,000
people in the US and as many as 400,000 in Europe.
The two-year clinical trial involving 300 patients is designed to show the
safety and effectiveness of Biogen's beta-interferon treatment. Mr Jim
Vincent, chairman, said the trial was designed to show the medicine
measurably reduces disability in MS patients.
At present, the only licensed product for multiple sclerosis is Betaseron,
Schering's treatment. This can slow nerve degeneration and cut the frequency
of attacks, but has not been demonstrated to reduce disability.
The drug, which was launched last year, has had to be rationed because of
huge demand. The product is expected to generate sales of DM560m (Dollars
351m) next year, according to US brokers Morgan Stanley.
If Biogen's beta-interferon receives a licence, the company plans to market
the drug on its own in the US and Europe, where the group believes it can
cover the market with no more than 200 sales representatives.
In Japan, Biogen plans to license the drug to another company. Mr Vincent
said the group was talking to several companies, both Japanese and
multinationals in Japan, and a decision would be taken soon.
Mr Vincent said he did not expect Biogen would need to return to the capital
markets during the launch of beta-interferon and Hirulog, a product that
blocks clotting of the blood. However, he warned the group's profitability
could be affected by the cost of finishing the trials and launching the two
drugs simultaneously in Europe and the US.

China has exceeded its target of Yn100bn (Dollars 11.5bn) for the sale of
Treasury bonds to finance its budget deficit for 1994-95, the People's Bank
announced.
The bulk of the bonds sold carried two and three-year maturities, but other
categories accounted for about 10 per cent of the offering - China's largest
since the Revolution.
Mr Zhang Jialun, a senior Ministry of Finance official responsible for the
bond issue, described as a 'very good trend' the strong demand for bonds
this year: by June 30 Yn102.5bn had been issued.
The two-year bonds carried a coupon rate of 13 per cent while the three-year
paper yielded 13.96 per cent.
China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yn67bn in 1994-95, while total
liabilities, including domestic and foreign debt service, are expected to
amount to Yn129.6bn.

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Concern grows over Swedish bond
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing over today's auction by the Swedish government of SKr6bn
of new government bonds. This follows turmoil in the country's financial
markets on Friday sparked by worries over the continuing rise in state debt.
The turmoil began after remarks made by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of
Skandia, one of Sweden's two leading insurance groups and one of the
country's largest institutional investors, that the company had stopped
buying government bonds in protest at the state of the country's finances.
Mr Wolrath said: 'We are not going to buy a single government bond as long
as the Swedish politicians do not have a trustworthy policy for reducing the
budget deficit.'
Bond yields rose sharply on Friday to almost 10 per cent, the Stockholm
stock exchange fell 2 per cent and the Swedish krona fell against leading
currencies.
Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS in London, said:
'Sweden has the highest real yields in the world, along with Canada. Such
high real interest rates imply an ever-increasing burden of financing and it
is this combination of high real rates and a rapidly rising debt to income
ratio which has the potential for a buyers' strike, which seems to be taking
place.'
Other insurance groups have said they would continue to trade in government
bonds and senior officials at the Finance Ministry said they did not expect
any short-term problems.
It is feared, however, that the government will have difficulty in meeting
its financing needs as a result of Skandia's move.
Sweden has the fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development member countries, standing at about 80 per cent
of gross national product at the end of last year, and a budget deficit of
13 per cent of GNP.

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming chiefs paid more than Pounds
1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two executives of Robert Fleming Holdings, the investment bank, were paid
more than Pounds 1.5m in the year to March 31 1994, while a third senior
executive earned a little more than Pounds 1m, according to the company's
annual report.
A further five senior executives received total remuneration of between
Pounds 525,000 and Pounds 795,000.
In addition loans to directors nearly doubled in the year, with Pounds 4.1m
to 22 directors outstanding at year-end, up from Pounds 2.5m in April 1993.
Fleming saw pre-tax profits rise by 97 per cent to Pounds 209.9m in that
period.
In 1992-93 the highest paid executive was paid a total remuneration of
Pounds 955,000, with the next highest receiving Pounds 815,000.
Overall, the total remuneration paid to Fleming's 26 executive directors in
1993-94 rose by 50 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, against Pounds 7.8m in the
comparable period. Of that, Pounds 8.2m represented performance related pay.
In the previous year, senior executives received a far more modest Pounds
4.1m in preformance related pay.
The annual report only details performance related bonuses to executive
directors, although other Fleming officials also apparently received
significant performance-related packages.
Mr John Manser, group chief executive, said last week that almost all of the
increase of about Pounds 60m in administrative costs represents
profit-related pay.
The annual report also shows that Mr Manser exercised 30,000 of his stock
options during the year, while being granted an additional 10,000. Mr
William Harrison, chief executive of the investment banking division was
granted the most stock options during the year, a total of 50,000.

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail rejects offer for Chiltern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Daily Mail and General Trust has rejected the offer by CLT, one of Europe's
largest private broadcasters, for its shares in Chiltern Radio, which
broadcasts in the north and the Home Counties.
DMGT, which recently acquired an 18.5 per cent stake in Chiltern, claimed
that the offer significantly undervalued Chiltern's prospects.
Luxembourg-based CLT has offered 242p per share valuing the company at
Pounds 16.9m.
DMGT also announced that it was buying up to 9.99 per cent of Chiltern's
shares in the market at 300p each. DMGT and European Media Associates, a
company formed by DMGT with European Media Partners, are seeking to buy up
to 648,587 Chiltern shares.
Chiltern said it planned to have talks with both DMGT and CLT.

Strong growth in its core home shopping businesses enabled Kleeneze to

Pounds 404,000.

621,000).
Turnover was Pounds 40.3m, against Pounds 29.2m, which included Pounds 2.87m

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AH Ball drops into losses of Pounds 405,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AH Ball, the civil engineer, announced a drop into losses of Pounds 405,000,
compared with a profit of Pounds 406,000, for the year ended March 31 1994.
The main problem of the year was a substantial loss on three contracts which
brought the gross profit margin down from 28.6 per cent to 14 per cent. This
was reflected in a fall in gross profits from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 1.19m
on turnover up from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.63m.
There is no final dividend, as forewarned, so the interim of 1p compares
with a total of 3.2p. Losses per share came out at 3.87p (4.42p).

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Utd Friendly action over purchase -
Independent expert sought to rule on Acuma buy from Amex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Friendly, the life and general insurance company, has started legal
action over its purchase of Acuma, the pension, financial consulting and
life insurance company, from American Express.
In a summons issued in the High Court last week, United seeks the
appointment of an independent expert to rule on how much it should pay Amex
for Acuma.
United announced last October that it was buying Acuma Financial Products
and Acuma. It made a payment on account of Pounds 11.4m in November but in
February wrote to Amex saying that it disagreed with the preparation of
Acuma's accounts.
United now wants Mr David Cade, a partner in Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm, nominated for the role by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, to help adjudicate on the final amount it
should pay.
The two sides have already agreed on the appointment of Mr Duncan Ferguson,
an actuary at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, to help resolve other differences.
United says that the terms of its deal with Amex allowed for its seeking to
alter the final purchase price after it had been sent Acuma's completion
accounts and net asset value statement. United's summons states that they
were received on January 24.
'The final purchase price for the deal is based on quite a lengthy legal
contract and we have been discussing with Amex, effectively over the last
six months, the interpretation of those terms,' said Mr John Instance, chief
executive of Acuma and a main board director of United.
'We feel that discussions are dragging on and our legal advisers just
suggested that the use of a writ was a mechanism to expedite a final
agreement,' he said.
The summons states that on February 11 United wrote to Acuma Financial
Services, an Amex subsidiary and a second defendant, listing its objections
to Acuma's accounts.
Amex then wrote back but with the two sides unable to reach agreement,
United says it is entitled under the original contract to seek the
appointment of a chartered accountant to rule on the accounting issues.
In particular it wants Mr Cade to adjudicate on two areas of Acuma's balance
sheet as of October 31, both relating to the calculation of net asset value.
They are total assets less current liabilities, valued by Amex at Pounds
111.6m, and the long term business fund, stated as Pounds 107m.
United's main business has been selling life assurance and general insurance
to middle and lower income households. However by buying Acuma United gained
access to up to 20,000 better-off households.
In its annual report for the financial year to December 31 1993 Mr John
Rampe, United's chairman, described Acuma as 'the most important strategic
development during the year'.
Mr Instance said yesterday said the dispute with Amex was not because of new
bad debt provision for possible mis-selling of pension plans by Acuma sales
staff.
'Acuma was doing things consistent with the rest of the industry. There have
been no discoveries of anything we were not aware of before,' he said.
Amex said on Friday: 'We are in the process of the reviewing the summons and
we have no comment at this time.'
Pre-tax profits of United dropped by Pounds 3m to Pounds 20.4m last year
mainly due to a decline in motor insurance profits.

<TEXT>
Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company, has announced yet another management
reshuffle.
The moves follow the decision by Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, to hand over
executive responsibilities to Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief
executive, last month and cease being a non-executive director in September.
Sir Richard, who was research and development director until last year, is
passing responsibility for R&amp;D to Dr Franz Humer, chief operating officer.
Dr Humer will also have responsibility for the technical directorate, mostly
manufacturing and quality assurance, and Latin America.
Mr Neil Maidment, who controls the Asian-Pacific, African and Middle East
markets will take over some European markets from Dr Humer. Mr Robert Ingram
will have responsibility for north America and Mr Hiroshi Konishi for Japan.
All will report directly to Sir Richard.
Sir Mark Richmond remains director of research, and Dr Goran Ando, stays as
director of group development and product strategy, but both report to Dr
Humer.

FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prudential sells Irish life assurance arm
for Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has sold its Irish life assurance
and pensions company to Irish Permanent Building Society for Pounds 30m
cash.
Prudential Life of Ireland was already involved in a joint venture with
Irish Permanent through Irish Permanent Life and Pensions, which sells
pensions, investment and life products through the society's branch network.
The purchase was driven by the same factors that have led some larger UK
building societies to set up their own life operations. Details of the deal
will be given in the prospectus to be issued by Irish Permanent as it
prepares to convert from a mutual organisation to plc status in the autumn.
Prudential Life of Ireland is among the country's 10 largest life insurers
with 6.7 per cent of the individual regular premium market.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Test of momentum for the big issue
 -Ina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian and international institutional investors will know tomorrow how
many shares they have been allocated in the biggest Italian privatisation so
far: the sale of 51 per cent of Ina, the state-owned insurer, which closed
last week. Small investors  - more than 400,000 of whom applied for shares
 -should hear about their allocation by Wednesday morning, when dealings
will start on the Milan and New York stock exchanges, and on London's SEAQ
International.
The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, expects to raise more
than L4,800bn (Pounds 1.97bn) from the sale, making it by far the largest
privatisation yet attempted. Investors and analysts are watching carefully
to gauge the success of the issue, which was prudently priced at L2,400 a
share, towards the lower end of the range originally suggested by the
treasury.
In view of the recent turbulence on Italian and international markets and
suggestions that the Italian public may be weary of large flotations,
advisers to the government will be hoping for lively trading on Wednesday as
an indication that the momentum of previous issues is being maintained. In
the autumn, the government expects to return to the market with offers of
shares in Stet, the telecommunications holding company, and Enel, the
electricity generator.

Greene King's interim results were particularly disappointing with profits
almost unchanged. Since then, the shares have been among the weakest in the

20.3m the year before. Any improvement this time will be regarded as

FT  04 JUL 94 / Jett joins battle with Kidder Peabody: Multi-millionaire
bond trader sees himself as victim of smear campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
As Joseph Jett sees it, it is largely about race. Two and a half months
after he was sacked from Kidder Peabody after allegedly mounting a Dollars
350m (Pounds 230.2m) trading scam, the black trader is beginning his fight
back - and out to paint himself as the victim of a smear campaign.
'They depicted me as being an urban black criminal,' Mr Jett says now of
Kidder and its parent, General Electric.
'That is something I rail against. I have never in my life attempted to use
my race as an advantage. I cannot allow it to be used as a weapon against me
 -and that is what Kidder and GE's . . . public relations blitz was.'
The continuing saga of Joseph Jett is proving baleful for Kidder. The
revelation in April that the firm's profits had been overstated in earlier
years by Dollars 350m - fictitious profits that the firm claims Mr Jett
conjured up through his bond trading - touched off a deeper scepticism on
Wall Street about the security firm's health.
That resulted at the end of last month in the departure of Kidder's chairman
and chief executive, Mr Michael Carpenter.
The Joseph Jett affair is unlikely to end there.
He will not discuss the specific allegations that Kidder has levelled
against him, but it is clear that the former trader will try to implicate
other senior executives.
Referring to management oversight of his trading strategy, Mr Jett says:
'Kidder is one of the flattest organisations on the street. The management
is direct, it's right there. The things that made Kidder strong - the
flatness of the organisation - meant that management had to be involved.'
The rise and fall of Joseph Jett is a story with a moral - whatever your
point of view. According to Mr Jett himself, an articulate, Harvard-educated
36-year-old, it is all about how powerful corporate interests gang up on an
outsider when a scapegoat is needed.
Kidder was losing money, and needed to blame it on someone, he says.
According to many observers on Wall Street, it is about what happens when an
ambitious securities firm with lax controls gives too much power to a trader
with a chequered past. Mr Jett was made redundant from two previous trading
jobs, yet was made head of Kidder's government bond desk after only two
years with the firm.
In an interview last week, Mr Jett attempted to dispel such notions.
Comparing himself with Mr Mike Vranos, the Kidder mortgage bond chief whose
bonus last year topped even Mr Jett's own Dollars 9m, he said: 'If you look
at Vranos' progress and you look at mine, there is no difference - except
that I'm older and better educated.'
In Mr Jett's version of events, he also created Wall Street's biggest
trading operation in stripped bonds, the specialised part of the fixed
income markets in which he operated.
'No matter what Kidder now says about me, besmirching my name, I took that
operation from having 3 per cent market share to I believe close to 40 per
cent market share. No institution on Wall Street could do a strip trade
without coming through Joseph Jett - no one could. We were that big, we were
that powerful.'
In such comments, there are echoes of another Joseph Jett - the aggressive,
take-no-prisoners trader depicted in a number of reports.
But Mr Jett now plays down such characteristics. That depiction - and the
racial overtones of the attack - he likens to the case of OJ Simpson, the US
football hero charged with murdering his wife. Referring to an infamous
magazine cover which has sparked accusations of racism aimed at Simpson, Mr
Jett says: 'It's like Time magazine darkening OJ Simpson's face. If you
allow it to be said and done, perception become reality. You keep repeating
it and repeating it, and all of a sudden it's true.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel pessimistic on share inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's investigation into the alleged downward manipulation of its
share price ahead of the pricing of its Pounds 858m rights issue is likely
to prove unsuccessful, according to the company.
Its efforts have been hampered by French secrecy laws which mean details of
any market manipulation are unlikely to emerge. 'I don't think we will ever
find the smoking gun,' said Mr Stephen Walker, Eurotunnel's company
secretary.
Last month the company issued Section 212 notices to British and French
financial institutions to discover if underwriters had sold shares they did
not own to buy them back later more cheaply. Eurotunnel believes any
large-scale shorting was done in Paris but the details that several
French-based institutions have given in their 212 returns are very limited.
Banque Worms, for example, stated it did not own or have an interest in any
Eurotunnel shares but held about 9.5m on behalf of approximately 2,000
clients.
'French law imposes banking secrecy obligations which prevent us from giving
you further information in the absence of authority from our clients,'
Banque Worms said.
Exact movements of shareholdings in the run-up to the rights issue
announcement on May 26 will emerge in about six weeks once NatWest
Registrars has computed all Eurotunnel share trading details. However
summaries of the 212 replies from UK underwriters indicate the report is
unlikely to yield many clues.
SG Warburg, for example, states it had a short position in Registered Units
at various times from March 1 to June 9, but over the period its holding was
broadly level.
Only amongst non-underwriters is there evidence of large-scale shorting and
selling in London. NatWest securities reveals it was a large seller of
Eurotunnel shares over the rights issue period. In its 212 reply dated June
23 Morgan Stanley declared that it had a 'short nominee interest' of 7.6m
shares.
The 212 notices were issued after the Commission des Operations de Bourse,
the French stock market regulator, began an investigation.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Spotlight likely to fall on fate
of cash mountain - GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City analysts are expecting a modest advance in pre-tax profits at GEC for
the year to March, with forecasts ranging from Pounds 875m to Pounds 900m
compared with the Pounds 863m made in 1992-93.
The group's perpetually rising cash mountain is expected to have grown even
bigger, possibly reaching Pounds 2.5bn compared with Pounds 2.2bn.
The backlog of orders is also expected to look healthy, possibly topping
Pounds 13bn, compared with Pounds 12.3bn last year. Although it came too
late to affect the forthcoming figures, the company recently announced a
large train construction contract in South Korea for GEC-Alsthom, its joint
venture with Alcatel Alsthom of France.
The market will be watching carefully for any announcement from Lord
Weinstock, the managing director, about how he intends to spend the cash
mountain; and also about how long he intends to continue working after his
70th birthday on July 29.
Mr James Heal, electronics analyst at Hoare Govett who is projecting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 895m, said questions will also be asked about the effect
on the company of cost over-runs on the European Fighter Aircraft.
The Eurofighter's future has also been overshadowed recently by doubts in
Germany over the need for the project.
Mr Brian Rusling, technology analyst at Yamichi, whose profit forecast is at
the lower end of the range, said: 'I would be a little cautious about
current trading conditions. The real attraction is the yield on the final
dividend.' At Friday's close of 288p, the yield was about 4.5 per cent,
above the FT-SE 100 average.
The consensus forecast for the dividend is about 10.8p, a slight increase on
last year's figure of 10.3p.
Earnings per share are pencilled in at between 19.9p and 20.8p, up from
19.7p the previous year.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Spanish telecoms group joins global alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonica, the Spanish national telecommunications operator, has joined
Unisource, the joint venture of the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss telecoms
operators which last month forged a European alliance with AT&amp;T, the largest
US telecoms company.
The move came as the three founding companies announced initial steps to
merge their international telecoms networks, and the Spanish government
agreed to open Spain's undeveloped mobile phone market to competition.
With turnover of nearly Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) in 1992, Telefonica is
far larger than its new partners. Its strong international holdings -
notably its telecoms stakes across Latin America - make it particularly
attractive to AT&amp;T and its European partners.
Telefonica is expected to take a 25 per cent equity stake in Unisource.
Unisource was established two years ago by the Dutch, Swiss and Swedish
operators as a means of pooling their efforts to exploit the growing market
for one-stop international telecoms services.
Telefonica was attracted to Unisource by its successes in the multinational
corporate sector, and by the desire to link up to a wider alliance as
Europe's larger operators line up in rival transatlantic groupings.
British Telecommunications last year signed a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with
MCI, the second largest US long-distance operator, and is set to compete
fiercely with Telefonica in the Spanish market through a deal with Banco
Santander, one of Spain's largest banks.
The other transatlantic alliance is between France Telecom, Deutsche
Telekom, and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator.
Unlike its Swiss and Swedish partners, Telefonica is in the private sector.
Its largest shareholder is the Spanish state with a 32 per cent holding.
Reversing Telefonica's long-standing opposition to early competition in the
Spanish telecoms market, Mr Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu, its chairman, said:
'We support the Unisource policy toward opening telecommunications markets
within Europe.'
The Spanish government has taken the first step by abolishing Telefonica's
monopoly over mobile telephony. Competitors will soon be invited to bid for
a second licence to operate a digital cellular network.
The Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators have decided to strengthen
their existing Unisource alliance by progressively merging their
international networks, with the aim of securing a fifth of worldwide
telephone traffic by 2000.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Gencor to reveal details of Shell deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Details of the long-awaited, Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) deal for Gencor of
South Africa to buy the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and metals
operations are expected to surface this week.
Gencor is already heavily involved in mining and metals in South Africa  -
producing gold, platinum, coal, and aluminium among other things - and the
Shell transaction, involving assets mainly under the Billiton banner, is
designed to make it an equally important player on the international stage.
However, negotiations have been dogged with difficulties. First, Shell
insisted on an early announcement in May last year after Gencor made its
unsolicited approach. Since then various deadlines have passed because
untangling the assets Gencor wants from other Shell operations worldwide
took more time than expected, and because of the complexities of Gencor's
financing problems.
Gencor originally intended to acquire the Billiton assets, which then had a
book value of Dollars 1.8bn, merge them with its own operations outside
South Africa as well as its R1.5bn (Dollars 410m), 50 per cent stake in
Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, and to float the new group in London.
It was considering taking on a partner or partners to help finance the deal.
Billiton is far from a hidden jewel within Shell. Low metals prices and
restructuring charges sent its net losses to Dollars 142m last year, from a
Dollars 75m loss in 1992.
And during the course of negotiations two important assets were ruled out of
the transaction:
Shell decided to go ahead with the flotation of some of its Australian
mining assets, a move being considered before Gencor's approach. These
assets, including Shell's 30 per cent stake in the lucrative Boddington gold
mine in Western Australia, are expected to raise about ADollars 400m (Pounds
193.2m) and Gencor said it could not match that price;
Shell also put its one-third stake in the Collahausi copper project in Chile
up for auction after Minorco, the cash-rich subsidiary of Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, indicated it would exercise its pre-emptive
rights to the holding.
This was disappointing for Gencor as the USDollars 1bn Collahausi scheme is
one of Billiton's better assets while the Australian operations would have
provided valuable cash flow to help pay for the debt Gencor has arranged to
raise outside South Africa with a consortium of banks. The Reserve Bank,
South Africa's central bank, has approved outline debt arrangements as well
as giving permission for Gencor to take its Richards Bay Minerals stake
offshore.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Arafat joins Rabin in strong defence of peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister, united yesterday in strongly defending their peace agreement
against its opponents on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide.
Mr Arafat, on the third day of his triumphant homecoming to the Gaza Strip,
warned people not to heed opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
'Peace has many enemies and there are many attempts to sabotage and destroy
the peace of the brave,' he said. 'This is why we are all requested to
defend this peace because this peace is for all of us  - Israelis and
Palestinians.'
Mr Rabin echoed the PLO chairman's remarks and attacked rightwing
demonstrators protesting against Mr Arafat's landmark visit to Gaza. He said
he supported the Palestinian leader's homecoming and promised to strengthen
the peace with Palestinians.
'The process will continue,' Mr Rabin said in a speech to members of his
ruling Labour party after hundreds of Israeli protesters clashed with police
in Jerusalem in a third day of rightwing demonstrations against the PLO
leader's visit. 'We have an interest in strengthening the elements among the
Palestinians who want the accord.'
The joint defence of the peace process came as Mr Arafat plunged into the
job of running the shattered Gaza Strip, forging ties with his impoverished
people and pledging to expand Palestinian self-rule quickly from
Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the West Bank.
In Gaza City Mr Arafat sought to demonstrate his concern about the deep
economic troubles facing the 850,000 mostly jobless residents of the strip,
inaugurating a citrus juice factory funded by foreign aid.
Mr Arafat made the visit after criticising international donors for the
delay in releasing millions of dollars of promised assistance and described
the situation in Gaza as close to 'starvation'.
The veteran guerrilla turned peacemaker, who returned last Friday after 27
years in exile, also said he wanted Israel to pull its forces out of
Palestinian towns in the West Bank by August.
The PLO said Mr Arafat would visit Jericho tomorrow to swear in his
24-member national authority, or cabinet, and meet residents of the West
Bank. The trip has been delayed by 24 hours, partly to make further security
preparations.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Brussels moves to ease debt rules for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has proposed to exempt Ireland from the tough rules
of the Maastricht treaty on government debt, offering hope to other
debt-laden member states such as Belgium and Italy that they may receive
similar leniency.
The Commission's move, at a meeting last week of the EU's secretive monetary
committee, might turn out to be a test of Commission powers under the
Maastricht treaty. If it succeeds, the Commission might create a precedent,
making it easier for countries with bigger debt problems eventually to
become full members of Europe's planned economic and monetary union.
Commission representatives surprised senior finance ministry and central
bank officials representing EU governments by proposing to exempt Ireland
from the 'excessive deficit' rules of Maastricht even though Ireland's debt
as a percentage of gross domestic product is well above the treaty's
guidelines.
Although it is unlikely that Emu will be achieved by 1997 or 1999, the two
dates named in the treaty, member states are already preparing for the
advent of the single currency and European central bank.
As part of the preparatory second stage of Emu, which began in January, EU
countries have started working with the procedure laid down in the treaty to
control, and if possible reduce, their large fiscal deficits.
At present, only Luxembourg meets the two Maastricht treaty deficit criteria
of having an annual budget deficit of less than 3 per cent of gross domestic
product and an overall debt of less than 60 per cent of gross domestic
product.
But at a meeting of the monetary committee last Tuesday, Mr Giovanni
Ravasio, the Commission representative, said it planned not to submit a
report to the EU council of ministers naming Ireland as an excessive deficit
country.
Ireland has made strenuous efforts to bring its deficits under control,
pushing its annual budget deficits below 2.5 per cent of GDP in recent
years. But its stock of debt, at around 90 per cent of GDP, has proved less
easy to cut.
Germany and some other EU member countries fear that any softening of the
criteria for Ireland could open the door to Emu for other countries with
bigger economic problems. Belgium, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120
per cent and a forecast budget deficit of 5.4 per cent of GDP this year,
wants to be a founder member of Emu even though economists believe it has
little chance of reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio to the Maastricht level this
century.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Square Mile calls for economic strategy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London, the City's local authority, has commissioned
consultants to draw up the first economic development strategy for the
capital's financial district.
The aim is to identify opportunities for attracting new businesses to the
City while maintaining its position as one of the world's three leading
financial centres.
The Square Mile faces growing competition from other European cities such as
Paris and Frankfurt, as well as UK cities that have economic development
organisations working to attract new businesses.
Corporation leaders believe there is a danger that the City may become
over-dependent on financial services, where the markets are mature and scope
for further growth is restricted.
The strategy will be formulated by consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, which won the contract against competition from six other
bidders.
It is expected to be completed by the autumn, providing a candid assessment
of the City's shortcomings as a place to do business. Among potential
weaknesses to be explored are London's expensive image and worries over the
effects on business of the government's attitude to closer European
integration.
The strategy will include an action plan for improving the attractions of
the Square Mile as a location for the headquarters of international
companies and other organisations.
At the same time, the corporation will also be setting up an office to
attract business from the former Soviet bloc countries. The Central and
Eastern European Trade Centre will offer research, consultancy and
translators for companies and trade missions seeking access to the London
markets.
Both moves reflect the growing leadership role being adopted by the
corporation in bringing business to London. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of
the influential policy and resources committee, says the unsuccessful
campaign to bring the new European Central Bank to London led it to focus on
weaknesses in the City's case.
The corporation has set aside a Pounds 1m-a-year budget for economic
regeneration, partly committed to supporting projects such as the London
First Centre, a one-stop shop for inward investors.
'The City may seem like the last place on earth that needs to sell itself,'
says Mr Vince Taylor of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'But that is exactly what it
needs to do if it is to maintain its market share and raise its
international profile.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the stock market is any guide, Britain's shopkeepers have shrugged off
tax rises and are expecting consumers to carry on spending with abandon.
Since February, the stores sector has been among the market's most
resilient. That may partly reflect negative reasoning: investors have viewed
stores as a safe haven as storms have raged in other markets. Marks and
Spencer, Boots and GUS, which account for 60 per cent of sector
capitalisation, are dependable stocks with cast-iron balance sheets, high
quality earnings and marginal overseas exposure.
But the other great appeal of shops is they are seen as a good hedge against
inflation. That was undoubtedly true in the 1970s but it might not prove to
be the case today. In mature competitive industries, modest inflation is
hard to pass on to customers - as the grocery industry has already shown.
Retailers' earnings will be squeezed by other pressures, too. Many groups
have announced big investment plans, threatening to add capacity in excess
of sales volume growth. Landlords will also become less generous with rent
discounts while foreign entrants to the market are turning up the
competitive heat.
The stores sector undoubtedly has great potential for generating surplus
cash. That raises the possibility of dividend increases or special pay-outs.
But the sector would have to raise its collective yield substantially to
match the market average. It is also somewhat quirky for retailers to stand
on both earnings and dividend premiums at the same time.

FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a 7 per cent rise last week, the regional electricity companies have
regained all the ground lost relative to the equity market earlier in the
year. The reasons for this sudden change of sentiment are hard to pinpoint;
full year results and dividends at the top end of expectations, combined
with thin trading activity, are the most likely explanations. But there is
no new reason for optimism about the forthcoming regulatory review of
electricity distribution. One-off price cuts averaging perhaps 20 per cent
and annual reductions of 3 to 4 per cent below the rate of inflation still
look likely. In April this prospect was enough to send the sector into a
spin.
True, the latest set of strong results has allowed dividend cover to be
increased by rather more than expected. If the same can be achieved this
year, the electricity companies will have more freedom for manoeuvre on
dividends once the tougher regulatory regime starts to bite. The companies
also used the results season to foster optimism about their ability to
deliver cost savings. Shareholders will feel the benefit if efficiencies
beyond those demanded by the regulator can be delivered.
Even taking these factors together it is difficult to argue that the outlook
for dividend growth has been transformed. But the bulls and bears of the
sector are separated by shades of optimism about whether the electricity
companies can build enough dividend cover and cut costs fast enough to
offset the coming regulatory squeeze. The pendulum of opinion could just as
easily swing back the other way.

FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: CBS/QVC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS, the leading US broadcaster, could clearly do with a bit of sizzle. And
Mr Barry Diller, chairman of cable television shopping channel QVC, could
probably provide that. So the idea of putting the two groups together has
appeal. But the question rival media groups and their investment bankers
will have probably spent much of the weekend asking is whether there is
anything unique in Mr Diller's wizardry.
The answer is probably no. What CBS lacks is experience in marketing its
programmes and powerful brand name outside its traditional broadcasting
market. While QVC has those skills, so do other cable TV and entertainment
groups such as Walt Disney and Mr Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System.
Their philosophy, like Mr Diller's, is to make programmes and sell them in
as many different formats, packages and geographical markets as possible.
A battle for CBS on the lines of the Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount,
which Mr Diller lost, is therefore a distinct possibility. Much will depend
on legal and regulatory issues. Would CBS be required to consider a rival
bidder since the deal has been structured as a merger not a takeover? How
easy would it be for rival bidders to get regulatory clearance given the
complex restrictions on cross-media ownership? CBS is such a prize that it
seems hard to believe such barriers will prove insuperable. Moreover, if
rival bidders are prepared to pay handsomely, Mr Laurence Tisch, the
71-year-old CBS chairman, who also owns 20 per cent of its stock, may not
even want to deter them.

FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Mutual disadvantage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposed changes to the Building Societies Act due to be
unveiled this week seem set to give societies more flexibility to raise
wholesale funds in the money market. It is less likely - especially while
the Lloyds bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester remains subject to possible
appeal - to propose much by way of reform of the industry's traditional
mutual structure. That is a pity because deregulation of funding will only
accentuate the anomaly of present arrangements.
Supporters of mutuality argue that it offers choice and works effectively.
Yet it also creates many problems. Why should a small depositor gain
immediate title to a share in reserves built up over many years? Since such
title exists, why should members have difficulty realising its value? The
mutual structure makes even friendly takeovers by outsiders exceedingly
difficult, so there is no market for corporate control and limited
accountability for management.
Above all, the mutual structure should not be impregnable. The real problem
is finding a way of achieving this without risking destabilising flows of
savings. One solution might be to weight voting rights according to duration
of membership. That would reflect the appropriate share of individual
building society members in accumulated reserves. Predators would have to
pay most to members with the longest-term interest in the society. If they
have stayed around out of satisfaction with their society's service, they
might also be those least inclined to take the money and run.

Something peculiar is happening to South Africa's currency, the rand,
mid-air over the Atlantic Ocean. It suddenly devalues from the rate offered
by banks - R5.6 to Pounds 1 - to R12 to Pounds 1. Or at least, it does if
you fly with British Airways.
BA cabin staff on the London-Johannesburg flight have been told that, with
effect from July 1, the airline's duty free prices are calculated at R12 to
Pounds 1. Thus a passenger on Saturday's flight to London found his R130
were worth only Pounds 10.86. A sympathetic purser encouraged him to
complain: 'We don't understand either'.
Well, someone has to foot BA's recent legal bills.

With the dollar plunging daily against the seemingly impregnable yen, a

It is called, rather unenticingly: 'Dollars 10 beef bowl with cup soup'.
More temptingly, it's also 'calculated on today's rate of exchange'.
Last week the dish cost Y958, before tax and service. The week before the

Sure, Y62 gets you little more than a used matchstick in today's Japan; but

You'd think Greece would have had enough of presidencies after recent events
at Corfu. Not a bit of it. Now it's taken the helm of Black Sea Economic
Co-operation.
Set up by Turkey in 1992, B-SEC (as it's pronounced) has the tricky job of
welding together 11 member states, some of which have severe bilateral
disputes, not least war.
Never mind. The members - including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey -
are now establishing a Black Sea trade and development bank. Wasn't the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development set up for a similar
purpose? Apparently even the EBRD's intended clients have overlooked its
existence.
Previous B-SEC president was Alexandre Chikvaidze, Georgia's foreign
minister and a tough act to follow, at least in the joke department.
Chikvaidze says he merits space in the Guinness Book of Records - as the
only Georgian minister in living memory who relinquished a political post
while sober and healthy.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dispute between Railtrack and the RMT rail union has been characterised
by bafflingly complex arguments over pay and, at times, almost farcical
misunderstandings between the two sides. But this is not an amusing trip
down industrial memory lane. It is a deeply damaging conflict for rail
privatisation and for the standing of Railtrack and must be resolved before
it escalates.
Managerial foot-dragging and the unfortunate timing of last year's 1.5 per
cent public sector pay limit caused legitimate grievances over signalling
staff pay to fester for too long. That does not excuse RMT's hasty use of
the strike weapon, especially when Railtrack had made clear its basic
sympathy with the signal staff case. The relative ease with which the strike
has been bypassed by commuters and freight users ought to be a reminder that
 -regardless of the ownership regime - railway staff are in a fight for
their jobs against other modes of transport. If the RMT executive were to
decide at its meeting today to escalate the dispute (though there are some
welcome indications that the union's negotiators may resist any serious
escalation of the conflict), the company and the government would have no
choice but to challenge the union's monopoly power on the railways and try
to keep the trains running without its members.
It should never have come to this. The rather technical differences between
the two sides on modernising the pay structure could easily have been
fudged, without conceding any important principle. The fact that the
differences have instead been exacerbated suggests either that Railtrack has
been looking for a fight or that a culture clash between old British Rail
hands and outsiders has led to crossed wires inside the organisation.
The government does not seem to have helped. Hitherto its public sector pay
bill freeze has been interpreted with appropriate flexibility and seems to
be meeting remarkably little resistance. The 3 per cent increases
recommended by some of the Pay Review Bodies were not baulked at by the
government and it has even made clear that savings on running costs can be
used to boost pay bills. Railtrack should have been left to negotiate alone.
That, after all, is part of the point of privatisation.
The pay increases announced on Friday by Railtrack form the basis of a fair
settlement. The fact that the offer as it now stands will leave one-quarter
of signal staff considerably worse off should not be an obstacle. It is part
of the price of a fairer pay system. But Railtrack needs to spell out in
more detail how it will compensate the relief signal staff affected.
Alternatively, given the very high turnover of relief staff it could
announce that the new terms apply only to new recruits and those on existing
rates can keep them until they give up the job.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Swedish bond boycott
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp rise in European bond yields this year partly reflects investors'
nervousness about deteriorating public finances around the industrialised
world. In few countries does such concern look more justified than Sweden.
The three-year-old centre-right coalition of Mr Carl Bildt has presided over
an explosive build-up of public debt. According to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, gross general government debt will
rise to 93 per cent of gross domestic product this year against only 44 per
cent in 1990.
The public deficit, which reached 13 per cent of GDP last year, is now
falling slowly as the economy starts to grow after three years of
contraction. The most worrying feature is the rise in the structural
deficit. According to the OECD, this is only about three percentage points
below the actual deficit, partly reflecting large government outlays on the
crisis-hit banking industry. The Bildt government has been woefully
unsuccessful in reducing government spending, estimated this year at 67 per
cent of GDP, against 59 per cent in 1990. Whichever government emerges from
the September general election will need to make expenditure cuts a
priority.
Against this sobering background, Friday's statement by Mr Bjorn Wolrath,
chief executive of the Skandia insurance group, that it is stopping
purchases of government bonds looks understandable, yet curious:
understandable, because Mr Wolrath appears to be alarmed by the prospect
that the opposition Social Democrats, if victorious in September, could
prove even less adept than Mr Bildt in curbing the deficit; curious, because
Mr Wolrath must have known his comments would trigger a sharp fall in
Swedish bond prices and the krona. The Skandia group, which holds an
estimated 4 per cent of Swedish state debt, has thus suffered a large
capital loss on its domestic bond portfolio.
Mr Bildt reacted by pointing to the continuing need for deficit cuts and
implied that the Social Democrats were not up to the task. This may seem an
inadequate response, but the Bildt government has already unveiled plans to
prune spending by the equivalent of 10 per cent of GDP over the next five
years.
The debt imbroglio highlights a Swedish paradox. Sweden's plans to join the
European Union are predicated on its becoming a 'core' country capable of
taking part in economic and monetary union. However, Mr Bildt's measures to
improve the functioning of the economy have left the country far away from
the Maastricht convergence targets. Over the longer term, Mr Wolrath's
broadside should strengthen politicians' will to implement budget cuts. In
the short term, however, the Skandia statement will make Swedish bonds
difficult to sell, unless real interest rates rise further and the krona
falls. Yet these would merely be palliatives. Sweden's integration into
Europe demands urgent pruning of public spending and the fiscal deficit.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Someone to sail the trade winds: The new World Trade
Organisation leader will shape its role on the international stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: dynamic leader for new international institution. The ideal
candidate will possess global strategic vision, yet be at home with
technical complexity, while combining a diplomat's finesse with proven
administrative skills and the instincts and forceful leadership of a
seasoned politician.
This superman - or superwoman - is being sought to head the World Trade
Organisation, due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
early next year. The new body will have a more formal structure, stronger
disciplinary powers and, potentially, a far more wide-ranging role than its
47-year-old predecessor.
Governments and trade policy experts worldwide have expressed optimism that
the WTO will develop into a pre-eminent forum for international
policymaking, which will take the lead in creating a framework for the
orderly management of global economic change into the next century.
It is widely agreed that the WTO's influence will depend critically on the
choice of its first director-general. 'Whoever does this job, and does it
well, will leave a mark on history,' says Professor John Jackson of Michigan
University, a leading authority on international trade law.
That prospect has triggered a race in which the declared candidates so far
are President Carlos Salinas of Mexico; Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian
former trade minister who has also been canvassed as a possible president of
the European Commission; Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister and
Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. More names may emerge before
the lists close at the end of this month.
Much as trade policy purists may wish the appointment to be decided solely
on merit, political manoeuvring is set to play a big role. The final choice,
expected to be reached by informal consensus in late autumn, will be heavily
influenced by the interplay of national pride, regional rivalries, economic
self-interest and mutual suspicion among Gatt's members.
Already, the competing Mexican and Brazilian claims on the post have divided
loyalties in Latin America. An even more bruising confrontation  - or a
stalemate - may develop if the US bats strongly for Mr Salinas, and the
European Union digs in behind Mr Ruggiero.
The decision also risks becoming entangled in wider horse-trading over other
heavyweight international appointments this year. Besides the presidency of
the European Commission they include the top jobs at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation and the Western European Union.
All this points to a much more complicated choice than last year's
appointment of Mr Peter Sutherland as Gatt's director-general, a post he
will vacate soon for personal reasons. Mr Sutherland's candidacy swiftly
gathered support because he was widely perceived as the right man to tackle
the biggest challenge then facing the world trade system - completion of the
protracted Uruguay Round negotiations.
The WTO head will be handed a far less clear-cut mandate. Views on the
body's role and the job's functions vary widely, reflecting the differing
political interests and economic priorities of those who will have a say in
filling it.
The WTO was inspired by plans in the 1940s for an International Trade
Organisation, intended as a stablemate for the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank. When the US Congress vetoed the idea, the Gatt was set up on
a 'provisional' basis.
But the ITO was conceived in a world far different from that in which the
WTO will be born. While the original design was drawn up for about 50
countries, most with war-shattered economies, the new body will start with
more than 120 members, ranging from super-rich to dirt poor.
Gatt has coped with this diversity by allowing countries to opt out of some
of its commitments. But every WTO member will be required to sign up to
almost all its obligations. Furthermore, in contrast to the IMF and World
Bank, where voting power is weighted in favour of wealthy countries, each
WTO member will have an equal vote.
Gatt has an impressive record of forging consensus, which has satisfied big
countries without trampling on small ones. But some observers believe that
will be harder in future. 'Creating consensus in the WTO will be enormously
difficult,' says Mr William Brock, a trade policy consultant who served as
President Ronald Reagan's top trade negotiator.
The organisation's cohesion will be tested by a growing array of challenges,
which reflect the changing focus of trade policy and shifts in the structure
of the world economy. They include:
The thrust of liberalisation efforts into largely uncharted territory, such
as the treatment of foreign direct investment and services.
Pressure to address links between trade and complex - and often highly
emotive - questions such as minimum labour standards and environment policy.
The impact of sudden capital market and currency fluctuations from which,
some experts fear, countries could seek to insulate themselves through trade
barriers.
The accession of about 20 further countries, led by China.
Mounting stresses within countries, particularly in the industrialised
world, as they face increasingly fierce global competition.
'All the instincts of the main industrialised countries are to seek security
and slow the pace of change,' says Mr Brock. 'Only the really aggressive
emerging economies will have a free hand in pressing ahead. Everyone else is
constrained by problems at home.'
The head of the WTO can potentially wield much influence over how these
problems are tackled, and over the future global policy agenda. However, the
job enjoys limited formal powers and resources. The Gatt secretariat, which
the WTO will inherit, has a SFr94m (Pounds 45m) budget this year and only
175 professional staff. A proposal to add 50 is under discussion.
By common consent, the WTO head will need to rely heavily - as Mr Sutherland
has done with great success - on his personal qualities and skills to make
an impact. But there is less agreement on what these should be.
Some experts think a master of policy detail is required, who will establish
the organisation's authority by perfecting its mechanics - notably its new
dispute settlement procedures - and broking behind-the-scenes deals in
Geneva. Others, however, want someone with a high public profile, who will
focus on broader strategic issues and deal directly with government leaders.
Mr Ruggiero and Mr Salinas personify some of these differences in approach.
The former has emphasised his credentials as a capable administrator with
wide international experience, gained in Brussels, the Gatt and at world
economic summits. But sceptics ask whether he has enough vision and stature
for the job.
Mr Salinas's biggest attraction is his boldness in presiding over sweeping
liberalisation, which has made Mexico a model of developing country reform.
However, some wonder whether, as a head of state, his style is too grand and
authoritarian for the WTO.
Regional ties are also an issue. They are aggravated by mutual suspicions
between the industrialised powers which have long dominated Gatt's affairs,
and the developing countries which make up most of its membership and
account for an increasing share of world trade and economic growth.
Mr Ruggiero must convince doubters that Brussels' backing will not make him
a champion of narrow EU interests. Mr Salinas's origins may have wider
appeal - but only if he can show clearly that he is not beholden to
patronage from Washington.
Whether any candidate can meet all, or most, of the requirements on the
wish-lists circulating in Geneva and world capitals looks doubtful. But with
more names likely to enter the race, the pace of international wheeling and
dealing is set to quicken. The final choice may call for all the negotiating
skills and talent for last-minute compromise which the Gatt can muster.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Personal View: An agenda for full employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MONKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I was elected general secretary of the Trades Union Congress 10 months
ago I was able to set as one of the organisation's principal objectives
helping to raise full employment in the UK to the top of the political
agenda.
Tomorrow we take a step towards that objective when the TUC and the
Employment Policy Institute, the independent think tank, host a conference
that brings together the employment spokesmen of the three main political
parties with the director general of the Confederation of British Industry
and other key figures, including representatives of the unemployed
themselves.
None of us underestimates the scale of the task. And I am sure all will
acknowledge that full employment is unlikely to be achieved in one country
alone, not least one as dependent on international trade as the UK.
But there are some things which can be done to set us in the right
direction. For a start I believe there is some more room for discretionary
management of demand. The economy needs to grow above the 2.5 per cent trend
to get unemployment down. We cannot create 3m jobs by demand management
alone and there are obvious constraints on national action, but I do believe
that this recently neglected weapon of economic management can play a
substantial role. The conditions are now favourable with low inflation,
excess capacity and European recovery picking up.
However, at the heart of any policy for full employment has to lie a strong
international trading sector. Without successful competitive companies we
shall not be able to raise living standards and deliver quality public
services.
In Britain, we do have some highly competitive companies. Almost invariably
they pay well, train well and have good industrial relations based on an
established relationship with trade unions. Some, like Rover, have turned
themselves round in recent years with the help of the workforce. The first
task then is to learn from these companies, to spread best practice in terms
of training, industrial relations and the high standards of health and
safety which also characterise the best companies.
But we cannot rely on the competitive sector alone. If we do, there is a
serious danger of reinforcing the growing social divisions with a well
rewarded group of insiders, a growing number of working poor and a large
pool of unemployed.
It has been argued that one means of filling the jobs gap is for the working
poor and jobless to lower their expectations and with them their wage rates.
Pricing people into jobs has been tried over the past 15 years and the
results are today's unacceptable divisions. In the interests of social
stability we cannot afford to widen the gap between the insiders and the
rest.
The obstacle to full employment is not just the number out of work but the
number of people out of work for a long period of time. As unemployment has
fallen in recent months the number out of work for a year or more has not
come down with it.
Practical measures to help such people back into work must be an essential
element in a programme for full employment. The government's workstart
scheme picks up a useful idea first put forward by Professor Dennis Snower
to transfer the benefits of the unemployed to an employer who was prepared
to take that person off the dole queue. This scheme deserves to be given a
better chance than the pilots so far under way. Trade unions will support
such schemes provided they are voluntary and can be shown to raise
employment levels rather than subsidise jobs that would have been created
anyway. Trade unions can and are playing a part in the process; in Barnsley,
for instance, the trades union council is working with the local training
and enterprise council in delivering help for the jobless.
Finally, we need to generate a greater sense of social solidarity where
those who can afford it accept that it is their duty, and to their
advantage, to meet the costs of bringing back into society those who
currently feel excluded because they do not have work and cannotsee an
opportunity to get any meaningful work.
Solidarity is a traditional trade union virtue. But the case for solidarity
is not just a moral one; it is also an economic one. Left to themselves
small and medium-sized firms will not train; they will only poach, and that
worsens the inflation/unemployment trade off. We need a training levy to
share the finances fairly.
We need co-operative arrangements not just to raise the skill of the
nation's workforce but also to ensure that the benefits of productivity
growth in the competitive sector are shared among the unemployed and the
increasing numbers of low-paid people in precarious jobs.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Arafat in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another important, if still largely symbolic, stage has been passed in the
Middle East peace process. Mr Yassir Arafat, having signed an outline peace
agreement with Israel and won recognition for the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, has now returned to territory freed from occupation. With the
toughest part of the negotiations yet to come, it is vital for Mr Arafat and
the Palestinians to build quickly on what has been achieved. This means
buckling down to the detailed work of creating a viable administration.
Miracles are not expected. The heavily populated Gaza strip and Jericho
suffer serious economic deprivation and guerrilla organisations do not breed
efficient bureaucrats overnight. Mr Arafat also faces political opposition
from Islamic and radical forces, thousands of Palestinians are still in
Israeli jails, while more than 30 per cent of the Gaza strip remains in
Israeli hands, along with virtually all the West Bank.
But the achievements can already be appreciated. The level of violence in
Gaza has dropped sharply and the Palestinian police force appears to have
made a good start. More than Dollars 2.4bn is available over the next five
years to rehabilitate and improve the infrastructure. Some of these funds
have also been necessarily committed to budget support and assisting the
Palestinians establish a bureaucracy. There is too much at stake for donor
governments to insist on unreasonably high standards of trans-parency and
accountability.
In return, they have every right to expect Mr Arafat to behave in the
democratic manner to which he is committed. Elections for an interim
Palestinian self-rule authority are due to be held just as soon as Israel
has completed its withdrawal and troop redeployment in the West Bank. Mr
Arafat should not be allowed to duck that requirement.
Israel also bears a heavy responsibility for the success of the present
experiment. Pulling out of the West Bank carries a much weightier domestic
political price than departing from Gaza, but speed and a greater
flexibility in Israel's negotiating stance are essential if even the modest
momentum so far achieved is to be sustained.
The Israeli government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin should be additionally buoyed by
Jordan's agreement to resume direct bilateral negotiations later this month.
The issues which divide the two governments are by no means minimal, but
should be capable of resolution within relatively few months. The return of
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, to the region shortly also
suggests there is some chance of a breakthrough in Israel's negotiations
with Syria.
Symbolism may not be a substitute for substance, but the message behind the
television pictures of Mr Arafat, back on his home territory and being
cheered by thousands of Palestinians, will not have been lost on President
Hafez al-Assad or King Hussein.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest and enjoyment the article, 'Celebrating rites of
passage' (June 25), by Jurek Martin on the recent graduation ceremonies at
Harvard.
I also had a daughter graduating from Harvard. My eyes are certainly older
than those of Mr Martin, but it was surely not dollar bills being waved by
graduates of Harvard Business School, including my daughter, but small flags
representing the many nationalities of the school's students.
They were waving them cheerily but not, I think, greedily, although one of
the school newspapers circulated at the ceremonies reported that many of the
graduates expect salaries (including bonuses) of Dollars 100,000 in their
first year after graduation.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Productivity the key measure for R&amp;D
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BARRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following the Department of Trade and Industry's recent ranking of
countries by R&amp;D expenditure (Technology: 'R&amp;D Scoreboard', June 17), cries
for increased R&amp;D expenditure by the UK have reached a crescendo. So two
cheers for your editorial of June 20, 'Costly Research'. You did leave it to
the final sentence, but at least you pointed out that what is really
important is R&amp;D output, not R&amp;D input spending. Too few commentators stress
the importance of R&amp;D productivity.
The results of oil industry R&amp;D clearly illustrate the huge differences in
productivity achieved by competing research teams.
Although an aberration in the OECD Frascati guidelines means that most oil
company R&amp;D is not actually counted as R&amp;D, it is possible to correct for
this and to look at the true picture.
Like their colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry, oil company scientists
and engineers spend about 10 per cent of sales on research for new products
 -in this case, new oil and gas fields. A Salomon Brothers report, 'Proved
Petroleum Reserves of 30 Large Energy Companies', allows a calculation that,
in the eight-year period 1983-90, research teams in the best performing
quartile achieved an average productivity of 0.45 barrels found per dollar
spent. The poorest performing quartile achieved only 0.10 barrels.
There is no reason to think such spreads are special to oil researchers.
Therefore, if UK research productivity is in the top quartile, calls to cut
dividends and spend more on R&amp;D may indeed make good sense. But if our R&amp;D
productivity is low, then it is likely to be far more cost-effective to
maintain (or even reduce) our spending level while concentrating on
improving the quality of R&amp;D management. It is R&amp;D productivity information,
therefore, that the DTI should collect, control for quality and then
publish.
On the other hand, if top managements do not know the relative standing of
their own R&amp;D productivity performance then I'm afraid we should fear the
worst.

FT  04 JUL 94 / The impossibility of being president: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the economic summit in Naples the world's press, once again, is likely to
be impressed by President Bill Clinton's youth, energy, intelligence, warmth
and persuasive rhetoric. Set against his elderly and cautious Group of Seven
peers, he cuts a rather impressive figure. Being an American he at least
possesses a modicum of optimism: unlike his world-weary colleagues he
believes that severe social problems - such as high global unemployment -
are soluble.
Yet in spite of these virtues and some solid legislative achievements, Mr
Clinton's approval ratings at home are depressingly low. The boost that he
hoped to get from robust economic growth has been largely offset by
continuing doubts about his character - doubts fuelled by the Whitewater
affair and Paula Jones's sexual harassment charges. At the same time he is
condemned as indecisive in foreign affairs and criticised for running an
ill-disciplined White House - a charge that prompted another reshuffling of
top aides last week and the appointment of Mr Leon Panetta, the affable
former budget director, as the new chief of staff.
While not denying that Mr Clinton has made many mistakes, I believe much of
the criticism of his presidency is misplaced. The US media are like a pack
of wolves: happy only when dismembering their prey. They would find grievous
faults in any occupant of the Oval Office because the job of an American
president is now beyond the ability of any mortal. This is largely the
consequence of an 18th century constitution designed by Virginia landowners
whose main objective was to limit the powers of a central government.
The goal of minimal government was admirable; but the ensuing legislative
arrangements create enormous tensions in an era when the American people
(and the wider world) expect an administration to solve countless problems.
In the US system, cabinet officers, as unelected appointees, have much less
authority than in parliamentary regimes. All important decisions on foreign
and domestic policy are thus funnelled into the White House for the
attention of the chief executive. Mr Clinton is engaged in formulating
policy in spheres such as macroeconomics, healthcare, crime and welfare at a
level of detail that in Britain would be left to the relevant secretaries of
state - if not senior civil servants.
Former President George Bush tried to solve the 'overload' problem by
ignoring domestic policy. But this led ultimately to electoral defeat. Mr
Clinton has set himself important goals in the domestic arena. He cannot
afford to delegate domestic policy because nobody but the president has the
clout to influence the other main power brokers in the US system, the men
who run the key congressional committees - such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
the unpredictable chairman of the Senate finance committee.
Such barons have limited respect for presidents, even from their own
parties, because they do not select them: Congress has to work with a
president independently chosen by the American people. But for Mr Clinton's
personal involvement, for example, Congress would never have voted in favour
of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The task could not have been
entrusted to cabinet officials such as the trade representative and treasury
secretary. Healthcare reform may be stymied despite Mr Clinton's passionate
involvement; without a presidential push, defeat would be virtually certain.
Mr Clinton thus has no choice but to try to keep on top of every aspect of
policy, from Bosnia to handguns; inevitably he drops some balls.
Other facets of the Washington system conspire to undermine him. One key to
understanding Mr Clinton is to remember that, unlike his recent
predecessors, he is comfortable with ideas. He is the product of a superior
liberal education - of a tradition that abhors dogmatism and stresses the
virtue of critical analysis from various points of view. The result is a
'seminar' presidency: a chief executive who mulls the arguments for and
against policies and makes decisions slowly. Having an open, inquiring mind
is not normally a sin; yet as president, Mr Clinton pays a heavy penalty.
Since nothing is secret in the American political system, every step in his
tortuous decision-making process is relayed to a confused public at home and
abroad. Policy-in-formation is endlessly 'analysed' in superficial news
reports. Yet the 'soundbite' style of presentation militates against true
understanding.
A thoughtful president who quite often gets it right - think for example of
his two Supreme Court nominations - ends up looking indecisive and muddled.
The system would treat a dictatorial leader with a closed mind far more
kindly. Yet this is hardly what the US wants. Would Americans, in fact, even
favour a retreat to the Bush era: to a president who rarely uttered a
coherent sentence and was ignorant of the detail of domestic policy?
I am not trying to imply that all of Mr Clinton's problems reflect the
inherent difficulties of being president. In many areas of policy, his
mistakes reflect an intellectual map that is seriously outdated: like many
products of elite US colleges Mr Clinton has an exaggerated faith in the
competence of government and a poor understanding of the efficiency of free
markets. This explains last year's unhelpful 'soak the rich' budget and his
continuing appetite for managed trade and other interventions. But since Mr
Clinton is one of the brightest US presidents in memory it is safe to
predict that many of his difficulties reflect the job. His successors are
not going to be popular either.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Soft bark and a weak bite: Bronwen Maddox asks whether the
UN's nuclear watchdog has the teeth to do its job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a second Korean war has receded with the agreement by North
Korea to talk to its southern neighbour for the first time since the second
world war. The talks, later this month, will indicate whether the secretive
northern regime of Kim Il-Sung can be discouraged from building nuclear
weapons.
But whatever the outcome of the discussion, tensions on the Korean peninsula
have raised pressing questions about the International Atomic Energy Agency,
the United Nations' nuclear watchdog. It was the refusal of North Korea to
allow the agency to inspect its nuclear sites which triggered the current
crisis.
The Nuclear Control Institute, a respected Washington-based lobby group,
attacked the agency last week for failing in its job of 'blowing the
whistle' on the spread of nuclear weapons. Officials at the US Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, responsible for US strategy on North Korea,
agree privately that the agency 'has not been as aggressive as it could have
been'.
The IAEA, a mouthful of vowels pronounced easily by nobody in a UN country,
was born in 1957 as part of US President Dwight Eisenhower's 'atoms for
peace' plan. In line with prevailing optimism about the potential of civil
nuclear power, it was given the job of helping UN countries acquire nuclear
skills, particularly safety techniques and medical treatments.
It was also given a second, separate role: 'safeguarding' or supervising
civil nuclear reactors to ensure that their contents were not diverted to
bombs. Although the cold war had dented hopes that the superpowers would
scale down their nuclear arsenals, it still seemed probable that nuclear
weapons' capability could be restricted to a tiny handful of countries.
The signing of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by 164 countries
has put much weight on that second role: signatories without nuclear weapons
were obliged to submit to regular IAEA scrutiny of their civil nuclear
programmes. Although inspections now take up only a third of the agency's
annual Dollars 200m budget, the agency's role as watchdog wins it a
disproportionate share of headlines. The treaty's renegotiation next year
will put its record under the spotlight.
Criticism of that record begins with a single word: Iraq. In the decade
before the 1990 Gulf War, the agency failed to detect Saddam Hussein's
Dollars 3bn clandestine weapons programme, saying that Iraq complied fully
with the treaty. The episode is by common agreement the agency's most
embarrassing hour. Mr David Kyd, spokesman at the agency's Vienna
headquarters, acknowledges that 'Iraq was a shock for us'.
After the war, it became clear that Iraq had imported sensitive western
technology for a decade, and employed 10,000 engineers in attempting to make
nuclear explosives in a dozen desert factories. Those included the site of
Iraq's two small reactors, which was regularly visited by the IAEA.
To the agency's critics, the crisis over North Korea's nuclear intentions
and capability suggests that the lessons of Iraq have not been assimilated.
In particular, they feel the agency was slow to raise the alarm. 'The place
runs like the post office,' says Mr Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear
Control Institute.
Mr David Kay, the former IAEA inspector in charge of the agency's post-war
inquiry into Iraq, who now advises the US nuclear industry, also sees the
agency's endeavours in North Korea as technically inept. Its video cameras
'are essentially consumer technology', he says. He believes tension in the
North Korean capital Pyongyang was heightened unnecessarily because agency
inspectors entered and exited nuclear sites repeatedly to replenish
batteries and tape, although 'there are cameras available which they could
have used to beam straight back to Vienna'.
In response to these attacks, the IAEA says that people frequently
overestimate the scope of its action. 'There is a public perception that we
were super-cops (in Iraq), but we were super-accountants,' according to Mr
Kyd. The agency carried out its task of monitoring the fuel inside Iraq's
reactors, he argues, but it had not looked for a weapons programme separate
from these civil reactors, because this is an expensive route to acquiring a
bomb.
The agency adds, however, that it has accepted the need for some change. 'We
are being encouraged by our members to be nosier,' Mr Kyd says. Members now
pass information on from their intelligence services; photographs last year
from the US Central Intelligence Agency helped alert the agency to the North
Korean threat.
But the agency's ability to become more intrusive is limited by its statute,
Vienna officials argue. They say the frequency of inspections is set
strictly in proportion to the size of a country's civil nuclear programme.
This condition was set in the 1950s when the threat of Germany, Japan,
Sweden and Switzerland acquiring nuclear weapons seemed great and, as a
result, IAEA inspectors still spend two-thirds of their time on western
Europe, Canada and Japan. 'But if we tilted that principle, developing
countries would scream 'discrimination' and leave,' Mr Kyd says.
That fear - that countries will resign from the IAEA and the NPT - is the
greatest restraint on the agency's aggression, according to its officials.
They see the agency's twin roles inextricably linked in a fragile bargain.
'It is industrialised countries who want safeguards inspection, but
developing countries mainly want technological assistance, and would not
want to be members of something directed entirely at curbing their research
programmes,' Mr Kyd says.
To those watching the watchdog, this dilemma lies at the heart of its
shortcomings. 'If some countries can't live with intrusive inspections, and
threaten to leave the IAEA, the world should know,' says Mr Kay.
To critics, the agency's attitude to Iran over the next few years will show
whether it is overcoming its weaknesses. Western intelligence experts are
keeping a close eye on Iran's procurement of technology in its current bid
to boost its military strength.
Some of the agency's problems, however, arise from political and
technological changes that have arisen since it was created. The countries
now embracing civil nuclear power with most enthusiasm are in the developing
world and in Asia, which lie outside the agency's traditional areas of
expertise.
Fresh techniques have emerged for refining uranium and plutonium to the
grade where they can be used for bombs. The disintegration of the Soviet
Union has increased the possibility for clandestine trade in assembled
nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, reprocessing plants such as the UK's Thorp and
France's Cogema will begin to inject large quantities of plutonium into the
world's stockpile as a by-product of treating left-over fuel.
To monitor these new threats - trade in nuclear technology, and the
production of civil plutonium - the IAEA's statute would have to be
extended. Whether that is desirable, or possible, is a question which next
year's debate on the NPT's future will have to tackle.
But if governments choose to maintain a pact to curb proliferation, they
will need some kind of watchdog. Given the IAEA's performance in the two
crises of the past three years, it is fair to conclude that the watchdog
will need to be more alert than in the past, and probably larger, if it is
to succeed in raising the alarm.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital not the priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D N VERMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While agreeing with much of what Richard Lapper says in his article on
reinsurance ('Third force emerges in high-risk world', June 30), I must
question his assertion of the pre-eminence of capital among criteria for the
well-appointed reinsurer.
Without denying in any way the value and importance of an adequate capital
base, proven underwriting and sound management, as exemplified in consistent
results and an ability to survive, give better indications of health.
The fragmentation of risk, which is both the method and purpose of
reinsurance, allows the small, the medium and the large to co-exist.
The slaughter of the innocents and the not so innocent owes more to the
apparent inadequacies of management than of capital.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russian opposition to Latvian stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BORIS PANKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Held up on the Western line' (June 23) rightly said that
the law on citizenship passed by the Latvian parliament on June 21 does not
accord with internationally accepted norms since it imposed draconian quotas
on non-Latvian permanent residents.
Moreover, according to the assessments by western legislators, this
discriminatory law contradicts the Universal Declaration on Human Rights,
the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
Reduction of Statelessness.
By trying to legitimise the deprivation of civil, political, socio-economic
and cultural rights of hundreds of thousands of people, Latvian
parliamentarians openly ignored the authoritative views of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe experts who
strongly recommended that the law be amended so as to expedite the smooth
integration of a large Russian-speaking minority in Latvian society.
Even the government of Latvia itself appealed to President Ulmanis not to
approve this citizenship law.
No wonder the Latvian president ordered parliament to reconsider a
controversial piece of legislation and said in a TV interview that the law
undermined Latvian prestige in democratic Europe, deprived permanent
residents of citizenship and complicated relations with Latvia's neighbours.
Or maybe it was just probing by the parliament to test the vigilance of the
international community? And later, the same law, with decorative
amendments, will be passed again? Let us hope that this time the Latvian
legislators will take into account the concerns expressed from all quarters.
I think that world public opinion would welcome a decision to delete
notorious quotas and change the discriminatory essence of the law.
This is all the more lamentable since Russia is prepared to develop good,
neighbourly relations with Latvia. On June 19 the Russian government decided
to submit a package of agreements, signed recently with Latvia including
that on a troop withdrawal by August 31 this year, to President Yeltsin for
approval and subsequent ratification by parliament.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts: More beast than beauty - Opera/Film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme of transformation is central to Cocteau's magical film La Belle et
la bete. Not only does the Beast turn into a Prince, his castle is also
alive with statues that become human, invisible hands that open doors and
jewels that turn into worthless trinkets.
Now the composer Philip Glass has endeavoured to make his own transformation
of the film. Last week's 'Meltdown' festival on the South Bank brought film
and music together as part of its theme of new work in the arts crossing
boundaries. Glass's re-working of La Belle et la bete is almost impossible
to classify. He calls it a 'live opera/film event', the programme an 'opera
for ensemble and film'.
What it involves is as follows. The Cocteau film (its original un-edited
version) is shown on a big screen, but without its soundtrack. A quartet of
singers sing the words that would have been spoken by the actors and a small
ensemble combining keyboards and saxophones provides the live accompaniment.
This showing was billed as part of the 'world premiere tour', but the
conductor, Michael Riesman, seemed practised at keeping the music in sync
with the film.
As in Nyman's film scores (so fashionable of late) the constant motor
rhythms of the minimalist school can become wearing over a film's unbroken
hour-and-a-half duration. Glass varies the pace more, but still not enough.
In the intimate encounters between Beauty and the Beast one longed for the
repeated chords to relax their pulse just for a few minutes.
Otherwise Glass has put together an atmospheric score, which captures the
grand guignol fantasy of the film. Whirling upward scales set the mood,
underpinned by ominous rumbling bass lines; bells peal along the chateau's
dark corridors, their ring electronically twisted into the shriek of ravens.
Unfortunately the amplification of the music drowned the singers' words.
Like most multimedia events, La Belle et la bete falls between two stools.
As a straight opera, there is probably not enough interest in its vocal
writing. Whether there is any future in opera/film as a medium beyond this
one-off exercise is another question again.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts: Firebrand or fashion victim? - Can Peter Jonas,
controversial ex-director of the ENO, win over conservative Munich audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is probably the most important week of Peter Jonas's career. The former
general director of English National Opera arrived in Munich last September
with a mandate to modernise a notoriously conservative institution, the
Bavarian State Opera. The Munich opera festival, opening on Wednesday, is
his first major test. It will show how far he has won over the Munich public
to his controversial views on music-theatre.
Jonas's appointment as the State Opera's first non-German intendant aroused
high expectations. In London, he had played a key role developing ENO's
reputation for bold theatrical ideas and enterprising repertoire. He talked
about 'making opera open to everybody', 'extending the frontiers of taste'
and 'going along the paths of adventure that are important to us'. That was
what attracted Munich's city fathers.
What they apparently overlooked was the price ENO paid for Jonas's
radicalism. The fashionable production values and brash marketing campaigns
of the late 1980s alienated many of ENO's core supporters, without winning
the imaginary new audience to replace them. Jonas and his colleagues seemed
to prize a first-night scandal above a solid artistic success. There was an
air of conceit.
By the time Jonas left London last summer, ENO audiences had fallen to 56
per cent, the deficit had risen to Pounds 2.3m, and the company had a
sharply diminished stock of revivable productions. Not all of this could be
blamed on the recession.
On his arrival in Munich, Jonas made clear he would pursue 'interpretative
rather than representational theatre' - productions designed to provoke
rather than comfort. He would aim to reach a wider audience than the State
Opera's traditional public. He would build on four pillars - Mozart, Wagner,
Verdi and newly-commissioned works.
As in London, the radical nature of Jonas's agenda was camouflaged by his
legendary charm and eloquence. He talked about policy in a way Germans could
understand. Unlike his predecessor, Wolfgang Sawallisch, he was
image-conscious and knew how to court the press.
The first evidence of a new direction came in March with Richard Jones's
Jurassic Park treatment of Handel's Giulio Cesare. The premiere was
accompanied by the kind of booing and cheering that had been de rigueur at
ENO. German critics found the production cheekily entertaining, and it
developed a cult-following among Munich's younger, more progressive
theatre-goers.
Jonas is hoping Wednesday's new production of Tannhauser will cause an even
bigger splash. Wagner is a house god, and Jonas has chosen one of his most
provocative ENO collaborators, David Alden, to stage it. Next season brings
a transfer of David Pountney's ENO version of The Adventures of Mr Broucek,
a Nicholas Hytner staging of Don Giovanni, and Parsifal directed by Peter
Konwitschny, a graduate of the didactic Ruth Berghaus school of east German
opera production.
The question now being asked in Munich is whether this programme amounts to
'aesthetic renewal' as Jonas claims - or merely a grafting of the
'powerhouse' aesthetic from ENO.
Jonas, who controls a budget of DM124m (Pounds 50m), has never hidden his
contempt for the wealthy Munich burghers who bankroll his organisation. 'I
have never in the whole world seen so much fake jewellery and dyed hair,' he
said earlier this season. 'Many women look like gilded Christmas trees'. He
talks of 'the possessiveness these people feel about their opera - they
regard themselves as owners of the works being performed and shareholders of
the company. But we're too dependent on them to slap them across the face.'
He believes his 11 years with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and nine years
with the ENO have prepared him well for his role at Munich. 'One's got a
great deal of experience of how these things work. In London it was pretty
difficult, because we were much more dependent on speculative customers,
coming through the door on the day. In Munich it's more like Covent Garden.
The subscription audience provides a huge backbone - about 11,000 people,
some of whom have several subscriptions.'
It is, he says, all a question of balance: 'You have to be able to create an
artistic policy that will convert some of this traditional audience and draw
some new people. Ultimately, you have to rely on instinct - the feel you
have on the tiller of the direction you're going.'
This sensitivity, however, is the very quality Jonas's critics find missing.
'He doesn't seem to have a feeling for what is appropriate for Munich,' says
Marianne Reissinger of the Abendzeitung, citing Jonas's disinterest in the
Strauss tradition and his approach to Verdi. In the past, Verdi's operas
have been successful in Munich only when tackled from the highest musical
level: Simon Boccanegra with Abbado, La traviata with Kleiber, Macbeth and
Aida with Muti, La forza del destino with Sinopoli. Jonas handed Un ballo in
maschera to the German conductor Peter Schneider, and the performance was
about as un-Italianate as you can get.
Whether Jonas was wise to choose Schneider as the company's music director
is open to debate. Schneider is likable and hard-working, but lacks a strong
artistic personality. One member of the orchestra expresses the widely-held
view that Jonas 'doesn't have much interest in the musical side. He doesn't
talk about opera in terms of music or making people happy.'
On that last point, Jonas is inclined to agree. He says comic opera 'is
never going to be very visible with me around, because I've always been more
interested in the Sturm und Drang kind of thing. I just have a certain
taste. One is chosen for one's competence, I suppose, but also for one's
taste. That may be my undoing or it may be my glory. Whatever the outcome,
I'm not going to change.'
One area of his London experience Jonas is unlikely to repeat in Munich is
his begging-bowl speech-making from the stage. 'It's extremely liberating
here, in that the basic argument about the necessity of the arts was won a
long time ago. Having a State Opera in this town is an accepted fact. We
meet the politicians, of course, but it's not oppressive. The civil servants
are helpful. What is difficult is the bureaucracy. There are rules and
regulations, who you can hire and what you can pay for. It can be quite
enervating. But I'd prefer that kind of circuitous difficulty, and have the
essential matters accepted.'
A fastidious 47-year-old, Jonas says life in Munich involves less struggle
than London. His home is a short walk from the theatre. He takes part in his
ballet company's work-outs. The son of a German-Jewish father and a
half-Scots, half-Lebanese mother, he occasionally delights the locals by
wearing the kilt he bought for his last night at ENO.
He has joined the MCC - Munich Cricket Club. And he uses a cricketing
metaphor to describe himself as 'a leg-glancing professional - giving the
appearance of treating difficult things rather lightly, a concept that's
foreign to the Germans. I hope I can make this job work. But if they believe
it has to go in a different direction, or back to what it was, that's fine -
they can just get rid of me.'

You have to admire the tenacity of the people at Channel 4 (or groan at

one of the greatest 'switch-off' subjects of all time. So what does Channel
4 do? Mounts an entire week of programmes on the subject to mark the 25th
anniversary of British troops being deployed on the streets. Who knows,
perhaps it will work. Loved Ones is a sequence of 26 two-minute films
commemorating the victims of political violence (7.50). In The Last Colony
Martin Dillon looks at the years between 1969 and 1972 when the armed
stand-off developed (9.00). Beyond The Troubles finds former hostage Brian
Keenan talking to people who have stepped beyond the confines of 'the long
war' (11.00). The Visit is an award-winning half-hour drama about the wife
of a Long Kesh prisoner (11.50). Wall To Wall is a new series about housing,
from mud skyscrapers in Yemen to the cob cottages of Devon (7.30 BBC2). Room
101, inspired by the dreaded place in Orwell's 1984, is another new BBC2
series - the antithesis of Desert Island Discs (10.00).

FT  04 JUL 94 / The Monday Interview: The chef, the hotelier - and their
profits / Nicholas Lander talks to French chef Joel Robuchon about his new
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joel Robuchon is the most highly esteemed chef in France. His talent has
taken him to the heights of his trade, in a country which believes it has
taught the world how to cook.
Among fellow chefs he is respected for his integrity and professionalism.
Those who have eaten his food recognise his ability to extract the finest
flavours, not only from ingredients such as lobster, caviar and truffles but
from the more prosaic potato and salad. His 'pommes purees' are considered
the best. By reintroducing them onto a top French menu in the early 1980s,
Robuchon started a trend that spread around the world.
His relatively simple salad of fresh herbs would have delighted the nuns who
ran the seminary kitchen he started work in 37 years ago. It was there that
he fell under the spell of food and its cooking.
Despite his talent, Robuchon is not a man who likes to shock or steal the
limelight. Softly spoken, with deep-set eyes, he smiles easily. He enjoys
talking, particularly about food, the quality of the produce he uses and
about the art and profession of cooking.
Yet the latest stage in his career casts an intriguing light upon the
economics of being a modern day super-chef. Last year he shocked peers and
countrymen by announcing he would be closing his three star Michelin
restaurant in Paris, Jamin, and transferring his entire brigade to the
kitchens of Le Parc Victor Hugo, a new luxury hotel. In the process,
Robuchon stepped into the arms of an international hotel chain.
Le Parc Victor Hugo is owned by La Compagnie International Phenix Hotels,
which operates 31 hotels, predominantly in Paris but also in London,
Amsterdam and Geneva. Its main shareholders are Compagnie Generale des Eaux,
one of France's leading utilities and Assurances Generales de France, a
large, state-owned insurance company shortly to be privatised.
Robuchon's standing has allowed him to command impressive terms from the two
corporate giants. The combined workforce of the two companies is more than
250,000. Yet last week at the official opening of Le Parc Victor Hugo the
collaboration between Robuchon and CIP was described as a 'partnership'.
However, in spite of the status the deal gives him, a troubling question
remains: why is it that a man at the peak of his career, as chef and
proprietor of a three star Michelin restaurant, has chosen to compromise his
independence ?
The most suitable analogy for this unlikely partnership lies in the Middle
Ages. Robuchon is the brilliant artist and CIP the powerful nobleman, whose
patronage will ensure Robuchon's survival and eventual fortune. For these
days few celebrity chefs can live by cooking alone.
Born in Poitiers in 1945, the son of a mason and a mother who cooked simple
French food, Robuchon entered a seminary at the age of 12 to train for the
priesthood. He worked in the kitchens, alongside the nuns, and it was they
who alerted him to the pleasures and satisfaction of cooking.
'Cooking is one of the very few professions,' Robuchon stresses, 'which
demands that you use both your hands and your head to the same level of
skill.'
The need to supplement the family income forced Robuchon, aged 15, into the
kitchen as an apprentice in the hotel and restaurant, Relais de Poitiers. A
year followed as a Compagnon du Tour du France, during which like a medieval
journeyman, he travelled France, reporting in each city to an appointed
'master' who set him to work.
Robuchon believes, despite the hard work, that this training as part of a
team, was invaluable. 'There are many, many chefs who can cook expertly but
the hardest task facing any chef today is building a brigade, maintaining a
team.'
In 1965 Robuchon left the provinces for a job at The Berkley hotel in Paris
to work under head chef Andre Moreau, who believed passionately in the
professionalism inculcated by culinary competitions. It was Moreau who
recognised Robuchon's talents and made him compete at every available
opportunity. This competitive era convinced Robuchon to strive for the top.
In 1968 while many of his colleagues were gripped by revolutionary fervour
and several left the profession, Rubouchon ploughed on.
By 1970 he had become the youngest chef to win the Prix Taittinger, perhaps
France's most arduous culinary contest, and by 1974, aged 28, he was head
chef of the Hotel Concorde Lafayette, responsible for 90 chefs serving 3,000
customers. In 1981 he opened Jamin which gained three Michelin stars within
three years.
Chefs became media stars in the 1980s, Robuchon believes partly because none
of those cooking at the very highest level make a profit in the dining room.
Dinner chez Robuchon will cost Dollars 200 per person with modest wines -
but the perishable raw ingredients are only the very best and the labour
costs are very high. At Robuchon's restaurants, staff of 45 serve no more
than 50 customers.
Robuchon believes that without a strong financial parent top chefs have had
to find other sources of income - by writing books, making television
appearances or endorsing a range of foodstuffs - to support their
restaurants.
So he was particularly vulnerable when the recession of the early 1990s
brought empty tables, smaller bills and shrinking profits. In 1990 Robuchon
met Jean-Marc Oury, CIP's chairman, as the company was embarking on a
Dollars 5m plan to convert five 1912 townhouses into Le Parc Victor Hugo.
Oury lured Robuchon to the hotel with a deal in which Robuchon owns the
restaurant but pays rent to CIP. He does not get a salary but keeps the
restaurant's profits and acts as consultant to the hotel's brasserie, which
is considerably cheaper than the restaurant.
Robuchon believes the security of this partnership will allow him to set new
culinary standards and to shape the future of French cuisine. 'Cooking has
changed fundamentally since I began in 1960. It used to be the quality of
the sauces that was important. The produce itself was secondary and often
you could not tell what you were eating. Today what is important is to
respect the produce you are working with and fix in your mind its taste and
flavour so that you can recognise the precise moment it is cooked. That is
what I must teach.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Hilbert's policy for happy
longevity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Maverick' is a word that sticks to Stephen Hilbert. A dozen years of
wheeling and dealing has brought the 48-year-old founder of life insurance
group Conseco his share of controversy, writes Richard Waters.
It has also brought him to the brink of his biggest coup, a Dollars 2.7bn
takeover of Kemper, the embattled insurance, fund management and
stockbroking group.
Hilbert is an unusual animal in the US life insurance industry, as well as
its most lavishly rewarded executive. His rise stems from a single Big Idea,
hatched in 1979: that the fragmented insurance business, burdened with heavy
costs, was due for an overhaul.
Starting out with Dollars 10,000, it took Hilbert until 1982 to get the
backing to launch Conseco, and since then he has bought 11 insurance
companies. Along the way, some of the US's biggest investors have thrown
their considerable weight behind him. Calpers has Dollars 100m in Hilbert's
latest acquisition vehicle; GE Capital, whose own bid for Kemper Hilbert
topped last week, was an investor in an earlier Conseco partnership.
Based in Carmel, Indiana, Hilbert's rapid rise has brought him enemies. But
he has withstood the criticism of Wall Street and the regulators and and
came back fighting - even if his share price has retreated a third from its
high point 18 months ago.
As he once told the Indianapolis Business Journal: 'I believe the only way
you really get rid of all the negative comments is to outlive everyone
else.' A message the venerable but labouring Kemper will no doubt take to
heart, as it prepares to forfeit its independence.

FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Schmidt sweeps up at Denmark's
ISS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for power at the world's biggest cleaning company has been
settled, writes Hilary Barnes. Waldemar Schmidt, 53, has been tapped to take
over from Poul Andreassen as the next chief executive of the Danish-based
International Service Systems (ISS).
Schmidt, managing director of ISS Europe in London since 1989, has been
appointed deputy group managing director and will take over the top job in
May 1996. He will have a hard act to follow in Andreassen who joined ISS
more than 30 years ago when it was one of many small Danish cleaning
companies. Since then he has built it up into the world's largest cleaning
group with 120,000 employees in Europe, North America and Brazil, and a 1993
turnover of DKr13.3bn.
Schmidt's main contender for the job was Henrik Slipsager, 39, chief
executive of ISS's US business. Slipsager announced last Thursday that he
plans to quit at the end of the year but will continue as a member of the
board of the US business.

FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the news): Wagoner rides ever higher at
General Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To say that Richard Wagoner's rise to the top of General Motors has been
meteoric is to risk understatement, writes Martin Dickson.
Two years ago, at the age of 39, he was plucked from Brazil, where he was
head of GM's operations, to become the group's chief financial officer.
Last week he was promoted again, to run GM's North American vehicle
operations (NAO) - the troubled heart of the world's largest industrial
company. And he is still only 41.
Little wonder, then, that he has emerged as the front-runner eventually to
succeed Jack Smith, GM's 56-year-old chief executive, who gained the
position after a boardroom coup in 1992 and has been running NAO himself
until now.
Smith displayed his confidence in Wagoner last year when Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, the volatile Spaniard who had been running GM's worldwide
parts purchasing operation, suddenly quit this key position - and an offer
to head NAO - to join Volkswagen. Smith added the Lopez job to Wagoner's
finance portfolio.
Wagoner is a tall, extremely articulate man with self-deprecating sense of
humour and a maturity of manner beyond his years. He oozes leadership and as
finance chief won over Wall Street with his clear, frank briefings on GM's
problems.
After gaining a Harvard MBA in 1977 he joined GM's New York treasury
department - also Mr Smith's training ground - and then saw widespread
experience abroad, with two spells in Brazil, one in Canada and two years in
Europe in charge of finance.
Wagoner faces a huge challenge at NAO, which will return to the black this
year but is a long way from producing a decent financial return.
It employs too many workers and bureaucrats, with lower productivity than
rival manufacturers, making too many vehicles which lack design flair and
are poorly marketed.
Wagoner's firm but friendly style, methodical approach to problems and
desire to build consensus should help him in slimming GM in co-operation
with the group's union leadership.
He has gone some way to smoothing relations with GM's part suppliers, who
were angered by Lopez's confrontational approach. 'He listens well and has a
desire to bring people together more,' says one supplier.
As head of Brazilian operations in 1991-92, he is reputed to have brought in
the kind of cultural change and lean production systems now required at NAO.
A potential weakness is that he comes - like Mr Smith - from the financial
side of GM, rather than motor manufacturing. He may thus find it hard to
produce the kind of engineering excitement and design flair that many GM
vehicles badly need.
Still, he may be able to make GM vehicles more attractive to a segment of
the market where it is badly lagging - young Americans. He's almost one
himself.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Architecture: Stonehenge, danger major road ahead - Colin
Amery backs the suggestion by Jocelyn Stevens that a tunnel should run under
the famous monument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, is much too good to go. He is
rumbling and threatening to resign if the Department of Transport goes ahead
with plans for a new major road close to the site of Stonehenge. He is right
to be angry with the short sightedness and folly of the DoT.
Stevens has incredible enthusiasm for his job and he has galvanised much of
English Heritage into greater efficiency. When it comes to Stonehenge, he
and the National Trust (which owns much of the site) have taken their time
to realise how terrible the present situation is for visitors and for the
reputation of archaeology in England.
If you attempt to visit the stones today you will see the ugliness of the
car park, the closeness of the roads and the sheer unpleasantness of the
tunnel approach to the site. The stones themselves are isolated as if in a
concentration camp and surrounded by a high wire fence.
The public accounts committee of the House of Commons condemned the
presentation of Stonehenge as, 'a national disgrace' and ever since the
stones were placed in the care of English Heritage in 1984 ways have been
sought to improve things.
Stonehenge is one of the world's most important prehistoric sites and has
been recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. There are more than 450
archaeological monuments within the boundaries of the site and in the years
3000 BC to 1200 BC the area was filled with settlements, tombs, and sites
where the flint industry thrived. The ritual elements of the landscape are
now the most visible and fascinating things about the area. They deserve to
be treated with immense respect and dignity.
Jocelyn Stevens is an ebullient showman and he has become something of a
convert to the excitement of archaeology. He now realises Stonehenge could
become a 2000 acre prehistoric park that could easily become an
international tourist attraction of even greater significance than it is
now. It is the real thing, not a Jurassic Park or Disney recreation. All
this would be ruined by a major new road. As an alternative English Heritage
proposes a radical solution.
The Stevens plan is for a 2.8 mile twin bore tunnel beneath Stonehenge. This
would allow the removal of all roads that damage the site. It would also
create the opportunity for a large visitors' centre near Amesbury and a
small railway, which would carry visitors to the 'sunken observation and
interpretation centre', from where they would be able to wander freely among
the stones in a landscape disturbed only by sheep. Money is the uncertain
factor in the debate.
The tunnel could cost up to Pounds 200m so the DoT has proposed an
alternative northerly route that takes the A303 through Ministry of Defence
land at Larkhill. That is expected to cost Pounds 30m.
Because this road passes close to an ammunition dump and the officers mess
of the Larkhill Garrison it has been partly re-routed so it now impinges on
two other crucial archaeological sites. Stevens thinks that this route is
not the answer - only a proper tunnelled road can ensure that Stonehenge is
seen in a timeless setting, free of the detritus of the 20th century.
How successful the campaign for the tunnel will be depends upon the outcome
of a conference that is being held in London this week (Stonehenge - The
Great Debate - July 8, Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre) where
international experts will explore the monument's future.
Stevens is determined to put the DoT on the spot.
The minister, Steven Norris, will face several learned professors in road
economics and engineering, including world experts in engineering tunnels.
Proponents of the tunnel believe the debate will show that the costs of a
short tunnel will be much less than government estimates.
Stevens is optimistic that the visitors' centre, near Amesbury, will
generate considerable income from shops and hotels.
It is doubtful that it will pay for the tunnel, but private enterprise has
to be involved and the possibility of a toll tunnel cannot be ruled out.
Can Stevens succeed in selling to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry
of Transport his vision for Stonehenge? It is a potent vision - a gloriously
peaceful park dedicated to the mysterious rituals of the great stones.
If the road lobby wins, I suspect that the nation will feel that Stevens is
right when he says that if the government sanctions a low-cost, destructive
road we will know that 'nothing is sacrosanct'. Not even Stonehenge.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: The French connection - John Ridding looks at
the country's growing multimedia businesses / The world's superhighways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past month, Parisian movie buffs have had a new source of
satisfaction. By popping a card in their visiopass cable box, they can link
up to a new pay-per-view movie channel launched by France Telecom and its
multimedia partners. For FFr29 (Pounds 3.45), excluding the rental cost of
the cable connection, subscribers can save a trip to the cinema.
The pay-per-view movie channel is one of the services leaving the drawing
board of France Telecom Multimedia. Set up in March, its aim is to keep pace
with the international multimedia industry, particularly in the US, and
exploit what the state-owned telecommunications company sees as 'a major
growth market' for the group. With the liberalisation of Europe's telecoms
market scheduled for 1998, the development of multimedia is also a source of
alternative revenues for the world's third largest telecoms operator.
The task of tapping this new source of income falls to Gerard Eymery,
chairman of the new multimedia operation. 'We have to find new products and
services,' he says. 'It is not a problem of networks or terminals, but one
of discovering what consumers want.'
As Eymery points out, interactive telecommunications services are nothing
new to France Telecom or the French public. For the past ten years, millions
of French fingers have been tapping away daily on the keyboards of Minitel
teletext monitors, searching for information on everything from job
opportunities to dating partners, paying bills and booking rail tickets.
'There are now more than 23,000 different services,' says Jean-Paul Maury,
director of the Minitel project when it was launched in 1979. After its
first decade of service, and with 6.5m Minitel terminals now installed, he
says the Minitel is making a return on investment. But if it has come of
age, the next generation of multimedia activities is still in its infancy.
'We are at the testing stage,' says Eymery, referring to his new projects.
Next to be tested, following the launch of the pay-per-view movie service,
are a video game channel and a home shopping channel. The games channel, to
be developed in conjunction with Matra-Hachette, the
electronics-to-publishing group, is due to be launched this Autumn. The
tele-shopping channel is expected to start services by the end of the year,
and is due to be followed by other products, such as a channel for betting
on horse races and one for small advertisements.
The various projects reflect France Telecom's strategy of entering
Multimedia through partnerships. The pay-per-view movie company is a joint
investment with Lyonnaise des Eaux, the construction and communications
group which operates the cable television network in the Paris area. TF1,
the television channel, and CLT, the Luxembourg broadcasting group are also
partners in the project. Negotiations are currently under way to determine
the allies in the tele-shopping venture.
Further afield, France Telecom has taken an unspecified equity stake in
General Magic, the California-based international multimedia group. Last
month the French state telecoms group announced it would take a 15 per cent
stake in a Japanese multimedia group, alongside 19 Japanese companies,
including Mitsubishi, Casio and Seiko.
The search for partners, says Eymery is driven by strategic considerations.
'We are seeking to develop higher-value added services, so we need to tie up
with companies with expertise in relevant areas.'
Financial considerations are a secondary consideration, partly because of
the relatively small scale of the investments involved. The total outlay on
the pay-per-view service has been about FFr60m. The home shopping channel is
expected to require a total of between FFr80m and FFr90m.
But what of the returns? Eymery accepts that progress will be gradual. 'All
new media services take a long time to establish themselves,' he says. 'That
has always been the case, ever since the introduction of the television.'
Maury concurs. Even in the US, he says, expectations have exceeded reality
in predicting the impact of multimedia.
In France, an additional constraint is presented by the low rate of cable
subscription. The government's ambitious 'Plan Cable' launched in the early
1980s, cleared the way for the construction of a state-of-the-art cable
network. But the high costs of construction, partly passed on to consumers,
and the controversial decision in the second half of the decade to grant
licences to new terrestrial and satellite broadcasters has resulted in a
disappointing level of penetration.
There are currently about 5.5m households linked to the cable network, but
just 1.4m subscribers. This is one of the lowest rates of penetration in
Europe, and compares with 15m subscribers in neighbouring Germany. 'France
has made just about every mistake in cable that it was possible to make,'
says Eymery. He believes the creation of new television channels has been
largely to blame for the cable industry's problems.
Despite such obstacles, however, France Telecom says that pay-per-view has
had an encouraging start. Subscribers are watching an average of 1.7 films
per month, more than in the US, for similar services, although the novelty
factor may be a consideration. Within five to ten years, claims Eymery,
annual revenues from pay-per-view could reach between FFr300m and FFr400m.
Turnover from all of France Telecom's multimedia activities could climb to
between FFr5bn and FFr10bn by early next century, he believes.
Annual revenues from Minitel are already approaching FFr7bn, derived from
almost 90m hours of connections by subscribers per year. But will the
traditional videotext service be threatened by new products from France
Telecom's multimedia subsidiary?
Both Maury and Eymery believe not. At least not yet. 'We will provide an
extension to Minitel services,' says Eymery, who argues that the limitations
on image quality on Minitel and the different services being provided by the
multimedia division will lead to complementarity rather than competition.
Maury believes there is still a solid foundation for Minitel. 'If you just
need a telephone number then you don't need multimedia,' he says, referring
to the system's core directory service, still the single largest source of
demand from Minitel users.
He believes growth will be maintained through the addition of more
sophisticated services and through higher quality sound and images,
particularly through connections via personal computers.
Within the next few months, France Telecom is due to launch the high-speed
Teletel Vitesse Rapide which, it says, will permit faster connections and
improved image quality for Minitel users. A minitel terminal with a smart
card reader is also due to be launched, allowing remote payment from home
using bank cards.
In the longer term, however, with the promise of information superhighways,
both minitel and the existing cable network may run into technical
constraints. 'Down the road, business and private consumers may want faster
systems with higher quality images,' says one telecommunications analyst in
Paris. 'This would require the creation of a fibre optic network linking
households and companies,' he adds.
The creation of a nationwide fibre optic network, linking households, is
currently a topic of hot debate in France. Anxious not to be left behind by
developments in the US and Japan, the government has commissioned a report
into so-called 'autoroutes d'information' or information superhighways. The
report, by Gerard Thery, former managing director of France Telecom, is due
by the end of July.
France Telecom is already expanding its network of fibre optic cables.
Charles Rozmaryn, managing director of the company, says the target is to
install 2m km of optical fibres in the national network by the year 2000,
compared with a current figure of 820,000km.
For the moment, however, the fibre optic network is not being extended to
households. And many are sceptical about the costs and returns that such an
extension would generate. 'It would take an investment of maybe FFr200bn to
link French households through fibre optic cables,' says Eymery, who argues
the investment would not generate adequate returns in the near future.
Besides, he already has enough on his drawing board.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Games Blockbuster plays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mid-1980s, two friends working in a garage could produce a perfectly
acceptable video game. Today, says Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin
Communications, teams of 12 to 20 people have to work on games for up to 18
months.
Devereux says: 'We very rarely develop anything for less than a seven figure
sum. We've got Dollars 40m of product in development at the moment. You can
make half a dozen mid-priced movies for that.'
Devereux's company is developing a basketball video game called Hoops. It
will have 19,000 frames of animation. The data storage systems required for
these games are increasingly complex and expensive, he says.
The escalating cost of making video games is one of the reasons why Devereux
welcomes last week's announcement that Blockbuster Entertainment of the US
is to increase its stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), Virgin's
video software subsidiary, from 20 per cent to 75 per cent.
VIE develops games and entertainment software compatible with Sega and
Nintendo hardware systems. It also devises games for personal computer and
compact disc read-only memory (CD-Rom) systems. It will shortly release
games based on the Walt Disney film of the Jungle Book and the animated
feature movie the Lion King.
Blockbuster, which is the world's biggest video rental company, is to sell
its entire VIE stake to Spelling Entertainment, the Hollywood film
production company in which it has a majority stake.
Devereux says Blockbuster admits it knows little about the development of
video games software. That is why VIE will be owned by Spelling, which is
more familiar with entertainment production.
The London-based Devereux, who is also in charge of Virgin's television,
radio and book publishing activities, will remain chief executive of VIE.
Steven Berrard, Blockbuster's president, will become chairman of VIE.
The advantages of the link with Blockbuster, Devereux says, are the
marketing muscle it will give VIE and the size of the US company's
distribution network: 4,250 shops worldwide.
Another reason why Devereux says he is pleased to be linking up with
Blockbuster is that the video games business is about to enter a difficult
period.
The first problem is that players are becoming bored with the range of games
on offer, he says. The second is that the machines on which the games are
played are going to change in ways that will confuse the consumer.
The industry is moving from cartridge-based games to CD-Rom. Devereux
believes this Christmas will be the last to see substantial sales of the
current generation of 16-bit cartridge-based machines.
Not all of the large games companies, however, will move on to CD-Rom
machines. Sega and Sony will, but Nintendo is bringing out a 64-bit
cartridge-based machine. Another growing development, Devereux believes,
will be CD-Rom games for personal computers.
The fragmentation will make games players reluctant to buy machines until
they know which system is likely to survive, he says.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Telecoms look for an outside edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the hype about multimedia and superhighways, one quiet but genuine
revolution stands out in the telecommunications industry - the gradual
transformation of the large national telecoms operators from utility-minded
monopolies to market-minded service providers.
The revolution is everywhere incomplete; in some cases it has barely
started. 'We discovered marketing last year, and can't get over the
excitement,' quips a senior executive of British Telecommunications, one of
Europe's more go-ahead operators.
What are the tell-tale signs? Flashy logos, more and better marketing and
advertising, ambitious joint ventures at home and abroad. But a less
obvious, and perhaps more fundamental, change is the wholesale replacement
of the senior management of the large telecoms companies.
It is not just a change of personnel: the type is changing too. Out goes the
engineer and career posts and telecoms bureaucrat; in comes the financial
services or consumer goods executive, hired to turn telecoms into a brand
and to fire a large proportion of the existing staff, not excepting the
senior engineers.
Last month's FT conference on European telecommunications highlighted the
trend. The heads of six large telecoms companies were on the programme. Only
one was a career telecoms engineer; the other five were outsiders who joined
their companies within the last six years.
Bessel Kok, chief executive of Belgacom, was chief executive of Swift, a
dedicated financial data processaing operator, prior to his appointment in
1992. His main occupation is bullying Belgium's politicians to get his state
monopoly into the private sector.
Wim Dik, chief executive of KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts and
telecoms monopoly, went to the job in 1988 from Unilever. He boasts of not
having spent a day in the public sector prior to KPN, and still serves on
the board of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.
Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, trained as an actuary, and was
managing director of Abbey Life, the UK group, before moving to BT in 1991.
Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu Ruiz, chairman of Telefonica, the private sector
Spanish monopoly, was director general of Tabacanarias, the Spanish tobacco
group, until 1989.
The fifth speaker, Mike Harris, chief executive of the UK's Mercury, is a
union of old and new. He came to Mercury two years ago, fresh from
masterminding the launch of the UK's first telephone bank, First Direct.
Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, is the model revolutionary,
having dispatched its entire ancien regime. Its chairman, Lord Young, is a
former politician and construction tycoon. James Ross, chief executive, was
until two years ago managing director of British Petroleum. Linus Cheung,
chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, was recruited
last year from Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline.
Oil, construction, airlines, banking - C&amp;W has everything but telecoms
experience among its senior management. For advice on the widgets, the
management board relies on Sydney O'Hara. Even he is a new arrival - from
BT, where he was deputy director of the company's research labs.
The sixth executive at the conference was, perhaps, the exception which
proves the rule. Charles Rozmaryn, chief executive of France Telecom, is
every inch the telecoms careerist: a graduate of the Ecole Superieure des
Telecommunications, who held a succession of posts in the Direction Generale
des Telecommunications before his current post.
Yet France Telecom defies all the maxims about state control equalling
inefficiency and a dynamism deficit. What next, if it becomes Europe's only
telecoms operator run by people who know what they are talking about?

FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Grandeur and chaos - Robert Graham gives an
aficionado's guide to Naples, scene of this week's G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bourbons used to make their regal entry into Naples by sea. So did
Admiral Nelson in search of Lady Hamilton. It is, to this day, also the most
convenient way to reach the heart of Naples.
The heads of the G7 countries will, however, arrive by air for their meeting
this week. This is, yes, more in tune with the times, but air travel misses
the sweep of the Bay of Naples with the volcanic cone of Vesuvius in the
background.
Unfortunately, most people's impressions of Naples are coloured by negative
experiences within minutes of setting foot at its airport or two railway
stations. This is unfortunate because Naples is unquestionably the grandest,
if not also the most maligned and most chaotic, of the great Mediterranean
port cities. Naples and the Neapolitans deserve a second, even a third,
chance.
The airport ordeal begins even before landing, as the aircraft navigates a
perilous path between illegally built apartment blocks and the tops of
ancient chemical plants that ring the runway. Then comes the wait for
baggage which has a habit of losing itself. Be quick to report luggage that
does not arrive: I was once allowed to search the holds of five parked
aircraft and, eventually, located the lost piece about to be dispatched to
Bari.
Luggage in hand, it is best to opt for a taxi. The cardinal rule about
Naples taxis - who consider any passenger, especially one from out of town,
fair game - is always to check the meter works and is clocked on. This is
particularly adviseable for the journey to central Naples, which takes at
least 45 minutes.
Here is a fairly standard routine between passenger and driver: 'Could you
put on the meter?'
'I'm afraid it's not working.'
At this point you threaten to get out of the taxi.
If done with good humour, you will immediately be called Dotto (Doctor - a
sign of respect) and then be treated to a display of Neapolitan driving -
something to be experienced, not described. But you may still be cheated
with some spurious supplementary charge.
Naples offers two railway stations. Napoli Centrali is the main terminal.
But Centrali suffers the inconveniences of being surrounded by a square with
often grid-locked traffic and a high proportion of assorted eastern European
alms-seekers and local importuners. It is often easier to go to Napoli
Mergellina which is close to the sea front, less crowded and allows access
to the main hotel area in less than 10 minutes.
Inter-city trains only ever stop at one of these two stations. However,
there is a useful underground link between them - the only part of the
city's long-promised metro.
Public transport is erratic and crowded, although in less than six months a
new mayor has performed wonders. He has managed to reduce the appalling
traffic jams of the past merely by making the traffic police work. A large
number were found to have been clocking in, only to go home with the excuse
that the traffic was so bad that their presence made no difference. The G-7
summit is an additional incentive to spruce up the city and improve its
workings.
The city centre is usually easier and more enjoyable to negotiate on foot.
Going by bus can be an uncertain experience: it is not always easy to buy a
ticket before boarding, as passengers are meant to, but board anyway because
no one will bother to check.
The best of Naples hotels are on the corniche of Via Partenope, overlooking
a small marina and the ancient hulk of the Castel Dell'Ovo, with the Bay and
Capri in the distance. Prices are more or less the same, with the Vesuvio at
the top of the range - over L350,000 (Dollars 220) a night. The Santa Lucia
is well-decorated with Neapolitan antiques and has helpful staff, while the
Excelsior appeals to those attracted by faded grandeur. If you want to pay
less, look for the smaller s in Chiaia.
Via Partenope corniche has the advantage of being fairly self-contained. In
front, there are a good 15 restaurants around the Castel Dell'Ovo marina,
all serving good Neapolitan cuisine.
If you come to Naples on business, it is a shame not to see some of the
sights. The priority must be the Museo Archeologico (one of the world's top
museums, with the finest finds from Pompei). There is a surfeit of churches,
Roman and Greek ruins at Pausilypon, palaces and art collections. The
Capodimonte Museum, the most important art gallery, is currently closed for
restoration.
For those with time to go to Pompei, it can be reached by train from Napoli
Centrale. The journey, scheduled to last 45 minutes, in the manner of Naples
often takes longer.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Time travel to a flexible clock - Michael
Skapinker divulges how he avoids jet lag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had resigned myself to watching US chat shows with presenters who burst
into tears, when Lulu came to my rescue.
I became an ardent viewer of chat shows on my last visit to the US. They
appeared on television in the early hours, and from 2.20am onwards I was
wide awake in my hotel room. Back home in London, it was 7.20am, my usual
waking time.
The chat shows were compelling. In one, the host asked his guest if she had
had an unhappy childhood. She had. The host wept copiously, miraculously
perking up in time for the commercial break.
During the day, I paid for this indulgence. I battled to stay awake during
interviews, felt hungry when I would have been eating in London, and had no
appetite when I had to join people for meals in the US.
There was, I thought, nothing that could be done about jet lag, until I read
a book called Around the World in Eighty Ways, published by Wexas
International, a club which organises travel for its members. The book is
full of famous people's travel tips. Lulu, the pop star, gives this remedy
for jet lag: do not eat on the aircraft.
Diana Rigg, the actress, offers the same advice: 'While on board, eat as
little as possible and drink as much as possible, preferably non-alcoholic.
Sounds dull, but it works.'
I have tried this twice now, on long trips in opposite directions. It is
dull, but being in an aircraft is seldom thrilling. And it does work.
On a day-time flight to the Caribbean, I did not avoid food entirely, eating
just enough to keep hunger at bay. I drank every non-alcoholic drink I was
offered. I had no jet lag at all.
I followed the same routine on a trip to Hong Kong, with the added challenge
that this was an overnight flight. I arrived in Hong Kong in mid-morning,
having snatched a few hours sleep on the flight. I went straight to a
welcome lunch and then on to two interviews, finishing in the early evening.
I was slightly weary, but without the feeling that my mind and stomach were
operating to a different clock.
This is not the only way to avoid jet lag. In the same book, the actress
Maureen Lipman says she heard it was a good idea to put brown wrapping
paper, cut to the shape of an inner sole, inside your socks.
She does not say whether she has tried it herself. Has anyone? Does it work?
Answers on this or any other jet lag remedy to me on fax 071-873-4343.

Karachi, Istanbul and Caracas are the least expensive cities for executives,
according to Business Traveller magazine. Tokyo and Moscow are the most
expensive, while London is 13th on the list of the dearest destinations and
Dublin 37th.
The figures are based on what it costs for a single room in a four-star
hotel with continental breakfast. It also takes into account soft drinks,
taxis and other incidental costs.
The daily costs in Tokyo are about Pounds 319, in London they are just over
Pounds 200, while the Dublin figure is about Pounds 155.
Those looking for a cheap stay could try Caracas (Pounds 84 a day), Karachi
(Pounds 80) or Istanbul (Pounds 66).

The days when airline travel represented a break from the stresses of the
office are over, according to Inmarsat, the international satellite
organisation.
Already, 30 airlines have begun to install telephones on their aircraft,
with some also offering facsimile machines. By the end of the century,
Inmarsat says, airline passengers will have all the facilities they now have
in their offices.
An Inmarsat global pager is being developed. So is a hand-held satellite
telephone. Passengers on some airlines can already use on-line notebook
computers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hotel industry will follow airlines in forming alliances to penetrate
markets in which they are currently weak, according to Mr Michael Hirst,
former chairman of Hilton International.
Mr Hirst told a recent conference in New York that international hotel
groups would find it difficult to expand in Asian markets by buying
individual properties. Building new hotels would also be difficult.
Developing a hotel from scratch required at least three years. Hotel groups
would thus, he said, have to form alliances with strong regional companies.

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has published proposals to protect
travellers who buy airline tickets in bucket shops, writes Michael
Skapinker. Its proposals will require shops selling discounted scheduled
flights to have their own Air Travel Organisers' Licences (Atol).
The Atol system protects passengers from losing their money or being
stranded abroad if their tour operator fails. Tour operators who sell
air-based trips are required by the CAA to lodge a bond - a financial
guarantee provided by a bank or insurance company.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: The ice men cometh - At the bar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you haven't heard of ice beer you will. It's no good muttering 'fad' and
ordering something else. Putting ice cubes in your pint won't do either. Ice
beer is brewed like that - it's served sans glace.
And if the North American consumer is anything to go by, it tastes just
great. A year after its launch, ice beer has 12 per cent of the Canadian
market: 2 per cent in the US. But it isn't cheap - I paid Pounds 4.90
(Dollars 7.60) for two bottles at a central London pub.
Labatt's quotes Pounds 1.50-Pounds 1.80 as a pub price range. Molson Pounds
1.90-Pounds 2.00 and Foster's Pounds 4.79 for a four-pack from the
off-licence. All are aiming for the trendy premium packaged lager market.
Bottling is fashionable and the buzz word is ICE.
Of course ice beer is a sophisticated product and the result of various
brewing processes too complicated to worry about - suffice to say they all
involve super-chilling or freezing to produce ice crystals. All should be
served cold: Labatt's recommends 42F.
When you and I get the stuff, the crystals have gone. Taking the ice out can
flush out proteins and compounds and 'improve' the taste and freshness
and/or strengthen the beer. Very little is new in brewing - the Canadians
used to leave cider out in buckets to freeze, and after removing the ice,
would fall around for weeks on the resulting concentrate.
What's left after you take the ice out of Labatt Ice Beer, Molson Ice, and
Foster's Ice is a premium lager which is one of two things. If you're the
brewer its smooth, clean, clear, crisp, and strong at between 5 and 5.6 per
cent alcohol by volume. If you're the consumer the word bland may creep into
your over-heated brain: the memory of drinking defrosted beer from the
fridge lingers around the taste buds.
My own judgment is that the lack of after-taste does make ice beer very
smooth. It's an odd sensation, the tingling clean taste on the tongue just
fades away. Then nothing happens. The alcohol content provides taste. It is
refreshing, and different, and on a blazing summer day the word ICE on the
label is going to empty a few shelves.
If the market takes off expect further competition in the UK.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Sport: Downside of the hero's return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose I should have been sorry that Nigel Mansell left the French Grand
Prix with only two thirds of it completed. But there was, to me, something
unseemly in the atmosphere permeating in the build up to yesterday's race.
I know there is no reason why Nigel Mansell should not have taken a day out
from IndyCar racing, in order to drive the Williams-Renault car. Nobody can
blame the team for wanting to borrow so good a driver, or for Mansell for
wanting to make such a well choreographed appearance, or the motor racing
fans for wanting one of their familiar heroes to return to their sport's
depleted stage.
But did nobody feel just a little uneasy with the whole episode? Those
lovers of the sport who were following events with such fascination - were
they the same people who, nine weeks earlier, had mourned so assiduously the
man whose place Mansell was now filling?
Of course the Williams team could not let the loss of Ayrton Senna bring its
season to an end. It had a business to run, one which deals, however
reluctantly, in death. By giving Senna's place to Damon Hill and bringing in
a young unknown, David Coulthard, to drive the number two car, Williams
handled the tragedy in the most decent way possible.
Yet the temptation to lure a big name to the team was very strong (stronger
according to press reports, for Renault than for Williams); and I shall hate
to sound as if I believe myself to have finer feelings than those who
orchestrated so popular a manoeuvre.
But yesterday's Grand Prix produced the sense that Senna's death, had,
however obscurely, led to an event which was a cause for celebration.
Necessity decreed that the empty place on the Williams team must be filled.
Yet should it have been filled with so much publicity, so great an eagerness
to forget motor racing's terrible recent past?
Perhaps it is hypocritical to say that it should not. But the tone in which
the race was previewed felt strange to me; and doubly strange for the fact
that all this excitement had been disseminated by Nigel Mansell.
When Mansell was a fixture in Formula One, who, apart from his army of
flag-waving fans, would have believed that he could ever have commanded such
a reaction? Who, apart from those same fans, would have thought that this
graceless figure would, one day, be regarded as the natural replacement for
the aristocratic Senna?
By leaving Formula One, Mansell finally achieved what he had never been able
to do when he was part of it: he made it want him. When he was on the Grand
Prix circuit, he maintained an air of being hard done by which was hugely
irritating in a multi-millionaire.
Yet there was a genuine sense of being under-appreciated, which was proved
to have some foundation when Mansell was virtually forced to make way for
Alain Prost on the Williams team, despite the fact that he had just won the
world championship.
This incident - the truth of which has never come out - finally compelled
Mansell to do what he had threatened to do several times before: retire from
Formula One. Nobody believed that he would do it, thinking instead that this
was another one of his uncharismatic shows of temperament. But he left, and
he made a success in IndyCar racing, and ever since then Formula One has
wanted him back.
Why? One cannot help wondering. Even though Mansell's performance itself was
a non-event, the build up to the French Grand Prix created an image of a
conquering hero returning to his people. This image would certainly be
re-created if Mansell decided to make appearances at subsequent races. Hype,
of course, has helped; but it is not all hype. Formula One wanted Mansell
back because it thought that he could help to salvage an almost ruined
season. Strange as it may seem, this resolutely unprepossessing man is
popular enough to do it.
I have never heard anyone say a good word for Nigel Mansell; and yet people
seem to like him. They criticise him for his demeanour, while, at the same
time, almost admiring his refusal to be charming, or aspire towards the more
gracious life that celebrity status can bring, or be anything other than a
richer version of the man he has always been.
It may be that, in some unconscious way, people connect these traits with
Mansell's refusal to give up on a race. Ayrton Senna was equally obdurate
but his determination had an other-worldly quality, which alienated people
because they could not understand it. Mansell's is absolutely of this world;
gritty, grubby, gutsy. It is the determination of the nobody who will not be
done down by the somebodys.
People see themselves - or part of themselves - in this. And they responded
when Mansell made his comeback. They know that he doesn't need the money and
that Dollars 1m is far too much for a few days of unsuccessful work. But
they sensed that he wanted to prove a point; that he wanted Formula One to
want him. They know that he will want to go on proving points all his life,
whatever the cost might be.
The exotic, mysterious Ayrton Senna had little in common with the dour,
unglamorous Nigel Mansell. But Senna, too, dared all whatever the cost, and
for this reason it is not, after all, so inappropriate that Mansell should
have been driving in his place yesterday.
Perhaps Senna would have seen the fitness of it, behind all the misplaced
celebrations. To me he was the dominant figure at the French Grand Prix, his
sombre brown stare gazing at the events he had set in motion and at Michael
Schumacher, the smiling young man that neither he nor Mansell could catch.

The Bucks Stop Here by Jim Parton. Published by Simon &amp; Schuster. paperback,
Pounds 5.99. 252pp
'I couldn't see the point of suffering in the City of London if the sums I
earned were only mildly revolting as opposed to completely obscene.' It's
the kind of opening that hints at plenty of juice to come; Parton delivers
on the promise.
There's always the fear with this kind of book - self-confessed hopeless
stockbroker bares soul and puts boot into former employers - that
embarrassment or failure to amuse lurk over the very next page. Relax.
Parton avoids those sins. He has written a very funny book, required reading
for all the forlorn City saps who are still playing the game.
Parton kicks off with him married to a Japanese television workaholic, five
years into a City broking life, employed by UBS Phillips and Drew. His
facility with the Japanese language plus a modicum of chutzpah has persuaded
successive ignorant City firms that he will one day land them a tidal wave
of Japanese cash, as eager Tokyo investors suddenly discover European
equities.
What goes up - Parton freely admits he was never good enough to go very far
up - must come down. He nosedives into unemployment and, yes, does discover
an alternate life, playing the piano, writing, enjoying himself without
loads of dosh.
That might sound twee. But buckets of black humour, ready self-criticism,
and side-swipes at City taboos - including this newspaper - suffocate
sentimentality on sight. It's just too funny, even when things turn sombre;
for instance, when Parton's wife dumps him and walks off with their child.
Everyone deservedly gets a going-over: broking firms; headhunters - Parton
calls them all 'Donald' since they are individually indistinguishable; even
the 'colleague' who told Parton that he would not speak to him if he wore a
checked shirt to the office. So, for the price of an up-market City sandwich
you can buy an afternoon's wonderful hilarity, far funnier and less pompous
than Liar's Poker.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Sun downers - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sun may be the best tonic for the blues. But it can also cause long-term
damage to those who worship it too much, in the form of premature ageing and
skin cancer.
'Prevention is always better than cure,' says Dr Mike McKiernan, director of
health, safety and environment at Lucas Industries in Birmingham. Dr
McKiernan, who learnt of the severe damage sun can do while working in
Australia, believes a current health promotion campaign from Down Under,
which advises sunbathers to 'slip, slop, slap' (slip on a T-shirt, slop on
some sun cream and slap on a hat) is the best pre-emptive measure for those
who want to play outside when the winter gloom lifts.
Using a protective sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) is
vital. For those with light skins, Dr John Hawk, consultant dermatologist
for sun related skin diseases at the St John's Institute, recommends creams
with an SPF factor of 15 to 20. People with darker skins may opt for weaker
protection, though a high SPF can never hurt.
Summer frolickers may choose between sun blocks based on chemical or
physical protection. Those with chemical components absorb the sun's
dangerous ultraviolet rays, while physical blocks contain a reflective
barrier. For cosmetic reasons, most people may prefer chemically based
creams, because those with reflective blocks tend to leave an opaque sheen
on the skin. But for those with sensitive skin, chemically based creams may
cause uncomfortable rashes.
In the early days of summer, unprotected sun exposure should be limited to
no more than half hour stretches, especially during the peak hours of
sunlight, around noon to 2 pm in the UK. If holidaying in hotter areas like
the Mediterranean, Dr McKiernan advises: 'Add an extra hour on either side.
Take that siesta from 11am to 3pm.'
Even one bad burn could lead to serious problems later in life. 'The skin
never forgets,' says Dr McKiernan.
If warts, moles or other such lesions do appear on the body, or if existing
ones change shape, colour or start to itch, seek medical advice immediately.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If you are a UK expatriate, you are entitled to receive gross interest from
your UK bank and building society after completing a form to declare your
non-resident status. But the ability to receive gross income does not mean
it is tax-exempt, since most UK sources of income are taxable.
The interest can only be excluded from liability to tax under
extra-statutory concession Bl3 but this involves considerable restrictions.
Donald Elkin, director of Wilfred T Fry Ltd, of Worthing, West Sussex,
points out that any interest you receive during 'broken' years of departure
from and arrival in the UK, will be fully taxable. Moreover, in intervening
years of non-residence, allowances will be set off against the gross paid
interest you thought was exempt.
If the interest is your only UK income, these will not be a problem. But if
you have other sources, such as a pension or are renting out property, Elkin
says you stand to suffer an unnecessary loss: 'Suppose, for example, that
while non-resident you receive UK letting profits of Pounds 3,400 per annum
and gross paid building society interest of Pounds 3,000. You might well
have assumed you would have no tax liability, the Pounds 3,000 interest
being exempt and the Pounds 3,400 letting profit fully covered by your
Pounds 3,445 personal allowance. In fact, that allowance will be set off
first against the interest, leaving only Pounds 445 to reduce the liability
on the letting profit. You would, therefore, have to pay tax on Pounds 2,955
(Pounds 3,400 minus Pounds 445) which at 25 per cent equals Pounds 738.75.'
Fortunately, this is a problem from which it is easy to escape simply by
transferring your account outside the UK. But it is always worth taking tax
advice before doing so.
Most UK banks and many building societies have offshore branches in the
Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. But remember the UK's Deposit Protection
Scheme for banks and building societies does not operate outside mainland
Britain, so it is important to stick to reputable depositors.
Of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle of Man has a comparable
scheme, which protects up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. If you
are with a building society, the Building Societies Act requires all the
liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the UK parent.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Trading places - Schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several recession-hit independent schools will close for good at the end of
this school year. Parents caught up in a closure will face a dilemma over
choosing a new school, for there will be no shortage of other schools
offering places.
Those with daughters at Felixstowe College already know the phenomenon. A
strong hint the school might be considering closure came about a month
before it was formally announced, when they received a letter from another
local private school, Amberfield, suggesting they might want to move their
girls there.
However, Felixstowe was in a stronger position than many schools when they
close. As a member of Allied Schools, a group which also includes Stowe and
Harrogate Ladies' College, it was able to steer parents in the direction of
other schools.
Rather more anger was generated at the Waterside School in Bishops
Stortford, where the staff were dismissed by the receiver two weeks ago
after the school had become insolvent. One group of parents distributed a
press release claiming children had woken 'to find the school had gone
overnight'.
Amanda Robertson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the receiver, said she was 'deeply
angered' by this reaction. She said she had made it 'blindingly obvious' to
parents at a meeting in the second week of June that the school had a 'zero
per cent chance' of surviving beyond the following Tuesday. Invigilators
were found for those pupils who had not finished their GCSE exams, and
school meals stayed available until the end of the week.
But it is difficult to close a school without pain for the pupils. The only
way for parents to avoid this is to ask some searching questions about the
accounts before enrolling children at a new school. According to Robertson:
'Waterside's accounts showed fat losses each year and were publicly
available.'

<TEXT>
When Fredy Girardet won three rosettes last November in Michelin's first
guide to Swiss restaurants, he reacted simply, 'Well, we will just have to
work harder.'
Certainly, the 57-year-old master of cuisine spontanee shows no signs of
fatigue. Slim and fit - he cycles regularly in the nearby Jura mountains -
he produces wonderful surprises and still inspires younger chefs throughout
the world.
I first became aware of Girardet through his student Kiyomi Mikuni, whose
Hotel de Mikuni became a favourite occasional retreat from Japanese fare
while posted in Tokyo.
Stepping into the master's discreet restaurant on a quiet street in Crissier
just north of Lausanne a few nights ago, the connection was immediately
clear. The dining room itself is plain, with only a dozen well spaced tables
and a few austere abstract/landscape paintings by Girardet's friend Yves
Mafli on the walls. Nothing distracts from the cuisine.
'I see the echoes,' I said clumsily to Girardet as he made his first of two
cruises through the dining room. 'Mikuni is echoing me,' he corrected
gently.
We will not soon forget his foie gras with grapes jellied in Madiera or the
half cooked wild salmon with rough sea salt kernels sprinkled on top or even
the astonishing variety of homemade breads. The lime and raspberry souffle
alone would be worth a detour.
Because the restaurant is so small, it is best to book well in advance for
Girardet. I rang in early April for a mid-June evening and found Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays were already fully booked.
Girardet, 1, rue d'Yverdon, 1023 Crissier, Switzerland. Tel (41-21)
634-0505. A la carte or set menus at SFr165 or SFr180. No credit cards.
Closed Sundays, Mondays, three weeks from the last Saturday in July, three
weeks from Christmas day.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Divide and thrive at Boots - Neil Buckley
reports on how the retailing and pharmaceuticals group used textbook
techniques to revive its profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late in 1992, workers at Boots factories in Nottingham found themselves
wearing a new badge on their overalls. The famous blue oval carrying the
Boots name in cursive script was replaced by one sporting two
interconnecting squiggles. At the same time, workers had to get used to the
idea that they were working not for 'Boots', but for a new business unit,
Boots Contract Manufacturing.
The logos were visible signs of important developments in the group -
changes that might have come straight from a modern management textbook, but
which were greeted with suspicion inside and outside the 111-year-old
company.
'There was some cynicism about the business-school speak,' says a company
insider. 'But now people think and speak the new language.'
If the changes are gaining acceptance in the group, Boots' announcement last
month of a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 484m for the
year to March (before exceptional items) helped to convince the outside
world of their effectiveness. In spite of uncertainty surrounding the
pharmaceuticals division, losses at the Do It All DIY chain, and
disappointing performances from other legacies of the Pounds 900m
acquisition of Ward White in 1989, it seemed that chief executive Sir James
Blyth had found a way of unlocking extra value.
Working with Marakon, a Connecticut-based management consultancy, the then
highly centralised Boots group split 18 months ago into 10 business units.
All units have a specified market and competitors, their own management
team, identity and logo.
Each draws up its own profit and loss account, balance sheet and cashflow
statements, and presents an annual 'prospectus' to the group centre
detailing its strategy, and the capital and resources required to fulfil it.
This is discussed with the group chief executive, and becomes a 'strategy
contract' signed by both sides.
The contract includes performance targets that determine unit managers'
incentive payments.
This, says Sir James, marks a big improvement on the practice in many
companies of allocating capital through annual budgetary procedures, where
the amount each division receives often depends on the 'baronial powers of
individuals'.
The group centre, meanwhile, has slimmed to 100 people in seven roles:
personnel, corporate affairs, corporate development, financial management,
information technology, quality control and treasury.
'Boots has tried to create an environment in which the group centre becomes
a shareholder in each business unit, with only a limited range of services.
But it is a demanding shareholder,' says Sir James.
The centre is also responsible for new business development and
restructuring, as well as exploiting synergies, or so-called 'key
affiliation benefits'. These include the transfer of retail skills between
businesses, development of the Boots brand, vertical integration, and the
sharing of information.
Sir James sums up the changes: 'What used to happen at board meetings was
that directors would spend a great deal of time talking about numbers. Now
all the discussion is about strategy.'
The goal of that strategy, as with any public company, is maximising
shareholder value. Boots defines this specifically as 'maximising the
long-term cashflow of each business unit'.
According to Sir James, the concentration on free cashflow reflects a
growing shift by institutional investors from looking at earnings per share.
'There is a much stronger correlation between cashflow per share and market
value than between earnings per share growth and market value,' he suggests.
The new structure at Boots also makes it easier for insiders and outsiders
to assess the contribution of different parts of the business.
While the future of the prescription pharmaceuticals arm is under review
following the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug last year, Boots
Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs arm, and Boots Contract
Manufacturing, which manufactures products for the other two as well as
health and beauty products, are emerging as businesses with great potential.
'Historically, for 25 years, we had been seen as a cost,' says John Watson,
managing director of BCM. 'Now we are seen as a profit.'
BCM's operating profits rose by nearly a quarter last year to Pounds 16.2m,
and as a standalone business it is the third-biggesst manufacturer of its
type in Europe. Eighty per cent of its output goes to other Boots companies,
60 per cent to Boots the Chemists alone. It already makes own-label products
for several of the UK's large grocery retailers, and is keen to expand its
third-party business.
Boots Healthcare International, whose brands include such well-known
products as Optrex, Nurofen and Strepsils, has also been earmarked for
expansion. BHI will concentrate on developing four product groups - cough
and cold remedies, pain relief, eye care and skin care - and plans
acquisitions in France, Italy and Germany.
The dominant business unit, however, remains Boots the Chemists, responsible
for 60 per cent of group operating profits. Its recent results - a 13 per
cent profit rise to Pounds 322m - suggest it is weathering the
everyday-low-pricing strategy operated by Superdrug, which is owned by the
rival Kingfisher group.
The resilience of BTC stems partly from changes wrought by managing director
Gordon Hourston.
In 1986 BTC was in danger of losing its identity and focus, with larger
stores carrying everything from toothpaste to televisions. A wide variation
in store sizes also made functions such as inventory management difficult.
Hourston's solution was to split the business in half, with stores larger
than 600 sq m operating separately. He also divided the central buying and
marketing department into business centres responsible for particular
product areas.
Under Hourston, Boots the Chemists became a pioneer of retail systems and
one of the biggest users of electronic point-of-sale technology in Europe.
These moves helped BTC reduce stockholding and operating costs. They also
increased flexibility, allowing it to respond almost instantly to price
initiatives by competitors, simply by reprogramming its computer, rather
than having sales assistants alter prices by hand. Till sales information
allows BTC to determine the profit contribution of all products and stop or
reduce unprofitable lines - one famous example being pet food.
Mistakes were made - Boots sometimes overlooked the fact that an
unprofitable product might nevertheless be attracting shoppers to the store.
But the final result was a more focused range, with the positioning and
shelf space of each product in each store controlled by a computer system
called Spaceman.
Another important strategy has been the development of the Boots brand.
Own-label products are important as they cost retailers less than
proprietary brands, and so carry a bigger profit margin or the same cash
profit at a lower price. Own-label products now account for 43 per cent of
BTC's sales - one-third of them made by Boots Contract Manufacturing.
George Charters, director of merchandise and marketing, divides own-label
into three categories:
Basic products, such as shampoo, which compete with rivals' own-label
products.
Brand competitors, such as the shampoo-and-conditioner Duo, designed to
compete with proprietary brands, but at prices 5 to 10 per cent cheaper.
Value-added products, such as the global and natural collections, which
compete with rival retailer Body Shop.
Charters says the third area, which has the highest margin, is the fastest
growing. That means operating margins, which have more than doubled from 5
per cent in 1985 to 11.5 per cent last year, should still have room for
growth.
There is also scope for physical growth. BTC has identified 240 potential
sites for more small stores, and it has a pilot programme of opening shops
within superstores operated by J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery
retailer.
The hope now is that Boots the Chemists' retailing skills can be passed to
the group's less successful retail chains - Halfords, Children's World,
Fads, and Do It All.
A longer-term aspiration is that countries such as France, perhaps under
pressure from the European Commission, might relax restrictions on companies
holding multiple pharmacy licences, allowing Boots the Chemists to take its
business overseas.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Cooking up deals in a motorway cafe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next time you find yourself having a cup of coffee and a stale Danish pastry
in a motorway service station, look around you. What are those men with
briefcases doing at the next table? Are they travelling salesmen comparing
double glazing brochures? Or are they tycoons stitching together a secret
deal?
Forget the Savoy Grill: big business these days is done in motorway cafes.
This information comes to me from a senior partner at one of the biggest
accountancy firms, who spends half his life travelling from a Welcome Break
on the M25 to a Happy Eater off the M1.
If you want to be discreet, smart restaurants are out, as are the offices of
the other party and their advisers. To meet in any of these places would be
tantamount to issuing a press release. The service station is the ideal
solution: handy yet anonymous. Everyone else is too intent on bolting their
snack and getting back on the road to wonder what fellow travellers are up
to.
Alternatively, you could meet in the middle of a field where the likelihood
of running into journalists or business acquaintances is even lower. But you
might look conspicuous there, and you couldn't get a cup of coffee - not
even a bad one.
We all know about downsizing, rightsizing, rationalising and other
euphemisms for firing people. Yet until last week I had not come across
'involuntary separation'. Nor had the 1,200 Du Pont employees who on
Thursday were bounced into this process by their employer.
There is no acceptable way of telling people that they have been sacked, but
companies nevertheless continue to search for the perfect, painless phrase.
According to consultancy Drake Deam Morin, there are more than 50 cliches in
common use among managers giving their workers the chop.
They talk of 'careers that have plateaued', of 'decruitment', 'deselection'
and 'displacement'. They speak of 'exiting the organisation', of the
'opportunity to look elsewhere', of 'releasing people', of 'retrenchment',
of employees being 'surplus to requirements'. They say: 'your future lies
elsewhere' or 'we are re-engineering'.
The aim is to place the moral responsibility somewhere other than on the
employer. Du Pont's 'involuntary separation' is particularly blatant, and
well it might be. The company has its motto - Part of Our Lives - to live up
to.
I had a leisurely time last week, having picked up the extra second on
Friday courtesy of the Central Bureau of the International Earth Rotation
Service. Now that I have acquired the taste for additional time, I long for
a whole extra hour - which would bring Britain into line with the rest of
Europe. It is bad enough trying to get hold of anyone in this country during
the business day - they are permanently in a meeting, out at lunch, or
travelling from one motorway service station to another.
But pinning down anyone on the Continent is more or less impossible. There
are only four hours - between 9 and 11 in the morning and 2 and 4 in the
afternoon - when there is any point in even trying. The rest of the time
either side is at lunch or in transit somewhere.
Technology buffs would have you believe that in the age of the virtual
company people can be reached 24 hours a day, so time zones don't matter. As
someone who has just bought an answering machine, I have found out this is
nonsense. The beauty of technology is that when properly used it makes you
less, rather than more, available.
On my interminable journey into work on Wednesday I read the Financial Times
Annual Report Service, trying to guess what business each company was in
from the pictures on their annual reports.
I could just see the link between autumn leaves and the French funeral
service company, OGF/PFG. But what has the smiling black man in a jungle
wearing a sheet over his shoulder got to do with Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian
oil and metals group? Why have Credit Suisse and Telus Corporation both
chosen pictures of rowers for their annual reports? Why does Scor, the
French reinsurance company, have a child's drawing of tents and elephants on
the cover, or Sema, the information technology company, have a botanical
drawing of a bud?
If you strain, you can make the connection between rowing and team work, or
buds and growth. But why should investors have to strain? When it comes to
annual reports we are not talking about metaphors, but about hard facts.
My favourite reports have a clear picture of the product on the cover, or
failing that, the company's name and the date. This information should also
be down the spine, and the format should not change from year to year. You
would have thought this was too obvious to be worth saying. But ICI has
chosen a different style every year for the last five, each worse than the
last. Last year it just said 'annual report' on the spine. This year,
nothing at all.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Julia Cleverdon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 44-year-old chief executive of Business in the Community, the charity
which under the presidency of the Prince of Wales seeks to involve companies
more closely in the community, would not enjoy a lonely sojourn on a desert
island. Renowned for her organisational skills and strong sense of purpose,
she has too much to do to sunbathe on a beach.
How would you keep yourself occupied?
'It would be a very great strain. I would probably turn to gardening,
getting vegetables into straight rows. I would need to have some feeling of
achievement - I could not go to bed and sleep well after a day just lounging
on the beach.'
How would you cope with loneliness?
'I would say my prayers and reflect on my family and comfort myself with a
marvellous range of memories about them and my friends.'
What additional item would you need for your beachside office beside a fax
and a telephone?
'I can have a fax and a telephone? Well, that changes things. I would try to
be in touch with people who are doing things. I would be ringing up the
entrepreneurs who have come through our Community Enterprise awards, asking
them how they were making a difference to their local communities. An
additional item you say? I would have a dictaphone to try out my speeches
because I normally never have time to plan them.'
If you could take one person who would that be?
'My husband, John Garnett. The other person I would like to take would be my
grandfather, James Windsor Lewis, a vicar of Aberdare in South Wales in the
1930s. I never met him but my mother says I am very like him, not least in
the way we arrange our finances. He was a great taker-up of causes. I would
love to talk to him.'
One luxury?
'Photographs spanning the years of all the family and my children, Charity
and Victoria.'
One film?
'Four Weddings and a Funeral. I roared with laughter, after having had a
former marriage myself.'
One book?
'Trollope, Anthony rather than Joanna. Can I take the whole of his
Barchester Chronicles? I adore the politics and the factions. They mirror
the world that Business in the Community has to tread through. Life does not
change.'
Some music?
'Stirring Mozart operas, I think. I listen to one a week on my exercise bike
which I use every morning.'
How would you like to be remembered if you were unable to get off the
island?
'As somebody who tried to invest in people. One of the most important
leadership roles is to grow people. It is very much like gardening. You tend
them and apply fertiliser. But sometimes you have to prune to make them grow
stronger.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / Fund managers warned on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The profitability of the UK fund-management industry reached a six-year peak
last year because of buoyant markets, but the industry's costs are also
rising far faster than they should, a survey by Price Waterhouse concludes.
In its sixth annual review of the fund-management industry the accountancy
and management consultancy group says that pre-tax profits as a proportion
of total revenues rose to 28.8 per cent last year, up from 18.1 per cent in
1992. None of the 41 organisations in the survey reported a pre-tax
operating loss last year, compared with a third in 1992.
The study found that costs rose on average by 4 per cent more than was
needed to accommodate expenses associated with the rise in assets under
management.
The report concludes: 'While other industries have achieved productivity
improvements over the last five years, it appears that the investment
mangement industry has had a negative productivity improvement.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / Buses offer route for news dispute: Raymond Snoddy on why
media moguls should heed precedents set in the public transport field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, and Mr Conrad Black,
chairman of the Telegraph group, should be urgently looking into the
economics of bus operation  - and in particular route 242 in Bognor Regis.
As the two newspaper proprietors glower across the battlelines of a weekday
Times at 20p and a Daily Telegraph at 30p, and the Office of Fair Trading
starts inquiries on price-cutting, bus wars offer precedents.
Last year the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that Southdown Motor
Services had acted anti-competitively and against the public interest by in
effect forcing the withdrawal of Easy Rider Minicoaches on route 242.
The OFT's main precedent on predatory behaviour also has wheels  - a
decision that Fife Scottish Omnibuses had tried to remove a competitor.
How far findings from the bus industry apply to alleged predatory pricing of
national newspapers is still uncertain. They do suggest, however, that both
the OFT and the commission, with the agreement of the trade and industry
secretary, have the power to intervene directly to change newspaper price
structures if they find breaches of competition and fair-trading
legislation.
Proving predatory pricing and attempts to drive rivals out of business are
never easy. A commission official said: 'It's like the difference between
murder and manslaughter. To establish murder you have to prove intent and
intent at the time the murder was committed.'
The Independent believes there is clear evidence of 'murder' rather than
'manslaughter'  - that Mr Murdoch's News International subsidiary is
indulging in predatory pricing with the intent of trying to drive it out of
business. The Independent argues that at 20p Mr Murdoch will lose more money
for every extra copy of The Times he sells unless there is a large rise in
advertising revenue. It believes that there is no evidence of any such rise.
Last year the OFT found that selling The Times at 30p did not represent
predatory pricing. This time the OFT has two main options if it finds a full
investigation is needed.
It can carry out its own investigation under the Competition Act 1980 on any
business activity which has, or is likely to have, the effect of
'restricting, distorting or preventing competition in connection with the
production, supply or acquisition of goods'.
A formal investigation might take up to six months and Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, could seek undertakings that could lead to
a newspaper's cover price rising. If the undertaking were not accepted or
not implemented correctly, Sir Bryan could call in the commission, which can
take a year to complete an investigation.
The other route would be for Sir Bryan to use the Fair Trading Act 1973 to
make a reference to the commission if he considers a monopoly exists  -
although any remedial action is in the hands of the trade and industry
secretary.
The Daily Telegraph, which sees itself as fellow victim with The Independent
rather than potential predator, believes that although an investigation
under the Competition Act might be both neater and relatively faster, a
commission inquiry might make more sense.
Telegraph executives have been advised that the commission could look at the
broader issues of public interest and cross-ownership and how one part of a
media empire can cross-subsidise another.
When looking at the route 242 precedent The Independent will see that the
remedy for Easy Rider Minicoaches came after its forced withdrawal.
For that reason The Independent is considering going to the European
Commission. European investigations can make the monopolies commission look
positively speedy  - but the complainant can seek injunctions to stop the
alleged abuse until the issue is settled.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Prescott pledges independent jobs commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, will today promise to set
up an independent commission for full employment if he wins the contest to
succeed John Smith as Labour leader.
The commission, modelled on the Commission for Social Justice, established
by Mr Smith after the 1992 general election, will form the centre-piece of a
personal manifesto setting out Mr Prescott's view of Labour's future.
His manifesto launch will follow a claim yesterday from Mr Tony Blair, the
clear front-runner for the leadership, that the Conservatives were chasing
Labour's agenda on employment and social policies.
Speaking as aides said he was certain of winning, Mr Blair said that the
government was being forced to abandon the individualistic rhetoric of the
1980s in favour of commitments to recreate social cohesions.
The result was that Labour was winning the battle of ideas. 'We are
redefining the new political landscape of Britain, not the Tories,' he said.
Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Blair confirmed that he was looking at ways to
ensure that those on the highest incomes paid a minimum level of income tax.
But he said the details of the proposed squeeze on allowances and avoidance
schemes were still to be worked out.
The commission suggested by Mr Prescott would be chaired by an independent
figure, and would be asked to review the party's existing employment
policies and recommend any changes necessary to end mass unemployment.
The idea is likely to be seen by some activists as a retreat from Mr
Prescott's earlier pledge to set targets for cuts in unemployment during the
first term of a Labour government.
However, Mr Prescott is believed to see the commission as a more practical
commitment than the statements of values offered by Mr Blair and Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the interim leader.
Mr Prescott also believes that his emphasis on full employment has helped to
restore action to end mass unemployment to the top of the agenda for both
main parties.
With Mr Blair now all but certain to secure the leadership the focus of the
campaign during the next two weeks will shift increasingly to the battle
between Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett for the position of deputy.
Mr Prescott will make clear at the launch of his manifesto that he remains
keen to win the deputy's post, which he believes could be transformed from a
largely administrative role into an important focal point for campaigning
and increasing party membership.
A friend said: 'John wants to be leader, and believes he can win, but he
would also be very pleased to win the deputy's job.'
Meanwhile a poll for GMTV, the ITV breakfast television station, tipped Mr
Blair as front-runner for the leadership. Among 600 Labour voters
questioned, Mr Blair scored 43.1 per cent. Mrs Beckett 19.1 per cent and Mr
Prescott 16.5 per cent, while 21.3 per cent were undecided. For the deputy
leadership 31.5 per cent backed Mrs Beckett, 26.7 per cent backed Mr
Prescott and 41.7 per cent were undecided.

Too many civil court cases cost more than the value of the dispute, the Law
Society says today.
Even where legal action would be cost-effective, many people cannot afford
it and are not eligible for legal aid.
The Law Society highlights these as serious problems in the civil justice
system in its submission to Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, who is
reviewing expenditure on civil litigation and legal aid.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Call to build new nuclear plants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's power-generation policy runs the risk of exchanging an
undue dependence on coal for an undue reliance on gas unless new
pressurised-water reactor nuclear plants are built, the cross-party European
Policy Forum warns today.
It says the government must make up its mind whether the security of supply
and environmental benefits make it appropriate for it to provide the support
needed to draw in private finance for a new PWR power station, for example
by underwriting risk insurance.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Group to press for 'lookalike' curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of more than 30 leading brand manufacturers will tomorrow
formalise a campaign group to press for legislation curbing supermarkets'
'lookalike' brands, Neil Buckley writes.
The British Producers and Brand Owners Group, set up earlier this year,
failed to get clauses included in the Trademarks Bill to strengthen
restrictions on lookalikes  - own-label products designed to resemble
well-known brands.
The main aim of the group, which includes Unilever, Mars and Nestle, will be
to persuade the government to introduce legislation.
It may also investigate the possibility of taking action against
supermarkets under European Union law.
Own-label products account for more than 50 per cent of sales by volume in
supermarket chains. Brand manufacturers want legislation to stop
supermarkets not only infringing registered trademarks, but copying the
overall look of branded goods, including the colour and shape of packaging.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Parking duty passes to councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A parking system which removes responsibility for enforcement from the
police and hands it to local authorities comes into effect throughout London
today.
Parking infringements will no longer be treated as criminal offences but
will be dealt with as an administrative issue by the local authorities and,
if necessary, as a civil matter in the county courts.
The system has been introduced in the 33 London boroughs but three-quarters
of local authorities around the country have expressed an interest in
adopting it. The Parking Committee for London said the idea was borrowed
from US cities such as Chicago and Philadelphia, but was its first example
in Europe.
The government believes parking regulations will be enforced more
effectively while a burden is removed from the police. Local authorities can
spend any surplus from fines on improving parking facilities, upgrading
roads or public transport.
Traffic wardens will be replaced by local-authority parking attendants who
will enforce parking laws with the help of hand-held computers. They will
issue penalty-charge notices for Pounds 30, Pounds 40 or Pounds 60.
One feature of the system is that prompt settlement is encouraged by
discounts of 50 per cent if a ticket is paid within 14 days. Under the Road
Traffic Act of 1991 councils also have the power to tow away or clamp
vehicles.
Under the previous rules police in London issued up to 2m parking tickets a
year, but at one stage fewer than half were paid.
Motorists who feel they have been unjustly treated may take their case to an
independent tribunal known as the Parking Appeals Service. Instead of being
summoned to a magistrates court motorists will be able to make an
appointment at a time which suits them.
The 1,500 traffic wardens employed by the police in London will be
redeployed to enforce no-stopping rules on the 'red routes' which are being
introduced to speed traffic throughout London.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Tax rules for Peps attacked by insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The favourable tax treatment of Personal Equity Plans has come under fire
from the Association of British Insurers, which has called on the government
to introduce a tax regime which does not direct savings into particular
investments.
The plea has been made in a private response to the Treasury as part of the
government's review of savings.
The association says tax breaks, if required, should be directed towards
longer-term savings.
It contrasts the tax neutrality towards which the government seemed to be
moving until the mid-1980s as tax breaks were ended, with the policy since
then of creating savings vehicles which can be tax-free.
An individual can invest up to Pounds 9,000 a year in Peps, by putting
Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep.
Sales of Peps are estimated to have reached Pounds 6bn in 1993-94.
According to an ABI analysis the net income which a Pep can generate for
basic and higher-rate taxpayers is greater than that which can come from any
other capital sum, including personal pensions.
It notes that in practice pensions and Peps are not in direct competition in
the savings market, but highlights the advantage which the tax treatment
gives Peps over putting money into equities, unit trusts and life insurance.
The ABI paper makes the case for continuing the favourable tax treatment of
savings through pension schemes.
It says that given public concern about life companies' attitudes to
regulatory standards and about the possible mis-selling of products, there
would appear to be little political attraction for the government in
introducing new tax breaks for life insurance.
However, greater equality between different forms of savings might be
achieved by imposing new limits on the amounts that can be invested tax-free
in Peps and Tessas  - tax-exempt special savings accounts.
Mr Stephen Dorrell and Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury ministers leading the
exercise, have held several meetings with interested parties to seek their
views, but no decisions are likely to be announced until the Budget on
November 29.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Financial malpractice in the workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses could learn from practices developed in the US and reward staff
for highlighting financial malpractice in the workplace, a report says
today, Richard Donkin writes.
The report, by Public Concern at Work, an organisation which advises
workplace 'whistleblowers', says fraud and financial malpractice have been
the most prevalent concerns of employees who have approached it for advice.
The report says: 'Our impression is that the pervading culture in many
organisations in the UK is that staff should mind their own business come
what may.'
It says this is in contrast to developments in the US, where companies have
started to reward staff for minding the company's business. The report cites
Bear Sterns, the New York stockbroker, which gives staff 5 per cent of any
losses they prevent when they report financial malpractice.

FT  04 JUL 94 / City slams 'low-calibre' non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City believes non-executive directors are failing to ensure that high
standards of corporate governance are met, a survey for BDO Binder Hamlyn,
the accountants, shows today.
Institutions suggested that the main reason non-executive directors were not
effective was that they were not of a high enough calibre.
Non-executive directors themselves said that the main inhibitor to their
effectiveness was a dominant chairman or chief executive. Other factors were
their insufficient knowledge of the business and the lack of time they could
spend on directorships.
Mr Clive Reay, a partner in BDO Binder Hamlyn, said yesterday: 'Since many
non-executives admit that they spend too little time on their directorships
and have insufficient underlying knowledge of the business, it is not
surprising that they find a dominant chairman or chief executive a
significant inhibiting factor.'
The survey, by City Research Associates, had more than 400 respondents.
It was generally agreed that the most suitable background for a
non-executive director was a top-level management position in another
company. Less than a quarter of those questioned rated merchant banking,
accountancy or law as suitable backgrounds, while civil service and
governmental backgrounds were regarded as suitable by only one in 10.
Most respondents agreed that the Cadbury code of conduct had made or would
make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of non-executives.
However, non-executives rejected the idea that sanctions should be applied
against directors who failed to comply with the code.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Treasury forecast 'complacent': Ernst &amp; Young Item Club less
optimistic on prospects for inflation and growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury's upbeat forecast for the economy, published last week, is
today described as 'complacent' by a research group, the Ernst &amp; Young Item
Club.
The Item Club, the only private-sector forecaster which uses the Treasury's
economic model, predicts that next year inflation will be higher, and growth
lower, than the Treasury expects.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, said last week that Britain
faced 'quite the best combination of circumstances, pointing to sustained
growth and low inflation' that he could remember for a 'a very, very long
time'.
Item's central forecast is that growth in gross domestic product will fall
to just under 2.5 per cent next year, from 2.8 per cent this year. The
Treasury's forecast for both years is 2.75 per cent.
The club says underlying inflation will rise to 3.4 per cent next year from
2.6 per cent this year. The Treasury's forecast for annual inflation in the
fourth quarter next year is just 2.75 per cent.
The club's summer report says: 'The key risk facing growth prospects in the
UK is a loss of confidence in the private sector. The threat is not so much
the large tax increases but the impact of the steepest three-month rise in
bond yields since earlier this century.' The rise in bond yields signals 'a
substantial deterioration in inflation expectations' according to the
report. 'If the financial markets are right about inflation, as a result of
a commodity price shock or a smaller amount of slack in the economy than
thought, then the economy could be in a problem in the pre-election years of
1996-97.'
The club believes there is still enough slack in the labour market to keep
inflation within the government's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
Nevertheless, the Bank of England will have to respond to signs of
accelerating inflation by increasing base rates from the current 5.25 per
cent to 6.5 per cent.
The Treasury expects consumer spending to grow 3 per cent next year, but the
club says higher bond yields and tax increases will restrict next year's
consumer spending growth to 1.6 per cent.
Slower growth will result in slower tax revenue growth and make it difficult
for Mr Clarke to achieve his public sector borrowing requirement targets and
tax cuts, it says.
The Scottish economy is forecast to lag behind that of the rest of the UK
this year, Scotland's principal economic research body says, James Buxton
writes.
The Fraser of Allander Institute predicts economic growth in Scotland of
2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year, compared with 3 per cent for the UK
as a whole.
It says that although the short-term outlook for the Scottish economy is
generally favourable it will lag behind the rest of the UK because its
manufacturing industry is more dependent on exports.
Scotland, which receives proportionately more from government spending than
England, will suffer disproportionately from spending cuts, as well as from
tax increases, with value added tax on fuel having more effect in Scotland
because of the colder climate.
The institute expects manufacturing output to grow by 3 per cent, with
continued strong growth in the electronics and electrical engineering
sectors.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Politics obstructs line to peace in signals dispute: Robert
Taylor finds RMT and Railtrack share a good deal of common ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The railway signalling dispute reaches a delicate stage today.
This afternoon the executive of the RMT transport union meets to decide what
to do next in an industrial conflict that still seems outwardly a long way
from a settlement. Tomorrow Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, and Mr
Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, will be questioned by the Commons employment
committee on the intricacies of the dispute.
For the past three Wednesdays most of the railway network has been at a
standstill. A further 24-hour strike is scheduled for this Wednesday and
further days of action are likely to be announced by the union executive as
by law seven days' notice is required for strikes. But Mr Knapp and his
executive have some difficult calculations to make.
Until now the signalmen have enjoyed much public sympathy. This is due
partly to Railtrack's inept negotiating, but above all to the late
intervention by the Department of Transport and the Treasury to veto any pay
deal that would be regarded by them to undermine the government's public
sector paybill freeze.
The public's mood also suggests that the signalmen  - described by Mr Horton
as 'sensible and dedicated people'  - are believed to have a fair and
reasonable case. Mr Knapp knows from past experience, however, that this
mood could soon change if the current stoppages persisted through the
summer.
This is why the RMT executive may resist any serious escalation of the
conflict. A possible option might be to shift the 24-hour stoppages from
Wednesday to another day in the week, perhaps Monday or Friday.
The union executive may also decide to continue with the stoppages but to go
straight back to the conciliation service Acas.
Much depends on how the 21 RMT executive members  - only two are from the
signalling grades  - read the current mood of the signalmen. At the weekend
Railtrack's 'hearts and minds' campaign has been aimed at convincing the
signalmen to accept its three-part productivity deal and to put pressure on
the RMT to go back to the negotiating table. But some RMT officials think
this could backfire and antagonise the signalmen.
The union's negotiators, including Mr Knapp, are reluctant, however, to see
a hardening of attitudes if this can be avoided. They want further talks
with Railtrack over the 3 per cent unconsolidated rise in pre-tax earnings
that is now on the negotiating table as part of the company's offer.
RMT officials point out that four weeks ago Railtrack's board agreed to an
immediate 5.7 per cent pay increase. One official said: 'We were on the
verge of a settlement then.' It was the government that put a stop to that
deal.
Railtrack still accepts tacitly that there must be an 'up-front' payment to
bring the signalmen into negotiations on a long-term settlement. Indeed, the
company's management is keen to resume talks with the RMT as soon as
possible. Railtrack said yesterday: 'Our door is open for further
negotiations.'
Both sides share a surprising amount of common ground. They agree that the
signalmen have genuine grievances and these must and can be met through a
self-financing deal. Railtrack and the RMT also accept that some form of
first-stage payment is necessary before bargaining can start on a final
restructuring package.
The union has proposed a joint working party with Railtrack to hammer out
the final deal. It accepts the various stages of any settlement must be
interlinked. An RMT official said last night: 'If the company have the will
and the wit we can settle this.'
Yet even if both sides can find a formula to end the strikes it remains
unclear whether that will be enough to end the signalling staff dispute,
which seems increasingly to be a political and not an industrial relations
problem.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Catholic training body faces closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of Cathedral Employment Enterprise, one of the biggest providers of
employment training in London, are meeting tomorrow to discuss winding up
the organisation, which is run by the Roman Catholic Church.
The group says falling government funding, partly due to a move towards
'payment by results', and restrictive and nonsensical regulations, are
making it impossible for it to operate.
The organisation employs 150 staff in 50 centres across London, running
about 80 courses for 1,400 people.
Cathedral's annual turnover is Pounds 3m. About Pounds 120,000 came from the
Catholic Church last year, out of a total of Pounds 400,000 from external
sources, with the government providing the rest.
Father Hugh Bridge, company secretary, said government funding of some
courses had fallen from more than 95 per cent to 70 per cent, putting
increasing pressure on the Church and other sources to come up with the
money. The Church, however, has refused to increase its contribution, or
Cathedral's borrowing powers.
Mr Bridge said it may be right that employer-run training courses, designed
to equip trainees to work for that employer, should not be totally funded by
the state. But for groups such as Cathedral, which devoted much of their
efforts to teaching basic skills to illiterate and innumerate people, there
was little alternative to public funding.
As an example of 'bureaucracy gone mad', Mr Bridge quoted a project in north
London teaching care-in-the-community skills.
Cathedral had a contract with North West London Training and Enterprise
Council, which disburses money on behalf of the government, to train 60
adults to level one of the National Vocational Qualifications. When able
members passed level two as well, the Tec refused to pay for it as the
contract specified level one only.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Motorists warned over summer smog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commuters are being asked to avoid using cars today because the hot summer
weather has raised air-pollution levels.
The Department of the Environment urges commuters to use public transport or
bicycles, or walk to work to help reduce the level of 'summer smog'  -
caused by high levels of ozone, the largest source of which is motor
vehicles.
The department yesterday forecast that air quality would be poor throughout
England and Wales today. Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to enjoy
cleaner air.
Motorists are being asked to switch off engines if they expect to be
stationary for more than a few minutes, and to avoid over-filling petrol
tanks because spilled petrol evaporates releasing toxic hydrocarbons.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Low inflation will not help wage rises says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher pay rises fuelled by tax increases have not materialised, and the
prospect of continuing low inflation in coming months creates little
likelihood of substantial wage inflation, says the latest report from the
independent pay analysts Industrial Relations Services, David Goodhart
writes.
In spite of some anxiety from government and business leaders about the
recent upward trend in overall earnings, IRS figures show pay settlements at
2.5 per cent in the three months to the end of May. Half of the 153
settlements recorded by IRS in the quarter to the end of May fall between 2
per cent and 3 per cent.
Just over two-fifths of bargaining groups secured higher pay rises than a
year earlier, but a similar proportion agreed lower rises.
A group of insurance staff at the Iron Trades Insurance Group, the UK mutual
insurance company, have rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer and are planning a
one-day strike on Thursday.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Six-year peak for fund management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The profitability of the UK fund-management industry reached a six-year peak
last year because of buoyant markets, but the industry's costs are also
rising far faster than they should, a survey by Price Waterhouse concludes.
In its sixth annual review of the fund-management industry the accountancy
and management consultancy group says that pre-tax profits as a proportion
of total revenues rose to 28.8 per cent last year, up from 18.1 per cent in
1992. None of the 41 organisations in the survey reported a pre-tax
operating loss last year, compared to a third in 1992.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Tractor production increases 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tractor production at the the main UK plants has been running up to 40 per
cent higher than last year to meet stronger demand in Britain, continental
Europe and North America.
New Holland Ford, the largest of the British manufacturers, said production
schedules at its plant in Basildon, Essex, provided for the production of
31,000 tractors this year, 40 per cent more than last year.
Mr Bob Humphrey, marketing manager, said: 'About 30 per cent of the hours
worked in the plant are on overtime.'
Massey Ferguson Tractors, whose Dollars 330m (Pounds 214.5m) takeover by
Agco of Atlanta from Varity Corporation was completed last week, reported
that it would sell 10,500 tractors by the time its Coventry plant closed for
the holidays later this month. In the same period last year it sold 7,500
units.
UK tractor registration figures, published today, are expected to show a 15
per cent downturn last month from May. But tractor registrations for the
first half of the year of more than 8,800 are nearly 10 per cent higher than
at the same time last year.
Mr Aaron Jones, managing director of Massey Ferguson, expects tractor sales
in the UK to be 11 per cent higher this year than last, compared with 8 per
cent in continental Europe and 12 per cent in North America.
Mr Jones was cautious about longer-term sales, however.
The Agriculture Engineers Association noted that UK sales this year were
still likely to be the third worst on record. However, it expects that the
positive balance of trade on agricultural machinery, the bulk of which is
tractors, will grow to about Pounds 350m this year from Pounds 240m last
year.
Tractor demand in the UK, rising from its lowest point in 1992, reflects the
improved confidence of farmers against the background of higher market
prices for arable products and higher support payments under the European
Union's Common Agricultural Policy.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Baked-bean contender launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alistair Grant, group chairman of Safeway, is said to be passionate
about it. He and his colleagues believe it can make a significant
contribution to cutting Britain's food-trade deficit.
The humble baked bean does not normally elicit such excitement but a new,
home-grown variety has captured the imagination of the food industry,
farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture. Such beans are normally imported
from North America.
The public will have its first chance to taste the British contender at the
Royal Show, England's biggest agricultural event, which opens today at
Stoneleigh in Warwickshire.
The appropriately named Albion variety of the navy bean - the raw material
for baked beans in tomato sauce - is being launched by Safeway, which hopes
to use it in its own-label product as part of its policy of import
substitution.
Baked beans were first imported into Britain by the Pittsburgh-based company
HJ Heinz at the turn of the century and sold at Fortnum &amp; Mason as a
delicacy. They became a cheap and popular staple food once Heinz started to
manufacture in the UK in 1928. Britons now consume 900m cans a year, or
about 16 cans per head, with sales totalling Pounds 230m.
To meet this huge demand the UK has to import 85,000 tonnes of navy beans
from the US and Canada at a cost of about Pounds 40m. Recent trials at
Cambridge University have shown that Albion and other new varieties can
survive cold, wet English summers and stand up to comparison with their
North American rivals.
Mr Geoffrey Gent, director of the Processors and Growers Research
Organisation, a group of farmers and food companies sponsoring the trials,
said: 'Last year was a critical testing time for the new generation of
beans. They developed well, maintaining a high level of quality despite a
summer of poor weather.
'We believe there is potential for the UK to compete internationally for
navy bean production.'
The project's supporters are campaigning for financial support from the
European Union under the Common Agricultural Policy.
The value of the basic crop is higher than that of comparable peas and field
beans, but it is uneconomical for farmers to grow because it does not
qualify for subsidies of Pounds 365 a hectare.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Recovery seen in consumer credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer credit recovered from its April fall to show a 1 per cent increase
in May, but lending to business remained sluggish, according to figures
released today by the Finance and Leasing Association.
Total consumer credit in May was Pounds 1.357bn, up from Pounds 1.339bn in
April, but below March's Pounds 1.463bn, before the tax increases came into
effect. Nevertheless, these figures represent a big rise on last year. May's
credit total was 35 per cent higher than the figure recorded in May last
year.
Personal loans, up 21 per cent on the previous month, were mainly
responsible for the increase in May's consumer credit total. Secured loans
rose 5 per cent on the month to Pounds 22m.
The amount lent on store cards fell 5 per cent between April and May, to
Pounds 364m.
There was a slight fall in motor finance to consumers, with lending on new
cars falling 4 per cent between April and May and that on used cars by 1 per
cent.
Mr David Hardisty, association chairman, said: 'After the slowdown in April,
May's figures are back to the kind of increases we were seeing at the end of
1993. Consumers appear to have taken the tax rises in their stride, but we
will need to watch for longer-term trends.'
Lending to business has been much more subdued than lending to consumers.
Business credit fell 3 per cent between April and May and, at Pounds 973m,
May's total was 2 per cent lower than in the same month last year. The
association said it was the lack of 'big ticket' activity that was
depressing lending to business.
Mr Hardisty added: 'We are beginning to see small and medium-sized
businesses investing in plant and machinery, but the larger deals are yet to
materialise.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / OECD set to slam Pergau arms link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government's use of an offer of Pounds 234m worth of aid to
Malaysia to help build the Pergau dam is expected to be criticised by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when it publishes a
long-delayed report tomorrow.
The report is expected to be broadly complimentary about the general conduct
of British aid policy. But it is thought to be critical about the way that
aid was linked to a defence deal in the case of the Pergau dam project.
The OECD's criticisms will come when the political controversy over
Britain's aid programme for the dam is set to re-open.
The Commons foreign affairs committee is due to publish a report into the
Pergau project in a few weeks. It is expected to be critical of decisions
taken by Baroness Thatcher's government in the late 1980s.
Later in the year the High Court will decide whether to issue a judicial
review of the decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to proceed
with the aid deal in 1991. If the High Court issued a review it could order
a halt to the bulk of the Pounds 234m of payments to the Malaysian
government.
The OECD's report is being published by the organisation's development
assistance committee following an annual review of Britain's aid programme
by a team of Finnish and Belgian examiners.
The OECD has been criticised for delaying the report, which was completed in
draft form in March. OECD officials have blamed the delay on production
difficulties.
In discussing Britain's involvement in Malaysia the committee is thought to
have expressed unanimous support for the principle that all aid be subjected
to the full standards of normal assessment and that 'aid quality should
predominate' in decisions by individual member states.
OECD examiners have taken evidence from British officials at the Overseas
Development Administration, which manages Britain's aid programme. Civil
servants objected to the Pergau project on economic grounds but were
overruled by ministers.
The government changed its aid and trade rules last year.
The aid grant offer to Malaysia was the largest ever provided for a single
scheme under the government's aid and trade provision.

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Kantor seeks break for US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No game has received more anticipatory ink and airtime than today's between
Brazil and the US. But the best word comes from Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative and baseball freak, caught with his family at the
Spain-Switzerland game.
He fancied Spain, though not, he insisted, because Swiss markets are
insufficiently open.
When Brazil declared independence early last century, the first country to
afford recognition was the US. Is it not time, Kantor wonders, for Brazil to
acknowledge that favour, especially since it is playing the US national team
on the 218th anniversary of US independence?

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Shock follows Escobar murder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombian police reported the arrest of two suspects and said two others
were being sought in the murder of national team player Andres Escobar.
Twenty-seven year-old Escobar, whose own goal in Colombia's game against the
US led to his team's 2-1 upset defeat and contributed to their elimination
from the tournament, was shot 12 times on Saturday as he left a bar in
Medellin, Colombia's third-largest city.
President Cesar Gaviria told mourners yesterday at the player's funeral,
that he was the victim of 'absurd violence' afflicting Colombia.
Fifa said in a statement that it was 'profoundly horrified and dismayed' by
the slaying, while Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi summed up the shock that
reverberated around the soccer community. 'The unjustified death of a young
player means that soccer is not only and no longer a sporting event, but
something whose importance goes beyond our beliefs.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Effective wins for Germany and Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The natural order of western European soccer re-asserted itself when Germany
and Spain disposed of Belgium and Switzerland on Saturday with no more than
a modicum of fuss. Germany beat Belgium 3-2 and Spain beat Switzerland 3-0.
The German result in an unseasonably cool Chicago was also closer than the
balance of play warranted. Albert's 90th-minute goal set up a frantic
finish, with Preud'homme, the admirable Belgian 'keeper, up in the German
penalty area and almost geting his head to an injury-time cross.
Belgian appeals for a second-half penalty after Weber had been brought down
were waved away.
Klinsmann, maintaining his goal-a-game pace, and Voller were too quick and
co-ordinated for the Belgian defence.

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Romania defeat Argentina in thriller; meet
Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romania will meet Sweden in the World Cup quarter-final after an inspired
performance last night to beat Argentina 3-2 in one of the most exciting
games of the tournament so far.
The appearance of banned superstar Diego Maradona in the press box as a TV
commentator could not inspire his teammates to break down a determined
Romanian defence that defended against tremendous pressure for most of the
second half.
A double strike from Ilie Dumitrescu set up the Romania victory, the first
three goals of the game coming in a seven-minute burst early in the match.
Romania went ahead in the 11th minute through a curling free kick by
Dumitrescu but Argentina equalised five minutes later when Gabriel Batistuta
scored from a dubious penalty.
Two minutes later Romania were back in front after skipper Gheorghe Hagi
split the defence for Dumitrescu to score his second.
Hagi put Romania 3-1 ahead with a rising drive in the 58th minute but his
team had to survive intense second-half Argentine pressure during which Abel
Balbo pulled a goal back in the 75th minute.
In Dallas, Sweden was able to force Saudi Arabia into a change of tactics,
conquer the 38'C heat and advance to the World Cup quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory.
Kennet Andersson scored twice and set up another for Martin Dahlin Sunday to
take Sweden into the last eight for the first time since 1958  - when they
went all the way to the final.

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Scoring is Ireland's problem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland are expected to stick to 4-5-1 against Holland, using one striker
supported by five mid-fielders. Manager Jack Charlton can use first-choice
full-backs Dennis Irwin and Terry Phelan, suspended for the 0-0 draw against
Norway.
But Ireland's problem is not defence. They are having trouble scoring. They
scored only twice in three first-round games, though the manager says his
team had to play in the toughest group.
'We have fully justified our presence here by qualifying (for the second
round),' Charlton said. 'It's still a difficult situation for us, but I said
from the beginning that if we got there we would be dangerous since the
pressure would be off.
'We'll see what happens next but we've already got a solid sense of
achievement.' The Irish have a fully-fit squad. 'We've now gone to the
second phase of two World Cups and we would like to go a bit further,' added
the manager.

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Total football a matter of faith for Holland
 -Simon Kuper in Boston finds that Dutch squabbles could undermine their
natural ability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch blame the heat. Soccer players boil at 47'C, and Holland's
second-round game today against Ireland is their third in sticky Orlando,
Florida.
Naturally, there is more to the Dutch decline than Florida's heat. Go back
six weeks to the European Cup final between Barcelona and AC Milan. Barca,
led by Dutchman Johan Cruyff, play pretty total football, and Cruyff spent
the days before the match knocking Milan - 'a team with only runners and
defenders.' It would be better for football if Barcelona won, he decreed.
Milan won 4-0, and in Orlando Cruyff's spirit lives on. The Dutch play
pretty soccer, and they think they deserve to win. So far they have been
lucky to beat little Saudi Arabia and Morocco - 2-1 each time - and they
lost 1-0 to Belgium.
The German press applauds any victory, but Dutch papers demand beautiful
football, and players are spending hours after every match lecturing
journalists on the weather. Lex Muller of the Algemeen Dagblad spoke for
many when he called the Orlando side 'a too gentle team of ideal
sons-in-law.'
Holland's winners are back home in Europe. Ruud Gullit, whatever the myth,
is no laid-back Rastafarian reggae-lover. He is a fierce competitor who
walked out of the Dutch training camp three weeks before the World Cup
because he thought that playing with four forwards was 'suicidal', and
because he secretly dreaded a seat on the bench. Marco van Basten is
chronically injured.
Cruyff, who loves winning, is absent thanks to the saddest row of all. It
was agreed two years ago that he would lead the Dutch to the World Cup. With
him in charge, Holland might have had a shot at the trophy.
Last December the time came to negotiate, and everything fell through.
Cruyff asked for too much money (no great turn-up for the books, that);
Lotto, kit sponsors of the Dutch team, took fright at his plans to promote
Cruyff Sportswear at the tournament (another old story); the chairman of the
Dutch FA pushed Cruyff to sign the contract in a week that Barcelona had
three matches; and, when a final fax from the chairman came through at Casa
Cruyff, the print was illegible.
So Dick Advocaat, a gritty 1970s midfielder, is managing Holland, and the
players are uninspired. English players always try hard, but Dutch ones are
different.
The Dutch squabble, a pastime that cost them the last World Cup and could
cost them this one, too. It is a tradition inspired by two men: John Calvin,
who taught the faithful to ignore priests and read the Bible for themselves,
and Johan Cruyff, who taught them that a good scrap motivates people.
Thanks to these two, a Dutch player believes that he is quite as likely as
his manager to have the Truth. Hence Gullit thought he had a right to tell
Advocaat how to play, while this week the players have been lobbying their
coach to play an extra defender. Authority figures have a hard time in
Holland.
This team lacks leaders - figures who will remind the rest that this is a
World Cup, who will chase opponents after 80 minutes in the heat, who call
for the ball when nothing seems to be working.
Ronald Koeman, the Dutch captain, lacks the cosmopolitan charisma of Gullit
or Cruyff, and has the job for want of an alternative. At 33, Jan Wouters
spends most of his time soliciting yellow cards, while Dennis Bergkamp,
though already 25 and the best player in the team, is still a shy boy.
Frank Rijkaard, the other great player in the side, has never wanted to
lead. If it were up to him, footballers would get as much publicity as
accountants or bricklayers, and though he is more gifted than Gullit, he
always played in Gullit's shadow.
Dick Advocaat dropped Rijkaard for the game against Morocco - just as Italy
took off Roberto Baggio when the going got tough - and after the match a
sedate Rijkaard explained to the press that 'not everyone can play at the
same time.' Had Gullit been left out, he would have flown home.
In the 1970s there were two Dutch clubs worth mentioning, Ajax and
Feyenoord. Ajax players were ballet dancer types who invented total
football, while Feyenoord players looked as though they had been dug out of
the ground.
Now there is only one serious club, Ajax, where nine of the players who
started against Morocco spent their formative years. The Dutch have no men
with beards anymore, and it shows.
Their playing style is holier-than-thou. Though they are now down from four
forwards to three, they use four mid-fielders, and the trio at the back
includes two creative players in Koeman and Frank de Boer. (A 100-metre dash
between them would be enlightening, but would take ages to complete).
Advocaat, who used to be a defensive coach, is now refusing to play a fourth
defender against Ireland. He points out that the Irish play with only one
striker. That is true, but their mid-fielders will come down the wings.
Ireland against Holland is chalk against cheese, and everyone knows what
happens to cheese at 47'C.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Healthcare battle for Congress this week
</HEADLINE>

   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political battle over US healthcare will move to the floor of the House
and Senate after this week's congressional recess following the completion
of committee work on the legislation.
The Senate finance committee approved on Saturday a version of the bill
which drops a key component of the reform envisaged by President Bill
Clinton - the employer mandate, under which companies would pay the bulk of
their workers' insurance costs.
The finance committee's version would rely instead on a mix of tax
incentives, insurance reform and subsidies for the poor to try to expand
health insurance coverage. The bill falls short of Mr Clinton's aim of
universal coverage.
In an indication of other struggles to come, the committee adopted an
amendment that would allow employers to exclude abortion coverage from any
health insurance they may buy their workers. Thirty-six Democratic
congressmen have written to Mr Thomas Foley, the House Speaker, saying they
cannot support legislation that does not exclude abortion.
Four of the five committees with jurisdiction over healthcare have now
completed their versions of the bill. The fifth, the House energy committee,
has given up the struggle after failing to reach consensus.
Three versions of the reform reported out of committee bear close
similarities to the Clinton plan. However, the Senate finance committee is
considered to reflect closely sentiment within the Senate itself, and some
House members may also look to it for a lead.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Airlines press Clinton on 'open skies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is coming under pressure from a growing number of US
carriers to revive negotiations with the UK on liberalising airline services
between the two countries.
Mr Ron Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines, the third largest US carrier, is
the latest US airline chief executive to have written to Mr Clinton asking
him to intervene to break the deadlock.
Mr Allen asked the US authorities to approve his airline's recent commercial
partnership with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways to give it
access to London's Heathrow airport.
Under the current air service agreement between the two countries only two
US carriers - United and American - can serve Heathrow, the world's biggest
international airport. But the marketing and ticket code-sharing partnership
with Virgin would open the door for Delta into Heathrow.
Mr Allen's letter follows a similar initiative last week by the heads of six
other US airlines, including United, the largest US carrier, who all wrote
to Mr Clinton urging him to take action to revive 'open skies' talks with
the UK.
These initiatives reflect frustration among many US carriers at the refusal
by the Department of Transportation to consider reviving talks with the UK
after walking away from negotiations last year.
The DOT appears to have sided so far with the position of American Airlines,
the second largest US carrier, which has argued that the US should renounce
its air agreement with the UK unless Heathrow was immediately opened to all
US carriers.
Instead, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, who has also become
increasingly frustrated by the DOT's attitude, has proposed a gradual
process of liberalisation over three phases eventually leading to total
'open skies'.
Mr Allen argued in his letter that approval of the Delta-Virgin partnership
would inject more competition on transatlantic routes and 'underscore the
desire of both our governments to move towards serious liberalisation'.
Mr MacGregor has already given his approval to the Delta-Virgin partnership.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Reich seeks action on labour standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Multilateral development loans and grants should be used as carrots and
sticks to encourage developing nations to improve their labour standards as
their economies grow, Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, has urged.
All countries should be held to certain minimal labour standards, Mr Reich
told a House banking subcommittee that oversees international development
and trade. States employing slave, prison or child labour, and denying
workers the right to organise and bargain collectively, were 'outside the
community of civilised nations', he said.
Beyond these fundamental standards, said Mr Reich, the US should be
cautious, realistic and pragmatic in its expectations of developing nations'
labour practices.
'The international community clearly cannot attempt to dictate levels of
working hours, minimum wages, benefits or health and safety standards
uniformly matching those of the US and other industrialised nations,' he
said. 'While it is neither fair nor realistic to insist that labour
standards within developing countries must be identical to those in richer
countries, it is appropriate to expect labour standards to improve as
economies develop.'
In addition to core labour standards, Mr Reich recommended a two-part test
to evaluate how developing nations should be ranked for multinational aid -
the existence of democratic institutions and evidence of improving trends in
labour conditions.
'The less democratic the country, the greater the grounds for suspicion or
concern that labour standards are being suppressed in order to serve narrow
commercial interests or in a misguided mercantilist impulse on the part of
the elites,' Mr Reich said.
Mr Reich's statements come at a time of growing debate in Congress and
across the country about whether the US should pass legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He warned that the debate over international labour standards should move
beyond simple free trade versus protectionism arguments. But the labour
secretary was attacked from both the right and left on just such grounds.
'I would hope that we don't tie some conditions to what a country has to
have before we can trade with them,' Mr Alfred McCandless, a California
republican and free-trader, said. 'We do not seem to take this attitude or
approach with the people we give foreign aid to.'
Mr Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, berated Mr Reich for having an
'academic' attitude to US jobs.
Mr Reich repeated his view that in an increasingly global economy,
government should stop thinking of companies as 'American' or 'foreign' and
develop a new patriotism based on its citizens, not its products.

FT  04 JUL 94 / International Press Review: Reshuffle fails to convince -
United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The White House did its utmost to put a favourable spin on last week's
reshuffle in its ranks, but the US media resolutely refused to be spun,
remaining sceptical of many aspects of the shake-up.
The oft-repeated official line that the changes were just the kind of
routine tinkering that any organisation goes through found few takers.
'No explanation has been given for the changes,' wrote Mary McGrory in The
Washington Post. 'To hear everyone speak at the graduation ceremonies in the
Oval Office Monday, everyone has done a spectacular job, things had never
been bad, they just could be better.'
The grumbling, she said, was all behind the scenes.
There was praise for the key players in the game of musical chairs  - Mr
Leon Panetta, who switched from heading the Office of Management and Budget
to become White House Chief of Staff, Ms Alice Rivlin, who stepped into Mr
Panetta's shoes, and spinmaster Mr David Gergen, who went from an advisory
role at the White House to one at the State Department.
But one common theme was: Good people, pity about their boss.
Giving the top White House job to a Washington insider like Mr Panetta would
help at a time when Mr Clinton's foreign policy was under attack, healthcare
reform was mired in Congress, and the president's poll ratings were falling,
suggested David Lauter at the Los Angeles Times. 'But because Clinton's
problems go far beyond his sometimes disorganised staff structure  - and
stem in large measure from his own lack of decision-making discipline  - the
help may be limited,' he wrote.
The New York Daily News was more succinct. 'If Clinton wants real change,
he'll read the riot act to the man in the mirror,' it said.
Mr Gergen too was praised at the expense of his boss. However, Doyle McManus
writing in the Los Angeles Times thought Mr Gergen's star had been waning,
and White House staffers must have been relieved to get rid of the
Republican in their midst ahead of November's mid-term elections.
The Post welcomed Ms Rivlin's step up from deputy at OMB and thought her
nomination 'virtually certain to sail through Congress'. She had 'earned a
reputation as the administration's fiercest deficit hawk', it said. The Los
Angeles Times could not resist reminding readers of her Capitol Hill
nickname  - Tiny Alice.
The only apparent loser in the reshuffle was Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, Mr
Clinton's childhood friend, who was eased aside by Mr Panetta but will
remain in the White House as a senior counsellor.
Mr McLarty was widely reported as a nice guy who just lacked sufficient
Washington experience to head the White House staff. But there was no
sympathy from New York Times columnist William Safire. 'Mack McLarty, who
went to kindergarten with Clinton, is taking their old sandbox into the Oval
Office's bunker of broken dreams.'
However, a Washington Post editorial thought that in switching from an
executive to an advisory role, Mr McLarty might even find himself wielding
more power than before. It pointed out that Mr George Stephanopoulos, former
White House communications chief, was 'reassigned from an executive function
to a counsellor's role' last year and is now more influential than ever.
Mr McLarty is nothing if not loyal. Only hours after the shake-up
announcement, which sounded at times like his funeral, up he popped on CNN's
Larry King Live show, flanked by Mr Panetta, saying what a great idea it all
was.
Mack the Nice and Neon Panetta, as King dubbed them, then seemed to appear
on every talkshow or news programme that would have them, or that was not
dominated by blanket coverage of the OJ Simpson case.
No news out of Washington last week could compete for air time with the
drama in Los Angles as one of the nation's most prominent sporting heroes
faced a televised preliminary trial hearing accused of murder.
Elsewhere there was much debate over whether more high-level reshuffling was
to come, particularly in the foreign policy area, where rumours of change
have been rife for weeks.
The Wall Street Journal, in a lengthy memo to Panetta, urged change at the
top of the foreign policy machine, reserving some harsh words for the
Secretary of State: 'Everyone in this town (Washington) thinks that Warren
Christopher is a lame duck.'
For The Washington Post's In the Loop column, Mr Christopher was not so much
a lame duck as a bald eagle  - the comeback of which from the verge of
extinction was much celebrated in the US last week. But only a big
administration victory on Bosnia, Haiti or especially Korea could remove Mr
Christopher and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, from the
endangered species list, it warned, and even that might be temporary.

Cambodia's coalition government announced yesterday that it had foiled an
attempted coup d'etat over the weekend, placing a former interior minister
under house arrest and expelling one of the sons of King Norodom Sihanouk
for plotting the government's overthrow, Victor Mallet, South East Asia
Correspondent, writes.
The attempted coup appears to have been stopped in its early stages without
death or injury, but it demonstrates the fragility of Cambodian democracy a
year after the UN-organised elections.
The authorities detained Mr Sin Song, interior minister under the previous,
communist regime installed by Vietnam, in the early hours of yesterday
morning. They also expelled Prince Chakrapong, a former deputy prime
minister, putting him on a flight to Kuala Lumpur.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Clinton to give private sector a policy role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is planning to give the private sectors of North
and South America an unprecedented role in constructing the policies
governing the economic integration of the two continents.
This will begin with the presentation at the Miami Summit of the Americas in
December of an action plan for liberalising trade and harmonising business
regulations. The plan will be based on a white paper which the
administration has requested from US business organisations and their Latin
American counterparts.
Senior administration officials are currently criss-crossing South America
meeting government ministers to draw up the summit's agenda.
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, who returned at the weekend from a trip
to Brazil, Argentina and Chile, said he had asked ministers to request
participation from their business sectors. He plans to write to the
governments of the other countries involved in the summit to request similar
input.
When President Bill Clinton in March this year announced plans for the first
summit of democratically elected leaders in the Americas, he promised that
labour and non-governmental organisations would have a role in planning the
agenda.
A successful summit, laying out long-term plans for closer integration of
the American economies as a means of shoring up democracies, could provide
some rebuttal to the administration's detractors. Mr Clinton has been widely
criticised for the the absence of a broad vision in post-cold war foreign
policy.
Mr Brown, speaking on his flight back to Washington, said the Miami summit
would be followed next spring by a hemisphere trade and commerce forum
hosted by him and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. This would
be the start of an annual process reviewing the action plan and adopting new
measures to ensure economic growth and integration across the Americas.
While in Chile, Mr Brown reiterated US commitment to work on a free trade
pact with Santiago. Canada and Mexico still had to be consulted on whether
it was to be a bilateral pact or an enlargement of their North American Free
Trade Agreement with the US.
US and Chilean officials have been studying each other's trade regimes in
preparation for talks which must wait until Congress has given the
administration new 'fast track' trade negotiating authority. This was
requested by the White House along with the implementing legislation for the
Uruguay world trade round.
Mr Brown said his trip left him more convinced than ever that change had
really come to Latin America. Chile and Argentina were serving as 'beacons'
of economic liberalisation.
'Even in Brazil you get the impression it's going to happen,' he said.

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Yemen's 190,000 barrel a day oil production has been halted by a south
Yemeni air raid, a north Yemeni oil official said at the weekend. The attack
deprives the Sanaa government of its chief source of hard currency until the
damage is repaired.
Northern forces, meanwhile, kept up artillery and rocket attacks on the
southern city of Aden as the International Committee of the Red Cross warned
that people in the city would soon be dying of thirst unless its shelled
water treatment plant was repaired.
Witnesses and hospital officials said 17 people were killed yesterday in the
shelling of Aden's residential areas, including nine who were digging a well
for water. Up to 23 people were injured.
North Yemeni officials last night said the northern government would let the
ICRC send water trucks to Aden and has promised safe passage to engineers to
repair installations.
Mr Ismail al-Dailami, oil ministry manager at Marib, told Reuters that a
raid by southern jets last week had destroyed two vital water coolers at the
crude oil pumping station feeding the pipeline to Ras Isa, the north's oil
export terminal.
He said that the damage could be repaired 'in a few days'. But it was
unclear if replacements for the two wrecked coolers were available in Yemen
or would have to be flown into the country.
The Marib operation is the mainstay of north Yemen's oil industry, pumping
almost 190,000 b/d of crude. Production is continuing in the south, where
Canadian Occidental is producing up to 160,000 b/d from its Masila field,
but the company has been paying Yemen's share of the oil revenues into a
trust account since the outbreak of civil war in early May.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Arafat's return shatters a dream of home: Many in the
refugee camps believe the Palestinian leader has sold them short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Yassir Arafat made a hero's entry into the Jabalya refugee camp at the
weekend  - the crucible of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against
Israel  - one family stubbornly stayed indoors.
'For us the return of Arafat means the end of hope  - the hope we will ever
get our land back. It is a day of shame,' said Hisham Elakra.
Like many Palestinians the Elakra family sees Mr Arafat's peace accord with
Israel as a betrayal of its dream of returning to the land its fathers lived
on before the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the subsequent creation of the state
of Israel.
The Elakra are not Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the peace agreement on
religious grounds because it does not usher in an Islamic state in all of
the traditional land of Palestine. They are part of the secular Palestinian
opposition to Mr Arafat inside Gaza, the West Bank and the 4m-strong
diaspora who believe that Mr Arafat has sold them short.
Not only has the peace agreement firmly ruled out any prospect of regaining
the 1948 Palestinian lands, but most Palestinians believe it has also
permanently shelved the notion of a return.
When the dust settles and the theatre of Mr Arafat's return passes, the fate
of the fragile peace agreement could be determined by whether he is able to
win over the secular opposition in Gaza-Jericho and in Lebanon, Jordan and
other Arab states. Any failure by Mr Arafat to deliver on promises of jobs
and prosperity and, more important, further gains of land from Israeli
occupation, will fuel the opposition.
The youths of the Elakra family  - Hisham, Bassam and Fayes  - were born and
raised in the dusty and littered streets of Jabalya Camp, home to 72,000
Palestinian refugees. They have never left the densely populated Gaza Strip
but they resolutely refuse to call it home.
They are proud of their refugee identity and have no wish to accept
Palestinian passports or leave the camp unless they are going home.
Home is a place they have not seen, and probably never will. But they
pronounce its Arabic name, Bruier (it is now called Brur Hail in Hebrew)
with pride and passion. It is a place which has become shrouded in myth and
legend, growing ever more sweet with the fading memories of their fathers
and grandfathers who were forced to flee their 300 dunums (about 75 acres)
of farmland as Israeli tanks and soldiers attacked their village in the
early hours of May 12 1948.
Today the Elakra's land, which once boasted grape vines and wheat fields, is
a built-up Israeli kibbutz south of Ashkelon.
The spirit of 1948 beats strong in the hearts of even the youngest in the
family.
'The peace agreement is not peace. It is a surrender of our Arab land and we
must fight against it by all means . . . We have nothing to lose  - no land,
no jobs, no dignity. We will not leave this camp until we go back to our
village,' said Bassam.
Although there is still a slim majority in favour of the peace process in
Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinian refugees like the Elakra family say the
peace agreement would be resoundingly defeated in a referendum held in the
entire Palestinian nation, including the diaspora.
There are no portraits of Mr Arafat or Palestine Liberation Organisation
flags at the Elakra house. Instead, pictures of Che Guevara, Lenin and Dr
George Habash, the Damascus-based leader of the left-wing Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, adorn the small bedrooms. Any mention of Dr
Habash  - or Hakeem (the wise one)  - is greeted with approval.
'We accepted Arafat as our leader  - as the president of Palestine. But he
has accepted to be mayor of Gaza-Jericho. He has sold us out for nothing and
the only way he will be able to rule is by using the secret police like the
Israelis,' said Hisham.
Mr Arafat is gambling that he will be able to win support through massive
investment in housing, jobs and social services. But he is clearly nervous
about the prospect of general elections. He may also have underestimated the
strength of feeling about recovering Arab land that burns so passionately
among the refugees who make up more than 75 per cent of Gaza's 850,000
population, especially those 325,000 still living in camps.
Attachment to land has acquired an almost supernatural importance to the
Palestinian refugees  - an affirmation of their existence with a past they
portray as a paradise.
'Land is stability,' said Bassam. 'If there is no land we will not exist as
a family as a people. We are physically related to our land because the
graves of our family are on that land and our history of our family is on
that land.'
Although many Palestinian refugees know they may not see their land in their
lifetime, they are philosophical about the future, sure that the tide of
history will one day turn in their favour.
'Yassir Arafat is betraying our rights now because we are weak and Israel is
strong,' said Hisham.
'Israel will not always be strong. Turkey and Britain ruled the world and
Palestine for hundreds of years but where are they today? No one thought the
Soviet Union would collapse but it did. One day Israel and the US, which
supports Israel, will collapse and Palestine will be returned to us.
'It does not matter whether I will live to see Palestine, but for sure my
son or my grandson will get the land back.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / Demand for crude tankers set to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil tanker industry is poised for recovery following a slump which has
lasted for most of the past 20 years, according to a review of the tanker
market by Petroleum Economics, a consultancy.
The rates paid to charter tankers increase sharply when surplus capacity
falls to 50m dead weight tons (dwt) and this threshold appears set to be
breached shortly, the review said.
A drop in the rates paid on the spot market in the early 1990s led to a
sharp increase in the number of older vessels being scrapped while fewer new
vessels have been ordered over the past three years. If the Opec oil
producers increase their shipments next winter, demand for tanker capacity
will rise, it forecast.
Oil output from wells outside the Middle East is running close to capacity
so any disruption to those supplies could only be matched by increased
output from the Middle east. Transporting oil on long-haul routes from the
Gulf will increase tanker demand.
The tightening up of environmental legislation in the US, in particular, has
made it less attractive for large oil companies to own their own fleets of
tankers. The amount of company-owned tonnage has fallen from around
one-third in the early 1970s to one-quarter. At the same time low rates in
the spot market have meant the oil companies and other charterers have
increased their activity in the spot market and reduced the number of
long-term charters.
The volume of tonnage on spot charter rose from 10 per cent to 50 per cent
while long-term charters fell from 50 per cent to 20 per cent.
This dependence on the spot market is expected to lead to fierce competition
among charterers for vessels when demand increases. This will push charter
rates up higher than would be the case if there was a greater volume of
long-term charters.
Charter rates for a modern 250,000 dwt 'supertanker' are forecast to rise on
the spot market from Dollars 13,000 a day this year to Dollars 21,000 in
1995 and Dollars 30,000 the following year, the review said.

telephones, approving a set of rules for digital cellular networks, writes
David White in Madrid.
Spain is due to invite bids later this month for a licence to compete with
the national operator Telefonica. Five consortia of Spanish and foreign
companies are set to enter the contest, which is due to be decided by the
end of November. The winner will have to pay an entry fee estimated at up to
Pta100bn (Pounds 487.8m).

FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bank lends less to developing countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank's lending commitments to developing countries in the year to
June fell from Dollars 23.7bn to Dollars 20.8bn (Pounds 13.6bn), the lowest
figure for three years. Disbursements were also down sharply, the bank's
operational results show, falling to Dollars 15.9bn against Dollars 18bn the
year before.
The biggest fall was at the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the bank's main component which lends at close to market terms,
where loan commitments amounted to Dollars 14.2bn against Dollars 16.9bn the
year before. Commitments by the International Development Association, which
lends to the poorest countries at concessional rates, dipped to Dollars
6.6bn from Dollars 6.8bn.
Bank officials attributed the decline in IBRD lending to the increased
availability of private capital to developing countries. This has
contributed to a sharp drop in adjustment lending as countries have not
required the balance of payments support from the bank that has normally
accompanied reform programmes.
More funds have also been available from the regional development banks
following replenishment of their resources, the officials said.
Within the totals, the level of IBRD and IDA lending commitments to Africa
was unchanged at Dollars 2.8bn. The bank said it was extending support for
economic reform and protection of social services targeted at the poor in
francophone Africa, in the wake of the devaluation by the CFA franc zone.
East Asian and Pacific countries saw an increase in commitments to Dollars
6bn from Dollars 4.4bn. The four sectors in the region receiving the most
support were transport, agriculture, power and education, the bank said,
with an emphasis on sustainable development.
Commitments to Latin America fell to Dollars 4.7bn from Dollars 5.8bn as
many counties moved beyond the need for large structural adjustment loans.
South Asia also got less, with commitments dropping to Dollars 2.4bn from
Dollars 3.4bn. The bank noted that India had continued its economic reform
programme and strengthened its foreign exchange programme and no longer
required loans to pay for its imports.
George Graham adds: The Republic of Congo has paid up all of its Dollars
101m in arrears to the World Bank and the IDA. Congo had been more than six
months overdue on its payments to the World Bank since 1991. By clearing its
arrears, Congo becomes eligible for new bank loans.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Gerashchenko wants amnesty to attract investment capital
back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, believes an
amnesty should be prepared to attract Russian flight capital back into
productive investment in the country. The Russian Finance Ministry estimates
that Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn has flowed out of Russia illegally in each of
the last two years, he added.
Mr Gerashchenko, who faced fierce criticism from reformers last year but
survived calls for his removal, said in an interview, 'The Russian 'new
class' understands that opportunities exist for profitable investment in
Russia. But they want certain tax and investment incentives and guarantees
that nobody will enquire too closely into the provenance of the repatriated
funds.'
'I say 'yes' to an amnesty. Why not? What will we obtain through making
unnecessary enquiries which require much difficult work, will not obtain
useful results and will certainly not create a good environment for
investment?'
Mr Gerashchenko, who remains sceptical about the efficacy of monetary policy
in a country with inadequate financial instruments at the command of the
monetary authorities, now acknowledges the importance of positive real
interest rates in attracting savings and underpinning the rouble. 'Six
months ago many citizens were buying foreign currencies to try to preserve
the value of their money. Now they receive positive interest rates from
rouble accounts with the Russian commercial banks and prefer to keep their
funds there.'
Predicting that inflation would drop to between 6.5 and 7 per cent in the
month of June from 8-9 per cent over the first five months of this year, Mr
Gerashchenko said he expected a period of economic stability for the rest of
the summer but some tension in the autumn, traditionally a time of pressure
on government spending and prices.
Expressing scepticism about the government's ability to stick to the tough
budget limits drawn up to conform with IMF performance targets, he said the
main problem was the inability to collect taxes. 'There is a large grey
economy and the government cannot collect taxes in full. That is why the
1994 budget law does not satisfy us much. Parliament continues to impose
spending obligations which we cannot fulfil, although we are hoping to be
able to issue more Treasury bills to raise revenue in the last quarter,' he
said.
Western tax experts have warned the government that if it does impose high
or arbitrary taxes on foreign companies and individuals it risks alienating
foreign investors who are free to chose more favourable tax and
administrative regimes in the extremely competitive investment climate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chad is already having problems meeting the terms of a new standby agreement
signed with the IMF in March and risks suspension at the mid-term review in
September unless it can increase customs receipts, Reuter reports from
N'djamena.
'In reality there is a risk,' said Mr Albert Pahimi, finance minister.
A 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc last January hit the landlocked
central African country hardest of all the franc zone members, economists
say. 'We accepted devaluation at Dakar out of solidarity,' Mr Pahimi said
yesterday. 'In Chad the CFA franc was overvalued by only about 20 per cent.'
Since devaluation, inflation has soared to 54 per cent, according to World
Bank figures.
The country's main export is cotton, and it has to import basic foods and
petroleum products. A key pillar of the standby agreement was an increase in
customs receipts, which Mr Pahimi said were not keeping pace with targets
set by the International Monetary Fund.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Chapter 11-style scheme proposed for insolvent states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the former economic adviser to the Russian government, has
called for a new system for dealing with country insolvency, based on the
Chapter 11 bankruptcy code used in the US.
Speaking at a Centre for Economic Performance symposium at the London School
of Economics, Mr Sachs said the International Monetary Fund had 'become an
institution that has unfortunately become set in ways that made sense in the
1950s but are inappropriate for the 1990s'.
The IMF lacks a conceptual framework for state insolvency, said Mr Sachs,
who has long been an outspoken critic of the IMF.
The Chapter 11 system, by creating a standstill on debtors, gives a critical
breathing period to companies, enabling them to sort out their problems, and
prevents a 'creditor grab race' whereby assets are quickly seized.
'The IMF needs to be moved in the direction of acting as a bankruptcy
referee or judge rather than as a lender in financial distress,' said Mr
Sachs. He thought the mechanisms to achieve a debt standstill could be
achieved under existing treaties, but a new economic conference to establish
such procedures might be needed.
Mr Sachs also criticised the IMF for favouring free-floating currencies,
rather than nominal exchange rate targets and for concentrating on balance
of payments financing needs, rather than on the financial problems of the
indebted governments themselves.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Russians hopeful for G7 summit: Shokhin would like Dollars
2bn in loans. This time, will deeds match words?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is hoping this week's Group of Seven summit in Naples will yield
smaller headlines but larger real support than it has received in the last
two years - when vast sums were pledged at G7 summits but much less
delivered.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy, said on Friday
that Russia might gain access to as much as Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in
extra loans this year - if the summit approved plans for the International
Monetary Fund to allocate some of its own reserve asset known as the special
drawing right (SDR) to developing countries and former Communist 'economies
in transition'.
The IMF board meets in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the SDR question.
But monetary officials in Washington and leading west European capitals were
uncertain whether there would be a consensus for an SDR allocation in time
for the summit.
There is general agreement among G7 countries that present arrangements are
unfair to 37 recent Fund members such as Russia, which have never received
an allocation of SDRs. But it remains unclear whether the IMF's 178 members
can overcome the technical and political complexities holding up an early
provision of SDRs to Russia and other disadvantaged nations.
Such a provision is 'certainly an issue that is going to be discussed, and
we hope positively, in Naples', a senior White House official said.
Mr Shokhin said an SDR allocation would provide non-inflationary support for
the budget and was urgently needed if Russia's political and economic
reforms were to continue. While inflation had fallen further - to 6 per cent
a month in June - production would continue to decline, albeit more slowly
than the 25 per cent rate in the first part of the year, he warned.
He also said Russia still had to construct an economic climate in which
capital would be attracted back to the country from the west.
Progress on inflation, cutting credits and raising interest rates to
strongly positive levels has won praise from the IMF and of the financial
community generally, and opened Russia to big IMF and World Bank loans.
However, huge debts, pressures on the budget and the gradually worsening
political atmosphere make western officials nervous of the future, and
doubtful that a programme to stabilise Russia's economy and currency will be
feasible this year - though that remains the official goal.
But US officials insist that 'on Russia, there is not going to be a pledging
session this year'. They say Dollars 30bn of the Dollars 43bn promised to
Russia at last year's summit is already approved by G7 governments and the
international financial institutions. Of the remaining Dollars 13bn, Dollars
4bn is available when Russia can conclude a standby arrangement with the
IMF, and Dollars 6bn more in a currency stabilisation fund when Russia makes
the rouble convertible.
The SDR question has been on the international agenda for several years. But
discussions so far have yielded no results because G7 members, led by
Germany, have been unable to agree to a general SDR allocation to all IMF
members along the lines of a SDR36bn (Pounds 33.8bn) issue proposed by Mr
Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director.
Until now, a selective 'catch-up' increase has been ruled out because it
would need an amendment to the IMF articles, entailing approval by holders
of 85 per cent the IMF's membership votes and backing from the US Congress.
The Fund is understood to have suggested a blend of general and selective
SDR issues.
Looking ahead to Naples, Mr Shokhin, now the longest-serving Russian
minister and generally seen as a moderate reformer, laid most stress on
Russia's access to the 'political G8' when the G7 admits Russia to talks on
general political issues next Sunday. Russia will remain out of Saturday's
'economic G7', which will discuss world economic problems.
He said that this 'step-by-step approach' was in Russia's interests, though
he forecast that it would become involved in a range of economic issues in
which its voice would demand to be heard. He said the Paris Club of creditor
nations, at which Russia now appears as a debtor, should recognise it also
as a creditor - since it is owed, he said, Dollars 140bn by developing
countries.
Mr Shokhin also made clear that he would push hard for further openings in
markets the Russians still see as closed or only partly open to their goods.
'It's hard to reconcile declarations about partnership with discriminatory
measures towards the Russian economy,' he said, instancing 260
discriminatory regulations against Russian goods in the US alone.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Moves on European pensions directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union, in an effort to break the deadlock over a European
pensions directive, is considering an alternative non-obligatory
'recommendation' urging the liberalisation of pension investment rules in
member states.
Speaking at a seminar on European pension provision, Mr Ron Golby, a
technical adviser to DGXV, the EU division which drafted the pension
directive, said that 'an alternative' could take the form of a
recommendation. The recommendation would be non-binding, although aggrieved
parties could ask the European Court of Justice to enforce compliance. It
would be up to the ECJ to decide whether it wished to enforce the
recommendation.
In June, the EU's Internal Market Council rejected a draft directive aimed
at loosening member states' restrictions on the types of assets and
currencies in which their domestic pension funds could invest. The measure
was intended to grant funded pension schemes the authority to invest in a
mix of assets which would yield the highest returns.
However, several member states which restrict pension investment to the home
country's currency or to its own government bonds, objected.
Meanwhile, a report commissioned by the EU from a group of pensions experts
noted that 'the draft directive has probably helped to reveal and to fuel a
latent conflict of interest between EU member states'. Mr Giovanni Tamburi,
a consultant with actuarial consultants R Watson and one of the authors of
the report, argued that the directive had been far too ambitious to succeed.
Because the style of pension investment has little bearing on competition,
the EU would be wiser to allow each member state to adopt its own investment
philosophy. 'The EU should use the concept of a framework of principles and
let member countries decide the matter between themselves,' the report said.
However, Mr Golby denied that the EU had been too ambitious, although it may
have made some errors. 'With the benefit of hindsight, some issues could
have been handled better.'

FT  04 JUL 94 / Council set to alter voting policy: Public record to make
decisions of EU ministers open to scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Council of Ministers, where European Union member states decide in
secret on EU laws, is set to compile for the first time a central, public
record of how ministers vote.
The policy change is expected to be announced this week in a written
response to a Financial Times request for a record on qualified majority
voting (QMV) by ministers going back to 1989.
According to EU diplomats, the Council letter will contain a final refusal
of the voting record request. But it will state that, from now on, there
will be a formal and open register of how ministers line up to legislate on
behalf of 340m EU citizens.
The refusal to reveal the record of more than 300 laws passed by QMV in
1989-93 was the result of resistance by a German-led coalition of nine
member states, opposed by the Netherlands and Denmark. The UK -
traditionally reticent about open government - in the end brokered a
compromise.
The Council's general secretariat in May turned down the initial request for
information, made under new provisions for public access to EU documents,
claiming it 'does not compile voting records'. A second request forced an
appeal, obliging the Council under the new rules to reply before July 6.
Member states, meeting under the Council's general affairs group on June 17,
withdrew a second rejection of the request when the Netherlands and Denmark
vetoed it and the UK switched sides.
The draft rejection letter contained the assertion that 'the Council is not
in possession of any such statistics' on QMV. The votes are recorded, but in
the minutes of ministerial meetings, which the council refuses to release.
At further meetings of the general affairs group on June 28, and of the 12's
ambassadors to the EU on June 30, the Dutch and Danes called for a full
debate at ministerial level. The British argued that the EU stood to gain in
credibility if the record sought by the FT were compiled and released.
But 'there was nothing approaching a serious yes,' one EU diplomat says, as
the German-led majority, flanked by lawyers, stood fast. 'They live in the
19th century,' another diplomat remarked. 'They said these are the rules
that we have and we have to stick to them.' The Council's legal defence
appears to be that there is no single document recording QMV votes. But
there will be one in future.
The UK, the architect of the compromise, was under pressure from two
questions to the government on QMV in the House of Commons. The first was
answered by Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office minister, on June 27,
saying 'the UK is arguing that the response to the Financial Times should be
as helpful as possible'. But a second, still to be answered, wants a full
account of how the UK voted on all the measures which put in place the EU's
single market.
Participants' accounts of the three Council meetings since June 17 on the
issue make clear that the main underlying fear about going into the past
record on QMV is that ministers could risk being accused of misleading the
public and/or their national parliaments.
The Council reply to the FT now being prepared will make clear that 'the
Council often takes decisions without a formal vote where it is clear that
the required majority exists'.
This consensual formula, used in most QMV decisions, nevertheless enables
ministers to leave meetings declaiming their opposition. But a retroactive
voting record would not substantiate this; only the minutes of meetings
would record ministers' initial positions before decisions went through.
The new policy should therefore bring with it some changes in the habits of
the secretive Council. As one EU diplomat points out, 'the way people vote
often depends on whether they know it's going to be published'.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, will offer more than 20 per cent of
its shares to the public and a further 15 per cent to foreign investors
within the country's second round of privatisations which began at the
weekend.
Lukoil, which produces approximately 50m tonnes of oil a year, 15 per cent
of total Russian crude, from western Siberia is the first large oil company
to offer shares to western investors.
The company has been the main beneficiary of the break-up of the old Rosneft
holding company and has inherited unquantified reserves which it claims to
be among the largest in the world.
In the past six months the company has frozen the price of its products and
lowered production costs by cutting out layers of management and reducing
drilling and repair teams.
It is also investing in a new refinery in association with the Swiss-Swedish
ABB Brown Boveri power engineering company, at Krasnodar, in southern
Russia, near the oil port of Novorossisk. Mr Vagit Alegperov, the company's
president, noted that the distance of existing refineries from the ports
increased transport costs.
The company's strategy is to turn itself into a competitive energy company
with associates in the former Soviet states as well as abroad. It has taken
a 10 per cent share in the BP-led consortium to develop oil reserves off
Azerbaijan - a project which Mr Alegperov said should be ready for Azeri
government approval by September.
However, oil quotas, which should have been lifted on July 1, will stay in
place at least until next January, according to Mr Oleg Davydov, the Russian
trade minister.
He said that the measure was 'untimely' because of the need to ensure fuel
for vital projects such as harvesting.
Energy production in Russia fell sharply in the first six months of the year
 -oil by more than 14 per cent, coal by 10.4 per cent, electricity by 6.5
per cent and gas by 2 per cent, compared with the same period last year. The
Energy Ministry blamed the fall on the debt crisis which has seen energy
companies run up debts of nearly Rbs40,000bn by June 1 as credit was cut or
priced too high for the enterprises to borrow.
The debt crisis is also held responsible for the widespread delays in
payments to oil workers, many of whom have received no wages for up to six
months.
A hunger strike has started by oil workers in Usinsk, in the norther Komi
Republic, because of a backlog of wages to February this year.
Mr Mikhail Shmakov, head of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia, said
that the situation in the oil fields could 'get out of hand' if the wages
backlog were not addressed.

FT  04 JUL 94 / European drug sales stagnate: German pharmaceuticals beat
trend as market recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German pharmaceuticals market, Europe's largest, has rebounded during
the first four months this year following a steep decline in 1993 in the
wake of healthcare reforms.
However, falls in French and Italian sales meant the overall European market
continued to stagnate, according to IMS International, the specialist market
research company.
In dollar terms, the seven largest European markets fell from Dollars 15.4bn
(Pounds 10bn) to Dollars 14.4bn in the four months to April. The seven
countries represent 85 per cent of the west European market.
In the US, the world's largest single national market for prescription
drugs, sales continued to expand, up 6 per cent from Dollars 14.9bn to
Dollars 15.9bn.
The Japanese market, the world's second largest, dropped 3 per cent in local
currency, although it rose in dollar terms from Dollars 6.07bn to Dollars
6.59bn. The effect of an average 6.6 per cent cut in drugs prices introduced
in April aggravated an already weak market.
Sales in Germany increased 5 per cent in D-Marks, up from Dollars 4.17bn to
Dollars 4.144bn. Among the most important therapeutic categories, only
respiratory drugs registered a fall, down 6 per cent to Dollars 438m.
However, German sales remain significantly down on the same period during
1992 when they reached Dollars 4.67bn.
The French market fell 3 per cent in local currency terms, down from Dollars
4.2bn to Dollars 3.875bn. The anti-infective market, which includes
antibiotics and anti-virals, dropped 14 per cent, while sales of respiratory
and musculo-skeletal treatments fell 7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.
Sales in Italian pharmacies fell 9 per cent from Dollars 2.87bn to Dollars
2.44bn, following continued healthcare reform. Sales of central nervous
system drugs fell 14 per cent, while those of respiratory, musculo-skeletal
treatments and blood agents dropped 20 per cent, 14 per cent and 26 per cent
respectively. The UK was the fastest-growing of Europe's biggest drugs
markets, up 7 per cent in sterling, an increase from Dollars 1.6bn to
Dollars 1.7bn. That compares with 11 per cent growth for the first four

<TEXT>
Whenever Sarajevo was bombed by Serb forces, Azra Nuhefendic would run to
the phone to find out whether her sister, trapped in the besieged Bosnian
capital, was safe. From Belgrade her only link with her native city was a
husband and wife team of radio amateurs, Dragan and Liljana Dimitrijevic.
With telephone, post and road connections cut off, the Serbian couple have
sent thousands of messages back and forth from people divided by the
frontlines in Bosnia. For up to 15 hours each day, they would contact their
ham counterparts in Bosnia, who in turn, would establish a radio to
telephone link so that people could speak with each other in spite of the
war.
But, following a ban by the government in Belgrade, the Dimitrijevics, and
up to 150 other ham radio operators, no longer transmit messages from Serbia
or Montenegro which comprise what remains of Yugoslavia.
They are at a loss to pinpoint the reasons behind the ban - speculation
ranges from fears of espionage to outright cruelty. 'The army thinks that
radio amateurs send coded messages. But there are 1,000 other ways if
someone wants to transmit ciphers,' says Mr Dimitrijevic.
His wife is less sanguine. 'I am so angry that people could forbid this
humanitarian act,' she says, adding that, until the ban three months ago,
people from all around the world would ring, anxious for news of their
relatives in Bosnia.
The Bosnian government was the first to ban direct telephone contacts -
insisting that radio amateurs transmitted the messages by themselves rather
than allowing a third party to speak. Amateur radio operators give examples
of the types of messages that they used to send. 'Are you still alive?, What
do you need? Enes is dead' - hardly examples of war-time treachery. Mr Milos
Vasic, an editor of the independent Belgrade weekly Vreme, dismisses any
suspicion that military secrets were transmitted - saying simply, 'the
authorities want to forbid human contact.'
While the Dimitrijevics have not yet managed to collect the ridiculous
number of documents required to re-register their station, they have not had
trouble from the authorities. But a Moslem radio amateur living in the
Serbian capital said that one day, without warning, the police came to his
door and took away his equipment.
Radio operators have helped the outside world find out what was happening in
the mostly Moslem enclaves.
'Many times I spoke with radio amateurs while their towns were under
bombardment,' says Mrs Dimitrijevic. A devotee to her hobby for 38 years,
who met her husband over the radio waves.
But the crackling radio sometimes brought laughs amid the grief. 'One woman
had not seen her husband in two years. Finally we established a telephone
contact - but the voice was so distorted that she insisted that it was not
her husband,' explained Mrs Dimitrijevic. 'When he started to curse she
laughed and said, 'So it really is you'.'

<TEXT>
The Social Democratic party (SPD) was yesterday edging towards a minority
government with the Green party in the eastern German state of
Saxony-Anhalt, a move which will require the tacit support of the Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed East German Communist party.
Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD leader in Saxony-Anhalt, said negotiations were
in progress to clear the way for the formation of a state government.
He had earlier rejected the idea of forming a so-called 'grand coalition'
between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the SPD, the two biggest
parties in the state parliament.
The SPD said it had opted for the so-called red-green coalition, regarded by
many as a risky experiment, to show that it was serious about winning the
general elections in October and would not accept any pacts with the CDU. If
the experiment in Saxony-Anhalt works it could bolster the SPD which is now
trailing the CDU in most opinion polls.
However, the closer ties between the SPD and the PDS will give Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats valuable political ammunition in the
run-up to the October elections, allowing them to cast the SPD as allies of
a party which is regarded by many people in western Germany as unacceptable.
In Bavaria the PDS is ranked alongside the far-right Republicans and both
are under surveillance by the interior ministry.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social
Union, the Bavarian equivalent of the CDU, opened what is likely to be a
barrage of criticism by accusing the SPD of giving a 'helping hand to the
drawing-room Bolsheviks'.
The CDU emerged as the biggest party in the state elections last week with
37 seats in the state parliament.
The SPD has 36 seats, the PDS 21 and the left-wing Greens five.

International mediators convene in Geneva today to put the finishing touches
on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' plan for Bosnia's partition. The plan's
architects - from Russia, the US, the UK, Germany, and France - propose
giving 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new Moslem-Croat federation and the
remainder to the Serbs, who currently control 70 per cent of the war-torn
country. Foreign ministers from the five-nation 'contact group' are due to
meet tomorrow to endorse the maps.
Leaders of the rival factions are also set to discuss the maps which have
already come under criticism.
Bosnian and Croatian foreign ministers, meeting in the Turkish capital
Ankara on Saturday, gave only qualified endorsement to the peace plan.
Bosnia's foreign minister, Mr Irfan Ljubiankic, said his government would
'not be the first to reject the plan', stressing however that the most
important issue was the 'quality of the territory and the guarantees for the
implementation of the plan'.
A joint communique warned that Bosnia and Croatia would reject any peace
plan that failed 'to redress the consequences of acquisitions of territories
through the use of force and ethnic cleansing'. But Mr Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Serb leader, dismissed as 'humiliating' the maps which he said would
prolong the war.
'If the current proposals are not changed, we should finally cancel our
co-operation with this worldwide mafia . . . we should deny them the right
to regulate Serb states,' he said.
Diplomats say the plan represents a 'last chance' for the warring sides to
decide whether they want 'carrots or sticks' from the international
community, united behind the newest maps. Measures could include the lifting
of sanctions on Belgrade, imposed for Bosnia's violent carve-up, or ending
the arms embargo on the Bosnian government.
Sources in Belgrade said that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia was
'taking the peace plan seriously'. He may exert pressure on his Bosnian
proxies in order to win the lifting of UN sanctions.

FT  04 JUL 94 / German post-telecom sale back on course

<TEXT>
The final hurdle blocking the sale of the German postal and
telecommunications service, the country's largest privatisation, was cleared
at the weekend when management and unions agreed a pay and benefits package.
After four weeks of acrimonious negotiations, the agreement allows for the
final passage of legislation approving the privatisation of the postal and
telecommunications service at the beginning of next year. It also marks an
end to a string of nationwide postal strikes which delayed an estimated 70m
letters and packages.
The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) had said it would use its
majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house, to overturn the recent vote to
change the constitution and approve the privatisation unless management and
unions came to an agreement. The package agreed early on Saturday guarantees
the present wage brackets until mid-1996 and also makes provisions that will
bring the status of employees in eastern Germany in line with standards in
western Germany. A negotiating team representing the three companies said
they had gone to the 'limits of what was managerially responsible'.
The state-owned leviathan, which employs 670,000 people, will now be turned
into three joint stock companies on January 1, 1995: Deutsche Telekom,
Postdienst (the postal service) and Postbank, the banking arm.
The postal sale is the centrepiece of a privatisation drive by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat government which recently agreed to reduce
its 51 per cent stake in Lufthansa, the national carrier, and is making
further efforts to reform the railway company, Deutsche Bahn, which became a
state-owned joint stock company at the beginning of the year.
However, the German Postal Union (DPG), a determined opponent of
privatisation since it was first proposed in 1989, had demanded that
management guarantee all employee benefits following privatisation. These
benefits include around 100,000 subsidised apartments, money towards new
shoes for postmen who wear out their soles on postal rounds and the right to
a cold drink in temperatures hotter than 26 degrees Celsius.
Many of these benefits are up for renegotiation in mid-1996 but there are
fears that a series of other agreements between the government and the SPD
may make it difficult for Deutsche Telekom, the first of the three companies
which will be fully privatised, to match the performance of international
competitors.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Shake-up in benefit rules signalled by chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday raised expectations that tougher benefit rules
for the unemployed would be accompanied in his November Budget by improved
incentives for people to take low paid jobs.
His comments point to an extension of family credit and to further changes
in national insurance contributions for those on low incomes to accompany
the replacement of unemployment benefit by a new Jobseekers' allowance.
The new allowance will be payable for six rather than 12 months and will
impose tighter obligations on the unemployed to seek work. But ministers are
aware the new system will only operate effectively if the jobless,
particularly those with children, do not face financial penalties in
accepting work.
Mr Clarke's remarks, which included another strong hint that there would be
no room for tax cuts in the next Budget, follow a recent lecture in which he
argued deregulated labour markets must be combined with a strengthened
welfare state.
Despite objections from the Tory right to any increase in the number of
benefit claimants, the chancellor intends to develop the argument in a
speech next week to the Social Market Foundation. The theme is likely to be
taken up also by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, in a speech
tomorrow to an employment conference organised by the Trades Union Congress.
Mr Hunt will underscore a commitment to full employment, but he will combine
it with a robust attack on Labour and union support for a minimum wage
instead of help for the low paid through benefits.
The chancellor's remarks coincided also with a warning by another
centre-left minister  - Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary  - that the
government must resist the pressure from the Tory right for another burst of
ideological radicalism.
The stance of the three ministers represents a counter-attack against the
right's recent successes in tilting Mr John Major towards Thatcherite
policies.
Speaking on BBC Television's Breakfast with Frost programme, the chancellor
said that the government would introduce tax cuts only when it had restored
firm control of public finances. He would give no guarantee of reductions in
the basic rate of income tax before the next general election. Mr Clarke has
asked officials to provide work on measures to alleviate the poverty and
unemployment traps at the bottom end of the income scale. He said he was
concerned to improve incentives for the unemployed to return to work.
The chancellor has accepted the Treasury orthodoxy that the most effective
way of helping the low-paid is through better in-work benefits rather than
changes in the tax system.
Family credit, paid to top up the incomes of around 450,000 households, is
one of the most successful benefits. But it is restricted to households with
children. The present rules mean also that more than 500,000 people would
face effective tax rates of 70 per cent or more if they returned to
employment.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Pressure on Enterprise chief after failed Lasmo bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, may be
forced to relinquish one of his roles following the failure last week of the
company's hostile bid for Lasmo, its fellow oil exploration group.
The Enterprise Oil board will meet shortly to consider Mr Hearne's position,
but it is unlikely that there will be pressure for him to resign both posts.
However, there has been concern about his dual role since the departure of
Mr John Walmsley, the former finance director, who had been considered a
counter-balancing force on the board.
Mr Hearne telephoned non-executive board members on Friday afternoon just
before the bid failure was publicly announced and later said the board
remained fully supportive of the takeover attempt.
'They saw it as a good opportunity as long as we got it at a sensible
price,' he said.
Many industry observers have expressed surprise that Mr Hearne, one of the
most highly regarded senior executives in the independent oil sector, should
have misread market sentiment so badly.
The Pounds 1.6bn all-paper offer for Lasmo attracted acceptances for only 23
per cent of the shares. Additionally, Enterprise acquired 9.8 per cent of
Lasmo via a Pounds 159m cash raid last Wednesday when its advisers, SG
Warburg and Co, believed that at least 40 per cent of shares would be
tendered in favour of the bid.
Enterprise is now showing a nominal loss of about Pounds 30m on the
investment.
The purchase is now raising questions about how the company and its advisers
could have misjudged investors' intentions.
Privately, some shareholders said that in face-to-face meetings, Enterprise
had appeared arrogant and overbearing.
Also, there were questions about whether it would be able to realise all the
benefits promised by the takeover.
Yesterday, Mr Piers Von Simson, the Warburg director in charge of the bid,
said: 'A large number of things went wrong. Individually each was not enough
to sink the deal but collectively they were.'
He added: 'It was our impression that the institutions would come in.'
Warburg's failing was its inability to communicate its client's message
effectively, he said.
'All along we believed it was an entirely sensible offer,' he added.
Mr Von Simson said that plans to underwrite 'a significant cash alternative'
to the all-paper bid were scuppered by volatile equity markets in mid-June,
making formation of an underwriting group impossible.
Warburg did not underwrite a cash offer on its own because 'in reality
that's not the way the world works'.
Enterprise officials yesterday said Mr Hearne was 'generally happy with the
work of the advisers', in spite of last week's costly error in judgment over
the bid for Lasmo.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Rail union leaders set to call for further negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of RMT, Britain's main rail union, are today likely to call for
a resumption in negotiations to resolve the signalling staff dispute that
has cost Railtrack Pounds 30m in lost revenue through three one-day strikes.
The union's executive of 21 is likely to announce plans for further 24-hour
stoppages after its meeting this afternoon. It will also discuss calls for
an escalation of the dispute through longer stoppages.
Railtrack, the state-owned company in charge of the network's
infrastructure, says the men  - traditionally a moderate group  - want a
settlement and not further stoppages.
But some union officials fear the company's 'hearts and minds' campaign to
convince the signalling staff to accept its three-stage productivity deal
might harden attitudes.
The union's rejection of the deal as it stands may be reinforced by
confirmation tomorrow that British Rail has substantially reduced its
operating deficit to about Pounds 100m for last year, down from an operating
loss of Pounds 167m in the year before.
Both sides made clear last night that they would like to resume negotiations
as soon as possible. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, and Mr Bob
Horton, Railtrack chairman, are to give evidence tomorrow before the House
of Commons employment committee. They are expected to use the opportunity to
emphasise their desire to settle what has turned into an intractable and
complex dispute.
However, further negotiations are likely to come too late to prevent this
Wednesday's 24-hour strike, the fourth in as many weeks.
In spite of outward signs of deadlock, RMT officials and Railtrack hinted
yesterday that the gap between them might not be as unbridgeable as it has
looked for the past four weeks. BR is also expected to report that it spent
an estimated Pounds 100m in the past financial year in preparing for the
privatisation of the railway network, nearly double its previous estimate.
The total cost of privatising the railways is believed to have risen to more
than Pounds 600m.
The dramatic improvement in BR's business performance is mainly due to a 7
per cent cut in railway operating costs.
A union official said yesterday it would have cost Railtrack Pounds 5m to
meet the RMT's 11 per cent interim pay demand for signalling staff. A
spokesman said the RMT wanted negotiations to focus upon possible
improvements to Railtrack's offer.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Berlusconi seeks to control central bank appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has signalled its determination to control key
appointments at the Bank of Italy, bringing into the open a long-simmering
debate over the bank's independence.
The government's position was made public after the central bank's higher
council, the body formally responsible for making the top appointments,
failed to reach agreement last Thursday on a successor to Mr Lamberto Dini,
who stepped down as director-general in May to become treasury minister.
The tough line adopted by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, risks
another institutional confrontation similar to that which occurred last week
over the right to hire and fire the board of the RAI, the state broadcasting
corporation. Mr Berlusconi, owner of the main commercial television
channels, achieved his objective at the RAI after a bruising battle with
Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
Until now the battle over the succession to Mr Dini in the number two
position at the Bank of Italy has been fought behind closed doors. But on
Friday the prime minister's office put out a statement asserting the
government's right to control appointments to the central bank's four-person
directorate.
The statement said: 'The bank's autonomy cannot be confused with the power
to make nominations for senior positions  - a power which in all
industrialised countries (including those central banks regarded as having
the maximum of autonomy like the German Bundesbank and the US Federal
Reserve) is vested in the executive.'
According to a mix of law and tradition, after any directorate appointment
is made by the 13-strong higher council  - composed of the bank's regional
office chairmen  - it must be confirmed by the head of state in conjunction
with the prime minister and the treasury minister. The government can thus
claim to be acting within the margins of its authority.
Although the Bank of Italy has declined to enter the controversy in public,
its officials are concerned that the Dini succession will be equated with
that of the RAI. In particular, Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the deputy
director-general who is technically in line for the job, has been portrayed
by both the populist Northern League and by the neo-fascist MSI as an
unacceptable leftwing economist. Within the bank and among his European
colleagues, he is regarded as one of the best technicians on monetary
issues.
The problem of the succession has been caused in part by the way in which Mr
Dini was deliberately passed over for the governorship in May last year when
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi moved to become prime minister. The job went to Mr
Antonio Fazio, the deputy director-general.
Mr Dini and his supporters have made it known they do not wish to see Mr
Padoa Schioppa as the number two and would prefer an outsider such as Mr
Rainer Masera, a liberal economist and current head of IMI, the
state-controlled finance group.
The Bank of Italy is fiercely resisting the imposition of an outsider. The
latest compromise suggested is that Mr Vincenzo Desario, the current second
deputy director-general, assume the number two slot.

regional. Today's results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be scrutinised
closely for evidence of early progress from Chef &amp; Brewer, which S&amp;N bought
from Grand Metropolitan late last year.
The Pounds 703m deal was of strategic importance to S&amp;N, since it greatly
increased its pub estate in the south of England and gave it an important
new outlet for its beer. On the other hand, GrandMet has the reputation of
extracting top prices for businesses it sells. Forecasts are for profits of
about Pounds 230m pre-tax against Pounds 201m.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Mannesmann share jolt as chief faces inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest companies, were jolted
yesterday by news that state prosecutors had launched a wide-ranging
investigation into Mr Werner Dieter, the company's chief executive, for
alleged fraud.
Mr Rolf Chanteaux, a spokesman for the state prosecutor in Dusseldorf, where
the engineering conglomerate is based, said investigations had begun into Mr
Dieter's alleged 'activities which are likely to harm the company'.
The probe could damage Mr Dieter's chances of becoming chief of Mannesmann's
supervisory board.
'On the basis of preliminary inquiries we have launched a full
investigation,' Mr Chanteaux said, declining to give any further details.
Mannesmann's share price fell to DM397 from an opening price of DM404 but
recovered in afternoon trading in Frankfurt to close at DM402. The shares
stood at DM446 before Spiegel magazine published an article three weeks ago
alleging irregularities in Mr Dieter's private business activities.
Spiegel alleged that Mr Dieter had forced Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary,
to buy hydraulic accessories from Hydac, a company mainly owned by Mr
Dieter's family.
Mr Dieter yesterday said his family owned 57.5 per cent of Hydac and a
further 50 per cent of Hydac Filter, another company. Family shareholders
held up to 75 per cent in a variety of smaller, related companies.
However, he said, the relationship between Rexroth and Hydac had existed
since 1963 and had been fully discussed when he took over as Mannesmann's
chief executive in 1985.
He said the business supplied by Hydac represented only a fraction of
Rexroth's activities and could have had no impact on the latter company,
whose turnover has grown from around DM10m (Pounds 4m) in 1960 to DM3.3bn
now.
Both companies were 'entirely competitive' and Rexroth had been able to
offer its international clients much better service through its long-term
relationship with Hydac, Mr Dieter said.
The Mannesmann group lost DM513m last year on sales of DM27.96bn.
Mr Dieter is due to step down as chief executive and take over as chairman
of the supervisory board, a non-executive body. The move was to have been
announced at the group annual meeting next Friday but Mr Dieter, 64,
admitted his chances of securing the post were now diminishing.

Twenty-six workers sacked from Goole docks on Humberside after industrial
action lost a four-year battle for redundancy money yesterday.
Three Court of Appeal judges dismissed by a majority an appeal aimed at
reinstating their entitlement to compensation. The 26 were dismissed in
April 1990 after an overtime ban in protest at a new bonus scheme. They said
that their sackings were a 'set-up' to avoid paying redundancy.
Lord Justice Dillon said that the industrial action in support of the bonus
generated the dismissals and the subsequent decision to use contract labour.

The High Court yesterday extended the order indefinitely. It could otherwise

Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, said that to apply for the

unlikely given that Mr Nadir failed to co-operate on a number of occasions.

FT  02 JUL 94 / British government rejects call for Hong Kong human-rights
commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yesterday rejected recommendations by an all-party
parliamentary committee in London for an independent human-rights commission
in Hong Kong, writes Our Foreign Staff.
The rejection was part of a reply to a report on Hong Kong by the foreign
affairs committee, which prompted an angry reaction in Beijing because of
its outspoken comments on Tibet and Taiwan. The British decision confirmed
the view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, that existing legal
arrangements, including a forthcoming Equal Opportunities Bill, are adequate
to protect human rights.
The UK government also told the committee that it was deeply concerned about
human rights abuses through China, including Tibet, but it did not think it
would help the Tibetans for London to try opening discussions on the
region's future.
'Any lasting solution can be found only through dialogue between the Chinese
government and the Tibetans without preconditions,' the report said, adding
that London urged all parties to begin this process without delay.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week sees full-year figures from two brewers, one national, one
regional. Monday's results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be scrutinised
closely for evidence of early progress from Chef &amp; Brewer, which S&amp;N bought
from Grand Metropolitan late last year.
The Pounds 703m deal was of strategic importance to S&amp;N, since it greatly
increased its pub estate in the south of England and gave it an important
new outlet for its beer. On the other hand, GrandMet has the reputation of
extracting top prices for businesses it sells. Forecasts are for S&amp;N to have
profits of about Pounds 230m pre-tax against Pounds 201m.
Full-year results from Greene King, the East Anglian regional brewer, are
due on Thursday. The market is unsure of its ground, since Greene King's
interim results were particularly disappointing with profits almost
unchanged. Since then, the shares have been among the weakest in the sector,
underperforming the market by around 15 per cent. Last year's pre-tax
profits were Pounds 20.1m, down from Pounds 20.3m the year before. Any
improvement in the headline figure this time will be regarded as progress.
MFI, the furniture group, is expected on Monday to announce a big increase
in full-year, pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.2m to about Pounds 70m.
Analysts raised their forecasts from about Pounds 60m after MFI's interim
results in January, when it disclosed a much stronger performance in the
January sales than in 1993. They are keen to hear from MFI whether the
improvement has been sustained. Exceptional charges of Pounds 214m connected
with the sale of its Silo chain in the US will obscure a small fall in
underlying profits at Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, on
Wednesday. Before the charges - which include trading and disposal losses,
and a Pounds 191m goodwill write-off - pre-tax profits are forecast at about
Pounds 75m. Last year's figure, after provisions for losses at Silo and
other charges, was Pounds 33.5m, but before exceptionals was Pounds 76.7m.
This year's fall is due largely to a poor performance at Christmas, when
Dixons was hit by a price war in computer games. Reported profits are also
expected to be depressed by exceptional costs of up to Pounds 20m to cover
the closure of 100 Currys high street stores this year as the latter's move
into out-of-town superstores accelerates.
Increased profits from Cellnet, the cellular telephone network operator
co-owned with BT, should help Securicor push interim profits beyond last
time's Pounds 29m when it reveals its interim results on Tuesday.

FT  02 JUL 94 / A clash of values on the Ark Royal: Nicholas Woodsworth
joins the aircraft carrier in the Adriatic and finds a subtle, non-violent
conflict taking place on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My grandfather, an Englishman from the lower edge of the middle class, spent
most of his life trying to escape insecurity and the limitations of his
background. He had a good deal of imagination but little business acumen and
the results, almost without exception, were spectacularly unsuccessful.
But at the end of his life there was one part of his professional career
that he looked back to with great pride and satisfaction. It had nothing to
do with escapist ventures in far-flung places. On the contrary, it lay close
to the heart of the British social and institutional traditions he was
trying to run away from. With the threat of hostilities in the late 1930s,
my grandfather became a naval reserve officer and served at sea with the
Royal Navy throughout the war.
I was not impressed when, on holiday visits between bouts of boarding
school, my grandfather extolled the merits of the Royal Navy. He spoke of an
ideal of duty, of the value of common endeavour, of comradeship, of jobs
well done; I could only see regimentation, blind obedience, and a
hierarchically tribal organisation. It all sounded too much like the strict
and old-fashioned school I had so happily come away from.
Since that time I had thought little of my grandfather's views on life
afloat until, not long ago, I found myself aboard the Ark Royal, cruising
the Adriatic. I had initially been interested in the Bosnian conflict
itself, and Britain's contribution to the UN-sponsored 'deny-flight'
programme in Bosnian air space. Much of it is executed from the flight deck
of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, the largest and perhaps best-known ship
in the Royal Navy.
But the more I clambered about the Ark's decks and stairways and looked in
on life in her messes, the more I became aware of the existence of another
sort of conflict. It is subtler and non-violent but, for all that, crucial
to the future of the Royal Navy. It is the struggle between new principles
of business and the old principles of duty my grandfather so respected.
The Ark Royal is like a small town. There is a bakery and a post office, a
laundry and a hospital, a police station and a cobbler's. Here, in addition
to a vast range of specialised professional activities, one finds most of
the normal goings-on of daily life.
I had spent periods at sea before on non-military boats, and knew the
feeling that makes each ship a little world unto itself. What astonished me
on the Ark Royal, and what would be found wholly inconceivable in civilian
life, is that all this activity, all these wills, are directed towards one
final end. From the swabbing of its immaculately kept decks to the operation
of ultra-sophisticated sonar equipment, life aboard the Ark Royal is above
all an endeavour of co-ordination. Millions of pounds worth of technology
not withstanding, the Ark Royal is a precision machine of 1,200 human parts.
The final objective on an aircraft carrier, of course, is the execution of
successful air missions, and I spent time on the grey-painted 'island'
overlooking the Ark Royal's flight deck.
From here I could watch the take off and recovery of aircraft - up to 80
movements a day on a runway just 600 feet long - of the ship's Sea King
helicopter and Sea Harrier combat jet squadrons.
To my eye there was something insect-like about it all - the way the
helicopters came hovering in beside the Ark Royal, then, sideslipping,
settled like dragon flies on a floating stick; the way, after landing, these
same aircraft folded their propellers back like so many delicate pairs of
wings; the angry buzzing of a Sea Harrier as it shot off the deck, circled
once or twice, then disappeared into the sky; the helmets and visors,
globular and reflective like the eyes of a fly, worn by combat pilots as
they climbed into their craft.
But insects operate from instinct. What this vision did not include was the
human factor - the training, the hours of repetition and practice that
everyone aboard goes through to achieve the degree of professionalism
required.
And flight operations are only the end product. Below, on nine windowless
decks sandwiched between the flight deck and the ship's keel, are the
hundreds of men, and now women - there are 110 Wrens aboard - who, with the
same professionalism in their own particular field make the whole thing
work.
Pilots, marine engineers, aircraft mechanics, caterers, weapons systems
operators, stokers, communications specialists - I found the workings of
community aboard the Ark Royal extraordinary to behold. All are so dependent
on each other, all have lives with demands so much more stringent than those
in our own civilian lives of negotiation and compromise that I began to
understand, for the first time, the sense of comradeship and service that is
the essential ingredient of a happy ship.
Everyone I talked to aboard subscribed, in his or her own way, to these old
ethics. Even the young. When on the flight deck I asked 27-year-old Lt Ivan
Hamilton what it felt like to fly a helicopter, his eyes lit up with the
sheer joy and excitement of it; but he also stressed the need among pilots,
the most individual of Navy men, for a 'pack-animal mentality'. Caroline
Redwood, an aircraft mechanic barely in her 20s, told me she could never go
back to civilian secretarial work - there were few satisfactions.
In the pubby, clubby atmosphere of the wardroom, where officers in the
coloured cummerbunds of their squadrons had gathered for drinks before
dinner, Lt Commander Jerry Betteridge put it more succinctly.
'We feel a sense of belonging to a special society,' he told me. 'Things
have changed: officers and ratings are better educated, more specialised
now, and the sense of mindless obedience has disappeared. But we hold on to
our old Navy traditions and ideals. If we let them go, we would lose the
concept on which we base all our behaviour and efficiency - our pride of
service.'
The world is changing so much that such ideals risk obliteration none the
less. The cold war of my youth and my grandfather's old age is over. In
strategic terms the collapse of Communism has wholly altered the Royal
Navy's situation. It now finds itself in a state similar to that following
the defeat of Napoleon in 1815: its longtime adversary gone and its
traditional role vanished, it is casting about for alternative roles.
After 1815 some of the Navy's resources were directed, as they are today in
Bosnia, to a humanitarian cause - the eradication of the slave trade. Most,
however, went to maintaining the Navy as the keeper of a worldwide and
highly profitable Pax Britannica.
But with British power eroded abroad and an economy ailing at home, the
Royal Navy has no such role to play today. With demands from other
ministries, the 'peace dividend' has only further justified continuing cuts
in defence budgets. Following the Falkland Islands conflict the Royal Navy
had 60 destroyers and frigates and 70,000 staff; today there are 40 such
vessels and 55,000 staff. Despite government promises on redundancy levels,
shock waves roll through the Royal Navy with each new leak from the Ministry
of Defence - the current defence cost study, due out shortly, is expected to
result in a further 8,000 Navy redundancies and many other cuts.
Recent policy has also gone a long way in changing the manner in which the
Navy is run. New management techniques, new systems of accountability, open
tendering, private contracting, the elimination of excess capacity - these
and other initiatives designed for cost-effectiveness make the Royal Navy
look as much an organisation stripped down for competitive business as for
combat.
Officers on the Ark pride themselves that the sea-borne air power they
provide off the coast of the former Yugoslavia is the most effective
expression of British government policy possible: from neutral waters they
assure a military offensive presence, demonstrate a political will, and give
a promise of protection to British ground troops, all at a minimum cost and
minimum level of engagement. And they are right - what neater tool of
British policy could there be?
At the same time, however, officers and staff feel they are not getting much
in return. The new ethos of rational business management, they say, not only
risks turning the Royal Navy into an ineffective force; it also threatens to
remove the public service ethic which lies at the very heart of the Navy.
This is a sentiment that runs from the bottom of the ship to the top, from
stokers I talked to deep in the ship's innards to officers taking tea and
rock buns in the wardroom. Certainly the captain, Terry Loughran, in an
immaculate white uniform on the Ark Royal's bridge, has fears for the Royal
Navy's future.
'Enormous strains are being put on us by new management techniques,' he told
me. 'We expect a man to be prepared to lay down his life for us, yet we turn
round without the slightest hesitation and make him redundant. We take great
pride in service. It would be frustrating to produce a shoddy, second-rate
job, but stress and great uncertainty is very much there and can lead to
just that.'
All this could be avoided, he said, if instead of managing the navy like an
unprofitable business, it were seen for what he believes it to be - an
investment with huge but unquantifiable returns.
'You cannot apply business principles to an organisation whose earnings are
invisible. Our product is intangible. Cost-cutting has got to the stage
where we have lost sight even of business principles. In a real business we
would have a 10-year plan. The MoD has a 10-year plan and rips it up every
year and starts again. We are now at the cut-off point where inefficiencies
outweigh the benefits of cost-saving.'
Greater influence in world affairs, research and development that brings
Britain export earnings, the protection of economic resources at sea, job
provision, the power to deal effectively with the crises that are becoming a
regular part of life in the post-communist world - all these, Captain
Loughran told me, are the invisible earnings of an efficient Royal Navy.
I am no more pro-military than I was as a schoolboy. But if the Royal Navy
has a future in invisible earnings it also has one in peace-keeping. My
ramblings about the Ark Royal brought me two things: a realisation that a
navy is only as good as the politicians who control it, and a reconciliation
with my grandfather.
What would he think, I wonder, of today's Royal Navy? As someone with both
old navy values and a vast experience in business failure, I imagine he
would be alarmed.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Why Britain needs Maradonas: It is not saintliness that
excites, it is winning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First, Britain lost its Empire. Then it began losing at sport. What else is
left to perpetuate its self-esteem? The fact that British men are gentlemen,
and the rest of the world cheats or worse. How gratifying it is to us all in
Britain that OJ Simpson is to be tried for the murder of his former wife,
Nicole, and a 25-year-old friend of the former Mrs OJ
We had not known much of Mr Simpson until the most recent developments in
his social life. But we are told that he was the biggest American football
star of his generation and that he was the most popular sportsman in that
country.
See how foolish our young American cousins are. They have put their faith in
a bad 'un once again. For English commentators this has been an unmitigated
pleasure. Since we had never needed to know about Simpson until now, none of
us has ever said anything laudatory about the man, which we need now
embarrassingly retract.
We can just make the most of the further staining of what is sometimes
called 'The American Dream' - the rise to stardom of poor kids from nowhere.
In fact, we have not had so much fun since the jailing for rape of Mike
Tyson, former heavyweight boxing champion.
There is another aspect to this which thrills the British. People such as
Simpson and Tyson were conspicuous spenders, as poor people tend to be when
they come into vast sums of money. In Britain we find that repulsive, and so
the thought of such vulgar brutes being brutally separated from their wealth
is delightful, almost to the point of titillation.
We do, naturally, aspire to sporting greatness, as much as any nation. We
would be agog with excitement and admiration if, by some bizarre turn of
events, a British man bestrode the world of American football like a
colossus. Real football, the sort we invented, is, of course, the one we
most care about. It was a savage blow to British pride when successively
England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland failed to qualify for the
World Cup. It had been only scant consolation that an Englishman, Jack
Charlton, was the manager of the qualifying team from the Republic of
Ireland. But now all is well again, and true Britons can hold their heads in
pride - Diego Maradona has been booted out of the World Cup for drug abuse.
One might question whether the taking of a cure for cold, which is available
over the counter, is worthy of such treatment by football's governing body.
But this would be to miss the point, and certainly to fail to recognise why
the British newspapers have devoted such hand-rubbing space to Maradona's
expulsion.
This was the man who, by cheating, knocked England out of the World Cup in
1986. Naturally, no Englishman would deliberately hand-ball, as Maradona did
on that famous occasion. To our rejoicing he has finally realised the limits
of ungentlemanly conduct.
It helps our sense of outrage that Maradona is a representative of a nation
we have recently fought against. Do not these chaps know when they are
beaten? Boris Becker's apparent gamesmanship in the current Wimbledon tennis
championship would be worthy enough of our righteous outrage, but he was
already in trouble for being German and better than any of our boys. 'Our
boys' at Wimbledon tend to conform to a different stereotype. Like Jeremy
Bates, they are all decent, clean-cut sportsmen, who would never
deliberately distract their opponents.
What we must never admit is that our boys could not beat Boris Becker even
employing dirty tricks. Nor can we admit that Diego Maradona has done more
to popularise football than any Englishman alive.
What we have yet to learn is that it is not manners, still less saintliness,
which inspire and excite. It is winning, winning at all costs and against
all odds. That attitude demands characters of an extreme, almost primitive
energy. We need them in British sport. They are, after all, the sort without
whom we could never have built an Empire.

FT  02 JUL 94 / How we elect the king: Tony Benn explains how the
constitution should be used to give Britons the right to choose, through the
ballot box, their head of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BENN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British constitution, contrary to what is widely believed, is not an
unwritten one but is written down in detail in a network of personal oaths
of allegiance which are imposed on everyone who exercises any responsibility
in the state and binds them, individually, to the crown.
All MPs, peers, mayors, judges, officers, police officers and many others
are required to take such an oath.
Privy councillors, who include all cabinet ministers, have a special and
secret oath administered binding them even more tightly to the crown.
Bishops are required to pay homage to the crown and accept that the monarch
is the only source of 'ecclesiastical, spiritual and temporal power', while
at the coronation the only oath that the Queen gives is to defend the
protestant religion and uphold the rights of the bishops.
The monarchy actually consists of three separate and interlocking parts.
The first, and most public, is to be found in the person of the king or
queen. The Queen has a high profile and symbolises the nation in the minds
of the people, ever present and presiding over parliament and government but
nowadays possessing very few personal powers.
The real powers of the crown are exercised by the prime minister using the
royal prerogatives. These confer an immense amount of patronage, including
the power to make and unmake ministers, appoint peers and thousands of
public officials.
They also include the power to go to war and sign treaties, without the
consent of parliament, and it is under the prerogative power of
treaty-making that all the laws assented to by British ministers in Brussels
gain their legitimacy and override any domestic legislation that might
conflict with them.
The third and most mysterious aspect of the monarchy lies in the existence
of the crown as a legal fiction, for example, when members of the security
services are placed under a lifetime obligation of confidentiality to the
crown, which is a licence for them to do what they like without regard to
the law and then to keep quiet about it, making them a state within a state.
This structure dates back hundreds of years and the only real change came
recently - and from an unexpected source - British entry into the European
Union.
Under the Maastricht Treaty provisions, the Queen and Prince Charles have
become citizens of this union, reducing them to the same level as the rest
of us. Within the European Union, as it moves towards federalism, it is
obvious that many more public officials will be required to transfer their
personal allegiance to the union, as British commissioners have already had
to do.
All these aspects of a monarchical system of government are carefully
concealed beneath the public face of the king or queen of the day. Any
criticism of the system has been fended off by presenting it as an unfair
attack upon the person of the monarch.
So successful has this technique been that it is almost impossible for any
serious discussion to take place on how we might wish to be governed
Some time ago I introduced a Commonwealth of Britain bill which would give
the country a new and democratic constitution providing, among other things,
for the election of a president and disestablishment of the Church of
England.
This bill received a great deal of attention and is on the reading list for
some universities, but the problem has always been the method by which the
process of reform could be started.
For many years I have been working on a method that would make this
possible, intending to disclose it when the throne became vacant, and this
is how I realised that it could be done.
When a sovereign dies or abdicates the successor has to be proclaimed king
or queen and that proclamation, which is then read out in public in various
parts of the country, is the legal basis upon which the new monarch rests
for his or her authority.
This proclamation is agreed at a meeting of the Privy Council, held at St
James's Palace, and the key words in it are as follows:
'We, therefore . . . do now, hereby, with one voice and consent of tongue
and heart publish and proclaim . . .'
This proclamation is then signed by all those present.
There could hardly be a clearer or more precise legal statement of the
requirement of unanimity - and it is virtually identical with the same
principle which applies in the Council of Ministers of the European Union
when the president of the commission has to be appointed.
A few days ago, the prime minister was vigorously defending his use of that
unanimity rule to block the appointment of the Belgian prime minister and
this was one of the reasons why I decided to make my proposal public, by
writing to the Lord President of the Council.
The other reason for doing so was the decision of the Prince of Wales to
recommend the disestablishment of the Church of England, which I have long
advocated, and which would have the most profound constitutional
implications.
If the proclamation of the Prince of Wales as king can be delayed by one
privy councillor registering an objection, then the matter would have to be
referred back to parliament, as it was in 1688 when parliament offered the
throne to William III.
My purpose in all this is very simple and straightforward and involves no
personal criticism of the Prince of Wales.
It is to offer this country a chance to adopt a democratic constitution that
would give everyone the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head
of state and both houses of parliament, as happens in every modern
democracy.
It is my conviction that the problems that face Britain can only be tackled
if we throw off the shackles of feudalism and start to have confidence in
ourselves.

has always been the French writer who most embodies our love affair with
decadent, romantic, venal Paris. The small fat man who stalked the faubourgs
for inspiration about everyday life and so became the father of the
realistic novel, Balzac is the voice of pre-1848 France as surely as Dickens
speaks for Victorian England.
This is the first English biography for 50 years. It reaffirms the Balzac
myth with all the detail and domestic precision of the Comedie Humaine
novels and it has a splendid story to tell. Born in 1799 in Tours, Balzac
was an object of instant dislike to his 20-year-old mother, who put him out
to nurse, ignored him while she pursued her lovers and sent him to a
boarding school which did not believe in holidays. From the ages of eight to
14, he saw his family twice.
But in 1813, his headmaster demanded that he be removed at once. Almost
comatose, unable to speak, thin and puny, it then emerged that Balzac had
passed much of his school years locked up either in a dungeon or in a
cupboard under the stairs. He had done little classwork but had devoured
every book in the school library. In a horrible way, the pattern of his life
was set. When he wrote his novels, he always wore a monk's habit and sat in
a darkened room with only a coffee-pot, to make sure he kept awake, as a
prop.
His parents moved to Paris and at 19 Balzac persuaded them to fund him as a
writer. Bourgeoise respectability dictated the deal. Balzac was secretly set
up in a room on the edge of the Marais, friends were told he had gone south
to work; he promised only to come out at night and to keep to the suburbs.
'In listening to these people, I could espouse their lives. I felt their
rags upon my back; I walked with my feet in their tattered shoes; their
desires, their wants - everything passed into my soul,' he said of those
nocturnal walks.
After a few pot-boilers, he wrote the first of the hundred or so tales of
Parisian and provincial life - Le Pere Goriot, La Cousine Bette - that make
up the Comedie Humaine. They were instantly successful and soon he was the
most famous novelist in France.
A good literary biography has at its heart the flow between the life and
work, the key impulses towards fictional creation. In Balzac's case, they
were consciously bound up with sexual energy - he told Dumas that a night of
love cost half a volume and that 'no woman alive is worth two volumes a
year.' His books are laced with the battle between desire and ascetism. The
hero of The Magic Skin has opera glasses equipped with a monocle which turns
sexiness to ugliness, and so watches the beautiful women on stage without
yearning. But Balzac's major figures are corrupt sensualists, androgynes
like Vautrin, Rastignac and de Rubrempre, who had a profound influence on
fin -de-siecle decadence - Rubrempre's death, said Wilde, was 'one of the
greatest tragedies of my life.'
Robb probes the psychological depths of neither the man nor the novels.
Instead, he loses his subject in a whirl of social climbing, adulterous
aristocrats and possible illegitimate children. Only the turning point of
Balzac's life cuts through this morass. In 1832, he received a fan's letter
from Odessa signed L'Etrangere. He was so taken by it that he placed an
answer in the Gazette de France. Fifteen years of love letters and rare
meetings with Madame Hanska, a Polish countess, followed.
Love and money play on each other throughout the Comedie Humaine, and so in
life. 'All my other passions were just a deposit for this one,' Balzac said.
He lived well and overspent; when her husband died Mme Hanska held off from
him because he lacked the financial acumen of his characters.
After years of madcap trips to Poland mixed with 18-hour working days, he
married her. Five months later he was dead. 'I always found them sitting by
the fireside and they talked and talked until morning. Whatever could they
find to talk about for so long?' recalled the valet who brought them coffee
in the small hours. Anecdotes like these are the high points of an
enthusiastic but flawed biography.
Balzac, Zola and Flaubert are all popular classics in England but among
French 19th century novelists, none is regarded with more suspicion here
than Stendhal. Balzac called Stendhal the Machiavelli of the 19th century
and for the English, Stendhal's reputation as a grey and difficult Gallic
literary anatomist is one that not even last year's bodice-ripping
television version of Scarlet and Black managed to overcome.
This stunning new biography will change our view of Stendhal for good. In
the 'vast, gorgeous tracts' of Stendhal's life as a Napoleonic soldier and
lover, Jonathan Keates sees a complex man whose sensuality and 'massively
humane curiosity' lay behind every line he wrote.
Here is Stendhal whose great panoramic novel, Scarlet and Black and The
Charterhouse of Parma, emerged out of his own passions and disappointments
and are warm human dramas. Keates makes clear how Stendhal's revolutionary
bridging of the gap between Romanticism and 19th century realistic fiction
had much to do with a temperament torn between nostalgia and cynicism. This
is an exhilarating portrait; sensitive, original, perfectly pitched between
art and life.
Stendhal was born Henri Deyle in 1783 and it is as a figure formed by 18th
century values that Keates depicts him. He came from a well-off Grenoble
family, slipped into a post in the Ministry of War, and from 1800 followed
Napoleon's campaign in Italy and Austria. He was small, ugly and obsessed by
physical beauty in others, and he spent most of his time in salons and opera
houses, pursuing aristocratic hostesses and singers. After the fall of
Napoleon he retired to Italy, adopted his pseudonym and began to write. At
59, unmarried, syphilitic and obscure, he dropped dead in a Paris street.
At once refined and emotionally wild, Stendhal sings out from these pages
like a character from a Mozart opera. He was, says Keates, a sexual
freebooter who 'found a notion of obtaining happiness from a virtuous woman
wholly inconceivable.' Often he played Don Giovanni - driven by sexual
intrigue, he marked the date of conquests on his braces, and recorded them
in a secret code. He bribed maids, hid in trunks to spy on unfaithful
mistresses, hung towels from his balcony to tell lovers when it was safe.
But despite the opera buffo roles it was a series of tortured unconsummated
obsessions which fuelled his art. Alexandrine was the muse for Gina de
Sanseverina in The Charterhouse of Parma. A fixation on a high-handed
Italian countess called Metilda inspired his heroine Mathilde de la Mole.
War and love made up his life, but he was neither greatly successful nor
ambitious in either, and Keates suggests that it was a backwards glance at
his roving existence which created the ambivalent tone of Scarlet and Black
(1830).
A lifetime's emotions tumbled out in this novel. The mercantile mayor was
modelled on his greedy father; elusive Madame de Renal on his adored mother.
The opera fanatic's penchant for romantic theatricality battles with
Stendhal the cool modernist, who wins out. The moral of Scarlet and Black is
that 'the men we honour are simply rogues who have been lucky enough not to
get caught red-handed'.
Stendhal saw his novel as a journey down the highway which reflected the
'blue of the skies and the mire of the road below'. Keates marvellously
captures both aspects of the man and his work.

SHOT IN THE HEART: ONE FAMILY'S HISTORY IN MURDER by Mikal Gilmore Viking
Pounds 16, 403 pages
A FATHER'S STORY by Lionel Dahmer Little, Brown Pounds 15.99, 255 pages
One day in late July 1976, Mikal Gilmore, a young music journalist, came
across a headline in a newspaper: 'Gary Mark Gilmore, 35, was charged with
the murders of two young clerks during the holdup of a service station and
motel . . .' He read on dazed and confused, about how both of the two dead
men were Mormons, about the same age as himself, both with a wife and
children. He read all about the crimes of Gary Gilmore, his brother, and
realised that he had become, suddenly, yet ineluctably, 'the brother of a
man who murdered innocent men.'
One day in late July 1991, Lionel Dahmer, a middle-aged Milwaukee chemist,
turned on the eleven o'clock news and saw his son's face fill the screen.
Jeffrey Dahmer was under arrest as a serial killer. Switching from channel
to channel, he saw the same face flash before him, accompanied by reports of
Jeffrey Dahmer's grisly crimes. He turned to his wife and said, 'Maybe some
day this will all be over.' 'This,' she replied, 'will never be over.' He
sensed that she was right: 'We were no longer merely parents,' he reflected,
'and we never would be again. We were the parents, and I, in particular, was
the father of Jeffrey Dahmer.'
Gary Gilmore and Jeffrey Dahmer became well-known for their inhumanity.
Gilmore, cold, unrepentant and arrogantly resolute, became the most famous
killer in America when, after being sentenced to death, he waived all rights
of appeal and insisted that his execution be carried out. His case became an
international news event, and he went to the firing squad with Norman Mailer
signed up to write his story and the movie rights sold. Dahmer, withdrawn
and aloof, sat impassively in court as his shocking crimes were discussed in
excruciating detail: at least 17 murders; cannibalism; human body parts
stored in the refrigerator; male genitalia kept preserved in formaldehyde;
and a full human skeleton hanging in the wardrobe. From the start of his
trial until the moment, several weeks later, when he was sentenced to 957
years in prison, he was never out of the news.
Murder, as WH Auden said, is 'a negative creation.' Its impact is profound,
forcing attention not merely on the killer and the victim but also on those
they knew and lived with. Neither Mikal Gilmore nor Lionel Dahmer wanted -
or expected - to be famous, yet both of them, because of the actions of
others, blood relations, found themselves, their lives and their families
changed almost beyond comprehension. Gilmore's remarkable, sensitively
written Shot in the Heart, and Dahmer's less illuminating yet painfully
compelling A Father's Story, tell the story of the intimate onlooker, the
public story that neither man can escape from in private.
The initial news of their unwitting involvement in a terrible event elicited
a similar reaction from both men. Dahmer, a quiet man who prided himself on
his calm, orderly, 'rational' life, felt disorientated and a growing sense
of panic, alarmed that his son 'was taking me down with him, dragging me
into the utter chaos that he had made of his life, and doing it publicly.'
Gilmore felt a mixture of grief, anger and humiliation, suddenly 'stuck
inside' his brother's notoriety. 'Our lives had overnight exploded in a way
that we could never have imagined,' Gilmore recalls, 'and for a long
nightmare season, our history, our sins, and our shame became part of a
pageant that was headed inexorably toward a public death.'
After the shock came the search for an explanation. Dahmer the scientist
finds it difficult to avoid blaming genes, as though there is guilt in the
simple fact of the bloodline itself. He remembers the first time he set eyes
on his newly-born son ('I stared at him, astonished at how much he looked
like me'), and half-forgotten childhood mischief, which once seemed so
innocent, now assumes a sinister significance. Gilmore prefers a more
speculative approach, exploring the ghosts and myths in his family's
history, searching through the house 'where murder is born' in the hope of
uncovering 'a key to unlock its secrets,' an event 'that might explain what
produced so much loss and violence.'
It is a painful, and seemingly endless, process of self-analysis, conjecture
and confession for both men. Gilmore admits that part of his fear is the
thought that he will never know the truth, while part is that he will find
out more truth than he can possibly live with. Dahmer confesses that he
remains 'in the grip of a great unknowing', both in terms of his son and of
his 'effect upon him as a father, by omissions and commissions.' Although
both men do their best to mourn the actual victims of the murders, and to
come to terms with the murderer they once knew and loved, the thing that
they both mourn most poignantly is the future that they are now unable to
live.

ART &amp; LIES by Jeanette Winterson Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 294 pages
Speaking in the voice of her character Sappho, Jeanette Winterson writes in
Art &amp; Lies, 'In the beginning was the Word. And at the end'. There is a
truth and an evasion here, for Winterson's obsession is certainly with
language - specifically the language of the Authorised Version of the Bible
 -rather than the novelist's incunabula of character and plot.
The evasion, however, lies in the way she uses this admitted preoccupation
to mask her true literary project. At first glance Winterson's trajectory as
a novelist has been an uncertain one, so much so that her second novel,
Boating for Beginners, has now been relegated by its author to the status of
'comic book' in her list of previous works. Readers and reviewers alike
refer nostalgically to her hugely successful debut, Oranges Are Not The Only
Fruit, and tend to regard her most recent novels - Written on the Body and
now Art &amp; Lies - as both difficult and a departure from what she originally
appeared to promise.
Art &amp; Lies arrives with a whimsical sub-title, 'A Piece for Three Voices and
a Bawd,' which immediately signals that it is not concerned at any level
with realism. The voices belong to Handel, a defrocked priest and breast
surgeon; Picasso, a young woman who has been sexually abused by her brother
and who longs to be a painter; and Sappho, the lesbian poet. In between we
hear from Doll Sneerpiece, a scatological type which has been a stock
feature of Winterson's fiction since The Passion.
Handel, Picasso and Sappho end up together on a train, although there is
nothing in the novel as conventional as denouement. Yet while Arts &amp; Lies is
determinedly abstruse and experimental, there is a sense in which it is a
wholly logical step in Winterson's literary development. Its 'voices',
especially that of Sappho, are frequently indistinguishable from that of the
unnamed narrator of Written on the Body; both, for all their declared
subjugation to the women they love, are blatantly self-regarding.
Winterson's fictional love-objects are a striking weakness of her work, from
the sick, etiolated Louise in Written on the Body to the insubstantial
Picasso in Art &amp; Lies, In dramatic contrast, her lovers are of heroic or
even monstrous proportions, reaching their apotheosis in the greedy,
devouring narrator of Written on the Body.
Winterson's interest in love and passion tends to reveal itself in the form
of intense self-examination in the part of the lover, with whom she often
appears to identify, rather than of the beloved.
Indeed her rejection of character and plot in Art &amp; Lies can be seen as an
increasingly confident attempt to liberate herself from the necessity to
mask her solipsism; the subject which has always engrossed her, from the
fictionalised autobiography of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit to the
magisterial pronouncements on life and art in this latest novel, is her own
development.
It is a truism that Winterson's obsession with Biblical language can be
traced back to her upbringing as a teenage evangelist. Art &amp; Lies declares
this influence from start to finish; 'Kiss me with the pulled-apart open
space, demolition of propriety, rebuilding of a place of worship among an
upright people'. And, on the same page: 'The word and the kiss are one.'
Yet the point about the language of the King James Bible is that, for all
its flights, it is anchored by an unshakeable belief in the existence of
God. Without this centre the words become meaningless, which is the
direction in which Winterson's verbal pyrotechnics have begun to tend.
Yet the evidence of her novels, particularly Art &amp; Lies, is that Winterson
is bent upon the creation of an alternative centre which is not the Word but
the endlessly-fascinating self.

OF DREAMS AND DEMONS: AN INDIAN MEMOIR by Patwant Singh Duckworth Pounds
16.99, 216 pages
There has been a dearth of good political memoirs in India since
Independence. Civil servants have felt too inhibited by the constraints of
the Official Secrets Act to tell much that is new - or else have been unable
to break free from the colourless bureaucratic style that has long cramped
the growth of the English language in India. Politicians have been unwilling
to rattle the skeletons gathering dust in the long years in which the Nehru
family have dominated Indian politics. Thus the few good memoirs to have
surfaced have been from writers/diarists like Raj Thapar, whose All These
Years shed light on some of the humiliating compromises and failures of
nerve amongst politicians and officials that allowed Mrs Gandhi to ride
roughshod over the country's political institutions during the Emergency in
the 1970s.
Patwant Singh is in this tradition. He is neither civil servant nor
bureaucrat. But like Raj Thapar, he is part of the relatively small elite
whose connections have had a place in most administrations. Son of a wealthy
Sikh business family, he founded India's first design magazine. He developed
a taste for politics and international affairs, and branched out as
columnist, author and crusader over issues close to his heart - saving
Delhi's architectural heritage, or human rights in the Punjab. Self
confident in his opinions, and never frightened of expressing them, he
writes clearly and wittily. He is sharp in his comments on politicians but
disappointingly reticent in his judgment of many other contemporaries.
Patwant's theme is decay. He draws on the two sides of his career - design
and politics - to underline the same message. The deterioration of Delhi's
urban landscape through ugly high rise buildings and urban sprawl has been
matched since independence by the erosion of political institutions and
values. He holds Mrs Gandhi's short term political manoeuvring and
unscrupulousness as largely responsible for many of the ills from which
India now suffers - the accelerating pace of corruption, the undermining of
the the judiciary, and the growth of regional conflicts in the Punjab and in
Kashmir.
As a Sikh, Patwant's anger is focussed on the hatred Mrs Gandhi stirred up
in the Punjab - which resulted in the end in her own assassination and the
barbaric anti-Sikh riots that followed. He curtly sums her up as 'an
irresponsible politician whose basic shortcoming was an absence of permanent
values.'
He has much more respect for her father Jawarhlal Nehru - matched by a
greater contempt for her two sons Rajiv (who also became Prime Minister) and
Sanjay. But it is clear that with India now turning away from the socialist,
pro-Soviet policies that marked most of the long period of rule by the Nehru
family, we are in for a major reassessment of their legacy.
Patwant is at his best in the first two thirds of this book. He weaves
together incidents from his personal life with the history unfolding before
him. The opportunities that open up to him personally have their parallels
in the challenges facing a country newly independent. In the final chapters,
his personal voice is drowned as indignation takes over.
His conclusions are too gloomy. He was writing before the last state
assembly elections when it had seemed that the Hindu BJP party would come to
power and the country be torn by renewed conflict. The BJP did badly and for
the moment is demoralised. At the same time, India is getting a much needed
injection of fresh ideas as it opens up its economy. Patwant, like many
Indian nationalists, has divided views about the growth of foreign
influence. But without it, India would have got stuck in a rut - both
economic and intellectual.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Conductor on peak form - Richard Fairman finds Jansons
bringing out the best in the LSO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Symphony Orchestra has taken to printing quotations from reviews
in its programmes of late. Carefully-edited snippets lauding an orchestra's
'beauty' and 'grandeur' are the sort of one-upmanship liable to test one's
patience, especially if the playing leaves something to be desired, but
nobody is likely to have complained to the LSO on Thursday.
The orchestra is finishing the 1993-4 season in what must be its best form
for many years. Three closing concerts with Mariss Jansons are scheduled
within the space of a week and the only regret after this first one was that
these will be Jansons's last appearances with the LSO, at least for a while.
As from this autumn he has undertaken to conduct in London exclusively as
principal guest conductor for the rival London Philharmonic, an agreement
that must have been signed a year or more ago.
Now we learn that the London Philharmonic is to say goodbye to its music
director, Franz Welser-Most, so where does this leave Jansons? The London
Philharmonic's management said last week that it would take some time for a
new appointment to be made, but it is difficult to see why. In half-an-hour
they could easily take the tube to the Barbican and head for the conductor's
room with the words, 'Hello, Mariss. Do you want the job?' Assuming he does
want it, that is: unfortunately Jansons may by now have higher ambitions
elsewhere.
How his star has risen in the last ten years. From his regular visits to
London with three of the capital's orchestras he has shown himself to be
unrivalled as an interpreter of Russian music and big showpiece scores. On
Thursday, with the LSO, he turned to the standard German classics and gave
us Beethoven and Bruckner, thought-out and delivered to an exemplary
standard that may well have surprised even his most ardent admirers.
In Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto he accompanied Alfred Brendel in a
typically alert fashion, balancing the romantic leanings of Brendel's
lyrical playing with neatly-sprung classical phrasing. From both of them it
was a marvellously concentrated performance, which always knew what it
wanted to say, and said it with wit and tenderness.
Those same qualities shone through in Bruckner's Seventh Symphony too, where
they might not necessarily be thought so appropriate. Jansons's Bruckner was
never going to be distinguished by the wisdom that is learnt patiently over
long decades by the composer's most illustrious interpreters, because that
is not his nature. What he brought to the music was the keenest possible
intelligence and a fine ear. If the symphony in the end added up to less
than the sum of its parts, that did not stop every part of it being
riveting.
Sometimes in the past, when faced with a big work, Jansons has been seduced
by volume for its own sake, but thankfully not here. In the long opening
movement one could have been listening to chamber music, so clear was every
strand of the music. Like the best international orchestras, the LSO has
found a natural internal balance of its own, so that the brass no longer
raucously drown their colleagues at climaxes as they used to. To judge from
the flute and oboe solos, even more the first violins' work above the stave,
the players are now technically well ahead of any other British orchestra.
Their two remaining concerts with Jansons are highly recommended.
Sponsored by Toshiba. The other two concerts are on July 3 and 5

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Bonn plays host to eastern Europe's avant-garde -
Besides 20th century art, the main theatrical event at the Kuntshalle is an
experimental opera about the life of Gorbachev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one ever went to Bonn for culture. But by the end of the century, when
the most important government ministries have transferred to Berlin, culture
may be all Bonn has to remind itself of those heady days as a European
capital.
The city's image as a cultural backwater has been transformed over the past
two years by the Kunsthalle, a large modern gallery with a growing
international reputation. Its latest exhibition is typically ambitious - a
panoramic survey of 20th century avant-garde art in eastern Europe.
Like several other artificially-created capitals, Bonn has struggled to
build a cultural life commensurate with its political status. In the 1980s,
the federal government began pumping money into the Bonn Opera, but there
has been little of permanent value to show for it. Attempts to exploit the
Beethoven connection (he was born in Bonn) have also had mixed success.
The Kunsthalle is different. Built with DM130m (Pounds 50m) of federal
funds, it opened with exquisite timing, just as the decision was taken to
deprive Bonn of its capital status. Situated next to two other new museums
in Bonn's government area, it has been a success from the start.
The building itself, a creamy limestone rectangle designed by the Viennese
architect Gustav Peichl, makes no great statement - unless you count the 16
rusty steel columns along the front, representing the 16 German Lander. But
you cannot mistake the three roof-cones, standing amid a landscaped
sculpture garden. Inside, the cones feed natural light onto circular display
areas, like neo-classical porticos - the perfect home for a Brancusi
polished bronze bird in the current exhibition. In addition to two floors of
flexible exhibition space, there are archive and video facilities, and a
500-seat theatre. The idea is to encourage inter-disciplinary activities -
exploring the east European theme, for example, with a film season and
experimental opera.
Entitled Europa, Europa, The Century of the Avant-Garde in Central and
Eastern Europe, the exhibition aims to highlight the contribution made by
east European artists to international artistic trends, and to show that art
behind the Iron Curtain was not necessarily subordinate. Starting with
symbolist and abstract art, we are swept through Cubism, Constructivism,
Jewish culture, Socialist Realism, postwar technical developments and
current trends. Putting this together cost DM10m - more than many museums'
annual budget.
Given the breadth of the subject, it is hardly surprising that the overall
impression is sketchy. Some of the work in the Cubist and Constructivist
sections lacks a distinctive quality. Chagall is poorly represented, and the
exhibition's vitality diminishes as it proceeds.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of discoveries - particularly in the opening
section, which includes a visionary 'Sunset' by the Lithuanian artist
Mikalojus Ciurlionis (1875-1911) and loans from Polish, Moravian, Slovenian
and Transylvanian collections, long hidden from western eyes. One admires
the simple strength of Popova's constructivist pictures, the fairy-tale
surrealism of Josef Sima's 'Fall of Icarus' (1936) and the sheer artistry of
Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's light-space modulator (1930), a sophisticated
forerunner of Tinguely's mechanical contraptions. A room of Russian theatre
designs includes a Gogolesque Mikado from Moscow in 1927. Dominating the
postwar section is Magdalena Abakonowicz's lifesize sculpture 'Human Crowd
IV' (1989), a grim posse of headless figures.
The exhibition and film season run till October 16. The main theatrical
event so far has been the world premiere of Gorbachev, an operatic sketch by
Franz Hummel with a text by Thomas Korner. Lasting less than 50 minutes, it
consists of a rehearsal of a fictitious 'grand heroic opera' about the
former Soviet leader. Gorbachev himself is a tenor, and the other two parts
 -the stage director and repetiteur - are spoken. A five-act structure is
glimpsed, embracing a Glasnost speech to the Communist Party congress, a
state visit to the West, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the coup attempt and
humiliation by Yeltsin in parliament.
Like Nixon in China and the Patty Hearst opera premiered at this year's
Munich Biennale, Gorbachev deals with a contemporary subject bursting with
natural theatre. Unlike them, it makes no attempt to fictionalise its
subject. Instead, it places Gorbachev in ironic parentheses, as the
protagonists question whether such a figure can be adequately represented on
stage while he is still alive.
The message seems to be that only when time lends its interpretative gloss,
when history offers its perspective, can a clear distinction be made between
real-life figure and theatrical archetype. Gorbachev asks more questions
than it answers: why would a Fuhrer consciously lay the ground for his own
downfall? What is Gorbachev's historical significance? Is he a messianic or
tragic figure? Would he make a suitable subject for an opera?
The music is harmless - chattering piano accompaniments, taped orchestral
perorations, declamatory arioso and lyrical canzonetta. The stage director
pontificates, the repetiteur makes tea. Flimsy material perhaps, but
Hansgunther Heyme's production, with Wolf Munzer's pyramid-staircase set,
transformed it into a worthwhile piece of theatre. Walter Raffeiner was the
authentic Gorbachev impersonator, assisted by Adolf Dresen's stage director
and Irina Rumina's repetiteur.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: How the LSO played off its debt - Antony Thorncroft
talks to cellist-turned-manager, Clive Gillinson, about the orchestra's
change of fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago the London Symphony Orchestra was facing disaster. The house
orchestra of the recently opened Barbican Centre seemed unable to put a foot
right. Its ambitious festivals of the music of Webern and Tippett were
attracting audiences of 50 per cent or less. Its policy, imported from the
US, of selling tickets by subscription and repeating programmes, was just
not working in a city with no shortage of alternative concerts.
One financial backer, the City of London, was restive; another, the Arts
Council, was specific: unless the orchestra eliminated its swiftly
accumulated deficit of Pounds 430,000 within three years funding would
cease. Managerial heads rolled at the LSO and the board looked around for a
new chief executive. In the meantime Clive Gillinson, a cellist in the
orchestra, was given the job of managing the LSO for three months.
A decade later he is still there. He surveys a typical London musical scene
where all the major orchestras have problems of one sort or another,
especially financial, except one. The LSO has around Pounds 100,000 in the
bank; the loyal support of the Arts Council and the City, who between them
have raised their annual subsidy to Pounds 2.1m; a turnover which has
doubled during the decade, to Pounds 7.7m this year; audiences in 1994 of
almost 90 per cent capacity; and a secure future. No wonder Gillinson is
picking up awards and taking calls from head hunters. He is staying put for
the next five years (he has just signed the deal) but lets loose that there
are two other jobs which intrigue him. Watch out the National Trust and the
National Theatre.
The change-around was not a pretty sound. Gillinson admits that for a year
or so the LSO sold itself blatantly to pay off the overdraft. Rehearsals
were cut and popular programmes played. Any rich egoist who could offer
private or corporate money got the chance to conduct the LSO. One was so
inadequate that the only way a particularly tricky scherzo could be recorded
was by asking him to listen while the orchestra played it under the baton of
its leader. This was the take that made the final recording. Luckily most of
the self-delusionists wanted to play pop classics and the undiscriminating
audience did not notice the cracks. But it was very disillusioning for the
musicians. By playing 700 sessions a year (as against 500 now) the LSO
managed to play off the debt.
But its confidence was shattered, and in 1985 Gillinson was preparing to
pull the plug on a series of concerts of Mahler and Viennese music under
Claudio Abbado, which would help to raise the reputation of the LSO but
could backfire financially. Gillinson flew to the maestro to discuss the
project and was persuaded to press ahead. Sponsorship money was found and
the series was a great artistic and critical success.
This was a turning point. The reviving reputation of the LSO was
consolidated by the courtship and seduction two years later of the cellist
Mstislav Rostropovich, who was looking for concerts to celebrate his 60th
birthday. LSO saw off the competition from other orchestras and he has
remained a loyal supporter.
As he won over the critics Gillinson was also changing the way the LSO
performed. The original three, monthly, seasons a year at the Barbican were
jettisoned for Thursday and Sunday concerts throughout the year. The
workload was reduced from 100 concerts to 85. When the City and the Arts
Council were persuaded to raise their backing, the LSO recruited joint
string principals to beef up what had always been the weakest aspect of its
playing. It also concentrated on booking only top flight conductors and
soloists.
The changes were not universally welcomed. Gillinson is a tough
disciplinarian and many LSO musicians left for a more easy going life-style.
If you stayed with the LSO you got the chance to play interesting programmes
to wide acclaim but you had to turn up for virtually every concert: the
audience expected to recognise each musician in their appointed seat. Fixed
holidays were brought in, and short-term pay offs were replaced by long-term
planning: performance fees have been frozen for the last three years.
But while the other London orchestras had the agonising experience last year
of being forced into a beauty contest before the Hoffmann Committee, which
had been asked by the Arts Council to recommend orchestras for the financial
chop, the LSO was excused. It enjoys much more subsidy than its rivals
(although it plays more London concerts); its audiences are far higher; its
reputation sound.
It does not entirely escape the malaise that has overtaken London concert
making in the past decade. Big name conductors are still reluctant to commit
themselves to taking on a London orchestra. This year Sir Colin Davis
succeeds Michael Tilson Thomas as principal conductor of the LSO, (which
should bring more British music into its repertoire), but, despite his high
national standing, Sir Colin has not the international reputation to bring
to the LSO lucrative recording contracts. The LSO has still to move from
being a great British orchestra to being an outstanding global one.
But most things are in place for take off. There is now a commitment to make
every concert special, rather than to go for safe Beethoven-Tchaikovsky
double bills, which can no longer guarantee an audience anyway. So in the
autumn programme you have either a festival theme - all of Mahler's
symphonies; or popular performers like Solti and Anne-Sophie Mutter; or
starrily cast operas in concert (Idomeneo). Like Simon Rattle in Birmingham
the LSO has now gained the confidence of its audience, which will go along
for challenging work with some expectation - although a barrage of discounts
and special offers helps. The reputations of the London orchestras rise and
fall but the LSO, bolstered by the Barbican residency, seems secure enough
to see out Gillinson's tenure.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Meltdown' opera proves a damp squib
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The festive catch-all on the South Bank, 'Meltdown', ends this weekend. It
seems to have been designed to entice that notional young-middle audience
which has not really got into 'classical' music but warms easily to
post-minimalism, to very loud, rhythmic, anarchical stuff, to highbrow raids
on jazz and pop, to ethnic imports, to current 'performance' theatre and to
films that incorporate any of those (the National Film Theatre is
participating).
I suspect that this omnivorous audience is a fiction, though there are
sub-audiences aplenty for each of those fashions - and there are people who
will try almost anything new-ish, especially in a balmy summer. But I guess
too that the imagined eclectic omnivores reflect a wistful South Bank hope:
if anything creditably new is going to turn up in these directionless times,
it should surface amid the (mild) ferment of trends which actually draw
non-classical audiences.
Who knows? - Nicholas Snowman and his modernist South Bank crew might even
be right about that.
On Wednesday, however, a much-hyped Meltdown event proved a damp, grisly
squib. That was Martin Butler's 'operatic adventure story' Craig's Progress,
to a libretto by Stephen Pruslin. Butler's original idea was to make
something operatic out of 'American comic-book narrative and design of the
1930s to '50s', and especially a disoriented Superman-figure (Craig) from
now. As 'developed' by Pruslin  - a sometime associate, pianist and
amanuensis for Maxwell Davies and Birtwistle - the idea founders in an
inconsequent mess.
Craig, the comic-book hero, undergoes 'adventures' which are too silly to be
funny, and too elaborate by far to be staged on the tiny budget available.
The high-flown synopsis in the programme barely connected with the naff
Playschool antics on view. The words, when audible, were embarrassing, the
would-be jokes worse, the action regularly crippled by empty verbal games.
One felt acutely for the five pleasant, hard-working Mecklenburgh Opera
singers, who will not wish to be remembered for this show.
Butler is a skilful composer of incidental music. His score for Craig's
Progress is largely incidental, and unremittingly bland. It uses ten winds
to no imaginative purpose, with a pair of piano-duettists tinkling away to
distraction: it was like continually bumping one's head against wind-chimes.
There was a woeful absence of pace. The Epilogue, obviously inspired by
Stravinsky's for The Rake's Progress, withered and died at the comparison.
Falling between so many stools at once is an astonishing feat; Stravinsky
himself remarked that between stools is sometimes the best place to be - but
he hadn't heard Craig's Progress.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Ambitious beyond the simple portrait - William Packer
admires the work in the 15th Portrait Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Portrait Award, now in its fifth year with BP and its 15th in all, has
become so much a fixture in the calendar that we may well take it too much
for granted. Certainly it is a measure of its established position that
again this year, rather like a former Prince of Wales, it is 'no better,
(it) is much the same.' The great thing is that it is no worse. 'Much the
same' in a position of strength is no bad thing at all.
Of course all but the judges will disagree with the prizes given, and even
they may have agreed to disagree among themselves. That too is in the nature
of the beast. What is clear is that with their three winners and clutch of
commendeds, they have been drawn towards the more awkward and unsettling of
the works: works that by their scale, and the formal and technical problems
they take on, are ambitious beyond the narrower conventions of portraiture.
Shani Rhys-James's huge and richly expressive self-portrait with tins of
paint (2nd prize); Louise Courtnell's starkly-lit self-nude (commended);
Peter Edwards' wistful elderly model in blue jumper and long, patterned
skirt, sitting with the arms folded lightly on her lap (1st prize - Pounds
10,000 and a commission): these are things for only the bravest of
boardrooms. But then, while never excluding the possibility, the safer icons
of boardroom, officers' mess or bishop's palace were never the Portrait
Award's particular thing.
Rather it was to restore the portrait itself to the currency of contemporary
art - which has largely been achieved, as these award exhibitions have
long-since shown in their quality and variety. Of the works unfavoured by
the judges this time, I recommend Brian Martin's large studio conversation
piece; Euan Gray's somewhat fierce and intense self-portrait; Minna
Thornton's rather more swift and delicate self-portrait; an ambitious
full-length self-portrait by Douglas Houghton; and Jason Line's
three-quarter length of a friend, Drax, resplendent in his patchwork shirt.
My only gripe against the Portrait Award is its restriction to artists of 40
and under. The young already have enough going for them - yet another
competition or award for young artists 'in those difficult years after
leaving college' would be one too many. Artists in mid-career need
encouragement too, and there are many whose premature exclusion has been the
award's loss in the longer term.
David Remfry is one of them, a most accomplished figure draughtsman and a
virtuoso of water-colour, which he regularly exploits on the largest scale
the medium can reasonably stand. The evidence of this latest show is that
his handling of it is growing ever more radical, free and experimental,
whatever the apparent subject of the work might be, bringing the eye always
back to the surface, to the stroke of the brush and the flow of the paint.
His principal subject has always been the female figure, young, beautiful
and active, usually in her party clothes and often be-hatted. This new work
at the Mercury continues his trend of recent years in extending that
particular pre-occupation into larger, more complex and ambitious
compositions - the night-club, the party, the dance, with Remfry's friends
supplying the immediately recognisably dramatis personae. Few artists catch
the life and movement, the very spirit of the party with such wit and light
dexterity.
Geoffrey Humphries is another remarkable draughtsman of the figure, which
remains his principal subject, in life-painting and portraiture. He includes
one or two such examples in this exhibition at Albion, but for once the bulk
of the work is of a different kind. He has spent most of his time in Venice
these many years, yet so domineering is the city as a subject that he has
long fought shy of it. Latterly, however, he has begun to work from it at
last, not in the conventional and familiar image of Grand Canal, Piazza and
Palazzo, but rather the intimate and informal city of his own daily life, of
bar and shop, alleyway and waterfront.
In all of this he has been working mainly in water-colour for practical
reasons. The results come small in scale but in remarkable quantity, and
with an economy of statement, and delicacy of touch that grow surer with
every one.
The BP Portrait Award 1994: National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place
WC2, until September 4; sponsored by British Petroleum. David Remfry: A
Little Night Music; Mercury Gallery, 26 Cork Street W1, until July 23.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Controversy rages over Velazquez - Susan Moore ponders
the fate of a questionable 'Immaculate Conception' / Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a painting by a major Old Master turns up on the market without
provenance and undocumented in the literature on the artist, it is almost
inevitable that the
art world is riven in its opinion of the work's authenticity.
In 1990, the French dealer Charles Bailly paid a sensational FFr18m - over
Pounds 2m - for an 'Immaculate Conception' offered at auction in Paris as
'circle of Velazquez'. Convinced it was by the master himself - as,
presumably, was the unknown underbidder - he set about trying to prove his
case and tempt a buyer.
Four years on, the picture's appearance at Sotheby's in London can be seen
as a measure of his failure to date - and of the reluctance of some museums
and art historians to involve themselves in attributing a picture that
happens to belong to the trade.
Relieved of its masking grime and x-rayed before the sale (almost unheard of
auction-house practice), the painting is being offered on Wednesday with a
Pounds 6m estimate as an autograph early Velazquez.
The controversy raging around the picture highlights once again the power of
experts to make or break a picture at auction. The world of Old Master
connoisseurship offers few certainties, and the slightest scholarly
reservation often freezes a collector's hand as it reaches for the cheque
book. Museum trustees tend to be an even more cautious breed.
The success of the auction may depend on whether any European or North
American institution can steel its
nerve to pay Pounds 6m or so (the reserve price has yet to be set) for a
picture that perhaps half the relevant authorities believe to be by Alonso
Cano, Velazquez's fellow apprentice in Seville.
The second question looming large over the sale is whether anyone with the
wherewithal to buy a Velazquez would want this one - not one of
the master's earthy bodegones or late court portraits, but an austerely
intellectual religious image? That said, Velazquezs likely to reach the
market are hardly thick on the ground.
Paris also turned up one of the highlights of the Old Master drawings show
currently at Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox. This unexpectedly delicate pen and brown
ink study by Rubens was offered at the Drouot in 1992 as 'circle of Van
Dyck' where it was bought in and later acquired by a French dealer for its
frame.
Subsequently bought by Hazlitts, the drawing was identified by Michael Jaffe
as a study for Rubens's 'Le Christ a la Paille' in
Antwerp. When the drawing was lifted from its mount, figure studies for
another Rubens composition were discovered on its verso. The asking price
for this double-sided sheet is around Pounds 200,000.
Discoveries appear to be
the theme of the week. On Wednesday, Christie's London offers an impressive
Assyrian relief of a eunuch and a bearded winged divine from the Palace of
Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud of 883-859 BC.
Part of the loot excavated by Sir Henry Layard in 1845-48, the bas relief
remained at Canford Manor after the house became a public school. There,
lining the tuck shop wall and covered in whitewash, it was thought to be one
of a group of plaster casts. A figure in excess of Pounds 750,000 is
expected.
No less remarkable at Christie's on Tuesday is the previously unrecorded
horn of a unicorn (produced, if truth be told, by the more prosaic narwhal,
a small
arctic whale), lovingly carved in mid 12th century England.
Among the most prized of medieval and renaissance treasures, these horns
commanded extravagant prices. Pope Clement VII paid 17,000 ducats to secure
one; Michelangelo agreed to paint the Sistine Ceiling for 3,000.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: All to play for and everything to lose -
Peter Berlin in Washington previews the second-round knock-out phase, and
argues that no team emerged from the group games head and shoulders above
the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Cup enters its serious phase today. The first 36 games have
eliminated eight of the 24 starters. The next 15 matches - four knock-out
rounds - will determine the winner.
The group matches did not provide many clues to go on. No team won all their
games and none has produced three good performances. Some have played well
in patches, but all have looked beatable. The second round is often where
the contenders start to flex their muscles.
Reigning champions Germany have looked lumpen, and meet the plodding
Belgians in Chicago this afternoon. The Germans are not happy. They dislike
the heat. Their ponderous defence has depended heavily on goalkeeper
Illgner's speed off the line and willingness to hurl himself at the feet of
strikers.
This risky ploy should be less necessary against Belgium, who have used four
strikers, all of them, apparently, equally slow and clumsy. Against Saudi
Arabia they attacked ceaselessly and uselessly from the air. The Belgian
captain and their most influential player, Scifo, believes Belgium are at
their most dangerous when they are the underdogs.
But the Gemans have more potent weapons in Klinsmann and Riedle, who broke
his drought with a goal against South Korea. They must have salivated as
they watched Saudi Arabia slice through the Belgian defence on Wednesday.
The Germans are being tormented by their press; there are tales of rifts in
the team; and Effenberg, a talented but obnoxious mid-field player, has been
thrown off the squad - for being obnoxious. Even so, they should be able to
kick sand in the Belgians' faces.
Today's other game features a pair of second-placed teams. Spain and
Switzerland have produced passages of good play, but not enough to suggest
that either can expect to grace the later stages of the competition. The
Spaniards are in the finals for the ninth time, but have reached the last
eight only twice, while the Swiss are hoping their occasionally fluid
teamwork can take them past Spain for the first time in 17 games. Caminero,
who scored twice for Spain against Bolivia, is missing because of a one-game
suspension.
Tomorrow, Saudi Arabia play Sweden at noon in Dallas, where temperatures
topped 110`F in Tuesday's game between Germany and South Korea. The Saudis
come from the desert but they seemed to wilt against Belgium in Washington
on Wednesday. They still won. They showed pace and flair in attack and dealt
comfortably with Belgium's aerial assault.
But if they allow Sweden as much possession as they gave Belgium and
Holland, they are unlikely to survive.
Argentina - the perennial survivors - take on Romania in Los Angeles.
Argentina looked overpowering in their first two games but underpowered in
their last, a defeat against Bulgaria when they were missing Maradona's deft
touch, most obviously at free kicks, where his accuracy and imagination was
replaced by unrehearsed clumsiness. Yet they won the Copa America last year
without Maradona and also without Caniggia, who has hurt a toe.
Furthermore, since the Argentinians had already qualified for the second
round they could be forgiven an evening off, particularly as they knew that
the lower they finished the easier their second round opponents would be.
Between them Bulgaria and Argentina set a single-game yellow-card record.
Romania are as niggly as the Bulgarians and play an even more cautious
counter-attacking game. Raducioiu will sit out the game thanks to picking up
two yellow cards.
Argentina could revert to their defensive posture of four years ago. But
they know that victory will bring them a winnable quarter-final against
Sweden or Saudi Arabia. Now is the time for Rodrigues, Redondo, Batistuta
and Balbo to step out of the shadows.
The Dutch - great under-achievers - still carry the aura of title
contenders. Four years ago their team contained Gullit, Van Basten, Rijkaard
and Koeman, all world-class, and yet played poorly for four games and were
eliminated at this stage.
Gullit and Van Basten are gone, to be replaced by Bergkamp, Overmars, Jonk
and Roy. Holland remain less than the sum of their parts and on Monday meet
the Irish who beat them 1-0 in Tilburg last April. But the weather was
different there.
Both teams have already played in steamy Orlando and both have said they
cannot stand the heat. The Irish have played impressively, but their form
dipped in their one game in Orlando, a loss to Mexico. Monday's game will be
a test of will and water retention as much as of skill and tactics.
The reward is a trip to Dallas, the hottest of the quarter-final sites,
where the likely opponents will be Brazil, the most plausible pretenders to
the trophy. Brazil play the US in San Francisco on Monday  - July 4 - and
the Americans are excited. 'I think we're all psyched to play against
Brazil,' said Lalas, the American centre-back. 'They're such a brilliant
team and have such great players.'
The organisers agree. This could not have worked out better. The US team
have stoked public interest. Americans do not like losers, but defeat
against Brazil, which even the most ill-informed American sports fans
associate with soccer, would be acceptable, especially if Brazil can find
the dazzling form they hinted at in the first round. The US will be without
John Harkes, one of their most impressive players so far, who misses the
game through suspension.
Nigeria's injury-time goal against Greece gave the Super Eagles the honour
of winning their group - an African first - but it brings a dubious reward:
Italy.
Italy have a habit of consolidating as World Cups progress. They are a big,
fast team: Nigeria will not be able to out-run or out-muscle them. Nigeria
have been breathtaking at times, but against Argentina they were
out-manoeuvred, and the canny Italians will provide an equally severe test
of their tactical sophistication.
Yet Italy must answer some questions themselves. Will their fragile
confidence start to strengthen? When will Signori and Roberto Baggio find
their form? Is Massaro about to emerge as the Schillaci or the Rossi of this
World Cup?
The second round will finish with two teams whose abilities lie in attack if
only they dared rely on them. The Mexicans are fast and skilful yet somehow
lethargic when moving from defence to attack. The Bulgarians, who will be
without three defenders after giving Jouini, the Tunisian referee, writer's
cramp on Thursday night, possess two exhilarating strikers in Kostadinov and
Stoichkov.
Their chief offensive strategy has been to win penalties, which Stoichkov
then converts. It could be an important skill: while the second round brings
the stomach-wrenching tension of knock-out play, it also brings the prospect
of games decided by penalty shoot-outs.
If teams like Bulgaria opt to sit out two hours' play in the hope of winning
spot-kick roulette, the good memories of the first two weeks of this World
Cup will be obliterated.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Argentina's lapse foils strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, my strategy of backing Latin America plus Romania in the World
Cup was looking really brainy, until Argentina messed me about by not
winning their group, Michael Thompson-Noel writes.
Colombia - spit, spit - were a mistake. Their exit cost me Pounds 77 (Pounds
70 stake plus 10 per cent betting tax). But two of my other three teams,
Brazil and Romania, won their first-round groups. Even the Argies were
cruising nicely until losing to Bulgaria. They still qualified, but only in
third place.
I have backed Romania at 25-1 and 33-1: two bets of Pounds 10 each-way
(Pounds 10 to win plus Pounds 10, at half-odds, to reach the final). I found
the 33-1 by shopping around after they had beaten Colombia. To biff the
bookies, you have to shop for odds. At present, victory for Romania would
yield a net profit of Pounds 635 on total stakes so far (all four teams) of
Pounds 275 ('net' meaning profit minus all losing bets and tax).
If the Argies win, the profit would be Pounds 275. Brazil: a net loss of
Pounds 35. To date, I have been treating Brazil as a saver. Trouble is,
since the start of the competition Brazil have slumped from 3-1 to less than
2-1 - excessively ungenerous.
Am I worried by the impact on Argentina of Maradona's expulsion for
drug-taking? Not a lot. A betting strategy based on a single player would be
a ridiculous one indeed. What is really irritating is that Argentina and
Romania now meet in the second round, and that only one of my three teams
can reach the final.
All extremely wretched. But the bookies aren't safe. I am preparing Plan B.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: Low-scoring trend reversed - World Cup '94
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More goals, more chances, and more attempts to score. That is a snapshot of
the World Cup finals so far.
Helped by regulations to punish defensive and foul play, the tournament has
reversed the trend to low-scoring games. This time, 36 first-round games
produced 93 goals, compared to 80 four years ago.
Fifa, soccer's governing body, decided to act after the 1990 World Cup
produced a record low goals-per-game average of 2.2.
The problems, Fifa believed, were frequent back-passing to goalkeepers,
negative play to achieve a draw, and repetitive fouling to stop opponents
shooting at goal.
So Fifa stopped goalies collecting kicked-back passes with their hands; made
the off-side rule kinder to attackers; and told referees to expel defenders
who hauled down strikers when they were going for goal. It also awarded
three points for a first-round win instead of two.
The result, says Brazilian soccer ace Pele, is a better game to watch and
good news for attackers. 'My opinion is (that) we have to applaud and
congratulate Fifa because these changes have worked very well so far,' he
said.
'These rule changes are the reason why we see so many goals and open games
and beautiful games. I think it is perfect for the public.'
Although seven first-round matches were drawn, only two failed to produce a
goal. Last time, 11 first-round games saw only one goal. This time it was
eight.
Goalkeepers have become far busier. There has been much more goal-mouth
action. 'There is more spectacle,' says Fifa's Sepp Blatter, attributing
this to better match control and better behaviour by players.
Russia's Salenko (six goals), Germany's Klinsmann (four), and Argentina'a
Batistuta, Sweden's Dahlin and Brazil's Romario (all three) lead the list of
goal-scorers.
Salenko, after setting a finals goal record with five against Cameroon, will
not have the opportunity to add to his tally. Bulgaria's victory over
Argentina and Nigeria's win over Greece meant Russia were eliminated.
'I had hoped Russia would continue playing and maybe finish as the
tournament's best scorer,' Salenko said. 'If there is any satisfaction, I'm
still holding the other record.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: Score a victory for the naive nations - Peter Aspden
finds soccer's traditional giants under threat / World Cup '94
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a magical moment during Argentina's impressive victory over
Nigeria when the African team's back four may have wished they were watching
the game on TV.
It came when Argentina were given a free kick in an attacking position on
the left, and the camera zoomed in on Claudio Caniggia's anxious features.
'Diego, Diego]', we saw him scream. 'Behind you, behind you]', we responded,
hoping to rouse the Nigerians from their apparent slumber.
It was too late. The world's most glamorous drug rehabilitation double act
snapped into action and a switch back to the long-distance camera confirmed
our worst fears: Caniggia was indeed utterly unmarked, the ball was indeed
despatched to him with awesome accuracy by Maradona, and Argentina went
ahead.
It was a classic example of what pundits like to call a naive piece of
defending. Naive defenders, like their close cousins, exuberant mid-fielders
and free-ranging attackers, are in a commentators' category all of their
own. What is remarkable is that they all seem to come from countries in
football's 'developing world', and are usually patronised in this way as
they are about to give a 'traditional' footballing nation a right stuffing.
Thus immediately after Saeed Owairan had scored his magnificent solo goal
for Saudi Arabia against Belgium, the ITV commentary team worried that the
Saudis would get 'over-excited' about their lead and let Belgium back into
the game. (They didn't)
This - of course - in sharp contrast to the consummate 'professionalism' of
the Irish team, who were commended by virtually every TV panellist for not
being tempted to push too many men forward while grinding out their
execrable draw against Norway.
To his credit, the Wimbledon striker John Fashanu, commenting for the BBC
(not, as stated last Saturday, for ITV), resisted John Motson's offer to
castigate the Nigerian defence for its ingenuousness, preferring to
concentrate on the Argentinians' excellence.
But it was a testing match for the lover of stereotype, with the 'innocent'
Africans out-fouling the 'cynical' South Americans by a staggering 24-1 in
the first half. Even then, Motson could not refrain from a melodramatic:
'Are these fouls or are the Argentinians diving?'
South Korea naively conceded three sloppy goals in their match with Germany,
before naively realising that this German side were actually very poor and
could quite easily be beaten. They didn't quite make it; but the notion that
the football globe can be divided into sophisticated, knowing European and
South American sides and a rest of the world struggling near the bottom of a
long learning curve is looking increasingly absurd.
Myths die hard, however. Brazil, for example, technically excellent as ever,
are nowhere near justifying the praise heaped on them. Their midfield looks
unimaginative and one-paced, and far too much is being asked of Romario, who
might just struggle against the uncompromising centre-backs of the US on
Monday.
With Argentina's aspirations seemingly undone by a nasal spray and Italy
looking as neurotic and angst-ridden as their 1982 side after the first
round (who went on to win the tournament, it must be said), the time looks
perfect for a new entrant into football's ultimate establishment, the
club-of-six World Cup-winning nations.
How about Romania, with Gheorghe Hagi's sliced mis-hits into the top corner?
Or the over-excited Saudis and the spectacular Owairan? The heat-seeking
Mexicans? It could be the year of the naive in the land of opportunity, and
the countries which have traditionally dominated world football might just
have to admit that - for now - they have run out of ideas.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: One more shot at being an immortal - Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The odyssey began 33 years ago in Revnice, a small town just outside Prague.
On the practice wall at the local tennis club a wiry little girl aged 4 1/2
swung her grandmother's old wooden tennis racket for the first time.
Because she was so small, Martina Subertova held the racket with both hands
and would spend hours on the practice wall - ' . . . queen of the two-handed
backhand', she remembers in her autobiography, Being Myself.
An American citizen since 1981 and universally acknowledged as the queen of
tennis, Martina Navratilova (she took the name of her mother's second
husband), will this afternoon attempt to complete the odyssey on a high note
by winning a record 10th Wimbledon singles title.
Tomorrow's men's final will be between the 22-year-old American Pete
Sampras, who won Wimbledon for the first time last year, and the Croatian
left-hander Goran Ivanisevic, a finalist two years ago. Despite losing his
first set of the tournament in yesterday's semi-final, Sampras returned the
second serve of fellow American Todd Martin with such authority that his 6-4
6-4 3-6 6-3 win had an air of inevitability about it.
Ivanisevic was equally impressive in beating three-times former champion
Boris Becker of Germany 6-2 7-6 6-4. The Croatian's serve was intimidating
and his ability to deliver an ace at will - he sent down another 22
yesterday to take his six-match total to 140 - put Becker under such
pressure that he seemed doomed once he had lost the opening set.
This will be a battle of the giants, and may become a one-dimensional
serving contest. Sampras should win, but he has lost five of his eight
matches against Ivanisevic, who also won their only two meetings on grass -
the Wimbledon semi in 1992 and the final in Manchester a year earlier. Sit
back, fasten your seat belts and stand by for fireworks.
Today's women's final will be highly emotional as Martina takes on
22-year-old Conchita Martinez, the first finalist from Spain since Lili de
Alvarez, who achieved the feat three years in a row between 1926 and 1928
but never won.
It will also be a testing occasion because Martinez is one of the few
players with a winning record against Navratilova. However, all four of
their meetings have been on the slow red clay of the Foro Italico in Rome, a
surface that favours Martinez's topspin baseline game.
Navratilova won their first encounter there in 1990 but lost in 1991, '93
and in this year's final, a match that cruelly exposed Martina's relative
slowness about the court these days.
During her progress through six rounds at Wimbledon, Navratilova has
gradually improved her mobility by practising against Jim Courier and some
of the other men. She has been urged on by another great former champion,
Billie Jean King, who, for four years, has been helping her rediscover the
simple joy of hitting tennis balls across a net.
This delight was never more apparent than in Navratilova's semi-final on
Thursday against her near neighbour in Aspen, Colorado, Gigi Fernandez. Her
6-4 7-6 win was a joyous occasion for both of them.
No longer a two-handed player, Martina has brought the art of grass court
tennis to near perfection these last 22 years. The ultimate professional,
Navratilova's swinging service is the best the game has seen; her touch and
power on the volley have never been surpassed; and her variety from the back
of the court is greater than any of her contemporaries.
To have reached the final for a 12th time is a staggering achievement. Until
today Navratilova had shared the record of 11 final-round appearances with
Charlotte Sterry who, as Charlotte Cooper, won the first of five titles in
1895.
Mrs Sterry was also Wimbledon's oldest champion when she won for the last
time in 1908, aged 37 years and 282 days - 25 days older than Navratilova is
today.
Age may well play a part in today's match. Martinez was noticeably faster
about the court than Navratilova in winning her semi-final against Steffi
Graf's conqueror, American Lori McNeil.
That was another exciting affair, won in the end by Martinez 3-6 6-2 10-8.
In the crucial closing stages Martinez was the more determined and the more
successful at producing telling shots on important points.
Martinez also hits the ball harder than Navratilova, a factor that was
decisive in her win against Martina in Rome this year. Against that, the
faster grass surface will enable Navratilova to impose her attacking game in
a way that was impossible in Rome.
There, serve-and-volley were suicidal; here at Wimbledon they could be her
salvation. Then there are the imponderables.
How will Martinez react to her first experience of a grand slam final? Will
Navratilova be able to cope with her own volatile emotions and those of
excitable spectators?
Whatever the outcome, this will be a momentous occasion. After so many
extraordinary upsets following the removal of Graf on the second day, it is
tempting to suggest that the gods, in honour of the greatest female player
of all time, have decided to give her one last chance at immortality.
Certainly Navratilova is ready to grasp the moment this afternoon as she
walks out to the roar of her devoted followers for the last time.
'This is what I wanted. I've got that opportunity one more time. That's what
I said when I walked off the court last year - I'll be back one more time.
'What a way to go] Geez, this is what I dreamed about. Win or lose . . .
this is what I wanted, to go out in style. You know I'm going to absolutely
enjoy every moment.'
So are we, Martina.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: A cox's lot is not a happy one - Michael Whale on his
self-imposed fast for Henley / Rowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WHALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose if I were to consult a doctor he would advise that at 5ft 7 1/2 in
tall, and weighing a mere 8st 8lb (55 kilos), there was something severely
wrong with my metabolism.
Not so. I am a coxswain taking part in this week's Henley Royal Regatta, and
severe loss of weight is the self-imposed penalty required to cox a crew of
super-fit and dedicated Imperial College students in the Thames Cup.
We trade under the name of Queen's Tower, a strange architectural quirk at
the centre of the college which is behind the Albert Hall in Kensington,
London.
As the eight-man crew endeavours to increase its weight and strength through
daily training, the cox is often the butt of their ire.
As you obey the coach's secret pre-race instructions and, in horse-racing
terms, apply the whip in the last furlong, there are moments when you can
read the hatred in their eyes.
One of the ways they get their own back is to judge how much weight you can
lose before a big event such as Henley. It was not my coxing prowess but my
weight loss that won most praise before this week's competition.
Having observed diet books climbing the weekly best-seller lists, I am busy
on The Henley Diet by The Coxswain. Unfortunately, its sales appeal would be
limited because it is as slim as its author.
I can, however, tell you that the main requirement is a three or six-mile
run before breakfast, quite often combined with steering my crew for an hour
from Putney to Mortlake at 7am.
The advantage of this start to the day is that it removes any appetite for
breakfast, apart from a cup or two of strong coffee.
After a hot bath, with a liberal amount of cooking salt in the water to
remove the aches of running, comes the daily visit to the scales.
Coxes, rather like inspectors of weights and measures, frequently find fault
with the accuracy of scales. Inevitably we feel they put weight on, rather
than record the wasting truth.
Living, as I do, on a regime of Ogen melon for lunch, and either chicken,
fish or hard-boiled egg and salad for dinner, my mood can become fractious
if I am not occupied every minute of the day.
Thankfully, I have discovered that a cox's diet permits a glass or two of
red wine in the evening. So, just as I have developed a craving for reading
recipe books, I am becoming an expert on the lower end of the red wine
market.
This week we are staying in a large house in Henley. At breakfast the crew
counts every crumb I eat. To add insult to injury I have been put in charge
of organising and must help prepare the massive evening meal for the crew.
Near the boat tents, I came across Jurgen Grobler, Great Britain's rowing
manager. We had met previously. I reintroduced myself, and said: 'I'm only
55 kilos, you know. How about being picked for England?'
I don't think he understood my humour.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: In the volcano's shadow - Financial Times Round the
World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are now in Chile.
We left Portillo just as the first real guests were arriving at the Chilean
resort's colonial-style 1940s hotel, which sits like a beached cruise-ship
on the shore of the Laguna del Inca.
Suddenly, after a surreal week of waiting - during which we often dined as
the only guests in the wood and leather-panelled restaurant - the principal
characters seemed to step out of their sepia freeze-frames to materialise
into full, animated colour.
Jimmy Ackerson, who had guided us around Heavenly ski resort in California
last January, was here wearing his bright red Portillo fleece for his eighth
annual term of office as ski school director during the California summer.
The menu, which we had come to know and love during our week of exotic exile
(smoked salmon every day), suddenly changed - and would change again every
night for the next three weeks before rotating all over again.
The hotel stocks enough food for 400 guests for 21 days because the pass
between Los Andos and Mendoza, across the Argentine border, can be blocked
by snow for up to a week at a time. And two doctors were installed in the
medical department, complete with glistening operating theatre, where
surgery can be carried out in an emergency.
Portillo's owner, Henry Purcell was on the mountain 'running the hotel from
a radio in his hip-pocket as usual' as Ackerson put it.
The new arrivals were mainly well-to-do Chileans with a sprinkling of guests
from the US. Skiing is still an elitist sport in Chile.
We celebrated our two-millionth vertical foot of skiing at Portillo. And
thanks to our sponsors we are still on course to ski every day of 1994.
Indeed, without our sponsors we would be very poor indeed - at the halfway
stage of our expedition, we worked out that American Airlines have flown us
35,000 miles and eight Avis vehicles have carried us more than 18,000 miles.
Including every form of transport - skis, ski lifts, Japanese bullet trains,
cars and jets - we have travelled well over 70,000 miles, almost the
equivalent of three times round the world, averaging more than 400 miles a
day since January 1.
Now we were about to commence our longest drive in a single day: 450 miles
from Portillo to Termas de Chillan, to ski on a volcano. Chile has 55 active
volcanoes, and some of them are ski areas. Llaima for example, where we
shall be skiing next, has erupted 10 times this century - most recently in
May this year.
As we meandered back down the pass, we drove past miles of railway track -
the legacy of the Transandean Railway, which early this century was
effectively Chile's first ski lift. Rather like the one in Wengen,
Switzerland which spawned the 'Down Hill Only' Club, it was used by
Englishmen (mainly engineers working on the construction of the railway) who
introduced recreational skiing to the area.
But apart from the magic of the mountains, it was a nightmarish journey  -
like driving along a completely unlit motorway with pedestrians, dogs and
cyclists with no lights - mere shadows in the night - trying to cross your
path at every opportunity, as huge trucks and coaches bear down on you at
80mph.
Then, with 10 miles to go, the wheels of our estate car spun hopelessly on
the ice-covered dirt track that serves as a road for the final 20 miles to
the ski area. It was almost midnight. Walking the final 10 miles seemed
ridiculous, as did trundling back along the 10 miles of rutted track and
then driving a further 40 miles back to Chillan to try to find a hotel. We
took one last run at it, but it was no use.
It was our own fault: we had chains in the car but the thought of trying to
put them on the middle of nowhere on a cold Andes night was just too
daunting. We retreated to Chillan. It was 2.30am but we found an hotel open
 -the Gran Isabel Riquelme.
Exhausted, we slept, blissfully unaware of Chillan's tragic history: after
being destroyed a number of times by foreign invaders, it was then flattened
five times by earthquakes, the last - in 1939 - destroying 90 per cent of
the city and claiming 15,000 lives.
The next day, Termas de Chillan arranged for someone to travel with us to
fix the chains, but thanks to a grim-faced piece of driving, his services
were not required.
Although skiing started in the area in the 1930s, Termas de Chillan has only
recently begun to realise its potential, and only about one fifth of the
possible ski area has been properly opened up. Imagine a snowscape with a
few scattered fumeroles belching out sulphur, and you have an idea of the
scale and the smell of the terrain.
It is the only resort in South America with hot springs at the base lodge,
and as many people come for the sulphur baths, hydro massage and mud therapy
as for the skiing.
The first proper ski lifts were installed 10 years ago. One of them, Don
Otto, with a vertical drop of well over 2,000ft, is the longest in South
America. One off-piste run, Shangri La, is almost nine miles long although
you need a guide and transport back to the resort. But the widespread bowls,
gullies and chutes on either side of the lift - all of them off-piste - give
the resort its most exciting and challenging skiing.
The head of the ski patrol, Hector Navarette Garrido, accompanied us on two
superb runs: Condor, a steep, sweeping gulley, and Tres Marias, a gentler
scenic run, almost three miles long.
In his South America Ski Guide, Chris Lizza, a ski patrolman at Mammoth,
mentions Pirigallo, a particularly challenging bowl. It was closed during
our visit but Lizza reports that during this descent 'the faint scent of
sulphur will begin to overwhelm already stressed lungs as skiers become
engulfed in clouds of the noxious steam at the bottom of the bowl'.
Lucy, who had nightmares as a child about volcanoes, is relieved that when
we ski at Llaima, we shall be lodging a safe distance away at Robert
Stanton's farm near a small community called General Lopez, near Temuco,
Chile's fourth largest city.
Stanton, more used to planning itineraries for summer clients of Passage to
South America, a British tour operator, is helping us plan our skiing
itinerary in Chile and Argentina.
We have discovered that we are not allowed to drive a rented car across the
border. Thus, we may have to get to Bariloche, Argentina's most famous
resort, by bus. But this leaves at 6am - too early to ski before we set off
 -and does not arrive until 6pm - too late to ski when we arrive . . .

Wines served out of doors, where a breeze can waft away their flavour, need
to be extra assertive - doubly so if they have to do battle with charred
food and barbecue sauces.
Many a brash New World wine comes into its own in the (hickory) smoke, such
as Safeway's Australian Hunter Valley 1993 Chardonnay, at Pounds 4.99, and
Waitrose's South African Backsberg 1992 Chardonnay, at Pounds 5.95.
When Oddbins takes delivery of its Chilean Errazuriz 1993 Chardonnay at
Pounds 4.99 this month, that, too, will do nicely.
For a Friday or Saturday night (but not on a night before an early morning
start), Baileys Shiraz 1992 (Pounds 4.99 Oddbins) is the archetypal barbecue
wine: 14.5 per cent alcohol, great concentration and a deep, deep flavour
from north east Victoria in Australia. This wine should be even better in a
year.
In rather the same mould, but slightly less of a sledgehammer, is Asda's
clever exclusivity, Kanonkop Bouwland 1992 made from a well-judged blend of
grape varieties by South Africa's celebrated winemaker Beyers Truter.
For those who prefer less of a cerebral challenge from their barbecue red,
Waitrose have the soft, aromatic bordeaux blend of Avontuur Cabernet/Merlot
1993 at Pounds 3.99, a South African designed for immediate drinking.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Where there's smoke, there's an American -
The history and ritual of one of the glories of American cooking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MARIANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not too long ago most everything a man ate was cooked outdoors over an open
fire. But, while grilling food over a smoky fire has become a relic to most
civilisations, barbecuing continues to be America's greatest gustatory
glory, refined over centuries by both native and new Americans.
In fact, the term barbecue comes from a Taino Indian word for a latticework
grill, and true barbecue has more to do with long, slow smoking than it does
with merely throwing meat on a grill.
Open-pit barbecuing is still a primordial man's world in America and a lot
of men will tell you barbecuing is an art form, like gear-shifting and VCR
programming. Southerners, and Texans in particular, get very protective
about what they consider integral to their history and they do not wish to
see it compromised into a mere marketing tool.
'Down here (in Texas), barbecue is not a word, it's a cultural thing,'
insists Robert Del Grande, chef-owner of Houston's Cafe Annie (713-840-1111)
'and you have to understand the depth of that.
'Too many chefs just throw spices on grilled meat and call it barbecue,
which is like saying you are doing Indian food merely by adding some curry
powder to a stew.'
There are dozens of barbecue contests held around the US each year. Memphis,
Tennessee, which claims to be the nation's barbecue capital - an idea
scoffed at by every other state - stages a no-holds barred World Champion
Barbecue contest each May composed of equal parts culinary wizardry and
Mardi Gras ribaldry. One competitor transformed a Japanese sedan into a
barbecue cooker while challengers from Federal Express rigged up a four-foot
model jet aeroplane as a smoker.
The two main forms of American barbecue are historically and geographically
determined by the Mississippi River: in the east, pork is king; in the west,
beef is preferred. The Indians showed settlers the basic techniques - they
even barbecued a few settlers now and then  - and the basting sauce
ingredients, chilli peppers and tomatoes, are indigenous to the Americas.
After that regional distinctions can get positively byzantine.
In North Carolina alone there are at least two principal styles of barbecued
pork, which comes either in the form of ribs or as shredded butt meat (the
hams) served on a hamburger bun. In the western part of the state, the
basting sauce is ketchup rich and fairly sweet; in the east they favour a
chilli-pepper-based sauce with plenty of vinegar in it.
In Texas they prefer a dry ribbed seasoning rather than sauce on beef
brisket, accompanied by nothing more than sliced white bread, cold beer and
a raw jalapeno chilli pepper.
Making a great American barbecue, of the kind you will find cooked up in a
Quonset hut along a roadside in Alabama, is more a question of patience and
ingenuity than it is of flawless technique. If you have got some form of
covered, kettle-shaped grill and 12 hours to spend tending it, anyone can
make reasonably good barbecue.
The secret is in keeping the food away from the fire. That is, build a small
fire of charcoal to one side of the grill, let it burn down so that there is
no flame. Place some small pieces of seasoned fruit wood soaked for an hour
in water on top, then place the meat on the other side of the grill. Cover
it, and let the smoke work its slow alchemy.
Meats may be basted, although you need not do so continuously if you intend
to serve them with a good bottled barbecue sauce, which in the US have such
evocative names as Mad Dog BBQ Sauce, Willingham's WHAM Sauce, JL Jardine's
Killer Hot Texas Bar-B-Q Sauce, and Crazy Cajun All-Purpose Sauce.
Perhaps Kentucky-raised Dean Fearing, chef at the superior Mansion on Turtle
Creek hotel in Dallas, and cooking at The Lanesborough Hotel, London, until
Friday, explains the mystique of barbecue best: 'From the first time I
tasted true Texas barbecue, my fate was sealed,' he says. 'It was at Sonny
Bryan's BBQ in Dallas, and it took me the next 10 years to achieve the kind
of complex flavours really good barbecue must have. Barbecue is part cooking
and part ritual, so when I die I want to have one hand wrapped around a Lone
Star beer, the other around a rib from Sonny's, lying face down in a pool of
his sauce.'
TEXAS DRY RUB SEASONING
In a mortar bowl crush together 1 tbsp black peppercorns, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tsp
cayenne pepper, 1 tsp cummin, 1 tsp coriander seeds, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1
tsp dried thyme and 1 tsp dried marjoram.
When it achieves the consistency of salt and pepper, apply to meat and let
stand for an hour or so before barbecuing
TEXAS WET SAUCE
In a bowl blend together 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp
dried cumin, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp ground black pepper.
In a saucepan melt 1/4 stick of butter, then add 7 cloves of chopped garlic
and 1 diced large onion.
Saute until the onions become clear and the garlic begins to brown. Add  1/4
cup Worcestershire Sauce,  1/4 cup A-I Steak Sauce, 2 cups ketchup,  1/4 cup
white vinegar, 3 tbs sugar, and the juice of one lemon. Cook until well
blended, then add dry ingredients. Cook slowly over a low flame for at least
40 mins until reduced and thickened. Use as a marinade, basting sauce or
side sauce with barbecued beef.
NORTH CAROLINA EASTERN-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE
In a bowl combine 3 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes, 3 tbsp freshly ground
pepper, 3 tbsp salt,  1/4 cup molasses, 4 cloves minced garlic and mash
together. Add 1 quart of white vinegar and mix. Allow to stand for several
hours. Use as a marinade or basting sauce for pork barbecue.
NORTH CAROLINA WESTERN-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE
In a saucepan, melt 1 stick of butter. Add 1 chopped large onion and 6
cloves garlic and saute until translucent and starting to brown. Add 1 cup
white vinegar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 cloves, 1 tbsp dry mustard, 1 tsp chilli
powder,  1/2 cup brown sugar and  2/3 cup ketchup. Stir together, then add 1
cup water and blend again. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Add salt
and pepper to taste and remove from heat. Best used on pork shoulder.
For measuring purposes in these recipes, a stick of butter is four ounces
and a cup is eight fluid ounces.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Never mind the weather - It is definitely
time to eat outdoors in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never mind the place or the weather. Officially, it is summer, and the
British are determined to eat out of doors. Any excuse will do.
This weekend, there will be strawberry feasts at Wimbledon, cricket teas on
village greens, hampers at Glyndebourne - even vacuum flask and Tupperware
picnics dipped into gratefully on windswept English beaches. Even
stay-at-homes may consider lunching lightly under a tree in the garden or
setting up a barbecue on the patio in the evening.
For recipe ideas, you need look no further than the latest crop of
cook-books.
CRAB TART (serves 4)
Rarely do I warm to cook-books by chefs but Roast Chicken &amp; Other Stories,
by Simon Hopkinson with Lindsey Bareham (Ebury, Pounds 17.99), is
irresistible: one mouth-watering page follows another. Hopkinson points out
that although crab works extremely well here, other sorts of shellfish can
be successful.
Ingredients: The white meat, plus a little of the brown, from a 2lb cooked
cock crab; an 8in short-crust pastry case, blind-baked until cooked through;
1 small tin of Italian plum tomatoes, chopped; 2 garlic cloves, peeled and
chopped; 1 bay leaf; 1 small sprig of thyme; salt and pepper;  1/2 pt double
cream;  1/2 tsp saffron threads; 4 egg yolks.
Method: Heat the oven to 350`F/180`C (gas mark 4). Put the tomatoes, garlic,
herbs and seasoning into a saucepan and reduce to a thickish sauce. Cool,
remove the herbs, and spread the sauce in the bottom of the pastry case.
Warm together 3 tablespoons of the cream and the saffron and allow to steep
for a few minutes. Beat together the yolks and the rest of the cream and add
the saffron cream. Season.
Fold the crab loosely into the custard and pour the mixture carefully into
the tart case. Bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until set and pale
golden-brown. Serve warm. JAPANESE-STYLE SESAME STEAK (serves 4)
This comes from Simply Different, by Sarah Woodward (Macmillan 15.99), a new
(to me) young writer, keen traveller and practical cook. The recipe is not,
by the author's own admission, authentic Japanese but it is quick, easy,
good and suitable for grilling indoors or on a barbecue.
Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb rump steak. For the marinade: 2 tablespoons sesame
seeds; 2 tablespoons light soy sauce, preferably Japanese; 2 tablespoons dry
sherry; 1 teaspoon white sugar. For the dipping sauce: 6 thin spring onions;
1in chunk of fresh ginger root; 2 tablespoons light soy sauce; the juice of
half a lemon; 1 teaspoon white sugar; a few drops of Worcester sauce.
Method: Trim away any fat and cut the meat into  1/2 in x 2in strips. Toast
the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over high heat for a minute or so,
stirring constantly, until they start to pop. Take care they do not burn.
Crush the seeds, mix with the other marinade ingredients, add the steak and
leave for half an hour.
To make the sauce, first chop the white part of the spring onions very
finely and peel and grate the ginger finely. Mix the two together and stir
in the remaining ingredients.
Heat the grill to maximum, placing a metal baking tray under it. When the
baking tray is very hot, add the strips of beef. Grill for two minutes, turn
the meat, baste with the rest of the marinade and grill for one to two
minutes more depending on how well cooked you like your steak.
Alternatively, cook the beef briefly over the glowing coals of a barbecue.
Either way, serve the steak as soon as cooked with a little bowl of dipping
sauce for each person.
BISSARA
Unlike her exciting first book, which was flavoured here and there with fish
and game, Annie Bell's Evergreen (Bantam, Pounds 16.99) follows a more
traditional vegetarian line. This north African puree of broad beans makes a
welcome change from the well-known hummus to serve with warm pitta bread and
other mezze dishes.
Ingredients: 1 1/2 lb broad beans, preferably fresh (but frozen are
perfectly adequate);  3/4 teaspoon fresh green chilli, chopped; 1 teaspoon
cumin seeds, freshly ground; 1 teaspoon sweet, smoky-flavoured paprika; 1
garlic clove, chopped; 7 tablespoons olive oil; the juice of a small lemon;
extra oil, lemon and paprika to serve.
Method: Boil the beans for three to four minutes if fresh, or eight minutes
if frozen. In the bowl of a food processor place the beans, chilli, cumin,
paprika and garlic. Reduce to a puree, trickling in the olive oil and lemon
juice. Season and rub through a sieve. Serve at room temperature in a
shallow dish with some olive oil trickled over the surface, some lemon
juice, and a sprinkling of paprika.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: I don't like this white wine but . . . -
Sauvignon Blanc does have infinite possibilities at this time of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not like Sauvignon Blanc. That is my official position and, being one
of those annoying people who can usually see both sides of every argument,
the silver lining in every cloud, etc, I do rather cherish this, my only
wine prejudice.
But even I have to admit that at this time of year, or at least in very hot
weather, the uncomplicated, nose-clearing, whistle-whetting, disarmingly
simple aromatic acidity of Sauvignon Blanc comes into its own.
It may not be complicated and intriguing, but who, when hot and fractious,
needs complication and intrigue? The piercing perfume of gooseberries,
currant bushes and cats pee will do the trick.
Fortunately, there are relatively cheap, perfectly acceptable Sauvignons in
the shops at the moment.
The classic choice was always Sancerre or Pouilly-Fume, but in my recent
experience it is usually necessary to buy the very best (such as Henri
Bourgeois's Sancerre and Didier Dageneau's Pouilly-Fume) to get a thrill to
match the price. Much better value than most classic Loire Sauvignons are
those made by the best-known 'flying winemakers' (who, since they have been
accused of making all wines taste the same - wrongly in my view - are now
busy repudiating the term).
Domaine St Francois Sauvignon Blanc 1993, just Pounds 3.25 from Asda for
example, is a fragrant, lively, very slightly fizzy, New World sort of wine
made by Hugh Ryman at the Foncalieu co-op in the Languedoc. His
Entre-Deux-Mers, Duras and Bergerac bottlings are also trustworthy, if a
little more expensive.
Jacques Lurton's Sauvignon Blanc Rueda 1993 is a defiantly pungent example
of the variety from north central Spain, sold by Sainsbury's at Pounds 3.99
and Oddbins at Pounds 4.29.
Peter Bright's Bright Brothers Ribatejo Sauvignon Blanc 1993 (Pounds 3.39
Sainsbury's) is not nearly as dramatic but tastes pure, lively and entirely
unexpected from Portugal, (Sainsbury's Chilean Sauvignon at the same price
is, on the other hand, pure tom cat to me). Racy, appetising winemaking
techniques are now much easier to find in south west France, where there is
a vast acreage of Sauvignon Blanc (and Semillon) just waiting to be
transformed into user-friendly refreshment.
Safeway's Bergerac Sauvignon 1993, at Pounds 3.49, is a fruity, please-all
example from the Sigoules co-op, surely known personally to a few
Dordogne-visiting FT readers.
Safeway also has Ch de Plantier 1993 Entre-Deux-Mers at Pounds 3.79 as an
encouraging, well-balanced example of the miracles that have been wrought on
dry white bordeaux very recently. Lots of Sauvignon flavour has been leeched
into this wine which is bolstered by the body of Semillon.
Neither of these wines is nearly as exciting as Waitrose's best two dry
white bordeaux, however. Ch de Haut Rian 1993 Bordeaux at Pounds 3.99 is
even better than Michel Dietrich's 1992 made in the Premieres Cotes de
Bordeaux.
Another Pounds 2.46 buys real class in the form of Ch Carsin 1992 Cuvee
prestige 1992, available at the top 85 Sainsbury's for Pounds 5.45. It is an
intriguing oak-matured dry white bordeaux made by Australian Amanda Jones.
Lively, scented, delicate fruit deepened but not overwhelmed by top quality
oak.
New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is another obvious choice, although only Montana
can provide a consistent product for fans of the tinned asparagus style for
less than Pounds 5.
Top bottlings include Cloudy Bay, Hunters, Jackson Estate, Vavasour, and
Wairau River. They usually sell in the Pounds 27 to Pounds 29 range and are
more usually found at independent merchants than in the chains because of
the quantities available, although Thresher, Bottoms up and Wine Rack have a
better selection than most.
South African Sauvignon can be extremely punchy. The allocation of
Mulderbosch at John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727 6846) is worth
seeking out, at around Pounds 90 a case.
But there is a host of wines other than Sauvignon capable of providing the
same refreshing effect. Vinho Verde from northern Portugal, Albarino from
Spain's Atlantic coast are obvious possibilities. Bottoms Up lists the
nervy, sought-after Rias Baixas Albarino, Lagar de Cervera 1993 at Pounds
8.49.
And then, if it is high acid and refreshing aroma you are after, there is
that grape they call Riesling . . . the under-used resource of the wine
world. Thanks to turmoil in the German fine wine market, there are some
stunning German wine bargains around.
Perhaps best value is Asda's Hochheimer Holle Riesling 1992 Aschrott at
Pounds 4.99. It is not bone dry, more like zesty grapefruit, but would make
great sipping in hot weather.
Waitrose is selling Erdener Treppchen Riesling Spatlese 1986 Monchhof for
only Pounds 5.95, presumably because Monchhof has been particularly keen to
sell.
Winemaking wizard Ernie Loosen has now taken over these vineyards. The
previous owners have given up the struggle to make these superb vineyards
pay. Delicate, mature, light, refreshing essence of top quality middle
Mosel; you would not find a fine, eight-year-old chardonnay at less than
three times this price.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Eating out-of-doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh, the delights of eating out-of-doors] Whether it be having a drink and
snack on the patio, or heading into the hills for a full-scale picnic,
eating outdoors is a quintessential English rite, says Lucia van der Post.
From Ratty and Mole, Wind In the Willows characters, to diarist Francis
Kilvert and author Somerset Maugham, the British have always responded to
the celebratory nature of outdoor food. (Remember Ratty's sublime
incantation: 'coldtonguecold hambeefpickledgherkinssalad
frenchrollscressandwiches pottedmeatgingerbeerlemon adesodawater' which sent
Mole into ecstasies?).
In spite of often dire weather, it is a pleasure the British refuse to give
up. As Georgina Battiscombe says in her book on English picnics: 'A picnic
is the Englishman's grand gesture, his final defiance flung in the face of
fate. No climate in the world is less propitious to picnics than the climate
of England yet, with a recklessness which is almost sublime, the English
rush out of doors to eat a meal on every possible and impossible occasion.'
Quite.
Although some are satisfied with a sandwich, for others, such as the
Duchesse d'Uzes in Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge: 'You can't have a
picnic without pate de foie gras.'
Although one can buy sophisticated equipment for outdoor cooking, it is also
possible to improvise simple barbecues. Huck and Tom Sawyer cooked up a
memorable meal with just some broad oak or hickory leaves, a frying pan and
some freshly-caught perch.
Keith Floyd, the peripatetic chef, in his latest book Floyd on Italy
(Michael Joseph, Pounds 16.99, 191 pages), is photographed enjoying the most
delicious of all breakfasts - freshly caught lake perch, washed and gutted,
and grilled with sprigs of rosemary, lemon juice, salt and pepper with some
country bread and a glass of red wine - all done on a very simple metal grid
placed over an olive wood fire.
Certainly the best outdoor cooked food I have eaten required no elaborate
equipment at all. On a Spanish hillside a friend used local wood, thyme and
rosemary to grill fresh sardines.
Those who like the spontaneity of barbecuing need portable equipment and
should go for something simple and, obviously, not too large. Graham &amp; Green
of 7 &amp; 10 Elgin Crescent, London W11 (tel: 071-727 4594) has a very simple
galvanised tin model from Greece. It would be ideal for sausages, seafood or
small pieces of meat. It is light to move around, easy to clean and costs
just Pounds 45.95.
For those who eat outdoors at home, and are looking for an unusual piece of
barbecuing equipment, German company Heibi Birmann has produced a barbecue
which has a choice of a wok pan top, and a conventional grill. Simple to
use, it runs on charcoal but is special to look at: Pounds 660 from Harrods
of Knightsbridge, London SW1.
A much smaller table-top piece of equipment is the Chaudier, or Table Grill,
by Le Creuset, costing Pounds 69. It runs on gel fuel, which is included in
the purchase price. Replacements can be bought from Le Creuset stockists.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Grills and griddles - the simple and
sublime / Peter Knight and Lucia van der Post have been seeking some classy
additions to the outdoor table ..
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT and LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has to be British - it barbecues in the rain. The new kettle-type gas
barbecue from a UK company called Outdoor Chef should satisfy the growing
number of northern Europeans who have developed a taste for the
Mediterranean charcoal grill, writes Peter Knight.
Granted, some other barbecues can also withstand the northern drizzle too,
but the Outdoor Chef has, more importantly, removed the hazard of fat
flare-ups that plague most of its gas competitors.
When correctly done, barbecued food is deliciously simple. You do not need
any special tools - a box of matches, a few dry twigs and a piece of wire
mesh will do.
That distinctive barbecue taste comes from the fat and juices dropping on to
the hot coals, vaporising and rising to smoke the food above. This flavour
will be further enhanced by the smoke coming from a fire made from wood -
the French swear by grapevine - and can be increased by placing aromatic
wood chips on charcoal while the food is cooking. But you do not need wood
smoke to achieve the barbecue flavour. Good charcoal emits no smoke and that
is why gas barbecues are just as good.
The secret of getting the best flavour is to expose the food to as much of
its own smoke as possible (which makes it important to oil vegetables and
fatless meat while grilling). The best way to ensure a good smoking is to
trap the vaporised juices around the food and that is why the better
barbecues have lids. The lids also trap the heat and the food cooks from
above too.
Flavour, of course, is not the only factor. Some like the cinderish look and
taste of flamed food and others like to get the food, especially potatoes,
right on to the coals. The choice of equipment will influence the look and
taste.
There are two types of barbecue. One grills the food with naked heat from
beneath and, if it has a lid, from above too. The other is a griddle, a slab
of metal heated by gas or charcoal. Griddles are popular in Australia and
South Africa and are becoming available in Europe. Aficionados prefer a
grill where the juices fall on to the heat source.
Grill-type barbecues come in various forms, from the Pounds 3.99 disposable
tray, pre-packed with self-igniting charcoal, to charcoal and gas-driven
devices with lids, which cost anything from about Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,000.
Charcoal barbecues are cheaper than gas (fewer working parts) and give
excellent results, especially if they have a lid that can capture the smoke.
The price depends largely on the quality of construction and materials -
important if you want the contraption to last in the garden.
Their main drawback is the hassle of handling and lighting the charcoal and
then waiting for it to reach its optimum heat output. Lighting usually
involves some form of petrochemical, such as a paraffin block or a fluid.
This makes an unpleasant smell, the fumes are bad for the environment -
banned in certain parts of the US - and can taint the food.
You can overcome the lighting problems by using a portable gas lighter or a
gas blow torch. Another problem is finding good charcoal. Much of the
charcoal sold in Britain is from forests in Asia and South America and is
often badly made.
Good charcoal will be slightly more expensive and an increasing amount is
now being made in the UK from coppiced woodland, an environmentally sound
practice. Look for labels or buy only from responsible outlets such as B &amp;
Q, Do-it-All, Wickes and other members of the World Wildlife Fund 95 Group,
who have pledged to supply wood products from environmentally sound sources.
Most gas barbecues are the American 'coffin' type and look hideous. Until
this year, unless you bought a top-of-the-range Weber - rather ugly when
compared with the company's classic charcoal kettles - you would have risked
the terror of flare-up when cooking fatty foods, such as chicken.
Most gas devices imitate charcoal by using a bed of lava rock heated from
underneath by gas burners. The principle is the same: the hot rocks heat the
food, the juices drop down and are vaporised to return as smoke.
To work effectively the lid has to be down, which concentrates the heat and
confines the flavour-giving vapours. But it does not usually work like that
because fatty foods - especially sausages, lamb, chicken and oily fish such
as mackerel - drop so much fat that the rocks become saturated and a fire
starts.
This means the lid has to be lifted and the heat reduced (either by turning
down the burner or raising the food to a higher level). Both these actions
reduce the efficiency of the system.
The Outdoor Chef gas kettle (Pounds 399 from good garden centres) overcomes
this problem with a simple metal cone device.
The Outdoor Chef kettle can also be used to griddle, roast, stir-fry and
even bake pizza. It also looks good.
The main benefit of gas, once the flare-up problem is overcome, is its ease
of use - it switches on just like a cooker. This means you can cook outdoors
in the winter and bring that summer taste indoors for eating. If this is
your intention, make sure you use the more volatile propane rather than the
common butane gas (a different regulator is needed).
But gas barbecues also have drawbacks. They are expensive to buy (although
they run efficiently), they work badly in wind, the lava-rock models are
prone to fat fires, most look hideous and the quality of materials is low.
If you want to cook outdoors a lot, invest in a high-quality gas model that
does not suffer from fat fires, such as the Outdoor Chef or the Weber, even
if this does set you back Pounds 399 or Pounds 799 respectively. Otherwise,
stick to twigs and matches.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Fashion: Back to the future - Grecian style / In search of
ancient trinkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The glitter of modern jewellery, yours for a king's ransom, may have magpie
appeal but it is easy to tire of its insistent brand of glamour. As even
relatively worthless costume jewellery from a fashionable couture house can
run into hundreds - sometimes thousands - of pounds, why not consider
jewellery from the classical world?
Its appeal lies not only in the soft, matt colouring of the gold, the simple
design, the modest use of cabochon rather than facetted stones, but also in
the fact that it is relatively undervalued. For a few hundred pounds you can
buy an ancient Roman ring, inset with a cornelian intaglio or, for a few
thousand, a simple gold torque.
Anna Somers Cocks, editor of The Art Newspaper and former jewellery expert
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, says that, historically, male collectors
were interested in sculpture, pots and intaglio - jewellery lay forgotten
and uncollected.
But ancient jewellery excites the imagination. Would the Roman senator who
wore an amethyst intaglio ring have been living when the news arrived of the
crucifixion of a prophet called Jesus Christ?
Perhaps I have found the very ring to which Ovid penned these thoughts
before he sent it to his beloved:
'May she receive thee with glad heart, and straightaway slip thee on her
finger; mayst thou fit her as well as she fits me and press her finger with
aptly adjusted circle]'
The pretty lemon-yellow hue of early Greek gold is explained by the fact
that it was only about 75 per cent pure. In the classical period, stones
were seldom used, enamel work was preferred, a feature put down to taste
rather than lack of supply, according to Doctor Dyfri Williams of the
British Museum.
Once Alexander the Great opened up trade with the east, the Middle Eastern
preference for coloured gems such as emeralds, garnets and amethysts,
resulted in more flamboyant, attention-seeking jewellery being made.
Regional tastes, it seems, do not change much down the ages.
In spite of the bold size of some pieces, early Greek jewellery tends to be
remarkably light (and therefore brittle) because it is made from hammered
out sheets of gold, not cast or solid metal.
The eye is struck by the complexity of the handwork. Minuscule round-section
wires, made by hammering and burnishing a thin rod of gold, were twisted and
then rolled between two flat surfaces of wood or metal and then used to
create ornate and delicate filigree work.
Tiny grains of gold were heated, melted and rolled into spheres and then
placed in clusters on a piece of beaten gold. Many can hardly be seen with
the naked eye; only a microscope can reveal the exacting nature of such a
craft.
On Wednesday, Christie's will be auctioning a private collection of ancient
gold jewellery as part of its fine antiquities sale in London. The sale
includes necklaces, earrings, finger rings and pendants from the 8th century
BC to the 12th century AD.
The following day, Sotheby's is offering a smaller array of ancient
jewellery.
For inspiration, the reader may wish to visit the spectacular exhibition of
Greek gold at the British Museum (until October 23), sponsored by Cartier.
There, brought together for the first time, are nearly 200 pieces of the
finest classical Greek jewellery from all parts of the Mediterranean.
If you do decide to buy from other than reputable dealers, be warned - some
collectors believe that up to 50 per cent of the 'ancient' jewellery on the
market is fake. Beginners should be prepared to make mistakes.
Dr Jack Ogden, who authenticated the forthcoming Christie's sale and is a
well- regarded expert who runs the Cambridge Centre for Precious Metal
Research, is the man to verify any serious investment.
'You must ask the right questions because fakes are harder and harder to
detect,' he warns. Clearly, experience counts but, as a rule, he would
suggest that 'there are few fakes produced before 1970 that are really going
to fool someone who takes it seriously'.
Forgery aside, many academics detest the trading of antiquities, arguing
that it encourages grave-robbing and the destruction of archaeological
sites. However, Dr Ogden argues: 'Whenever there's a market in anything it
encourages theft, whether it's a house robbery for an old master, a bike
shed raid for an old bike in Cambridge or a grave for antiquities. The
pieces on the market are not going to be re-buried. I see my job as trying
to record as much information as possible.'
While he admits to wearing a gold bracelet dating back to 700 BC, Dr Ogden
is gradually changing his opinion about whether these ancient pieces should
be worn. 'Wearing a piece does damage it and it also makes it much harder to
authenticate because a lot of the evidence is on the surface; the tool
marks, the deposits and so on. And gold does change slightly with time when
worn. And that rich matt colour begins to dissipate.'
However, he sees little wrong in wearing unimportant pieces and even
encourages the knowing purchase of acknowledged fakes. 'A couple of years
ago there was a gorgeous pair of fake Greek earrings on the market for about
Pounds 2,000. They were absolutely stunning. Even a great piece of fakery,
if you know it's fake, can be a bargain.'
Alessandro Castellani's Victorian fakes, for instance, are highly
sought-after and very collectable. In this growing market, Dr Ogden's
research centre is consulted by costume jewellery dealers. Recently, the
centre was asked to authenticate 1940s Chanel brooches. 'At Dollars 500 or
Dollars 600 a piece, people are bound to try and fake them. It's a joke
really,' says Ogden.
One is left with the view that unless investing serious money (in which case
extensive and costly tests of verification can be sought), then enjoy these
pieces for their refined style and the possibility, however remote, that
Caesar's concubine may have worn your brooch.
Sources of ancient jewellery (071 code unless indicated) include:
Christie's, London. (Tel: 839 9060 - Sarah Hornsby).
Sotheby's, London. (493 8080 - Felicity Nicholson).

Allegra Donn. (381 1568).
For expert verification - Jack Ogden. Tel: Cambridge 0223-67232.
Susan Hadida, Rupert Wace and Robin Symes, although operating in the same
street, deal with different areas of the market. Hadida's prices range from
Pounds 50 for a thin bronze Byzantine bracelet to Pounds 15,000 for an early
Byzantine gold, glass and mother of pearl bracelet. The atmosphere at her
premises is informal. Hadida wants to dispel the illusion that 'these things
can't be touched or worn and only belong in museums'.
Rupert Wace can offer a Romano-British bronze and enamel brooch for between
Pounds 50 and Pounds 1,000 or a wearable Roman intaglio ring for about
Pounds 1,000.
The pride of his collection, which he sold to Durham Museum for Pounds
5,000, was an Egyptian amethyst and gold necklace (800 BC) which, in the
early 19th century, had belonged to the Duke of Northumberland.
Robin Symes has been dealing in antiquities since the early 1970s and has,
particularly, interested academic collectors. You may be able to buy Roman
earrings for Pounds 200 but, more typically, a fine Greek gold chain for
Pounds 40,000.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Travel: Myth and reality of the Rio Grande - Nicholas
Woodsworth hangs out on the US-Mexican border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boca Chica. In my imagination the Rio Grande has always loomed large and
wide, a substantial expression of the frontier and all that is heroically
American. But what is true of the country's favourite sweet and sticky
soft-drink is also true of the river - the real thing is never as impressive
as the myth that surrounds it.
Here, at its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,500 miles from its
source, the Rio Grande is no mighty river. Shallow, muddy and sluggish, it
is barely more than 15 yards across. Standing on its crumbling banks, I felt
deceived. Life on the border is not quite the old west romance you might
think. It is, in fact, far more more curious and compelling than that.
On the other side, a line of rusty pick-up trucks was parked on the beach
and a dozen cowboy-hatted Mexicans were spending a sunny Saturday morning
fishing. Seagulls screamed overhead and excited Latin rhythms floated on the
mild winter air from truck radios.
On the beach, one of the Mexicans threw a metal grill over a fire of broken
fruit crates. Another, all whiskers and paunch, stripped to his bright green
boxer shorts. Wading gingerly into the river, he began casting a circular
throw-net for the whiting that come to the river's mouth at low tide.
His casting was interrupted by the approach of a small motor boat from
up-river. It cut cross-stream and nosed into the Mexican shore. A woman
climbed out of one of the trucks, hopped into the boat, and in 30 seconds
was ferried to the American side. Jumping into a waiting vehicle, she
disappeared down the flat sand beach towards the main road and the city of
Brownsville, half-an-hour away.
'Just one more Dollars 50-a-week cleaning lady,' said Jesse, the young
Chicano I had been chatting to, as he cast a baited hook into the stream.
'No work papers, no resident's card, no minimum wage.'
Jesse has no such worries. Hispanic by blood but American by birth, he is of
two minds about the country across the river. He is a product of la
frontera, and tied to the strongly-flavoured, hybrid border culture that has
grown up along the Rio Grande. He is as 'Tex-Mex' as tacos and enchiladas,
or as Radio Caliente, the local station which serves rapid-fire bilingual
chit-chat and conjunto, the Anglo-Hispanic accordion music of the border.
But Mexico itself appeals little: Jesse knows that if Mexicans are willing
to take up exploited, illegal lives in the US for Dollars 50 a week, it is
because life at home is harder still.
Did he himself often cross the border to Matamoros, I asked? 'Not much.
Liquor is cheaper there. But there's too much hustling - stolen cars,
hookers, drugs, phoney documents, smuggling, scams of all kinds. There are
some real bad guys over there. Last time they took my money.'
Who were 'they', I asked. Street toughs? No, he said, laughing. The police.
For most, life on the border is rarely fair or easy.
Matamoros. An air of shabbiness, poverty, and impermanence hangs over the
Rio Grande, especially here in the seamy bars and billiard halls, the dog
tracks and strip joints, the pawn shops and gun stores. On both sides of the
border you will find people and services providing for and exploiting human
need. Americans cross the border in search of exoticism and surreptitious
pleasures. Most Mexicans seem happy to find rough survival on the other
side.
Essentially, this is no man's land. Trust and familiarity are foreign here -
shop windows are grilled, fences abound, 'No Loitering' signs hang in
parking lots and gas stations. Few outsiders linger along the underbelly of
the US. Most feel a strong sense of place here, but little sense of
belonging. If the border belongs to anyone, it is to the anonymous
transients who stream over it.
The international crossing points over the Rio Grande are a travel bargain.
Where else on earth can you pay 25 cents and in seconds walk from a society
of high-tech mass-consumption to third world neglect and deprivation? It is
along the Rio Grande that the techtonic plates of the north-south divide run
edge to edge.
But in spite of the cracked pavements, the cheap blankets and tourist
trinkets, the sleazy come-ons to buy marijuana or half-an-hour with a young
girl, there is something refreshing about Mexican towns on the Rio Grande.
They have a heart.
On the US side, community life has largely disappeared from downtown
pavements. If it exists anywhere, it is in freeway shopping malls and fast
food places out on the urban peripheries - there are times when America's
soul seems approachable only by car.
Mexican life, though, is immediately accessible. In Matamoros there were
mobile vendors and shoe-shine boys, blind musicians and sellers of lottery
tickets, squeezers of fruit juice and pavement grillers of skewered lamb.
There were crowded markets and city squares graced by orange trees and
bandstands of ornate wrought iron work. Whole families promenaded, entire
armies of men chatted the day away. Shopping malls may be more efficient,
but I will take the streets of Matamoros any day.
The lower Rio Grande Valley. I spent a morning in a trailer park with
Barbara and Archie Dick. If they make the only decent cup of tea in the
whole valley, it is because they have not forgotten their native Glasgow.
They had driven down from the frozen wastes of Ontario, where they now live,
for some winter sunshine. But was it really worth it, I wondered?
Not long ago the valley's wealth came largely from the market gardens and
fruit orchards, sugar cane and cotton fields worked and harvested by Chicano
and Mexican immigrant labour. These days, it is the fast-growing retirement
industry that fills the roadside fields the length of the lower valley.
I do not begrudge retired people their place in the sun, their health and
leisure centres, their golf carts and woodworking classes, their social
evenings that have turned the valley into the square-dancing capital of the
world.
But I did have difficulties with their 80,000 'RVs' - recreational vehicles
 -and the more than 500 monstrous 'RV parks' that blot the landscape here.
RVs - great blocks of lumbering, wheeled real estate that permit the
transfer of ghastly suburbs from one part of the country to the other - may
one day take over the US. When I left the valley to follow the river up to
Big Bend, I counted a convoy of eight 55-ft monsters from Quebec pulling out
behind me, a lost tribe seeking its destiny in the desert.
Laredo. Saturday night in downtown Laredo, on the US side of the border, is
deader than it ever was when this was a dung-spattered frontier town. I
spent the early evening at my motel off Interstate 35 drinking beer with a
crowd of over-nighting truck-drivers. We sat out in the parking lot in front
of a plastic garbage can filled with ice and bottles of Bud, and told dirty
jokes. I have long known that truck drivers are the folk heroes of modern
America. Now I am trying to figure out why.
Nuevo Laredo. Where do all the hip cowboys in Laredo head on a Saturday
night? Answer: Nuevo Laredo on the other side of the Rio Grande. Near the
clubs on Plaza San Miguel, the pavements were jammed and noisy. By midnight
there was car gridlock downtown, and the line to get into the OK Tijuana
discotheque stretched round the corner.
There were no signs of the usual Rio Grande poverty in the OK Tijuana, none
of its striking contrasts. Like the Americans in the place, the Mexicans
were all young, good-looking, well-dressed and well-off. What is more, the
two groups were hardly distinguishable. The Mexican city has a sizeable
middle-class, and its US sister-city a mixed Anglo-Hispanic population.
Big Bend. Nancy Kerrigan, the Bobbitts, California earthquakes, Elvis
Presley, the Cowboys vs the Bills - you can twiddle the car radio knob late
at night and catch all of America's madness as the striped lines fly by, but
in Big Bend country none of it will touch you.
Big Bend - a big bend in the Rio Grande - is what is left of the unspoilt
frontier. It is a huge, remote, largely uninhabited tract in the Chihuahua
desert, and breathtaking in its beauty. For US tourists, who still believe
strongly in the idea of the frontier, its national park is a sanctuary
protected from everything but tourism itself.
But even wagon trains of RVs lose themselves in this vast space, and I found
a serene stretch of riverbank. On the other side, the little Mexican village
of Santa Elena slumbered in the winter sunshine. There were no bridges or
border posts or hustlers here, just a rowboat and a ferryman sitting on the
far bank beside a burro. The ferryman dozed, the burro dozed, and I, too,
settled quietly to an afternoon of dreaming. Here, at least, the river was
as wide and deep and peaceful as it has always been in my imagination.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Evolution of long-running cereals: The genetic engineering
of crops that could save the world - The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last of the dinosaurs grazed on a primeval grass which has since evolved
over 65m years into thousands of different species, including the cereal
crops which together account for more than half the food eaten by mankind.
Today, the different cereals vary enormously in their overall genetic
characteristics. At one extreme is wheat, with a vast amount of genetic
material - six times more DNA than a human being - divided between 21 giant
chromosomes. At the other is rice, which has 12 tiny chromosomes and only
three per cent as much DNA as wheat. In between lie maize, sorghum and
millet.
Research over the past two years has shown, however, that the genes
themselves are remarkably similar in wheat, rice and all other cereals - and
they are arranged in exactly the same sequence in each species. In wheat
(and barley and rye) the genes are interspersed with long repetitive
stretches of 'junk DNA', whereas in rice there is little of this apparently
superfluous DNA which does not control the plant's growth and development.
This surprising discovery, by Mike Gale, Graham Moore and colleagues at
Britain's John Innes Centre in Norwich, working with the Japanese Rice
Genome Research Programme, has huge implications for cereal breeding. It
means that breeders, who have traditionally studied each species separately,
can pool information and quickly come up with a common genetic map that
applies to all grasses and cereals.
Once genes for important characteristics - for example those conferring
resistance to heat or cold, disease or drought - are identified in one
cereal, they can be inserted into another, using the rapidly developing
technology of genetic engineering.
Rice will become the main focus of genetic research in cereals, because its
genome is so much smaller and therefore easier to manipulate than the other
species. (Genome is a useful technical term, meaning all the genetic
material in a species, including the functioning genes, control regions that
switch them on and off, and all the junk DNA in between.) Rice can be used
as a general tool to isolate genes from any cereal crop.
'We will be using rice as a bridge for research on wheat,' says Dick
Flavell, director of the John Innes Centre. 'If I had stood up a few years
ago as head of a British research institute and said we needed to invest in
rice research, people would have thought I was bonkers. But we do need to.'
The latest developments are good news for Japan, which had already decided
to focus its agricultural genetics research on rice. The government-funded
Rice Genome Research Programme, is now half way through the task of
discovering the precise chemical sequence of the estimated 30,000 rice
genes. Fortunately for the rest of the world, the Japanese seem to be
publishing their results quickly and openly, rather than restricting access
or patenting them.
At the same time, plant scientists worldwide are making rapid progress in
developing the genetic engineering technology that will be required to make
practical use of the newly discovered genes.
The 1980s was a frustrating decade because the technique used to transfer
genes to other plants - infecting them with bacteria which carried in the
new DNA - did not work in cereals. But it has turned out during the 1990s
that a brutally direct way of inserting genes - coating thousands of
microscopic gold balls with DNA and firing them into plant cells - is highly
effective.
And earlier this year Zeneca, the British bioscience and seeds company,
announced success with an extraordinarily simple method: the researcher
shakes a test-tube full of water, plant cells, DNA and tiny crystals of a
common chemical called silicon carbide. The crystals (known as whiskers)
punch holes in the cells through which foreign DNA can enter.
The first field trials of genetically engineered wheat, maize and other
cereals are getting under way. Easily traced 'marker genes' have been added
to these plants; they do not confer commercially valuable characteristics
but are used for scientific analysis. In Cambridgeshire, for example, Ciba
Seeds is growing two types of wheat this summer: one has a red pigment gene
taken from wild Peruvian maize and the other produces a bacterial enzyme
that can be detected in simple tests.
In the laboratory, meanwhile, researchers are beginning experiments to
transfer genes that would be industrially useful. The Institute of Arable
Crops Research in the UK has a project, for instance, to give wheat more
genes for gluten proteins, to enhance its bread-making properties.
Another early target might be the genes that control the movement of nitrate
across cell membranes. Their enhancement could help wheat to use nutrients
more efficiently. If so, farmers could cut the amount of nitrate fertilisers
spread on their fields.
In the longer run, there is potentially huge scope for genetic engineering
of all cereals to make them more resistant to attack by pests and diseases
and to withstand adverse weather. But as Paul Lazzeri of the IACR's
Rothamsted Experimental Station points out: 'In parallel with the research,
we have to resolve the question of the public acceptance of genetic
engineering of food.'
Scientists believe that the world will have to accept genetically engineered
cereals. On current projections, twice as much wheat and rice will have to
be produced during the next 50 years as in the past 10,000. Although
improved agronomy can make a contribution, the only real hope for feeding
the growing human population without catastrophic environmental damage lies
in applying cereal genetics.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Rational choice on the menu: Christina Lamb asks Gary Becker
about his theories on everyday life - Lunch with the FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something disconcerting about having lunch with a man who can
explain your menu selection in terms of rational economic choice. I thought
mere whim had decided my choice of the exotic-sounding fettucine with sea
scallops. But not according to Gary Becker.
The soft-spoken, 63-year-old professor from the University of Chicago
pioneered the application of economic theory to everyday life. For the past
40 years, while jeering colleagues concentrated on lofty matters such as
trade policy and market behaviour, Becker has devoted himself to devising
economic models for why we fall in (or out of) love, get depressed, commit
crimes, become drug addicts or buy fast cars.
He was vindicated when he became a surprise winner of the 1992 Nobel prize
for economics. His latest work, on the formation of preferences, aims to
explain why someone like me would order fettucine with sea scallops.
We are sitting in Printer's Row, a yuppyish restaurant in a renovated part
of downtown Chicago. Actually, with its inoffensive green and red decor, a
waitress from Lyons, a Mozart violin concerto on the sound system and an
absence of scowling gangsters, it could have been anywhere. Initially,
Becker had suggested the university faculty club - but then changed his
mind, concerned perhaps that this would seem unimaginative.
We each elected to start with the ragout of wild mushrooms, after which he
went for the day's special: grilled grouper with a colourful array of
oriental vegetables. Recalling that Becker had written: 'Every death is to
some extent a suicide' - that is, we are responsible partly for when we die
through the foods and drinks we ingest - I took defiant enjoyment in
ordering a crisp Californian Chardonnay. He stuck to mineral water and tried
to rationalise my taste for sea scallops.
'Like the Freudians, I stress early childhood,' he explained. 'What foods
you were given growing up and how that influenced your later preferences.
Peer pressure is also important - maybe it was 'in' in your group in England
to like shellfish. By eating scallops regularly you keep up, and even raise,
your taste for scallops.'
'Is that economics?' I asked, incredulously.
From his resigned smile as he answered, I could see Becker was used to this
question. 'My view is that economics deals with more than stock prices or
inflation. It's a way of thinking about the world and is not confined to
material things.'
Becker originally wanted to be a sociologist but claims it was 'too hard'.
As a graduate economist, he saw potential for applying the more rigorous
science of economics to social problems. His basic insight: most people act
rationally most of the time.
I said this seemed nothing more than common sense. Becker liked that. 'I
take it as a compliment. My approach is based on common sense - what's new
is where you take the analysis from there, which may give you surprising
conclusions.
'Take divorce, for example. Most people think rich people are more likely to
divorce than poor people. In fact, it's the opposite. My theory explains
that what matters is the gain from staying married.
'In a poor family with the husband unemployed, hanging around, the wife may
decide she's better off throwing the bum out. The richer family get much
more out of marriage. The wife is contributing - if not in income, then in
providing a good home. So, it's more rational to stay married.'
An avowed romantic, I was uncomfortable with such dispassionate analysis;
Becker, after all, has a wife and four children. 'But what about falling in
love. Surely that can't be explained by equations?'
He was ready for that one. 'Rational choice can handle that. I can't say
that individual A is going to fall in love with B or C, but I can say why
people tend to marry people with clear similarity in terms of background,
education etc. Moreover, why is it that love doesn't last? I don't deny that
people fall in love, I try to incorporate it.' (L represents love in his
equations.)
I was not about to give up so easily. 'How do you explain people falling in
love with the 'wrong' person? If we are concerned only with behaving
rationally, why would we ever get involved in difficult relationships like
inter-racial marriage?'
'Well,' he replied, 'that's where love etc comes in. But tell me why
inter-racial marriages have such an unusually high divorce rate. Rational
behaviour does not rule out mistakes.'
The sea scallops were no more and I felt I was not getting through to this
endearing figure with the domed forehead and detached expression. So, I
tried a new tack: 'What about public figures indulging in extra-marital
affairs? How could it be rational for someone like (President) Clinton to
risk jeopardising a successful career for a one-night stand?'
'I don't have any difficulty understanding that,' he replied. 'The
opportunities you're exposed to in a powerful position are enormous, while
the risks of being caught are very low . . . My bet is that for everyone
brought down, there are a lot who have no trouble at all. Now it's becoming
much more risky, I think it will decrease.'
Frustrated by the range of human behaviour that fits into Becker's rational
choice models, I asked if nothing was sacred. 'Say I decide to squander my
pay cheque on a Donna Karan dress, leaving me with no money to live on?'
Laughing, he said: 'I have a paper on that. Why do some women want a Chanel
suit when they can buy something that looks the same for a sixth of the
price? The fact that they know they're wearing a Chanel suit is the
important thing for them. That's perfectly rational.'
'Sounds irrational to me,' I said.
'Now you're being too much of an economist,' he replied. 'I fight with my
colleagues about this the whole time. Who's to say that the only reason you
wear a suit is because it covers your body? What you're wearing is conveying
something to the outside world about you as a person, your choices, what you
belong to, how successful you are. It's perfectly rational to be interested
in that.'
I wondered if he could go round the entire restaurant and explain, in terms
of rational choice, everything people were eating and wearing, and the
relationships they were having. 'That's not my goal. My goal is to try to
understand the phenomena of people falling in love, buying Chanel suits or
designer jeans. There are a lot of things we can't yet understand through
this approach, such as religion or war, though that may be a matter of
time.'
Over coffee, I ventured to inquire if the Nobel prize-money had tempted him
into a little irrational spending. 'Well, it wasn't so much money. It was
announced as Dollars 1.2m but declined immediately because the Swedish krona
devalued, so I ended up with Dollars 700,000 after tax.
'We've done some modest things, re-modelled the house, acquired a place on
Cape Cod. But we still drive a five-year-old Audi. The irrational thing
would have been to have spent it.'
'But surely more fun?' I asked.
The arrival of the bill left the question hanging. Ever the gentleman,
Becker offered to pay before deciding it was more rational to let the FT
pick up the tab.
A nice man, but his theories seemed suddenly to have made the world less
interesting.
As he strode away, I changed my mind about splurging the fee for this
article on an expensive jacket for fear that it might indeed be a rational
act.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Carving a niche for themselves: Susan Moore compares the
careers of three craftsmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrasting careers of three graduates of the City &amp; Guilds of London
Art School illustrate that the late 20th century is more appreciative of the
traditional skills of the stone and wood carver and letterer if they belong
to an 'artist' rather than a craftsman.
Tim Metcalfe is carving a raking knurl - a rope twist to you and me - out of
a piece of Ketton limestone surrounding the clock face of Sir George Gilbert
Scott's St Pancras Hotel. His clock tower perch is 220ft from the ground,
the station forecourt a hoist, a leap over a balcony, and several ladders
away.
For Metcalfe, replacing the corroded stone and extending the straightforward
original design is bread and butter work, 'but best quality bread and
butter'.
As we took our snakes-and-ladders route across the scaffolding of this grand
Gothic Revival facade, Metcalfe pointed out the unorthodox combination of
sandstone and limestone, the craftsmanship and richness of the ornament -
even in places not destined for the eyes of man.
He raises his voice above the sandblasting and the roar of the traffic, and
pauses at the occasional thunderclap of rubble emptied down the disposal
chute. It is wet and cold, but clearly there is no place he would rather be.
Metcalfe, a boyish 48, came to stone carving fairly late. Resisting parental
pressure to become a solicitor after public school he tried his hand at most
things during an escapist stint in Australia - undertaker's assistant, prawn
trawling, gold mining, sapphire digging. He knew only that he wanted to work
outdoors with his hands, and hopefully with his brain. In Indonesia he
watched wood carvers at work on a door, and decided that was what he wanted
to do.
Unable to find an apprenticeship when he returned to England, he enrolled on
the newly revived stone carving course at the City &amp; Guilds Art School in
Kennington, south London. 'It was my salvation,' he claims. 'It was the
first time in my life that I found something that I wanted to do. There was
 -and is - no greater thrill than whacking into a piece of stone.'
On graduating in 1976 he was taken on as Arthur Ayres's assistant at
Westminster Abbey. He spent six years working on the north front carving a
dozen or so figures and surveying and securing the monuments inside.
He still works there off and on. His is a hand-to-mouth existence.
Maintaining a steady flow of work is nearly impossible and lean periods are
not uncommon. Even at St Pancras where he is the sole stone carver, the work
is not continuous.
The demise of his ancient and venerable craft saddens him, its death knell
the breakdown of the apprenticeship system and the birth of Modernist
architecture. Metcalfe is only too aware that he will never begin to match
Ayres' experience or knowledge - let alone pass it on. 'Unless we are very
careful, these skills will not exist in 20 or 30 years,' he muses.
As it is, building contractors increasingly use cheap, unskilled labour for
restoration projects. The last stone mason's yard in London closed in May.
For the first time in over 1,000 years, there is no London yard cutting,
shaping or carving stone. 'We are all waiting for an upsurge in building in
stone,' Metcalfe smiles, 'and for a more joyful expression in architecture.'
Tim Metcalfe was Alec Peever's contemporary at Kennington. Peever, 39, is a
letter cutter and sculptor working in partnership with his wife Fiona, his
former apprentice. Seven years ago they exchanged their south London studio
for a former milking shed in the Cotswolds. It may be a rural idyll, and
Peever may sport a Hollywood-casting craftsman's beard and tousled mane but
his is no country crafts operation.
Peever had tried various jobs but was always irritated that he was never
doing anything he enjoyed. It had always been at the back of his mind that
he would like to be a sign painter but everyone had said: 'You had a grammar
school education, you can't possibly work with your hands.'
He walked into the City &amp; Guilds without any portfolio. His tutor, the
German type designer Berthold Wolpe, enveloped them with his passion for the
subject. By the time he left he had learned to carve in stone to a
rudimentary level.
As assistant to the letter carver Richard Kindersley, Peever learnt to carve
professionally, and after a year was itching to start on his own.
He advertised and took anything he was offered, painting signs for pet shops
and garages. It was a rough and ready training.
At first he had to persuade people to commission stone lettering. Now,
thanks to an increasing awareness of the medium, they are offered an
unexpectedly wide range of commissions, from carved titles for TV series and
slates cut with poetry for gardens, to pure sculpture.
It is the invention rather than the execution that excites. Asked to make a
lettering frieze above the tomb of Catherine of Aragon in Peterborough
Cathedral, Peever persuaded the authorities to allow him to cast a
free-standing frieze from clay and then gild it. Asked to make a
commemorative tablet marking the opening of a new primary school, he
designed something the children could leapfrog over.
Says Peever: 'This job has always had to pay the rent, and latterly pay the
mortgage and run two cars.' The business averages 50 commissions a year and
a turnover of Pounds 100,000.
At 27, Alex Jones is at the start of his career. He works from the Victorian
greenhouse of his parents' Queen Anne house near Winchester, Hampshire,
surrounded by geraniums and figs, and ineffectually shaded by a gnarled
vine. He works outside on benches when it is too hot, his 50 chisels laid
out on the bench with a surgeon's neatness.
He took a City &amp; Guilds wood carving course after working for a framer off
London's King's Road. After an extra year there - 'without apprenticeships
these days it is impossible to get the really high standards you need before
you go into the marketplace' - and another working with Peter Thurin, a
traditional woodcarver, he launched out on his own.
An illustration of a carved coat-of-arms in Interiors gained him a string of
commissions in the area of interior decoration - cupid coronas for beds,
furniture and mirror frames. He makes careful drawings for projects but then
casts them aside to work unprepared, like the medieval carver. 'I feel the
carving is more alive that way. I like to solve the problems as I go along.
It's like going on a journey.'
Jones is tired of utilitarian furniture. One of his tables takes the form of
an oak tree, its table-top canopy of leaves entwined with carved references
to the life of the owner - a watering can, a pheasant, wellies. A mirror
takes the form of a trompe l'oeil theatre, his patrons portrayed sitting in
a box, their coats of arms carved above the stage. The back of a chair made
for an American advertising executive incorporates the New York skyline with
an aeroplane circling the Chrysler building.
While Jones has never been short of work, he does have difficulty making
money. Each commission and its materials are different and require different
skills. He has had to re-think his approach and is taking on a traditionally
trained wood carver to help him improve, to speed up his carving and to
shoulder the bulk of it while he concentrates on design. He detects a new
reverence for the work he does: thanks in large part to Lord Linley, saying
one's son is a craftsman no longer sends shock waves around a cocktail
party.
Tim Metcalfe can be contacted on 081-769 4594; Alec &amp; Fiona Peever
0993-868012; Alex Jones 0962-712169. Work by this year's graduates of the
City &amp; Guilds is on show at the art school, entrance via the blue door in
Cleaver Square SE11, until Monday

FT  02 JUL 94 / Motoring: Why diesels score well for value - The latest car
league tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the results of two recent surveys are anything to go by, the diesel car
boom in Britain still has a long way to go.
Fleet Management Services, which runs many thousands of cars on behalf of
companies, puts diesel cars in four of the top five places in its 'best
value' league table. And although only 10 per cent of the 63,032 car owners
who responded to a nationwide survey for Volkswagen GB currently run
diesels, almost 30 per cent said they would buy one next time.
Most people know by now that diesel cars save a lot of fuel, especially if
they spend a fair amount of time in heavy traffic. Naturally, fleet
operators welcome lower fuel consumption. But the bottom line for them is
what a car will be worth at four years old with 80,000 miles (128,000km) on
the clock.
Using a five-year computer forecasting model, which had accurately predicted
falling residual values in the recession, FMS discovered that four of the
five best value fleet cars in Britain were diesels. First was the Citroen ZX
1.9D Reflex 5-door with total running costs - purchase price, funding, fuel,
maintenance and depreciation - of 18.84 pence per mile.
Second best was the Vauxhall Astra 1.7 D Merit 5-door (19.16p per mile),
followed by the Renault 19 1.4 RL Prima 5-door (19.3p and the only petrol
car in the five), Rover 218 D 5-door (19.99p) and Ford Escort 1.8 D 5-door
(20.05p).
Total running costs over four years and 80,000 miles ranged from Pounds
15,072 (Pounds 3,768 pa) for the Citroen to Pounds 16,040 (Pounds 4,010 pa)
for the Ford. The Astra cost Pounds 15,328 (Pounds 3,832), the Renault
Pounds 15,440 (Pounds 3,860) and the Rover, Pounds 15,992 (Pounds 3,998).
The most important single factor in running costs is how quickly the car's
value depreciates. This is something many private buyers, while agonising
over dealer discounts and fuel consumption, tend to ignore. Cheapest of the
five to buy was the Renault (Pounds 8,695 recommended retail) and the
dearest, the Rover at Pounds 10,205. Other prices were: Citroen ZX Pounds
9,345; Escort Pounds 9,800; Astra Pounds 9,995. The Astra was the cheapest
to maintain, the Rover the dearest, but the difference this made to overall
running costs was marginal.
The idea of VW GB's survey was to find out what people expected from the new
cars they would buy over the next 10 or 20 years. Apart from diesel economy,
occupant protection and vehicle security were main concerns.
Perhaps surprisingly, most of the emphasis was on passive safety -
mitigating the effects of a crash - and not on active safety features that
might help a driver to avoid having a collision at all. Almost 80 per cent
wanted airbags and a crash-activated switch to cut off the fuel pump.
Speed limiters were demanded by fewer than 40 per cent, sensors to tell
drivers they are travelling too close to the vehicle in front by about 50
per cent.
Some company car users, with tax saving in mind, have started trading down
to smaller, cheaper models. But the trend among retail buyers may be the
other way. They could be going for larger, more practical cars; more than 20
per cent said they would prefer an estate as household transport.
Increasing car crime put car security high on the agenda. Nine in 10 of
those surveyed wanted an engine immobiliser as standard equipment; 65 per
cent opted for a computerised tracking device (already offered as an extra
by BMW and Saab) to locate a car after it had been stolen.
Next week, the two-month consultation period on Ministry of Transport
proposals to ban coaches from the outside lane of three-lane motorways ends.
Under a European Commission directive, all coaches will be speed-limited to
65mph/105kph from 1996; at the moment, they must not exceed 70mph, but many
often do.
Most motorists would be delighted to see them banned from the third lane -
the sooner the better. For good measure, heavy lorries (already limited in
theory if not always in practice to 60mph/97kph) should be kept out of both
of the outer lanes of the M25 and other motorways that have been converted
to four lanes.
Saab and Volvo already have rear centre armrests that double as child safety
seats. BMW plans to go further and will offer, probably next year,
integrated (but easily removable) safety seats, adjustable for children
between nine months and 12 years. They have foot rests, to stop the backs of
the front seats from being kicked, and side supports to prevent sleeping
heads from lolling uncomfortably. Other ideas BMW has for the family car are
fold-out tables with low-line reading lights, that will not reflect in the
windscreen, and storage boxes. These can also be plugged into the electrical
system to cool drinks or warm babies' bottles.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Outdoors: A rhythm restored - Gardening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half-term reports on this season have swung round and become positive:
unlike investors, gardeners have had an excellent June.
True, we had wind and, recently, great heat. The soil here has started to
crack and the phloxes need watering.
After three summers on fast forward, nature has slowed and returned to her
English rhythm. From June 15 to July 10, it is roses all the way, relatively
unspoiled by rain. If in doubt, plant the pink Rose Felicia, the pale pink
climbing New Dawn and festoons of the rampant white Rambling Rector up trees
or towards your neighbours.
Gardening does not need to be complicated and I have tried to look back on
the first half of summer through the eyes of a starter or self-improver who
wants to be different without having a flop.
One answer would be to brave the queues and go to next week's Hampton Court
Show, open from July 6 to July 10 with first-class shopping on the spot from
our main nurseries.
Another is to cast around and react against the things which have caught my
eye. I would start the long route upwards with particular shrubs, especially
the pink-flowered Beauty Bush which is only held back by its name. Beauty
Bush is bad enough, but the true Kolkwitzia is not everyone's party-talk.
This year, it has been splendid and I doubt if even a half-hearted gardener
could kill it. It grows in any soil, including clay, but is best of all on
chalk. It is totally hardy and after three or four years reaches a height of
6ft or more.
The flowers are a pale pink in profusion just before shrub roses are at
their best. Twenty years ago, we were often short-changed by a shy-flowering
form. It seems to have retreated and Beauty Bushes now flower their skirts
off from the second year onwards. It pays to prune back all shoots which
have flowered as soon as the petals have fallen. Otherwise, the bush tends
to flower at the top and you have to make a virtue of its lop-sidedness,
planting something like a blue michaelmas daisy for late summer.
In early June, hardened gardeners fear the infamous June gap when the best
of the tulips are over and the best of the irises and roses have not begun.
Everything seems to hold its breath, what can we do about it?
This year, nature covered the gap by holding up May-flowering shrubs in
those awful gales and cold evenings. Late spring ran smoothly into summer,
but even so, I was glad of my easy answer, the single-flowered white Rocket,
which grows like a weed from packets of seed sown now for next year.
It is listed as Hesperis and it is well worth the minimal trouble as it will
even flower in those dry places beneath a hedge. It picks up from the point
where connoisseurs might have seen their perennial forms of white Cardamine
go over, leading into the easy white profusion of June and July.
If you hate sowing seeds, think bigger and try one of my fool-proof shrubs
which can be multiplied with the greatest of ease from cuttings. The
white-flowered Rubus Tridel Benenden is quite a tall and broad customer, but
it is outstandingly good in late May and I always relish the freshness
throughout the year of its greencurrant leaves and darker stems which exude
health.
Make the most of it because breeders have now crossed it with purple-pink
odoratus and the result is about to hit our garden centres. I cannot imagine
that it will surpass Benenden, the ideal shrub for improving a rough bit of
garden, the edge of a drive or one of those broad corners by a dark shed
where nobody goes very often. You can prune it very hard after flowering,
but it is spoilt if it has less of a width than 7ft or 8ft.
If the Rubus seems too massive, hunt around at a height of 2ft for a grossly
neglected cousin of the common old Flower of Jove. Many of us grow more of
the magenta-flowered Lychnis than we ever intend because it seeds everywhere
and springs up so rapidly.
Too few of us try the old, soft Lychnis coronaria oculata, whose white
flowers have the prettiest pink eye which fades with age. Anyone can grow
this easy perennial which will split rapidly into dozens and will thrive in
any sunny garden, however small, or in gaps between paving. Like the rest of
the family, it likes sunshine, but the lower leaves will turn brown if it is
constantly dry. It flowers for a month and a half. It was popular in the
period which historians call early modern, but it is oddly unpopular
nowadays, in what ancient historians think of as a dark age.
It is amazing how quickly the gap closes between ambitious self-improvers
and old gardens which rest on their laurels and hollies. My crowning memory
of early June is a mischievous visit to Hidcote, between the bedding seasons
at this famous Warwickshire garden in the National Trust.
I was glad that the ticket was free and did not cost the usual Pounds 4.80.
In early June, what was there, apart from the old hedges and some gorgeous
blue meconopsis?
Does anyone else grow a dusky pink Weigela called Conquete? The family is
full of good shrubs, but many of them have flowers which are too sombre to
show up well among the leaves. This one is much brighter: is it alive and
available in what sounds like its native France or can we not reintroduce it
from Hidcote's stocks?
Meanwhile, you can compensate by hunting for some lesser-known old variety
in the lists of Peter Beales or David Austin. This year, even on my rotten
soil for roses, the surprise has been the rose-purple Ardoisse de Lyon. I
love to think that these fine varieties have been totally forgotten in the
France which first bred them. In England, we will soon be calling them
heritage and making it impossible for any of them to go out of fashion.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Property (Australia): Where street sales are a way of life -
Roadside auctions provide popular entertainment in the state of Victoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Victoria is 'the auction capital of Australia, if not the world', according
to the state government's planning and development department. Its advice
booklet on buying or selling a home, which it prints in 12 languages, goes
on to note that 'the traditional Saturday street-side auctions of
properties, ranging from modest weatherboard cottages to million-dollar
mansions, is a popular weekend entertainment in Victoria's cities'.
The majority of homes for sale in Victoria are offered by auction. Only if a
property fails to sell is a buyer sought by private treaty.
Victoria, in the south-east corner of Australia, has 4.4m people, most of
whom (3.1m) live in Melbourne, the nation's second-largest city. The state's
estate agents compete fiercely and most quote 'AH' (after hours) telephone
numbers in auction advertisements.
New buyers must learn the many abbreviations. BICs are built-in cupboards,
IGP an in-ground pool and LUG a lock-up garage. ELF is not a garden gnome -
it refers to electric light fittings.
An OFP (open fireplace) always gets a mention with Victoria properties.
Plenty of homes have laundries and a number even have sewing rooms. There
are a great many references to alarm systems and security.
Do not, however, expect the detailed foolscap pages or glossy brochures with
colour photographs that you get from a British estate agent. Initially, you
might have to make do with a single sheet containing a line drawing of the
property, the briefest description and a floor plan. You can see why the
department's booklet suggests potential buyers should take their own
photographs of properties they like.
The booklet offers guidance on procedure. This includes getting legal
documents copied, the property vetted by an architect or builder, and a
mortgage approved. A successful purchaser at auction pays a 10 per cent
deposit - but he forfeits the deposit if he finds he cannot proceed.
A private treaty purchaser is entitled to a three-day cooling-off period,
during which he can withdraw, if the price does not exceed ADollars 250,000
(about Pounds 120,000). But there is no cooling-off time for an auction
buyer.
How does a system weighted so heavily towards the saleroom work in practice?
Janet and Stewart Simmons are a British couple who, after renting flats in
Victoria, decided last year to buy a house. They had noted that property
prices were about to start rising after diving in the recession.
They wanted a place with a garden in a part of Melbourne where their
children could grow up happily. A suburb adjacent to Port Philip bay seemed
just the thing so they made arrangements for a bank mortgage, started
viewing houses and attending auctions.
'Often,' she recalls, 'the auctions were outside in the street. There could
be anything from 20 to 60 people. Everyone stands on the pavement. Half the
street turns out to see what is going on. People in cars slow down, then
drive on again.'
They went to one auction fully prepared to buy but did not even manage a bid
as the price soared above their limit. At another, they managed a few bids
but then dropped out. 'In the end, I got cold feet and we did not buy at
auction,' Simmons says.
Instead, they negotiated successfully for a property which was due to be
auctioned but where the owner was willing to sell privately if the right
price was offered.
What they got was a detached, three-bedroom bungalow built of brick in 1946
with a lounge, family/dining area, kitchen, bathroom and laundry. There is
also the ubiquitous OFP and central heating plus W/W (wall-to-wall carpets)
and drapes, a garage and a garden with a range of trees: silver birch, elm,
maple and oak.
They feel they will need to build an additional room but do not see that as
a problem. Some people in the road have had a complete storey added: hence,
prices there range from the equivalent of Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 120,000.
Auction or private treaty: which is the better method? Simmons, who has had
previous experience of buying in England, hedges her bets. She prefers
buying by private treaty but accepts that auction could be a better way to
sell.
Victoria-born Robin Wilson, now an auctioneer with London-based agent
Winkworth, finds it logical for a property to go to auction first to
establish its worth. He says such a sale is open to everyone and there is no
argument about the price.
Wilson adds: 'Everybody in England says: 'As a last resort, we can put it to
auction'.' In his view, that is the wrong approach.
Simmons' husband has dual citizenship, so he had no difficulty making the
purchase. But other foreigners hoping to move to Australia and, eventually,
buy a home there should check with the Foreign Investment Review Board (a
department of the Treasury) at Parkes Place, Parkes, ACT 2600, Australia. It
will tell you if permission is necessary and if, taking into account your
circumstances, you are likely to get it.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Property (Australia): They all want a view of Sydney's
harbour - Its beauty enchanted Trollope last century. For home seekers in
Australia's biggest city, things haven't changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthony Trollope, the 19th century British writer, could have made a killing
in the Sydney property business. The city's harbour, he once gushed, 'is so
inexpressibly lovely that it makes a man ask himself whether it would not be
worth his while to move his household goods to the eastern coast of
Australia, in order that he might look at it as long as he can look at
anything'.
More than 100 years later, little has changed. Local estate agents say
newcomers still echo Trollope's sentiments, making 'harbour views' their
number one demand. 'It's the first thing they all ask for,' says Carl Hall,
principal at Farquarsons, a firm of executive rental agents.
The industry exploits this preference shamelessly. Advertisements are loaded
with promises of 'stunning skyline views' and 'panoramic vistas'  - and such
is the length of Sydney's shoreline that many properties do live up to the
hype. In the Wentworth Courier, a chunky weekly publication which acts as
the real estate bible for anyone house-hunting in the prosperous eastern
suburbs, shots of the yacht-flecked waterway almost outnumber photographs of
properties themselves.
The eastern suburbs, along the south side of the harbour from Potts Point to
the ocean, and parts of the lower North Shore, such as Mosman and Hunter's
Hill, remain favoured locations commanding top prices. According to the Real
Estate Institute of New South Wales, an 'average' house in these areas would
have cost between ADollars 475,000 (Pounds 220,000) and ADollars 640,000 in
the first quarter of 1994. For the best properties, though, deals of
ADollars 1m and up are commonplace.
The pursuit of value, however, has caused younger buyers to cast their nets
more widely. In the 1960s, for example, they renovated such near-city
districts as Paddington and Balmain, turning generous Victorian terraces
into streamlined and trendy family homes. Today, Range-Rovers and BMWs
jostle for space beneath the intricate iron-work balconies - not always to
the delight of older residents.
More recently, attention has turned to other run-down but cosmopolitan
inner-city areas such as Darlinghurst, Newtown, Glebe and parts of Redfern -
once notorious as Sydney's worst slum - where properties of a similar size
beckon for a fraction of the price. Travel times into the city are little
different and the variety of restaurants and shops is often better.
To the south-east, oceanfront suburbs such as Bronte and Coogee have also
undergone a revival, although longer distances from the centre and
less-than-ideal transport remain a disadvantage.
Such trends explain in part the very patchy price movements seen in the
Sydney property market in recent times. Until late last year, the city's
house values were largely stagnant - although, even then, there were
selective pockets where demand from job-secure professionals was pushing
prices back to the boom levels of the late-1980s. By late 1993, for example,
three-bedroomed terraces in Paddington, less than two miles from the city
centre, were changing hands for around ADollars 450,000, little different
from the peak prices seen in 1989.
Over the past six months, however, most agents have scented a more general
upturn in confidence, although many still say that it is only the most
desirable properties which are guaranteed an easy, attractive sale. 'It all
depends on location,' says one North Shore agent, adding that flats seem to
have out-paced houses.
Eva Schleisinger, at Bradfield &amp; Prichard's office in Double Bay, the heart
of the affluent eastern suburbs - and known to all Sydneysiders as 'Double
Pay' for its cost of living - confirms this impression although she is
fairly encouraging about values in her area. 'Prices have been gradually
creeping up again and are generally close to the boom period of 1989,' she
says. But she points out that one factor now absent is the heavy Hong Kong
and South African interest, which was a driving force late in the 1980s.
In the rental market, the picture is more consistent. Rents are edging up
and harbour views still win hands down. Many agents also say that the
established preference among executives for the eastern suburbs over the
lower North Shore shows little sign of changing. This, Hall suggests, is
partly because of easier access to the airport - which is on the south side
of the harbour - and a concentration of good schools.
North Shore homes also tend to face south, making them darker than those in
the eastern suburbs. 'Europeans seem to grasp this quickly,' he says. But he
does admit that the slightly cheaper prices on the lower North Shore
sometimes woo the re-locating spouse who is going to spend more time in the
home and realises that a more spacious property can be obtained for the same
weekly cost.
There is another, more practical element. Samantha Richmond, of agent WJ
Bridges, notes a frequent request for air-conditioning - something
Sydneysiders install rarely despite summer temperatures of 30``C-plus.
Accessibility to the city also ranks highly, and this is easier to satisfy.
Bridges has on its books a Los Angeles-based banker who is searching for a
suitable family home. Used to spending 45 minutes commuting on a good day in
California, his first request was for somewhere quiet but within 20 minutes
of the city. That would be a standard drive from the eastern suburbs.
The improvement in demand over the past six months means that weekly rents
at the top of the range can range up to ADollars 2,500 a week although a
spacious flat with two or three bedrooms and a couple of bathrooms would
cost a little less - perhaps ADollars 1,000 to ADollars 1,200 (a year ago,
it might have been ADollars 800 to ADollars 900). A house with three
bedrooms or more would range between ADollars 1,500 and ADollars 2,500. Hall
says leases are being negotiated for periods of three to four years, with
annual increases of around 5 per cent built in.
Anyone paying top whack on the housing front can expect a few extras, like
swimming pool or tennis court, although most agents say these facilities are
rarely requested at the outset. And if there is direct water frontage,
landlords may try to push prices higher still. But such efforts tend to hit
market resistance: Hall says he is sitting on a house in Vaucluse, another
top eastern suburb, which last changed hands for ADollars 7.8m. Its owner is
asking ADollars 3,000 a week rent; so far, there has been no taker.
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Asian rental market in Sydney tends
to be slightly different from the European, with executives showing a
stronger preference for prestigious flats. This has become increasingly easy
to satisfy: the city now offers apartment blocks in the central business
district itself, such as the Quay West tower, as well as on the north side
of the harbour bridge at McMahon's Point and Kirribilli.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A wild time in the garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everything in the garden is rosy at the wildflower centre - providing the
owners do not look at their bank balance too often.
'More often than not it's in the red, but when we feel down in the dumps we
just consider our quality of life,' said 36-year-old ecologist Peter
Loosley.
Loosley and his partner Anne Starling, the founder of Natural Surroundings,
the Centre for Wildlife Gardening and Conservation, describe their
Norfolk-based business as 'the largest wildlife gardening centre in
Britain'.
It is set in eight tucked-away acres near the small town of Holt in the
north of the county. On a fine summer's day 'idyllic' accurately describes
the setting, in the valley of the river Glaven.
In winter however the site loses some of its appeal. On a day when the
biting north-east winds are roaring in from Greenland, even the soothing
chimes of the clock at Glandford church, one of two visible on the skyline,
do little to compensate for the harshness of the surroundings.
'We came here in February 1989, when I joined Anne part-time, and soon found
it to be an absolutely ideal base - better than our wildest dreams,' said
Loosley, who continued with his job as a countryside ranger for the North
Norfolk District Council until he left his job to form a full-time business
partnership with Anne in early 1990.
'We realised it was going to be a slog and that things would be bleak in
winter. But we didn't really anticipate how dire it would be in the long
dark months - that's when the bank account dips deep into the red,' Loosley
said.
Sometimes the pair think they are mad to stick at their task, which after
nearly 5 1/2 years turns over only Pounds 44,000 and provides a meagre
living for the two. 'Fortunately we are both single,' said Starling. 'But
even with the amount of idealism we retain, we find it tough when we realise
that with good qualifications in our mid-30s and usually working a seven-day
week, we still find it hard to make ends meet.'
This year, in a determined effort to have enough money to take a holiday if
either of them desires one, the partners are employing no part-time staff.
'We are doing everything ourselves this summer to try and build up a little
spare cash,' Starling said.
The decision means very long days, frequently followed by one or both of
them giving an evening class or a talk to a local organisation.
The labours involved in running the centre include caring for three pet
goats, creating a new section of the centre every year, tending to the
demonstration plots, mowing and general maintenance, caring for the two
acres of wildflower meadows, conducting guided tours, and working in the
nursery.
'Our work has a high educational content,' Loosley said. 'For example,
visitors sometimes ask why we mow meadows, but that is the way they were
always cultivated. They were intended to provide at least one crop of hay.
'But in attempting to recreate them, the skill lies in knowing when to mow,
and also when to plant additional species that will add to the variety and
richness of the meadow.'
Starling and Loosley have more than 130 wildflower species at the centre. As
the soil was virgin and unsprayed they reckon up to 80 species were there
before they arrived. They now import 50 varieties and propagate well over
100 species of wildflower plant - and also produce their own seed from
plants in their wildflower nursery.
'Above all, the people coming here want to know how to create wildflower
meadows on parts of their land, and it's one of the hardest things to
achieve,' Loosley said.
Starling and Loosley charge for entry to the centre and also for any talks
they give. Three quarters of their turnover - Pounds 33,000 - comes from
sales of plants, entry fees and shop takings. They also undertake a limited
amount of contracting work and Starling has designed three local wildlife
gardens that she still tends once a fortnight. They have a Pounds 5,000
outstanding loan from Anne's father and an overdraft facility of Pounds
7,000 that they rely on heavily in winter.
If the partners have any regrets over a lifestyle that is, they admit, just
what they wanted, it is that they feel the local community has not supported
them financially as much as they might have wished.
'We have a wonderful landlord in the estate owner, Robin Combe. Initially he
gave us two years rent free. Now he takes five per cent of turnover,'
Starling said. 'Despite trying hard, we failed at the outset to get any sort
of grant or sponsorship, which we accepted. But we find it hard to accept
that many local people don't know we are here and what we do. We really are
dependent on people visiting us from all over the country and spreading the
word.'
Fortunately this is happening. Every summer the partners find they have an
increasing number of repeat visits, which is one reason they try to extend
their activities every spring.
But there is still the problem of the winter. Much of last winter was spent
producing their first mail order catalogue. It has sections on wild flower
plants and seeds, native trees and shrubs, cottage garden plants, wild
flower meadow seed mixtures, pond plants, and naturalists' equipment and
books. Most of the items are available all year round.
'The signs are quite hopeful,' Loosley said. 'Things are building up, even
if financially it is still very hard. This is a business based on a good
deal of idealism, designed with the community in mind and with a strong
educational element.
'Sometimes we feel we are not pushy enough. But whatever happens we are here
to stay.' Natural Surroundings Centre for Wildlife Gardening and

FT  02 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: Chaos is restored - What Britain
should have been saying at Corfu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, is fond of saying that things in
the European Union are moving Britain's way. And last weekend's events on
the island of Corfu proved it. Britain was able to eliminate the man -
Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene - that most of the others wanted on
the reasonable ground that they preferred him. Especially the Germans and
the French.
Many Europeans failed to see this as the blow for freedom it was represented
as being in Britain but, rather, the result of an interplay of forces within
the Conservative party and the British media. What happened had, in effect,
been a coronary at the heart of Europe. The Dutch paper, Trouw, expressed
the general view succinctly: 'Major cannot accept Dehaene. In the United
Kingdom, it is the tabloids that rule.'
The fact is that Dehaene was no more unacceptable to Britain than any other
majority candidate might have been. But since he was depicted in the UK as a
fanatical centraliser, that was that.
Actually, he was a good deal more acceptable than the other leading
contender, Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, whose colourful and
scandal-ridden career in politics would have caused huge international
interest had it happened anywhere but the Netherlands. Lubbers was also the
architect of the Maastricht treaty, which could be regarded as a
disqualification for most jobs.
In Germany, and even in France, there was some sympathy for the British
position. The Frankfurter Allgemeine shared a widely-held view that the way
in which Dehaene had been presented to the nations of Europe left a lot to
be desired. By implication, John Major was right to see this as some kind of
Franco-German diktat.
Yet, said the paper: 'Franco-German co-operation is indispensable for the
evolution of Europe.' And it noted, menacingly: 'Only those who believed
that the order of battle 'Britain against the rest of Europe' had been put
to rest with Margaret Thatcher's overthrow can refuse to admit the existence
of a fundamental British conflict with the Europeans.'
In France, comment often followed similar lines. There was some recognition
that the two allies would have to watch their step, however high-minded
their motivation, alongside a belief that Britain could not really be
'dissolved in Europe', as La Tribune put it.
Inevitably, Figaro produced a characteristic rant and quoted Joan of Arc's
words about booting the English out of France - which, in the eyes of most
sections of French society, is synonymous with Europe. (It ceases to be
Europe when it disagrees with France.) But there was an implicit question
that found an echo elsewhere: 'Can Europe progress with Britain as a
member?'
The next stage of the battle is to find another candidate, a freely accepted
man-of-the-majority and yet one who is more acceptable to Britain than
Dehaene. Liberation thought the affair could end up by leaving the British
worse off (although conceding Major had done Europe a service by returning
the EU to its normal state of chaos). And it pointed out that even though
there might not be a revival of 'cohesion', this row could well result in
more clarity about the respective roles of the commission and the member
states.
For the UK, though, an opportunity has been missed by rejecting Dehaene
unconditionally. The British should have demanded that he and his sponsors
agree to four priorities in the work of the commission as a condition for
his succession. These are:
A crackdown on the corrupt use of EU funds. At present, this is largely the
responsibility of governments - and they have little interest in firm action
because corruption offers gains to their people at the expense of others.
That work should begin now on ensuring farm spending is reduced in
preparation for the programme of subsidy reduction agreed in the Gatt world
trade round.
That each member should guarantee implementation of the single market
directives to at least the level achieved in Britain.
That the commission should complete its work on producing a binding
definition of subsidiarity.
These (apparently naive) proposals are thoroughly objectionable in the eyes
of most governments although they could hardly admit it. Rejection would
mean that any British veto had a sound moral base. Acceptance would give the
British a huge stick to wave at every council meeting from now on.
The great error of the British is the failure to recognise that the best way
to screw up the EU is to ensure that every single rule, regulation,
directive and agreement is implemented to the very letter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Weekend FT of May 21/22, you gave details of permanent
interest-bearing shares (Pibs) in several building societies.
You stated in your article that investors can get back their capital only by
selling these in the stock market. Where can you buy Pibs and where are the
daily prices published?
Permanent interest-bearing shares in building societies can be purchased
through the market and you should contact your local broker. Prices are
published in the stock exchange Official List and under the London Stock
Exchange Dealings heading in section one of Saturday's FT.
Investors should be aware, however, that Pibs are not protected investments
for the purposes of payments out of the building societies' investor
protection funds. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tenants and the Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I live in a leasehold flat, and along with the other 13 tenants in the
building, have a 1/14th equal share in a limited company that owns the
freehold. As a company, we act in all matters concerning the building,
including collection of charges due.
The company does not generate a 'profit' and any surplus funds at the end of
the financial year are carried forward for use in the future. No dividends
are paid to shareholders and nor are any likely to be. On this basis, why
does the Inland Revenue produce assessments for tax, and how can we prepare
our company accounts to avoid what appears to the Revenue to be a profit?
Since the company is assessable under the rules of Schedule A, the way in
which its accounts are drawn up will not affect its annual corporation tax
bill, as the company's auditor will confirm.
Broadly speaking, the expenditure actually incurred in each year is deducted
from the rents and service charges due from the tenants in the year, and any
balance is chargeable to corporation tax. If surplus funds are put on
deposit or invested, the resulting income will also be chargeable to
corporation tax under the rules of case III of Schedule D (or otherwise,
depending upon the precise nature of the investment.)

One solution you might like to consider is that many unit trusts offer free

given credit for the shares' value, albeit small. (Answer by Murray

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I refer to your reply saying that 'as a non-resident Commonwealth citizen,
you are entitled to a personal allowance against your UK income tax
liability'. If this is so, could you please let me know:
1. Since which tax year has this been so?
2. Is one also entitled to higher personal or age allowance or only basic
personal allowance?
1. Non-resident Commonwealth citizens have been entitled to full personal
reliefs since 1990-91. In 1989-90 and 1988-89 (which is as far back as
claims can be made, under the general six-year time limit) the rules were
different and entitlement to relief depended upon world-wide income.
2. The only allowance not available to a non-resident is the transitional
allowance for a married woman whose husband had a small income in 1989-90.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When credit is overdue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent Briefcase reply, you said all Commonwealth citizens were
entitled to a personal allowance to set against dividend income in the UK. I
am a British citizen with full rights of residence in the UK and my husband
also is British. But since my marriage 27 years ago, I have been resident
and ordinarily resident in Switzerland.
I have a small income from UK investments amounting to about Pounds 2,000 a
year and I have claimed back tax above the 15 per cent withholding tax each
year. It appears that I might have been entitled to claim back the
withholding tax as well. If this is so, how far back can I claim?
Yes, you have been entitled to payment of the whole of the tax credit on
your UK dividends after April 5 1990 because your personal allowance is
Pounds 3,005 for 1990-91, Pounds 3,295 for 1991-92, and Pounds 3,445 for
1992-93 to 1994-95.
Write to the foreign dividends office to which you have submitted your
claims and ask it to transfer your file to the international claims office
(with a request that it sends you forms for section 278(2)(a) supplementary
claims for 1990-91 onwards).
The rules were different before April 6 1990. Whether any further refunds
are due for 1988-89 and 1989-90 (which is as far back as you can go, under
the general six-year time limit) depends upon your husband's world-wide
income. It seems unlikely that anything further will, in fact, prove to be
due for those two early years.
You could ask also for a copy of the free booklet IR 20 (Residents and
non-residents: liability to tax in the UK).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is little point investing carefully in a pension plan for 20 to 30
years if, at retirement, you fail to shop around for your annuity. The wrong
choice of provider can reduce the annuity rate by up to 25 per cent, while
unnecessary expense on costly features can knock up to 50 per cent off your
income.
An annuity is an insurance product that provides a guaranteed income for
life in return for a lump sum investment. With money purchase pensions,
which invest contributions to provide a fund at retirement rather than a
salary-linked pension, the bulk of that fund must be used to buy what is
known as a compulsory purchase annuity.
Retirement annuities, personal pensions, executive plans, most company
additional voluntary contribution schemes (AVCs), free-standing AVCs
(FSAVCs) and contracted-out money purchase schemes (Comps) are all examples
of money purchase arrangements.
Given the complexity of annuities, it is essential to seek expert
independent advice, preferably on a fee basis. But the important point to
remember is that once you have made your choice and handed over your money,
you cannot switch to a different provider - or even to a different type of
annuity within the same provider's product range.
In recent years, though, providers have developed the range of options. You
can, for example, buy a fixed rate of annual increase (commonly, 3 or 5 per
cent a year), or increases that are linked to retail price inflation. Other
options ensure a return of outstanding fund to your dependants if you die
within a certain period. But each bolt-on feature carries a cost in terms of
reduced income.
Annuity rates fluctuate in line with investment conditions. To back the
guarantee associated with annuities, life offices buy medium and long dated
gilts. The annuity rate you secure - that is, the amount of regular income
you can purchase with your fund - will depend on prevailing gilt yields. The
annuity rate also is based on a series of actuarial factors including your
age, sex and health. Statistically, women tend to outlive men by between
five and seven years, so the annuity rates offered to women will be lower
than for men of the same age.
One exception is annuities bought by a personal pension fund which has
inherited liabilities from the State earnings-related pension scheme
(Serps). It is possible for an individual to contract out of Serps and use
the money handed over to build up a personal pension fund. This fund then
has to buy an annuity which meets certain government specifications.
The company providing the annuity must make similar quotations to people of
the same age, regardless of sex; it also has to offer a spouse's pension and
annual increases up to a maximum of 3 per cent.
Step one towards choosing the right annuity is to use the open market
option. This allows you to take the proceeds of your pension fund away from
the plan provider and to buy your annuity elsewhere. The top names in
personal pension plans often are quite different from the top names in the
annuity market, so it makes sense to shop around.
Annuities can be sold only by life offices. If your pension plan is provided
by any other sort of financial institution - say, a unit trust group - then
you have no choice but to use the open market option. This can improve the
income provided by your annuity by up to 25 per cent - the typical
difference between the best and worst rates on offer. But some life offices
penalise policy-holders who use the option while others pay a loyalty bonus
to those who stay put, which is tantamount to the same thing. Either way,
the differential must be taken into consideration when weighing up the
benefits of the better rates available under the option.
The table shows the various annuity options and their cost in terms of
diminished income. The figures, provided by Lexis Pensions Consultants,
assume the buyer is a man aged 60 with a wife of 57. After taking his
tax-free cash and purchasing his protected rights annuity, his fund size is
Pounds 100,000.
The maximum annual income he could get when we checked was Pounds 11,327;
this was for a pension that did not include annual increases, a spouse's
pension, or any other guarantees. If he goes for every possible option (see
'combination' in the examples following), he might consider himself to be a
wise and cautious fellow - but he will also forfeit half of his income,
leaving him just Pounds 5,675 a year.
The options fall into seven main categories:
Guaranteed annuities. These pay a lump sum or continue the regular income
for the five or 10 years guaranteed even if the annuitant dies - a useful
option given that one in eight people dies within the first five years of
retirement. Reduction in income: 2 per cent to 6.2 per cent, depending on
the period of guarantee.
Increasing ('escalating') annuities. These rise each year in line with a
pre-determined rate, typically 3 per cent, 5 per cent or RPI. Some degree of
inflation-proofing is essential. Once inflation takes its toll, the value of
the level annuity plummets. Early retirement - whether voluntary or enforced
 -combined with increased longevity aggravate this problem, as can be seen
in Table 2. Reduction in income: 20 per cent to 40 per cent, depending on
rate of increase.
Payable in advance or in arrears. This affects the timing of the first
payment. You can also chose the frequency of payment: monthly, quarterly,
half-yearly or annually. Likely reduction in income: 10.4 per cent for
annual in advance. Monthly in advance would reduce the income by about 6 per
cent compared with an annual income paid in arrears.
Spouses' pensions. These are not normally compulsory except for annuities
bought from personal pension funds which have taken over liabilities from
Serps. Your requirements will depend on marital status and your spouse's own
pension arrangements. Reduction in income: 11 to 14 per cent, but can be
higher depending on couple's age and the level of spouse's pension.
With or without proportion. When an annuitant dies shortly before a pension
payment is due, the surviving
spouse might already have lived for several months with no income, for some
pension schemes pay as seldom as once a year. With most schemes, that is
just tough. But it is possible to arrange that the scheme will pay the
survivor a proportion of the next payment. So, if there were three months
left to the next annual payment, the survivor would receive three-quarters
of it. Reduction in income: an extra l per cent on top of the cost of the
spouse's pension.
Combination. Clearly, many people would like to combine several options, and
here the drop in income can be substantial, particularly if you go for a
high rate of annual increase and a high level of spouse's pension. Reduction
in income: up to 50 per cent, depending on options selected.
Investment. A handful of providers sell annuities that leave the fund
invested on a with-profits or unit-linked basis. Under a with-profits
annuity, shown in the chart on page VII, the annuitant secures a fairly low
guaranteed income and also is awarded annual bonuses from the with-profits
fund. To lift the initial income, it is possible to set an anticipated rate
of bonus. Where the actual declared bonus rate is lower than anticipated,
then the income will fall, and vice-versa.
But these, and other complex options like phased retirement, should be
considered only if you can afford to take a gamble. For others, a
conventional product is best since it offers rock-solid guarantees.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Pension reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's white paper on pension reform indicates there will be more
flexibility on the timing of annuity purchases after April 1997. Although
details are few, it appears you will be able to take your tax-free cash at
retirement and leave the rest of the fund fully invested so long as you buy
your annuity by age-75. During the deferment period, it will be possible to
draw an annual income from the fund.
A second proposal will require the protected rights fund from the
appropriate personal pension to buy an annuity that increases each year in
line with price inflation, capped at 5 per cent (known as limited price
indexation) rather than the 3 per cent fixed rate applicable now. Full
details will be given in the Weekend FT in due course

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A simple Pounds 60bn success story -
Seeing how other people look after money helps you to control your own more
efficiently. That is the theory behind Joanna Slaughter's series on private
client investment managers.  Today: Mercury Asset Management / The
Professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the investment management arm of the SG Warburg
group, made its reputation in the 1970s and 1980s by being overweight in
equities. Today, it sees no reason to reverse this investment philosophy.
British shares continue to form rather more than the backbone of most UK
private client portfolios and David Rosier, the chairman of MAM Private
Investors - the private client subsidiary which alone has Pounds 2.9bn under
management - says: 'We still believe that long-term investors will do a lot
better by investing in the equity markets. That is where the long-term value
is.'
MAM was incorporated as a Warburg subsidiary in 1969 and now has a total of
Pounds 60bn under management, including a large amount of pension fund
money. Rosier cites this financial muscle as an added source of reassurance
and benefit for the private clients in his corner of the empire.
'We are dedicated to giving a personal service to private clients,' he
stresses. 'They will have their own portfolio manager looking after them
whose job it is to cater to their requirements. But, by being part of
Mercury Asset Management, we also have the ability to deliver services that
may not be available at other investment houses.
'For example, we have specialists in MAM who are looking after Dollars 20bn
of international bonds, and our clients have been able to take advantage of
the large rise in international bond markets that began in 1991. In Julian
Baring, we are also acknowledged to have the expert in mining and gold
shares in the UK, and there are times when private clients would like, and
should have, some gold.
'MAM has offices in every financial centre in the world and a smaller
organisation simply couldn't afford that. A further benefit of size is that
it has allowed us to invest heavily in systems.
'Administration is so important on the private investor side. People can
understand that you don't always get that extra bit of performance, but they
can't understand if you don't spell their name right or if they don't
receive their dividend cheques.'
MAM believes a correct asset allocation strategy is central to the
management of clients' investments. Last year, some private clients with
growth portfolios had approaching 20 per cent of their assets in
international bonds and cash.
Today, the favoured asset distribution is UK equities (63 per cent); North
America (6 per cent); Europe (7 per cent); Japan (6 per cent); Pacific basin
(3 per cent); emerging markets and commodities (3 per cent); gilts (11 per
cent) and cash (1 per cent).
Private client portfolios do not replicate these allocations slavishly,
however. Rosier explains: 'It is up to the private client manager to work
within this asset allocation because he knows the client and structures the
portfolio accordingly.'
MAM has 2,400 UK private and 500 international clients and each has a
portfolio manager with whom regular contact is maintained although there is
the safety-net of a team back-up to ensure continuity 'if someone falls
under a bus'. The managers have considerable autonomy and there is no list
of approved equities to clip their wings.
Sometimes, however, there will be a strong house view on certain companies,
and managers will be told not to hold these shares. It is a matter of some
pride to Rosier that MAM was not holding one Polly Peck or British &amp;
Commonwealth share when these companies hit trouble.
Individual portfolios are constructed for all private clients with more than
Pounds 300,000 to invest, and the UK exposure in these is concentrated
tightly on 20 to 30 shares. 'In order to take away 90 per cent of the risk
in a portfolio, you need to have about 20 shares,' Rosier argues. 'With 50
to 60 shares, you are moving only towards the average, and there is no point
in having something in your portfolio that isn't going to have any effect on
your performance.'
Exposure to smaller companies is provided through Mercury unit trusts.
Indeed, unit trusts and a range of investment trusts also provide the
overseas weighting in smaller portfolios. Only clients who have more than
Pounds 1m are invested directly in overseas equities, and even these large
accounts often have a core holding in a fund.
Unless they are very large, equity portfolios are seldom hedged because of
the cost. Hedging usually is confined to the pure bond portfolios where
managers may like a bond market but not the currency.
The performance achieved for each private client portfolio is monitored
regularly. So is turnover; Rosier reckons this averages around 25 per cent a
year.
Each of the 24 private client managers has responsibility for a specialist
sector of the market, but they are not expected to devote themselves only to
research. Rosier notes: 'They don't have time and, anyway, we have this huge
research back-up within MAM.'
The numbers certainly are impressive. There are more than 170 fund managers
in the group, each specialising in a market or sector. MAM believes this to
be one of the largest investment teams in the world. Last year, MAM's
private investor arm won 420 new clients and lost between 20 and 30. Each
new client is asked to contact Rosier if they are unhappy with the service
the receive.
Last year, a client with Pounds 5m did so. 'He didn't believe we had
understood his brief and we changed the manager,' says Rosier, adding: 'You
always lose a few clients but it is quite hard to find out why. Essentially,
it means that the relationship has broken down.'
Rosier sees a 'huge' potential for expanding overseas client numbers. 'The
international private client market is very fragmented,' he points out.
'There are areas of the world where there has been an enormous growth in
personal wealth - yet, by and large, the international private client has
not been well catered for.'
Increasingly, clients with very large portfolios are opting to spread their
assets among several different investment managers. Rosier says: 'There is
very much a trend towards multi-advisers. It is not so much that clients
want diversification, but they don't want all their eggs in one basket.'
This seems to demonstrate an inherent caution which Rosier believes to be
common to almost every client. Indeed, a number of MAM's international
clients insist that 50 per cent of their money is in bonds and 50 per cent
in UK equities.
Rosier says: 'Experience has taught me that most clients are pretty
risk-averse. Often, you find that the more money people have, the less risk
they want to take. After all, if you have made Pounds 100m, you don't need
to take risks.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Record bond prizes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WILLSHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Someone in Britain is getting used to becoming an instant millionaire. For
only the fourth time, National Savings' premium bonds yesterday paid out a
Pounds 1m jackpot, writes Richard Willsher.
The chances are that it wasn't you - but you might well have won a prize,
anyway, because there are plenty to go around. July marks the first time
that more than 250,000, with a total value in excess of Pounds 16.5m, will
have been paid out in a single month.
This record-breaking pay-out represents a return of 5.2 per cent on the
Pounds 3.8bn total value of bonds held. Since January, the number of prizes
has risen by 34 per cent and their value by 37 per cent.
News of the Pounds 1m prize was announced on December 16 and investment in
premium bonds took off, reaching Pounds 201m in February. This was the last
month in which newly-bought bonds were eligible for the first seven-figure
pay-out at the start of April.
The approach of a National Lottery has sparked even more interest in premium
bonds - where buyers have the added advantage of not losing their stake -
and marketing has been intensified. But will investors find them
worth-while?
The best instant access accounts at building societies are, typically,
paying around 6.5 per cent gross or 4.9 per cent net of basic rate tax. But
winnings on premium bonds are free of UK income tax.
Investors with the maximum holding of 20,000 Pounds 1 bonds - and anyone
over 16 can hold that many - can expect, with average luck, to win 16 prizes
of Pounds 50 in a full year. That is, roughly, 4 per cent gross. Even if you
win nothing, you lose only the chance of earning interest on your money -
which is not much in the present low interest-rate environment.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Power companies await the crunch - A
dilemma for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders have been showered with statistics by the 14 regional power
companies in England, Wales and Scotland during the past month's results
season. But the question uppermost in their minds remains unanswered.
They need to know how tough Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, will be in his coming review of price controls covering the
companies' distribution businesses. His response is expected in the next
month or so.
The controls will, more than any other single factor, determine the
profitability of the 12 England and Wales companies for the immediate future
and will have a significant, although less powerful, impact on the two
Scottish companies.
Distribution - getting power into homes and commercial premises - accounts
for more than 80 per cent of profits for the England and Wales companies, 40
per cent of Scottish Power and 20 per cent of Scottish Hydro-Electric. But
the Scottish companies also are facing a review of their supply businesses,
which buy and sell electricity.
All this explains why the sector's shares have been falling in price more
than the market in the past couple of months, even though most results for
1993-94 have been at the top end of City expectations.
The companies have recorded impressive profits in the four years since they
were privatised - those in England and Wales have outperformed the market by
at least 65 per cent, and the Scots by about 20 per cent - and investors
have had a far better return than they could have expected at the start.
Helped by vigorous cost-cutting and improved efficiency, most of the results
this month showed the companies had, once again, been able to boost
percentage pre-tax profit growth well into the 'teens and increase dividends
by between 11 per cent (Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric) and 19.8 per cent
(Eastern).
Even those companies that reported a decline in pre-tax profits were able to
satisfy the City as to the reasons. The figure of Pounds 51m for East
Midlands in 1993-94 was about Pounds 100m down on 1992-93, but that was
because of Pounds 130m of exceptional costs associated with retailing and
problems of diversification.
Consumers have benefited from privatisation through improved service and
price reductions. Yet, many feel there has not been enough progress. So,
what will Littlechild do?
The signs from his Birmingham office are that he will be reasonably severe
on the companies in England and Wales but less so on the two in Scotland.
They have been regulated more tightly since privatisation, partly because
they were floated later when the government had more experience.
The degree of severity, however, is a matter of vigorous debate among
investment house analysts. John Wilson, of UBS, does not like any of the
England and Wales companies and recommends clients to sell shares in all of
them.
He feels the best of a bad bunch are Eastern, Midlands, South Wales and
Yorkshire, which could be held. But he much prefers the Scottish companies.
Wilson predicts all the England and Wales companies will have to cut their
distribution prices - which make up about a quarter of final electricity
bills - by an average of 17 to 20 per cent from next April. The Scots may be
allowed to raise prices or keep them steady.
Wilson also expects that Littlechild will require all the companies,
including the Scots, to raise prices only by the rate of inflation minus 3
or 4 per cent - which, in some years, will mean cuts.
He bases his figures on the assumption that the regulator will stick to his
policy of calculating assets - the value of which will help to determine
prices - as the market value of the companies shortly after flotation.
This value (about Pounds 8bn) is considerably less than the book value of
Pounds 11 to Pounds 12bn which the companies estimate as the cost of
replacing their assets.
The logic of using flotation values is that they represent the asset price
on which shareholders expected a fair return before it became clear that the
companies were going to be far more efficient than they were before being
privatised.
Most investment houses are expecting a less severe outcome, though. Nick
Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, predicts distribution price cuts for
the England and Wales companies at about 10 per cent, and expects future
rises to be held to inflation minus 3 per cent.
Warburg believes, however, that the companies' ability to lower dividend
cover and continue cutting costs will allow those in England and Wales to
increase dividends by at least 4 per cent above inflation during the period
of review. Scottish real growth could be 5 per cent real.
Warburg recommends buying shares in Southern, Yorkshire, London, Manweb and
Eastern, and holds for the rest.
At Hoare Govett, Nigel Hawkins forecasts dividend growth of 6 per cent real
for the England and Wales companies. He recommends Manweb, Seeboard, Norweb,
Midlands and Southern as buys.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Some you win, some you lose - Good
news and bad / The impact of the O'Higgins theory in the year so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For readers who follow the O'Higgins theory, outlined many times before on
these pages, there has been both good news and bad news in the first half of
1994.
The good news is that stocks chosen by the O'Higgins theory have
outperformed the FT-A All-Share index over the past six months. The bad news
is that both the O'Higgins portfolio and the All-Share have fallen in value;
the building society would have been a far better option.
Michael O'Higgins is a US fund manager who wrote a book* outlining a simple
method for beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Taking the 30 stocks in
the Dow, he found the 10 with the highest dividend yields. Of those, he
selected the five with the lowest share prices (ie, if stock A costs Dollars
1 and stock B costs Dollars 2, choose stock A). Then, he waited a year and
performed the exercise again.
He found that, between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio chosen by this method
produced average annual returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with 10.4 per
cent from the Dow.
In Britain, applying this method to the FT-30 index also appeared to work.
Even allowing for costs of 5 per cent a year, the FT found that the
O'Higgins method earned 22 per cent a year between 1979 and 1991 compared
with 17.5 per cent for the All-Share. Last year, including gross dividends,
the five stocks chosen by the O'Higgins method returned a whopping 46.8 per
cent.
The law of averages might suggest that, after such a good year in 1993, the
method was destined to do less well this year. Indeed, only one of the five
stocks chosen (using the FT of December 30) managed an increase in share
price: Tate &amp; Lyle. One share, British Gas, has fallen 22.7 per cent.
Overall, in capital terms, the five shares have fallen by an average of just
under 9 per cent. Nevertheless, that is a better performance than the
All-Share, which dropped 12.6 per cent between December 30 and June 30.
To be fair, if you allow for costs and also for the higher dividend yield
provided by the O'Higgins shares, it is probably a tie between the portfolio
and the All-Share.
Nevertheless, the results are not completely discouraging. The O'Higgins
method is designed to beat the index over the long term, and anyone
following it over the past 18 months is still well ahead.
So, what about those who are starting from scratch to choose a portfolio
today? The components of the FT-30 are: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, Blue
Circle, BOC, BTR, Boots, British Airways, British Gas, British Petroleum,
British Telecommunications, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC,
Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, Marks and Spencer,
NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, SmithKline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle and
Thorn EMI.
Using the share lists in the FT of June 30, the chosen five are: Blue Circle
(285p, 4.9 per cent yield); British Gas (266p, 6.8 per cent); BT (376p, 5.7
per cent); Hanson (247p, 6.1 per cent) and Lucas (170p, 5.1 per cent).
Three of those five were in the portfolio chosen at the start of the year:
out go BICC and Tate &amp; Lyle, in come Blue Circle and BT. Note, however, that
the theory says that those who picked their portfolios at end-December
should stick with them until the end of 1994.
It is worth reminding readers of the caveats. A portfolio containing only
five stocks is, inevitably, high risk; and, just because the theory has
worked before, there is no guarantee it will work again.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Ailing dollar has markets guessing -
Where next for the US currency?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many of the thousands of football fans who went to the US for soccer's
World Cup, the weak dollar could not have come at a better time. But those
among them with equity and bond investments back home are likely to find the
weak dollar more of a mixed blessing.
Few investment strategists believe financial markets can flourish against
the background of an ailing dollar, and many would cite the US currency's
poor performance this year as a key cause of the generally unsettled state
of world financial markets.
One point to note is that while the dollar has fallen to a post-war low of
98.55 against the yen, it has actually been fairly stable against many other
currencies.
Indeed, the trade-weighted value of the dollar is not much below where it
was at the beginning of 1990, and it is nearly 10 per cent above the low it
touched in the third quarter of 1992. Then, the exchange rate was Dollars
2/Pounds 1 (now Dollars 1.55) and DM1.40/Dollars 1 (now DM1.58).
From a sterling perspective, figures from Record Treasury Management, a
company specialising in currency risk and currency funds, show that in the
six months to April 1994, the sterling/dollar trading range was barely more
than 2 per cent. Going back to 1980, however, the average is closer to 10
per cent.
Even in recent weeks, sterling has struggled to make progress against the
dollar, and few analysts feel it will change much in 6-12 months.
From a consumer perspective, it is doubtful if the weaker dollar has had
much impact. In 1992, travel companies reported a surge in travel to the US,
but there has been no repeat this time. Although travellers have greater
spending power, Thomson, the largest package travel operator in the UK,
reports that bookings are steady.
The UK is not a particularly large importer of consumer goods from the US,
either. Imports tend more to be of a capital nature, such as computers and
aeroplanes, with long-term financing arrangements unaffected by short-term
currency movements.
As for the present, analysts are split about the investment implications of
the lower dollar. Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, says
investors should not be concerned. He argues that the dollar is a side
issue, the key concern for financial markets being the strength of the US
economy.
'It is a tremendous mistake to believe that weakness in the dollar is likely
to tell you something about likely US interest rates,' he says.
But John Reynolds, global strategist at Natwest Markets, notes: 'With the US
long bond market still holding the key to the outlook for world markets, a
weaker dollar is just grist to the mill for inflation bears.'
In other words, further dollar weakness would put more upward pressure on US
interest rates. This would probably have a negative effect on US bond and
equity prices, with a spill-over into other international markets - the
pattern ever since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates on February
4.
What of the future? Reynolds believes the dollar has probably overshot on
the downside and that a bounce can be expected. 'Dollar-based investments
are probably, on a 12-month view, going to be a wise thing to do,' he says.
Beyond that, he and many other analysts are bearish about the dollar so long
as the US continues to run a large trade deficit.
A final caution. Currencies are notoriously difficult to predict and most
analysts have been wrong on the dollar so far this year. There is no reason
why it should not confound the market again.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Mirror men make news - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, we highlighted the increase in directors' share buying. The
market continues to be affected by pressure from overseas as well as other
internal markets, but directors continue to search out the silver lining and
dealing has continued apace.
While the largest acquisitions all were recorded in open offers or new
issues, there was an interesting, and topical deal, at the Mirror Group, now
the home of The Independent as well.
Five directors, including Sir Robert Clark, the non-executive chairman, and
chief executive David Montgomery bought stock at prices between 126-134p.
The war of the broadsheets continues and there has so far been little change
in Mirror Group's shares.
Dewhirst Group, the textile company, has featured regularly in this column.
Directors started buying last December when the share price was just under
100p.
The most recent transaction was by Brian Farrow. He has been on the board
for almost one year and this deal, at 135.5p, brings his total holding to
more than 200,000 shares.
The sale by two directors - including the finance supremo - of RJB Mining
was no surprise since a note of their intention to sell following the
management buy-out was made when the shares got a quote.
RJB Mining is one of the key coal producers bidding for the mines that are
being sold off by the government as a part of its privatisation plan. Both
directors retain stakes in the company.

Exco, the money-broking arm of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group,
has launched its return to the stock market after a seven-year absence with
a share offer which values the company at Pounds 215.5m, writes Simon
Davies.
The public is being offered 13.3m shares at a price of 175p, while a further
39.8m shares have been placed with institutions already.
Exco, one of the four major global money-broking businesses, is emerging
from a troubled period under the unsteady guidance of a parent in
receivership. The receivers are selling their remaining 40 per cent holding.
The company has an even profits split between money-broking and fixed income
securities broking, and it has lowered its exposure to individually volatile
markets through a policy of global diversification.
The shares have been issued on an historic price-earnings ratio of 9.5 and a
notional gross yield of 6 per cent, reflecting the apprehension of
volatility attached to the sector.
But Exco's recent record of growth is expected to continue, with interim
profits forecast to rise 28 per cent to Pounds 27.5m.
The offer closes on Friday, July 8, and trading will start on July 19. This
issue is sponsored by NM Rothschild, and the stockbroker is Kleinwort Benson
Securities.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: So little time - Rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is only one complete stock exchange account period left until rolling
settlement begins on July 18.
The exchange divides the year into account periods, named by letters of the
alphabet. We are now at the end of account period M, in which the last day
for dealings was July 1. All trades conducted any time in the period, which
began on June 20, are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent
out. It has to be settled on July 11.
This allows some investors (particularly, those who have dealt early in the
account) up to 15 working days to settle their accounts.
The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all
investors, and especially speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit
within the same account. If successful, they can make money without ever
having to put up a penny of their own money.
Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in
the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25.
From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day -
or T+10.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Swap those unwanted shares and save
money - Too many tiny holdings? - How to shed them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are you the sort of investor with a large, well-balanced portfolio of shares
which is reviewed regularly and weeded out? Or do you, like many, have a
ragbag collection - a couple of hundred BT here, a hundred Abbey National
there, plus a few other bits and pieces which are, generally, too small to
bother about?
The wave of privatisations since the early 1980s has left many people with
tiny holdings in privatised companies. Many share offers were so popular
that applications had to be scaled back, so most people received half or
one-third the number they applied for.
The problem with a portfolio built up in this way is that it is often
unbalanced. Rather than a wide, low-risk spread of a good variety of
companies in different sectors, your entire holdings could be divided
between a handful of utilities which all tend to move in the same direction
at the same time.
But if you decide to sell a few shares and re-invest the proceeds elsewhere,
you will soon learn that dealing on a small scale can be disproportionately
expensive.
Stockbrokers set a minimum commission for transactions; this starts at
around Pounds 20 with the cheapest execution-only services, but can be
Pounds 50 or more.
If your shares are worth only Pounds 250, selling them takes a big chunk out
of your investment. And if you want to re-invest the resulting cash in other
shares, yet more commission must be paid.
Small shareholders do have an alternative, however. Many unit and investment
trust managers operate share exchange schemes designed to appeal to small
investors with precisely this problem.
They will swap your small shareholdings for shares or units in the trust of
your choice. So, with the same amount of money, you get exposure to a far
wider range of companies, in the UK and overseas if you wish.
The cost of the entire transaction should be less than using a conventional
stockbroker: most investment trust share exchange schemes charge a minimum
of between Pounds 10 and Pounds 30, while some do not charge at all for
sales.
Most investment trust share exchange schemes are administered through their
savings schemes, and normally you pay the standard charges when buying the
investment trust shares: typically, 0.2 per cent to 1 per cent. Dunedin does
not charge for purchases.
Fleming's standard charge for sales is Pounds 12.50, but every month it has
a special offer for a particular sector. During July, it will accept shares
in the building and construction sector for Pounds 7.50. There is a 1 per
cent charge for purchases.
Unit trusts sometimes absorb your holdings into their own portfolios, in
which case there may be no additional charge. Otherwise, dealing charges are
similar to investment trust schemes.
In either case, though, you still pay the standard initial charge on the
units, which is typically around 5 per cent. Some charge less, particularly
if you buy the units through a personal equity plan where lower initial
charges sometimes are counter-balanced by exit charges if you sell up within
the first three to five years.
M&amp;G sends customers a list of the shares it holds itself and will accept for
exchange without charge. There are about 200 companies on this list, which
is updated every six months. Other UK shares are accepted as well, but the
selling costs are passed on to investors.
All the unit and investment trust schemes will accept the top 200 or so UK
shares, which includes the privatisations. Some accept any UK-listed share,
including those traded on the Unlisted Securities Market, and a few also
take gilts or rival companies' unit trusts.
Trusts usually set a minimum value for packages of shares they will accept
for exchange, generally in the Pounds 250 to Pounds 1,000 range. But if your
shareholding is too small even for this, you can often make up the
difference in cash. The smallest holding with which anyone can deal is about
Pounds 15. Many schemes will treat a family's holdings as one, so it could
be worth clubbing together if you all have a few shares in the same company.
One drawback with investing via an investment trust savings scheme can be
loss of control over timing. The schemes tend to store up all orders
received and deal once a week, or even once a month, and there could be a
delay of up to three weeks between when shares are sold and the proceeds are
re-invested. If this worries you, ask about it: some schemes will speed up
your business for an extra charge.
Share exchange schemes are much more common with unit trusts than investment
trusts. It is only within the past five or 10 years that most investment
trusts have built up a direct relationship with their investors by offering
savings schemes so that members of the public could, in effect, buy directly
from the managers. But unit trusts have been used to dealing direct with
customers all along.
Investment trust groups offering share exchange schemes include
Alliance/Second Alliance, Dunedin, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Fleming, Foreign
&amp; Colonial, Framlington, Gartmore, John Govett, Henderson Touche Remnant and
Murray Johnstone.
There are more than 100 unit trust managers, and around half of them operate
share exchange schemes including most of the big names such as Fidelity,
Gartmore, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mercury, Perpetual and Save &amp; Prosper. The Unit
Trust Directory, published by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds*, includes details of which unit trust groups have share exchange
schemes.
But the fact that a good share-swap scheme is available should not be the
main factor in picking a trust. There is no point in saving a few pounds on
a share transaction, only to lose out in terms of long-term growth.
Past performance can help show which trusts are well managed, but it is
better to look for consistency over several years rather than outstanding
performance over just one.
Performance statistics and other investment trust details are included in
the monthly information service from the Association of Investment Trust
Companies*, which costs Pounds 28 for a year's subscription. Unit trust
performance tables can be found in the monthly Money Management magazine.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: It's open house at Equitable -
Company beats SIB deadline on information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers for pensions, insurance and investment products should acquire a
greater spring in their step as the long-awaited system of ensuring they
have better information about what they can buy - and what it might cost
them - hits the streets.
Or, rather, one street. From now on, Equitable Life, one of the UK's largest
mutual life insurers, will show a new openness in the information it
volunteers to all its customers. As yet, it is alone among life insurers in
doing so.
Equitable plays down the extent to which the new format will differ from the
information it used to make available to clients but, until now, it has not
produced estimates of what policies would be worth in the future based on
its own charges rather than industry averages.
As from yesterday, Equitable's sales agents will provide clients with:
A four-page document setting out the key features of the policy being sold.
Examples of how much it will yield.
A letter explaining why the advice to take out the policy has been given.
The surrender values at various points during the contract, together with a
figure for the cost of providing advice.
Take a 20-year pension plan sold to a man aged 45 which costs Pounds 1,000 a
year in premiums and has an assumed 9 per cent rate of return.
The information shows that if the policy were given up at the end of five
years, the customer would receive Pounds 6,139, having paid Pounds 384 in
deductions.
On the same basis, the customer would have had Pounds 1,189 deducted in
charges at the end of 10 years, and would receive Pounds 15,371 if the
policy were surrendered then.
It also says that the cost of providing advice for this sort of policy
averaged Pounds 231 in 1993, and that this cost would rise proportionately
as the level of customer contribution increased.
The presentation of the information meets the format required by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. But some
insurers say they cannot meet SIB's requirements until January 1, the date
by which they become compulsory.
Others do have plans to comply before then and will incorporate the changes
in any new products - but these are not likely before the autumn.
One reason for Equitable being able to move more quickly is because it is
not re-designing its products, as many life insurers intend doing in order
to spread the costs of commission as these become more visible.
A further factor has been that Equitable's sales force is salaried - rather
than paid on commission - and its costs are strikingly low as a proportion
of its premium income. So, the issue is not as sensitive for the company as
for most of its competitors.
Should customers now stampede to Equitable? That depends on what you want,
but it would be rash to assume that Equitable would suit everyone.
It did, however, come out very well from the recent report by the Office of
Fair Trading on surrender values of life policies.
The company specialises in pensions for the top end of the personal
financial market and has a conservative attitude towards its products, which
it believes in keeping relatively simple. But there may be people, even in
Equitable's target audience, who are slightly uncomfortable with its intent
focus on individuals of high net worth.
While this clearly makes commercial sense, there is something slightly
chilling about the way its marketing director talks of 'the proletariat'
during the same conversation in which he insists the company is not elitist.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Inchcape's fall from favour - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape's decision this week not to increase its 15 per cent stake in
Gestetner, the distributor of office equipment and photographic supplies,
has focused attention on the international motors, marketing and business
services group.
Although Gestetner's shares fell on the announcement, Inchcape's rose -
partly reflecting City relief that the larger group had dropped any idea of
launching a full bid for Gestetner, which would probably have required a
rights issue.
However, Inchcape shares remain 25 per cent below this year's peak level of
606p, which they reached at the end of January. This is partly due to the
adverse impact of the strong Japanese yen on the group, which does a lot of
its business in and from the Far East.
Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the decision not to lift
the group's stake in Gestetner was taken for strategic reasons - rather than
any concern for market reaction.
As the chart shows, Inchcape's shares were uprated in the early 1990s, as
the market warmed to its management strategy and exposure to the
fast-growing Pacific Rim. The group's strong presence in Hong Kong means it
is well placed to benefit from increased development in China. How justified
is the recent decline in the group's share price?
Last year was certainly a tough one for Inchcape. The motors business, which
now accounts for just over half of the group's operating profits, was hit by
a sharp decline in the continental European market and the higher cost of
Japanese vehicles.
The continuing Japanese recession hit the group's marketing activities,
which also suffered when the Chinese authorities imposed austerity measures
to slow the pace of the boom sweeping the southern provinces.
Yet Inchcape still managed to increase its pre-tax profits and earnings last
year. Even a downbeat statement on the current trading at May's agm said the
group was cautiously optimistic that it would again grow profits from last
year's level of Pounds 272m.
Inchcape has certainly been active in recent years. Its acquisition of TKM
for Pounds 383m in 1992 made it into the world's largest independent
distributor of motors. This April's purchase of the insurance broker Hogg
for Pounds 177m created - when combined with the group's own insurance
broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson - the seventh largest insurance broker in
the world.
Current forecasts put the shares on a prospective multiple of about 14 - a
discount to the market as a whole of more than 20 per cent. Yet as recently
as last year, the shares were on a 40 per cent premium to the market.
Stock markets have a tendency to overshoot. Arguably the enthusiasm for
Inchcape as a Far Eastern play became overdone in the early 1990s, but the
recent correction looks equally extreme. Certainly most City analysts now
have the shares as a buy or a hold.
Mike Smith, an analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, points out that there
has been a strong correlation between the yen/dollar rate and Inchcape's
share price in the past two years. 'It appears obvious from this that, as
and when there is a reversal from this yen strength, the shares will begin
to regain their previous momentum.'
Calling the turn on the dollar/yen exchange rate is no game for the small
shareholder, and there seems scant prospect of currency stability in the
immediate future. However, Inchcape's credentials as a well managed play of
Far East remain intact. This month it bought a motor distributor in the
Chinese city of Nanjing and formed a joint venture to promote sales of
consumer goods in central China.
The group is well placed to benefit from the gathering strength of the
British motors market and will also benefit from recovery in continental
Europe.
By declining to increase its exposure to Gestetner, Inchcape has removed one
potential area of uncertainty which was unsettling the market. For investors
prepared to take a medium to long-term view, the recent fall in the share
price presents a buying opportunity.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Wall Street jerks the strings - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'For the umpteenth time, I'm not going to support Mr Dehaene,' asserted John
Major over a Euro-summit dinner last weekend in Corfu.
Using the 'just say no' strategy of Nancy Reagan, Major stopped the Belgian
prime minister from becoming.
If only it were so easy for European markets to disengage themselves from
the dollar. They managed to for several days this week but only when
concerns over US inflation and growth lay dormant. But when Wall Street
twitched on Thursday, European bourses and bond markets jerked.
In a commendable performance, albeit on light volume, the FT-SE 100 index
rose four out of five days for a net gain on the week of 59.8 points. This
failed to repair fully, however, the damage of the previous week when the
index fell 146.3 points.
Thursday was a fittingly down-day to end a depressing half-year. Once
February's peaks were scaled, it was downhill all the way. The Footsie took
the brunt of the sell-off, falling 14.6 per cent over the half-year.
The worst sectors were gas distribution and financials which fell more than
25 per cent. The best were oils, minerals and chemicals which fell less than
4 per cent.
The FT-SE 250 index of mid-sized companies outperformed it, however, on the
way up and down. It was off 9.95 per cent at the half-year end. The best
performance came from FT-SE Small Cap index, home to the remaining 330
companies in FT-SE-A All-Share Index. Having enjoyed the strongest rally in
the first month of the year it was down only 4.7 per cent by the end of
June.
The trigger for February's market reversal was the first monetary tightening
of the cycle by the US Federal Reserve. Again this coming week, the fate of
global markets will hang on the Fed as its policy-setting committee meets on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Will it or won't it raise its Fed Funds rate? Some analysts and investors
hope that higher US interest rates will bring stability to the dollar and
thus bond and stock markets.
They argue that rapid US growth and inflationary dangers warrant a rise in
Fed Funds by at least one-quarter of a percentage point, if not one-half.
Others argue that a rate rise is unjustified by domestic US economic
conditions and anyway it would be as flimsy a prop to the dollar as
intervention and jaw-boning by central bankers. The fundamental weakness of
the dollar and strength of the yen defy such easy policy remedies.
The no-change camp has several good arguments. The US economy has shown
signs recently of decelerating, commodity prices (except coffee) have
cooled, and the Fed is sporting President Clinton's first two, and
presumably more dovish, nominees, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen.
Sharp criticism of another rate rise comes from Robin Aspinall of Panmure
Gordon. 'Raising interest rates hardly ever succeeds in saving an
intrinsically weak currency . . . the forces driving the yen higher look
irresistible.'
But his far greater concern lies with the lack of money flowing into
markets. The problems of the dollar are entwined with those of stock and
bond markets. 'The Fed knows that when they pricked the speculative bubble
in February, they generated an intense liquidity crisis. That liquidity
crisis poses a continuing threat to the markets and the economy. And the
correct response to a liquidity crisis is to cut rates.'
Not surprisingly, given his position, chancellor Kenneth Clarke takes a more
upbeat view. Unveiling the Treasury's forecasts this week, he said the
economy was enjoying 'quite the best combination of circumstances . . . for
a very, very long time.'
The Treasury expects growth this year of 2.75 per cent (against its forecast
of 2.5 per cent last November) and another 2.75 per cent in 1995. It
believes retail prices minus mortgage payments will rise 2.5 per cent this
year (against November's forecast of 3.25 per cent) and 2.75 per cent next
year.
One analyst seeing a stronger dollar and an opportunity to pick stocks
accordingly, is Paul Walton, James Capel's UK strategist. He believes higher
interest rates in the US and lower rates in Europe will bolster the US
currency.
His analysis of 50 large UK stocks sensitive to the dollar shows that they
out-perform the market by 2 to 4 per cent for every 10 per cent rise in the
dollar against sterling. Typically, the stocks are in the aerospace,
pharmaceutical, drinks, packaging and textile sectors plus a handful in
media and engineering.
If you think, however, the dollar will fall by 10 per cent, then his group
of 50 would be likely tounderperform by 1 to 2 per cent.
Picking the next stocks to buy has been much on the minds of institutional
investors through all this recent market turbulence. Many still believe the
downside to the market is limited and that a rally will come. But will there
be a discernible trigger for it?
Probably not, says Barton Biggs, the strategic guru of Morgan Stanley in New
York who is on a European tour. 'It will be just a spontaneous combustion in
the compost heap.'
One long-smoldering corporate saga which burst into flames this week was
Enterprise Oil's bid for Lasmo. The bid battle never moved entirely beyond
rhetoric from either side to a more elevated discussion of the merits of
merger.
The final straw for some Lasmo shareholders was Enterprise's Wednesday
tea-time raid which gave it 10 per cent of the stock. Only a handful of
investors were able to sell out at up to 169p. The shares closed yesterday
at 136p after Enterprise's bid failed.
To Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, an overwhelming
majority of Lasmo shareholders just said no.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Tricky tips from the horse's mouth - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insider dealing is a criminal offence in Britain but directors' dealings are
perfectly okay. So okay, in fact, that the Weekend FT publishes lists of
such dealings regularly as a potentially useful tool for investors (this
week's list can be found on page IV).
The difference between the two comes down to the context. Essentially,
insider dealings by directors are those where they can profit because of
their superior knowledge of a company's affairs.
For example, the stock exchange code bans them from dealing ahead of a
company's results. This is because results often influence share prices. And
a catch-all clause also forbids dealing whenever unpublished price sensitive
information exists.
It can be tricky for the outside observer to understand exactly where the
line between acceptable directors' dealings and unacceptable insider dealing
is drawn. Take, for example, the large sale of Telegraph shares in May by
Hollinger, a company controlled by Canadian-born Telegraph chairman Conrad
Black.
When the management cut the newspaper's price last week, the Telegraph share
price plunged. Investors who had bought shares from Hollinger were hopping
mad and one of its brokers, Cazenove, has now resigned.
The stock exchange cleared the sale because it found no evidence that a
price cut was contemplated at the time of the share sale. But any other
Telegraph shareholders who copied Hollinger's sale must now be counting
their blessings.
This is not an isolated example. In 1991, Alan Sugar sold a chunk of his
large Amstrad shareholding and some of his co-directors followed suit. Four
months later, the share price had halved.
No wonder many investors reckon that following directors' dealings is like
getting tips from the horse's mouth.
In the United States, home of the serious investor, most fund managers and
many private investors pore over such dealings. They are even catching on in
Britain.
But, like all investment indicators, directors' dealings need intelligent
interpretation. Only a small minority are useful pointers.
Generally speaking, it is more significant when directors buy than when they
sell. Few people buy shares unless they expect them to rise.
There are, however, lots of reasons for selling shares other than gloom
about share price prospects. The director might, for example, simply need
the extra money to buy a house or educate his kids.
Directus, which provides the Weekend FT's weekly lists of directors'
dealings has some other hints for would-be sleuths.
Pay attention only to purchases which are meaningful in relation to the
director's other holdings - say, 10 per cent or more.
When more than one director buys at the same time, it is always worth a
close look - unless they are just the token purchases of new directors.
And if directors fail to take up shares in a rights issue, it is probably
worth following their example.
But directors' dealings should never be looked at in isolation. If a single
director appears to be the only buyer in sight and everyone else in the
market is worried, he could be fighting a losing battle, making him a
dangerous man to follow.
Look at any given deal in the light of earlier ones. If the directors have
made massive sales near a market peak, a small purchase lower down does not
necessarily mark a turning point.
Remember, too, that the ban on dealings ahead of company announcements means
that sales or purchases just before the barrier comes down may be
particularly significant.
Some directors - and some corporate shareholders - have an uncanny knack of
getting their share dealing right while avoiding any hint of impropriety.
Sir Phil Harris has always seemed to have as happy a touch in the stock
market as he does in the carpet trade. The Beazer sale by the Hanson
conglomerate caught the market just in time. And the Cayzer family, which is
keeping its stake in new issue Exco (see page IV), has usually proved
commendably canny in its stock market dealings.
Always remember, though: even if you get your tips right from the horse's
mouth, following them blindly is asinine.
What a welcome sight. Still more competition is creeping into the financial
services area. Abbey National, the building society turned bank, is nearly
halving its overdraft rate.
What is more, Abbey, unlike many competitors, does not charge a fee for
allowing you to have an overdraft in the first place. True, Abbey is a
minnow in this field. But its move could still exert some pressure on its
larger rivals.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Predatory bears make a meal of the Dow - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anyone doubted that the US stock market was in a steep decline, consider
this: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen for the past two quarters,
the first time it has registered consecutive quarterly declines since 1984.
True, the loss in the latest three-month period was only a modest 11 points,
or 0.3 per cent. But when added to the 118-point decline recorded in the
first quarter, it was the Dow's worst first-half performance in a decade.
Does this mean the long bull market is over, and that equities are now
entrenched firmly in a bear market phase? Not necessarily.
While it is clear that the bulls no longer have the upper hand on Wall
Street, and have not had since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates
early in February, it is not so clear that large numbers of investors' are
looking elsewhere in search of better returns. For many, stocks remain the
best bet in town.
Although recent anecdotal evidence from the mutual fund industry indicates
that investor demand for stock funds slowed in June, more money was still
flowing in than flowing out. Fidelity, the largest mutual fund group in the
US, says the amount put into its stock funds by clients last month was about
half the total recorded in May.
Yet, May was a surprisingly strong month, both for Fidelity and the rest of
the mutual fund industry, with a net Dollars 11.8bn invested in all US-based
stock funds by individuals and institutions - a total comparable with some
of the best months of 1993. (It is bond, not stock, funds which have taken
the real beating this year, recording net outflows of cash in February,
March and May - and probably also in June - in the wake of steadily
declining bond prices).
According to fund analysts, the slowing of investment in stock funds is the
result of investors taking a more cautious, rather than an outright bearish,
view of the market. Instead of putting more cash into stocks, they have been
putting it into short-term money market funds.
This is not because these are offering better returns than stock funds, but
because they represent a safe haven at a time when the equity market is
behaving erratically.
That erratic behaviour was on display this week. On Monday, trading opened
with analysts in a nervous mood after the previous Friday's 62-point drop in
the Dow.
They were worried that fresh weakness in the dollar would create further
turmoil in bond and stock markets, with investors increasingly fearful that
the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates to defend the
ailing US currency.
To no one's surprise, the Dow dropped 26 points in early trading on Monday,
and the pessimists began predicting that it would fall below 3,600 well
before the week was out. Yet, for no immediately apparent reason, the market
staged a dramatic recovery, the Dow rallying more than 70 points to end
48.56 higher at 3,685.50.
The rebound, however, was not as impressive as it seemed because volume was
low by recent standards (at 250m shares) and because there were almost as
many shares which ended lower on Monday as ended higher. This indicated that
strength in a few prominent stocks - Caterpillar, General Motors, General
Electric and IBM all rose more than a dollar - had pulled the market higher.
The weakness in market sentiment was underlined over the next two days when
stocks eased slightly across the board. Then, on Thursday, the bears
returned in force, sending the Dow 42 points lower as bond prices tumbled
following another decline in the dollar.
The stock market's losses would have been worse but for the usual
end-of-quarter buying by fund managers and the psychological boost provided
by news of a planned multi-billion dollar merger between CBS, the network
television group, and QVC, the home shopping cable channel.
The merger, if not the only positive news of the week, was certainly the
most interesting. Under the planned coupling - a complex stock swap - Barry
Diller, the charismatic chairman of QVC, would take over running CBS day to
day with Laurence Tisch remaining chairman of the overall group.
Although analysts struggled at first to identify the natural synergies
between the two companies, they welcomed the prospect of Diller running the
CBS broadcasting business. The QVC chief made his name as a creative
television programmer while at ABC television in the 1970s, and at the
then-fledgling Murdoch-owned Fox network in the 1980s.
Investors were even more enthusiastic about the proposed deal, bidding up
the shares of both CBS and QVC on the New York and Nasdaq stock markets.

Shares in smaller companies did worse than the main market, and the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies index (Capital gains version) fell 2.1 per cent to
1609.8 over the week ending 1 July, compared with 1 per cent for the FT-SE

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Coffee to cost more - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Soaring prices on the coffee futures market this week will leave consumers
paying more for their supermarket purchases of instant unless the market
quickly collapses.
The coffee futures price at the London Commodity Exchange has risen by over
150 per cent this year from Dollars 1,198 a tonne in January to break
through Dollars 3,000 a tonne this week. On Monday, prices hit a 7 1/2 year
high, after frost damage in Brazil.
The market is expected to remain strong at least for the next six weeks,
while the Brazilian crop is particularly vulnerable before the harvest. Over
the longer term, the coffee market is buoyed by rising demand and a slip in
production as a result of extremely low prices in the past couple of years.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Unit trust investment suffers another fall - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment in unit trusts fell for the second month running to a net Pounds
726m in May. The figure is down from last May's inflow of Pounds 915m, but
well above 1990-92 levels. Private investors accounted for 87 per cent of
the net sales and favoured the UK Equity Income sector above others.
Institutional investors preferred Japan and the Fund of Funds sectors. The
value of funds slipped last month to Pounds 95.1bn from Pounds 97.1bn in
April.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The famous DNA double act: Forty years ago, James D. Watson
and Francis Crick made a discovery described as the greatest achievement of
science in the 20th century. Christian Tyler tells the story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
The professor was galloping back and forth along the base line, returning
his coach's slamming serves with an aggressive, short-swinging stab. His
pursuit of the ball was single-minded, and impressively nimble for a
66-year-old.
A mile or so from this animated scene, scientists at the John Radcliffe
Hospital, in Oxford, were concluding a remarkable post mortem examination.
They reported that 'Otzi', a Tyrolean hiker overtaken by a blizzard and
frozen to death 5,000 years ago, has at least 88 relatives living in the
same Alpine region today and other kinsmen dotted round Germany and northern
Europe. Therefore Otzi could not be, as some have tried to claim, a Peruvian
mummy deposited on the mountain pass three years ago by a practical joker.
The professor had been bouncing about the tennis court for half an hour,
whooping and exclaiming. Now he collected up his things, thanked the coach,
complained that he had not been up to his best but said he was glad to have
shed another ounce or two.
Meanwhile, a few fields away, a controversy was raging over a cabbage patch.
Another group of scientists had been given permission to release on to their
test site a genetically-altered virus designed to kill the caterpillar of a
pest called the cabbage looper. But a local resident, a materials scientist,
had spotted the statutory announcement in the local paper and protested. Was
there any guarantee, he wanted to know, that the virus - which contains a
gene for scorpion venom - would not attack other kinds of insect or breed
with wild viruses? It was the biggest row of its kind yet seen in Britain.
The experiment was interrupted.
These two trials, like thousands more going on in medicine and agriculture
all over the world, are the results of a biological revolution started by
the leaping tennis player, James D. Watson, and his colleague Francis Crick.
Their discovery of the molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA,
the famous double helix, was made more than 40 years ago at the Cavendish
Laboratory in Cambridge. It was published in that annus mirabilis of 1953,
just before the Queen's coronation and the British team's conquest of
Everest.
It was a vital link in the chain of discoveries which the late Sir Peter
Medawar called in his book Pluto's Republic 'the greatest achievement of
science in the 20th century'. Not only did Crick and Watson share the Nobel
prize for it but, contrary to their own expectations at the time, lived to
see its extraordinary consequences.
They are both alive, and both still kicking. Francis Crick, now 78, holds a
specially-created research post at the Salk Institute in La Jolla,
California. On a visit to London last month to promote his new book he told
me: 'The general reaction of younger people - if they don't say it you can
see it in their eyes - is 'Good heavens] Are you still alive?'' He recounted
how a young woman was selling a car to him and his wife, Odile. On hearing
the name she looked suspiciously at Crick: 'Anything to do with DNA?' He
confirmed that he was and she exclaimed: 'But I've got a photo of you over
my bed]'
The former colleagues are a paradoxical pair. Both work in the US, but
Watson, the American, is very much an Anglophile. Crick, the Englishman,
loves the Californian lifestyle. Rather like the double helix itself, the
two spiral strands of which unwind and decouple for replication, their own
lives have diverged. Yet beneath the skin they are remarkably similar.
Jim Watson is the younger man but looks older. He confessed that he had
grown overweight during his long tenure at Cold Spring Harbor, the
laboratory on Long Island, New York, where he is director and responsible
for raising funds for young medical researchers. But the year he has been
spending as a visiting fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, has allowed him
time to get fit and recover something of his former skinny profile. Behind
the old man's visage one can recognise the gawky, precocious youth with the
large eyes, crooked smile and self-mocking, slurping chuckle who arrived in
Cambridge in 1951.
Francis Crick's hair is white but the face below it is seamless and young,
for all that he has lived the past 18 years on the West Coast. He is still
the energetic talker described by Watson in his best-seller, The Double
Helix, but there is little trace today of the hyena laugh which so upset Sir
Lawrence Bragg, head of the Cavendish laboratory. Nor does he display that
characteristic which Watson noted in the famous first sentence of the book:
'I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.' Crick says now: 'I think
he meant I was usually exuberant. He just used the wrong word.' Maybe.
Although their work separated them long ago, the two men meet occasionally.
When they talk about each other now it is with a critical but nostalgic
affection - with admiration, too. Watson, the precocious one (he went to the
university of Chicago at the age of 15), says Crick has the faster brain. He
still professes to be puzzled that the older man, so brimming with ideas,
should have taken as long as he did - he was in his mid-30s when they
discovered the double helix - to make his mark.
Watson has been described as the Boswell without whose book his collaborator
might not have become known to the public at all. 'Francis went to the
extremes of trying to avoid the press,' he said, 'which I think diminished
his importance in the world.' Watson once wrote that Crick would prove to be
as important a scientist as Rutherford or Bohr. Had he? 'I think so.'
And how does Crick describe his Boswell? 'He is still what you might call
the unAmerican boy. He doesn't conform very easily. But he has turned out to
be an extraordinarily good scientific administrator, for example, both at
raising money and at getting good people. He's very shrewd, in fact.'
Both say they owe their present elevated position to the fact that they are
Nobel laureates. They shared the prize in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins, a
friend of Crick's from the war years, whose X-ray diffraction work on the
DNA molecule at King's College, London, was vital to the discovery. There
were other benefits, said Crick, one of which was getting past bureaucrats.
He described how, scruffily dressed, he went to the US embassy in London for
a visa so that he could deliver a lecture in America. The woman behind the
desk asked him how he could support himself on one lecture alone and was
incredulous when told he was getting paid Dollars 1,000 for it (this was
some years ago), and transfigured when she learnt he was a Nobel
prizewinner.
'But it doesn't help socially,' said Crick, 'because people treat you as
some sort of strange animal. If they find themselves at dinner sitting next
to a Nobel prizewinner they worry about what their conversation is like.'
Neither man will say that the double helix was the climax of his career,
that the rest had been less interesting. Watson maintains that he has
derived more pleasure from his books in the long run - the textbooks as well
as the best-seller - 'because they were totally my own'. He is writing a
sequel to The Double Helix about his life after Cambridge, in which he
describes his pursuit of pretty girls and his eventual marriage, at the age
of 40, to Elizabeth Lewis. He wants to call the sequel Genes and Girls, if
his publisher will let him. 'First I found the perfect molecule and then the
perfect woman,' he laughed.
Watson returned to the US in 1953, still only 25 years old and feeling, as
he wrote later, 'too old to be unusual'. He worked with the distinguished
chemist Linus Pauling and taught at Harvard before being appointed to run
the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory. Crick stayed on at Cambridge finished his
PhD and helped crack the genetic code.
Through his research students, Watson is still interested in pursuing genes,
especially those which could account for medical disorders such as cancer,
Alzheimer's disease, or manic depression. He became part-time director of
the human genome project in Washington, DC, but was sacked by the parent
body, the US National Institutes of Health two years ago, allegedly for a
potential conflict of interest between his professional work and private
shareholdings in biotechnology companies.
But the real reason, he said, was a clash between his scientific opinion and
a bureaucrat's power game. In his characteristically blunt way, he had
publicly disagreed with the 'absurd' policy of patenting short sequences of
DNA, which he argued were commercially valueless.
These days he is interested in medical ethics. By this, he does not mean
what most people mean. Of course, he said, there is a problem in deciding
how far people should be warned of their genetic predisposition to
particular illnesses. 'But the major ethical problem - one which faces the
British government, for example - is whether it will spend the money to
ensure that its citizens have as healthy babies as possible. That's the
major one.' In other words, he is worried not that legislators will let
scientists interfere too much, but interfere too little.
'We have the wrong priorities,' he said. 'We tend to get stuck on something
about which you can argue for ever. But does a family want a child that
can't learn? Are we going to help people have functional families? It's just
common sense. I think the problem will disappear if we ask the right
questions.' Watson speaks with feeling: one of his own two sons was born
with a serious learning handicap.
And here the similarity of thinking between Crick and Watson, so productive
at the Cavendish all those years ago, becomes apparent. Both are frank and
passionate materialists who run a mile from the comfort of metaphysical
explanations. 'Are we similar types? Yes,' said Watson. 'I think we think in
the same way. Francis always thought much quicker and better than I do. But
we sort of have similar reactions to people.'
To the big questions also. Francis Crick's latest book, published in May, is
called The Astonishing Hypothesis. It is the product of his new career at
the Salk Institute as a neuroscientist specialising in visual perception.
(Watson has plans for similar research.)
Crick's hypothesis is simply that human consciousness, personality, the soul
 -whatever you will - are entirely explicable in terms of brain activity.
Approaching the mystery of consciousness with the same ruthlessness that the
pair applied to the secret of life, Crick argues that the only way we can
explain ourselves to ourselves is to get right inside, to the brain cells,
and look.
'To very religious people I say: we don't know which way this thing is
turning out. It may turn out there is something immaterial that we don't
know about.' For example there was a serious difficulty in accounting for
qualia - phenomena such as the 'redness' of red.
So human beings are machines? 'You mustn't call us machines,' said Crick. 'I
would put it the other way round. We should be saying 'Isn't it remarkable
that this thing inside my head does such wonderful things]' We won't destroy
the wonder. We are simply trying to remove the mystery.'
Crick's remark could be an appropriate epitaph, for one thing is certain.
The two old men of the double helix will not be around to see the results.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Long View: Midsummer's dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bland complacency of the Treasury's summer forecast for the UK economy
this week clashed strikingly with the recent mood of puzzled alarm in the
securities markets. It seems from the Treasury's document that chancellor
Kenneth Clarke has nothing to worry about as the economy cruises steadily
towards comfortable equilibrium - except perhaps about precisely how to time
modest tax reductions for the best effect ahead of the next general
election.
Certainly, recent dives in equities and gilts do not fit into this rosy
picture. It must be, the Treasury muses, that confused investors have become
over-alarmed about a possible future rise in inflation. As usual the
Treasury is completely out of touch.
The Treasury's computer model is far from being the worst of its kind at
tracking the economy, and indeed the results have been adjusted further in
line with the consensus, but recent history has shown that such devices are
hopeless at forecasting the future.
The document only really tells us how the government would like the future
to be. Financial markets, in contrast, reflect the actual effects of money
flowing through the global economy. This year they have indicated that large
shifts are taking place. No reliable economic forecast can be found here
either; but at least there is no wishful thinking.
Halfway through the year the financial damage is, briefly, as follows: the
long-dated gilt-edged yield up from 6.4 to 8.7 per cent, the corresponding
index-linked yield up from 2.9 to almost 4.0 per cent, and the All-Share
Index down by 13 per cent. At the low point a week ago the Footsie index of
100 blue chips was showing a decline of 18 per cent from its February 2
peak.
Six months ago I suggested that equities were overpriced and becoming
dangerous, although the turning point might not be all that close (it was
nearer than I thought). I also warned that trouble would ensue when the
benign relationship between the US and Japanese capital markets, which had
prevailed in bullish 1993, broke down.
At under 3,000 on the Footsie the UK equity market has returned to a level
offering reasonable long-term value. By this I mean that if you buy now you
will not feel embarrassed about the decision in three or four years.
The dividend yield is now back to 4 per cent on the market as a whole and,
with dividends growing at a comparatively rapid rate of 6.4 per cent
year-on-year, the income argument for holding shares has been reinstated.
The market price-earnings ratio, based on prospective 1994 earnings, is
rather less alluring at perhaps 15. Low dividend cover continues to be a
problem, although it is surmountable if a couple of years of decent profits
growth can be achieved. It is likely that shares will get cheaper. We are
coming out of the part of the economic cycle when equities tend to be
overvalued in relation to the long-term fundamentals and are entering the
phase of possible undervaluation, because real interest rates are rising.
The complication here is that real interest rates are not primarily set by
what is going on locally in the UK but are heavily influenced by global
developments. Last year the weaknesses in the Japanese and Continental
European economies encouraged a fall in interest rates. But with Europe, at
least, recovering, if not yet Japan, the balance has changed in 1994.
A key external sign of the shift is the weakness of the dollar, down from
112 to 99 yen this year. The explanation is simply one of supply and demand;
not only are the Americans running a current account deficit of Dollars
140bn a year but they are buying large amounts of foreign securities to
diversify their portfolios. To offset these flows foreigners must make
dollar deposits or buy dollar securities to the tune in aggregate of some
Dollars 250bn-300bn. This year their appetite has run out.
In particular the Japanese, the world's last big source of surplus savings,
are staying at home. Their view of the outside world can be summed up by one
of the statistics buried deep in the FT-Actuaries World Index matrix: the
World ex Japan index, expressed in yen, has tumbled by 16 per cent in six
months.
There is evidently a bear market on, say investors in Tokyo. The bond
markets look even worse. But the world's equity markets appear so
differently from a viewpoint in the US. The World ex US index, in dollars,
is 8 per cent higher. There is a bull market, Americans think, albeit a
modest one - and focused almost entirely on Japan.
What happens now? Most likely, the Americans will be forced at some stage to
raise interest rates, perhaps quite sharply, in order to reverse the flows
out of the dollar.
The dollar-yen exchange rate may have to go to a silly level first.
Eventually the Japanese, and others, will pile into dollar bonds. But the
global economy will slow down, which could damage equities.
This time last year, when the Footsie was close to where it is now, I
suggested that share prices might be driven up in a liquidity-based surge,
into which I would be a seller. We may now face the mirror image of that.
Equities may be hit by the backlash from the necessary rebalancing of the
dollar economy.
Yet the second half of the year may be a time for exploiting opportunity,
just as the first half has been a period for avoiding risk. Savers who were
panicked out of low interest rate deposit accounts in the early weeks of
1994 did the wrong thing. They might eventually regret a reverse move this
summer.
If you feel worried, my advice would be to splash out Pounds 6 on the
Treasury's summer forecast, sit in the warm sunshine and wallow in its
purple passages (well, blue charts anyway). Sometimes there is no harm in
dreaming.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Builders step up fight over planning guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unprecedented initiative to unite industry against government planning
guidelines has been launched by the Housebuilders Federation, which fears
that development may face restrictions.
The housebuilders have approached carmakers and retailers to see if they
would join in opposing Environment Department guidelines which they say
pander to environmental activists and threaten economic recovery.
The move comes as the government is struggling to recapture its traditional
supporters in southern England, many of whom oppose development in rural
areas.
Companies approached by the Housebuilders Federation include car
manufacturers Ford and Vauxhall and retailer J. Sainsbury. It has also
contacted the British Road Federation, the British Property Federation and
Bacmi, the trade association of the British Aggregates Construction
Materials Industries.
Mr Roger Humber, federation director, said: 'We are merely sounding out
other industries to see if they share our concern about the way in which
planning policy is being shaped by the Environment Department.'
Housebuilders fear that government policies allowing local authorities
greater autonomy to determine housing requirements will restrict development
in shire counties where demand for homes is greatest.
The British Road Federation and the British Property Federation have also
criticised policy guidelines issued to local authorities by Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, discouraging out-of-town developments that require
people to travel. A planning policy guidance note - PPG 13 - issued jointly
with the Transport Department said development policies designed to reduce
travel might help cut fuel consumption and emissions by 15 per cent over 20
years.
The BRF said yesterday: 'The Environment Department is in danger of becoming
a hostage to fortune to some of the more extreme elements in the
environmental movement.'
The British Property Federation said the wording of the Environment
Department's support of the policy on sustainable development could 'allow
local authorities to prevent worthwhile developments which are, in no way,
globe-threatening'.
The road and property federations said yesterday they would be prepared to
consider an approach with housebuilders. Ford said it was considering its
position. Sainsbury was unavailable for comment yesterday.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Murdoch acquires free stake in German satellite TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With characteristic flair and chutzpah, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
yesterday acquired a stake in the Vox satellite television channel in
Germany - for nothing.
The deal gives News Corp 49.9 per cent of the broadcaster, which went into
liquidation on April l. However, the Murdoch group will not take on any of
the TV station's debt.
News Corp, whose interests include a 50 per cent stake in British Sky
Broadcasting in the UK, the Fox television network in the US and control of
Star TV in Asia, will contribute 'programming expertise'.
The deal represents Mr Murdoch's most significant move into the German
television market.
Launched at the beginning of last year, Vox has been in trouble from the
start because of its programme mix and disagreements between the original
six shareholders. It is estimated to have cost shareholders, including media
group Bertelsmann, DM400m (Pounds 161m) since its launch.
The channel, billed originally as 'television for university graduates', is
required by its licence to have a heavy information content. However, it
seems likely that it will now be redefined and aimed at a younger market,
possibly with more entertainment programmes.
Vox has about a 2 per cent audience share and is believed to be ninth out of
15 cable and satellite channels in the German market. However, it is one of
only three channels to have access to the entire German terrestrial and
cable television network. It is also carried on both the Astra and the
Kopernikus satellite television systems.
Bertelsmann, which is second only to Time Warner on the world media stage,
will retain its 24.9 per cent in Vox. Yesterday it said the closure of the
broadcaster had been 'averted at the last minute' after a 'months-long
negotiating marathon'.
The remaining 25.2 percent of the broadcaster will be held by a trustee
until other investors are found. There is speculation that Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, which holds a 49.9 per cent stake in RTL,
a rival channel, will take a stake in Vox.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets barely stirred at the latest surge in coffee prices. With
around 25 per cent of its profits coming from coffee, Nestle has most at
stake, although Philip Morris - through Kraft General Foods - and Procter &amp;
Gamble also have significant exposures to the brown stuff. Judging by the
steady performance of Nestle shares, investors are taking the view that
manufacturers will have little trouble defending margins despite a 40 per
cent rise in commodity prices.
Past experience certainly gives grounds for confidence. When coffee prices
soared in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s consumers were mostly prepared to
swallow the increase. But in the current price-conscious climate, though,
there is no guarantee that history will repeat itself. Both Philip Morris
and P&amp;G have adopted aggressive pricing strategies in other consumer
markets. Even if consumers are unwilling to pay more this time around,
though, it is difficult to see Nestle being squeezed.
Its strength in instant coffee - where the commodity accounts for only a
small proportion of the retail price - is a competitive advantage. Ground
coffee manufacturers will face greater pressure to raise retail prices.
Although Nestle is coy about the extent of its hedging, it is generally
reckoned to buy more coffee forward than the industry average. And on the
reasonable assumption that as market leader Nestle enjoys higher margins
than most of its competitors, particularly own-label manufacturers, higher
commodity prices could be an opportunity to consolidate its lead.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Vendome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fusion of the Dunhill and Cartier luxury goods businesses created one of
the world's biggest purveyors of trinkets to the glittering classes. With a
market value of more than Pounds 3bn, Vendome represents one of the most
accessible means for exploiting the rich. Lingering recession in Europe and
Japan may have hampered progress last year. But Vendome should rake in the
money once recovery rages. Such thinking has helped the shares race ahead
since last year's listing.
Yet, on closer inspection, it is hard to justify Vendome's opulent rating.
The internal workings of the Vendome empire remain opaque. The cost savings
of combining the two businesses have been negligible. Nor, as yet, is there
much evidence to suggest the merger has produced any incremental sales
gains. Other luxury goods businesses, such as LVMH and Hermes, have been
notably more upbeat about this year's prospects. That either reflects
excessive caution on Vendome's part or a realisation that the merger's
benefits will take time to realise. By then, however, Vendome's abnormally
low tax charge will have unwound, gnawing away at earnings gains.
Moreover, there is little attraction in the yield. The company may generate
cash in profusion but that will not necessarily translate into generous
dividends. Vendome's pay-out policy is likely to be dictated more by the
cash-flow needs of the majority shareholder, Richemont, than the wishes of
minority investors. Vendome's shares, like its products, are only for those
with extravagant tastes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 index seems to have found a footing above 2,900 this week, but
it would be rash to assume that its troubles are over. First there is the
hurdle of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting next week. Then
there is the industrial summit at the weekend. With the dollar looking weak
again last night, the chances remain that US interest rates could be raised.
Indeed, the currency could fall quite sharply if the summit passes without
such action. Either way the markets look vulnerable to upset all over again.
On a historic multiple of around 15, equities look reasonable value in
theory and could attract some cash now that the new quarter has started. But
the yield premium over index-linked gilts remains very tight at only around
10 basis points. Equities thus have very little room to outperform.
Thanks in part to some generous payouts by electricity companies, dividends
are growing at around 10 per cent. At a stretch the prospect of real
dividend growth could offer some compensation for equities' narrow premium
over index-linked gilts. The trouble is that high real dividend growth
depends on rising earnings which in turn requires continued robust recovery.
If that happens rising real interest rates in the gilt-edged market could
still hold equities back.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo on the loose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Champagne corks were popping at Lasmo's headquarters last night. The
rejection of Enterprise's hostile bid was in part a thumbs-up for Lasmo's
reformed management and balance sheet. But more decisive than Lasmo's
positive qualities was Enterprise's failure to show any industrial logic in
the bid and investors' distaste for the all-paper offer. So Mr Joe Darby,
Lasmo's chief executive, still has to prove he can get the company's costs
down and make the most of its development prospects.
The bigger challenge, though, is faced by Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's
chairman and chief executive. Shareholders have shown little confidence in
his 'big boys' strategy of growing through acquisition. Lasmo's defensive
salvos have thrown into doubt whether past acquisitions have been in
shareholders' interests. Moreover, Enterprise's desperate purchase this week
of 10 per cent of Lasmo is showing a paper loss of about Pounds 30m, while
the company has wasted millions more on bid costs.
Now is a good time for Enterprise to reassess its strategy. Growth through
acquisition does not seem the best way to enhance shareholders' wealth. It
would be better to focus on exploration, where Enterprise's previously
excellent record has recently become rather tarnished. One way of sharpening
the focus would be to split Enterprise into two. One half would contain the
bulk of its production assets, pay investors handsome dividends and
gradually liquidate itself. The other half would concentrate on exploration.
But before Enterprise could contemplate a radical change of strategy, it
would probably be necessary for Mr Hearne to split his roles of chairman and
chief executive.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt turns its attention
to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that long bonds were thought likely to recover in the third quarter
of 1994, was no help to markets - Paris, and Madrid in particular - where
they continued to fall on the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT opened the third quarter with a nod in the direction of the
strategists who have been saying that banks deserve a spell in the sun
again, after a long time out in the cold. Deutsche Bank, Dresdner and
Commerzbank, Germany's big three, managed to rise in tandem: by DM10 to
DM694, DM4.30 to DM379, and DM4 to DM328 as the Dax index rose 11.18 to
2,036.52.
Mr Ian McEwen at Merrill Lynch in London said that there was sense in this.
'German banks are cheaper relative to the market than they have ever been,'
he said. 'They underperformed in 1992 and 1993 in spite of an excellent
profit performance and they have underperformed again this year.'
The sector, said Mr McEwen, will produce interim trading figures towards the
end of this month, and in the first week of August. Within those, trading
will be the volatile element after the bear market in global bonds this
year.
He expects the banks, in fact, to be in touch overall with 1993 performance,
apart from Deutsche which has had a particular problem with interest
margins. 'Among other things,' he said, 'Deutsche had the cheapest funding
base, and when market rates come down the relative advantage of that base is
eroded.'
Turnover fell from DM7bn to DM5.9bn. After hours, there was excitement in
Mannesmann on news that its management board chairman, Mr Werner Dieter, is
under investigation by Dusseldorf prosecutors after allegations that he
disguised private interests in a company which won huge orders from a
Mannesmann subsidiary. The shares fell DM6 on the news to DM397, recovering
to DM400.
AMSTERDAM reversed early falls to end marginally firmer on position squaring
ahead of the long US holiday weekend and in response to the better
performance of the dollar. The AEX index put on 0.98 to 384.52, up 0.8 per
cent on the week.
DSM, the chemical group, added to the week's gains, which followed a
positive analyst's note, gaining Fl 2.90 to Fl 129.50.
Begemann, the troubled engineering group, dropped Fl 1.80 or 5.3 per cent to
Fl 32.20, after a warning that it faced union demonstrations.
A Fl 2 rise to Fl 46.20 in Pakhoed, the transport and storage group, was
attributed to short covering.
MILAN finished a lacklustre week in apathetic mood, still awaiting firm
budget proposals from the government. The Comit index fell 6.09 to 683.50,
down 2.2 per cent on the week, although the real time Mibtel index finished
the day 4 higher at 10,923, reflecting a late pick up in some prices.
The market was distracted by the resignation of the board of RAI, the state
broadcaster, claiming political interference, which fuelled suggestions of
political mismanagement by the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Fiat was pulled back from a high of L6,405, to finish L2 lower at L6,374,
again unable to make progress following Thursday's upbeat comments by Mr
Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman, and the forecast that the group would return
to profit this year.
Among other blue chips, Pirelli finished L7 higher at L2,480, Montedison
picked up L10 of the week's losses to L1,470 and Generali, the insurer,
rebounded L143 to L40,783, but off a high of L41,150.
PARIS ended 1 per cent down on the day and 1.8 per cent lower on the week,
brokers saying that bonds were weak, French fund managers were absent and
short of liquidity, and that foreign arbitrageurs were sellers. The CAC-40
index ended 19.14 lower at 1,872.86 in turnover of FFr3.31bn.
Accor, the travel group, fell FFr19 to FFr595 after an intraday low for the
year of FFr589 on a sell recommendation from Paribas. There was more trouble
too, for money raisers in the Eurostock category, this time for Euro Disney
which fell 50 centimes to a year's low of FFr11.25, against a rights issue
price of FFr10.
MADRID's domestic bonds suffered another weak and erratic day and it took
late institutional support for equities to leave the general index only 1.06
lower at 299.08, off the intraday low of 297.40.
Turnover was Pta31bn, but around Pta10bn of that was attributed to block
trades. In banks, BBV fell Pta70 to Pta2,810; it said that net profits could
fall by up to 20 per cent in the first half because of Pta25bn losses on the
bank's fixed income portfolio.
Of the other banks that may be affected by debt losses, Santander fell Pta35
to Pta4,700, and Argentaria by Pta60 to Pta5,040.
Telefonica held firm again at Pta1,770 as the Spanish telecommunications
company said that it had joined Unisource as its fourth member.
Unisource, a joint venture including PTT Telecom Netherlands, Telia of
Sweden and Swiss Telecom PTT until now, offers a range of telecommunications
products for multinational companies.
ZURICH continued to worry about the dollar and interest rates and prices
fell in another derivatives led session. The SMI index fell 19.9 to 2,588.9,
for a 0.5 per cent rise on the week.
Banks remained under pressure with UBS losing SFr10 to SFr1,152, and
insurers also slipped.
Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and Vendome luxury goods group, fell SFr20
to SFr1,060 as it reported a 45 per cent fall in consolidated net earnings
in the year to March 31, mainly because of restructuring charges.
STOCKHOLM fell 1.7 per cent, having picked up from early lows, as debt
market yields climbed after Skandia, the insurer, said it was boycotting
Swedish state bonds.
The Affarsvarlden index fell 22.8 to 1,349.6 and brokers forecast further
falls next week as the market grew increasingly concerned at the
government's inability to put forward a budget deficit reduction programme.
Skandia's share fell SKr3 to SKr105.
ATHENS lost 1.5 per cent on the day, and a fraction less on the week in
record low turnover for 1994, the general index falling 13.01 to 836.30.
However, the market newcomer, Chipita, ended at the eight per cent upper
volatility limit in its second day of trading, closing at Dr4,082. More than
9,000 Chipita shares changed hands and a queue formed to bid for some
150,000 shares, with none offered toward the close.
COPENHAGEN was slightly lower on profit-taking but the market resisted
strong downward pressure from falling bond prices. The KFX top-20 index lost
0.35 to 102.39.
Shares in Danisco went against the trend to end DKr27 higher at DKr947 in
response to Thursday's announcement of better than expected full year
profits.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lacklustre Dow lifted by late
buying flurry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks benefited yesterday from a late flurry of buying just
before the market closed for long Independence Day weekend, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.69 better at 3,646.65, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.93 at 446.20. Volume
on the Big Board was light, as many investors decided to begin the holiday a
day early. Only 198m shares were traded.
The secondary markets showed little change, with the American SE inching
0.64 ahead to 424.72, and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.89 to 706.85.
In the previous session, the Dow industrials slid 42 points as the bond
market reacted badly to signs of mounting inflationary pressures in the
manufacturing sector.
Yesterday there was more of the same kind of economic news. The National
Association of Purchasing Management said that its June index of business
activity slipped, while more of its members paid higher prices during the
month. The results mirrored those contained in a regional survey released
Thursday, but investors in neither stocks nor bonds were in the mood for
another sell-off.
The dollar offered some support, gaining ground on the yen, but its recent
erosion remained a peripheral issue for US equity investors. Many of them
were reluctant to make a move until it becomes clear next week whether the
Federal Reserve will lift interest rates next week in support of the
greenback.
At the opening, bargain hunters helped lift the blue chips by nearly 26
points, but the early gains dissolved by midday. Stocks caught a second wind
during the afternoon, and finished strongly.
Among the cyclicals, Alcoa was Dollars 2 3/8 higher at Dollars 75 1/2 and
International Paper climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/4 . On the
negative side, IBM dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57.
Profit-taking pushed CBS down Dollars 3 to Dollars 307. A day earlier, the
stock surged on news that the media group was close to an agreement to merge
with QVC, the home-shopping network. QVC receded Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37
1/4 yesterday. Fresh acquisition news fanned interest in Circus Circus, a
casino operator.
The stock jumped 20.3 per cent, or Dollars 4 3/8 , to Dollars 25 7/8 on a
report that Bally Entertainment was seeking federal approval to take a big
stake in its gaming rival. Bally added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 .
Venezuela
Caracas picked up 3.7 per cent in a technical adjustment following sharp
falls in recent days. The Merinvest composite index closed 4.7 higher at
133.23, with the benchmark Electricidad de Caracas up 14 bolivars at 333
bolivars. Corimon, the industrial holding was an exception among the
generally firm blue chips, losing 7.50 bolivars to 55.50 bolivars as a
result of a six-for-one dividend share issue.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Steady bullion price helps Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg gold shares rallied in response to the steady early bullion
price before ending off the day's highs as the metal failed to make further
progress.
Industrials, still uninspired by nervous equity markets elsewhere, were
stable around their slightly lower opening levels.
The overall index dipped 2 to 5,401, industrial lost 27 to 6,232 and golds
rose 39 to 2,127 as buyers returned after the sector's recent losses.
De Beers made 25 cents to R107 while Anglos rose R1 to R227.50. In golds,
Oryx added 15 cents to R4 and Vaal Reefs gained R11 to R415 while Loraine
slid 65 cents to R16.10.
Richemont lost 75 cents to R37.75 in response to results.
Iscor was 2 cents off at R3.52 while Trans-Natal was 50 cents up at R23.

FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News of Thursday's air crash in France involving the Airbus 330 aircraft
weakened British Aerospace leaving the shares to buck the market trend as
they closed 3 down at 454p. BAe is not only a 20 per cent stake holder in
the Airbus consortium project, but also builds the wings of the Airbus
series of aircraft.
Sentiment was also hurt by food retailer Asda's intention to write down the
value of its holding in property company Burwood House Group, jointly owned
with BAe. Analysts suggested the company will soon have to revalue its 50
per cent holding in the joint venture to match the move made by Asda.
Researchers also pointed out that BAe's announcement on Thursday that it was
changing the way it funds its 30 per cent holding in mobile phones operator
Hutchinson telecommunications would effectively add previously
off-balance-debt on to the balance sheet.
The latest upsurge in crude oil prices, which saw Brent crude for July
delivery move comfortably above the Dollars 18 a barrel level, saw the oil
majors make strong progress. 'If the dollar stages anything of a rally next
week, then the leaders should do very well,' said one oil specialist at a
leading UK intergrated house.
Oil prices were said to be moving higher in wake of strike threats in the
Nigerian oilfields could with worries that the civil unrest in the Yemen
could halt the 200,000 barrels a day oil flow from that country.
BP moved up 2 1/2 to 392p, while Shell edged up 4 to 684p. British Gas were
held back by ongoing regulatory fears and eased 1 1/2 to 267p. But one of
the market's top broking houses was said to be talking a strong buy story on
the shares, emphasising the dividend dividend.
Burmah Castrol was one of the FT-SE 100's worst individual performers, the
shares sliding 15 to 851p after a sell note published by Nomura, the
Japanese-owned broker.
Mr Nick Clayton at Nomura said Burmah shares had outperformed by 20 per cent
over the past six months and stood at their highest price earnings rating
against the UK market for more than ten years. 'Investors can currently buy
BP on a lower rating to Burmah thereby gaining exposure to the superior
earnings growth resulting from its aggressive restructuring and cost cutting
programme,' the Nomura analyst said.
Talk of better than expected new subscriber numbers for June, rounding off
what is expected to be an excellent quarterly performance for the cellular
phones group, was said to have been behind the latest rise in Vodafone
shares, which jumped 9 to 499p.
ICI rose 15 more to 790p after a successful presentation at Goldman Sachs,
the US brokerage.
Chiltern Radio leapt 33 to 273p after the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust
rejected the CLT bid for its existing 18.5 per cent and moved into the
market to buy a near-10 per cent stake at 300p a share.
A volatile session was seen in luxury products group Vendome. The shares
closed 6 better at 444p, after it suggested in a results statement that
recovery hopes may be premature.
Activity in the banks sector subsided after the flurry of selling that
affected the shares on Thursday in the wake of news that Abbey National had
instigated a price cutting war in bank overnight interest rates. Abbey stock
moved up 7 to 400p.
Dealers said TSB, which dropped below the 200p level for the first time
since September last year, was the only leading bank to suffer any follow
through selling after the rate cutting news. TSB shares settled a net 2 1/2
off at 200 1/2 p on turnover of 5.1m shares.
Barclays, on the other hand, rose 11 to 530p and NatWest 9 1/2 to 441p.
The market's leading insurance brokers began to creep ahead amid talk that a
broker buy recommendation is in the process of being prepared. Willis
Corroon edged up 2 to 1480p, as did Sedgwick, 174p.
The Hoare Govett buy recommendation helped life stocks move ahead with
Prudential leading the sector higher and finally 4 better at 291p.
Continued profit-taking in Allied Lyons, which is to hold an analysts
presentations on Tuesday, saw the shares give up 10 to 543p.
A squeeze in Kingfisher helped the shares appreciate 9 to 508p. A single
large buyer of Marks &amp; Spenser sent the shares climbing 7 1/2 to 399p.
Shares in Rolls-Royce closed 2 ahead at 175p, following trade of 3.8m, after
a recommendation from investment bank Lehman Brothers in its review of the
six best performing stocks of the year.
Lehman said: 'We believe that over the next 12 months or so, Rolls-Royce may
at last be able to achieve some positive earnings surprises.'
Analysts at the bank also predicted an improvement in civil spares business.

FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector bid move fails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The death throes of the Enterprise bid for Lasmo saw the market get wind of
the failure of the often acrimonious bid battle and stimulated the Stock
Exchange into declaring prices for the two stocks as 'indicative only' -
meaning that those on the screen are not firm for trading.
At the close of a tense trading session Lasmo shares slipped back from a
day's high point of 138p to close a net 1 1/2 higher at 136p, while
Enterprise advanced rapidly late in the session, as the bid hopes faded, to
close 9 1/2 higher at 398 1/2 p.
Analysts said Enterprise's failure would be viewed by the market as a vote
of no confidence in the Enterprise management. 'The shares may go up in the
short term but that will represent relief that there will not be the much
feared 'cascade' of Enterprise paper if the bid had gone through. The shares
will also be buoyed by the latest upsurge in oil prices,' said one leading
oil analyst.
He also felt that Lasmo shares would improve on the oil price factor. 'The
10 per cent stock overhang, a legacy of Enterprise's failure, will obviously
be a significant restraining factor,' he said.
The failure of the Enterprise bid spilled over into the merchant banks
sector where SG Warburg, which represented Enterprise in the battle, fell
back in late trading to close 5 off at 684p.

FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buyers help shares to a firm
close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market cruised comfortably to a firm close yesterday, helped by
a steadier trend in the dollar and the bond markets ahead of the meeting
next week of the G7 countries. The final minutes of the London session were
featured by the dramatic disclosure that Enterprise Oil had failed in its
Pounds 1.7bn bid for Lasmo.
After some initial uncertainty, the stock market took its lead from
improvement in British government bonds. Bonds later lost most of their
early gains but share prices remained very firm although many were below the
best levels by the close. Traders reported some 'nostalgic buying for new
time' late yesterday, the last time such dealings will take place before the
London market switches over to a rolling account system on July 18.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Share Index at 2,936.4, for a net gain
on the day of 17.2. After opening lower behind weakness in the Dow Average
and Federal bonds overnight, the Footsie dipped 13 to 2,906.2. But equities
rallied well when gilts moved higher, and the Index was nearly 20 points up
at the day's peak.
The Footsie 100 Index has recovered by 59.8 points this week as markets
across Europe have rallied on strengthening hopes that the G7 meeting next
weekend will bring agreement on monetary co-operation to ease the problems
caused by the fall in the US dollar against the Yen.
But the damage wrought on bond prices by the dollar's setback has been
reflected in a fall of nearly 3 per cent in the Footsie 100 over the two
week equity account which closed last night.
Share losses across the broader range of the market left the FT-SE Mid 250
Index down 1.7 at 3,415.8 yesterday, and about 3.1 per cent lower over the
equity account. Traders stressed the 'better tone' which developed in the
stock market yesterday. Several small trading programmes were identified and
at least one overseas fund was believed to be trying to put money - perhaps
as much as Pounds 100m - into the UK market. It was thought that the fund
was unable to commit all this cash to equities yesterday but traders hoped
that the fund manager would try again next week.
Trading volume dipped to 517.1m shares from the 601.1m of the previous
session, when customer business of Pounds 1.29bn was comfortably within the
range of profitable trading levels from the point of view of the securities
trading houses.
UK government bonds took their lead from US Treasuries, slipping back from
their best levels when the prices component of the June Index of the US
National Association of Purchasing Managers rose to its highest level for
nearly six years. UK bonds steadied to close with gains of 3/32 at the short
end of the scale and much the same in long dated stocks.
Traders commented that many fund managers had reduced investment activity
yesterday afternoon ahead of the extended weekend holiday in the New York
markets. In addition to being foreshortened by the one day closure of US
markets, next week will bring meetings of the US Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee, the Bundesbank policy committee and finally the G7 finance
ministers.
Faced with this battery of high-powered decision makers, investors are
unlikely to hasten in implementing any new investment plans for the third
quarter of the year.

It was a slack session in the derivatives markets, and although the stock
index future contract provided a confident lead for equities, trading volume
was not heavy, writes Terry Byland. The September contract held at a small
premium to the cash market, although the closing quotation of 2,945 on
September showed a discount of about 4 to fair value.
In traded options, the picture was much the same. Overall volume dipped to
22,311 contracts from more than 29,000 on Thursday. Only 8,622 contracts
were recorded in the FT-SE option.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar limped to the end of a difficult week yesterday as the market
cast its view ahead to next week's rash of important G3 central bank
meetings and the G7 summit in Naples, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency flattered to deceive, being unable to hold onto early gains
which saw it recover from a post-war low of Y97.68 reached in Tokyo.
It closed in London at Y98.705, and DM1.5946 after earlier reaching
DM1.6025.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish krona and Italian lira were the focus of
attention with both currencies suffering from worries about the state of
public finances in the respective countries.
Sterling had an uneventful day, finishing at DM2.4525 from DM 2.4564, and
Dollars 1.538 from Dollars 1.5435.
Trade was fairly muted yesterday, with many investors taking to the
sidelines ahead of the Independence day long weekend in the US, and next
week's meetings.
The nervous response of the market, however, to rumours that the Bank of
Japan might cut its discount rate prompted some traders to predict a bumpy
ride next week. Others said that investors would probably sit on the
sidelines until after the G7 summit.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented:
'Market expectations are building that we will get some sort of concerted G3
policy next week.'
Rumours of BOJ intervention were fuelled by comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US treasury secretary, that the dollar and world growth would be helped
by German and Japanese rate cuts.
The dollar gave up its earlier gains during late European trading. Some
traders were disappointed that the central banks had not chosen to
intervene, saying the combination of a rising currency and thin Friday trade
was opportune.
The June purchasing managers index, where the pricing component rose to a
six year high, was largely ignored by the market.
The krona and the lira were the focus of attention in Europe. After
threatening in early trade to breach the L1,000 level against the D-Mark,
falling as low as L999.70, the Italian currency recovered to close unchanged
in London at L994.7. There were unconfirmed rumours that the Bank of Italy
had intervened to support the currency.
The lira touched a record low against the D-Mark of L1,010.50 on December 2,
1993. Apart from concerns about the budget deficit, traders said technical
factors had also driven the currency lower. Volumes were reported to be low,
and price movements volatile.
The Swedish krona finished at SKr4.906, up from a low of SKr4.9650, against
the D-Mark. Part of the weakness in the Swedish currency was attributable to
rumours that Skandia Insurance was refusing to buy Swedish bonds,
aggravating fears about a lack of progress in dealing with the budget
deficit.
Activity in the interest rate futures markets was very muted. The December
eurosterling contract finished unchanged at 93.71, while the December
euromark contract closed at 94.94 from 94.91.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 700m assistance to the market after
forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee sets record tumbling - Week
in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee, which has been leading the averages in the world commodity league
for some time, put in a performance worthy of Brian Lara this week. Records
tumbled as futures prices surged on both sides of the Atlantic in response
to Monday's news of damaging frosts in Brazilian growing areas.
That day's Dollars 593-a-tonne rise for second position futures at the
London Commodity Exchange was the biggest ever, as was the Dollars 943 rise
on the week to Dollars 3,198 a tonne. And, coming on top of price advances
in a wide range of other commodities in recent weeks, coffee's dizzying rise
lifted the Reuter Commodity Index to an all-time high.
The degree of damage to next year's Brazilian coffee crop remains in doubt,
with estimates of bean losses from a previously expected harvest of 24m bags
(60kg each) ranging from 5m to 9m bags. Even if the damage turns out to be
at the lower end of the scale, however, prospects for a price retreat will
be limited by the fact that it came so early in the season, with six weeks
to go before the frost risk period is over. Brazil's worst-ever coffee
frost, which took out nearly three quarters of the following year's crop,
hit in mid-July, 1975.
The market impact of this blow to the 1995-96 crop was heightened on
Thursday night by a US Department of Agriculture report indicating that the
season will start with world stocks of coffee already at a historic low. The
department estimated that global consumption of coffee in the 1994-95
season, at 99.6m bags, would exceed production by 9m, taking stocks below
22m. It was in response to that news that the LCE second position leapt
yesterday morning to a peak of Dollars 3,300 a tonne, traders said.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London broker GNI, pointed out, however, that
the USDA assessment was made before this weeks market fireworks and said
that the higher prices might result in the deficit being reduced by as much
as 2m bags. He also suggested that the Brazilian government would see the
price rise as an opportunity to dispose of its 17m bags of stocks, which it
saw as a constraint on its coffee policy.
At the London Metal Exchange copper lead a general upturn in base metals
markets from midweek. But only aluminium and lead managed to finish with net
gains. Having dipped below Dollars 2,380 a tonne on Wednesday the three
months copper price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,441.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 26 on balance.
Aluminium's rally, which began a day earlier than copper's, was aided
yesterday by news of a big cut in LME warehouse stocks, the fifth in
succession. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,510.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 20 overall and Dollars 55.50 above Tuesday's low.
Lead was also helped by an LME stocks fall as it bounded to a 21-month high
yesterday. Three months metal closes at Dollars 582.50, up Dollars 22 on the
week, and dealers were not ruling out further gains. 'Fundamentally the lead
market looks quite constructive, and people are probably targeting
significantly higher numbers,' one told Reuter.
Precious metals fared less well. The gold finished Dollars 6.70 down at
Dollars 385 a troy ounce, having sustained most when US investment funds
turned against the market on Monday. Dealers suggested that the funds were
reacting to disappointment at the metal's failure to profit from the
dollar's weakness. Silver was also lower but platinum bounced yesterday on
consumer buying.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decline of the dollar and rise of commodity prices in general
have strengthened many spices markets, reports Man Producten. The currency
effect is straight forward. The relation ship of advances in coffee and oil
and others to spices is more subtle. Farmers and exporters in the source
markets tend to grow and handle a variety of materials. In Indonesia for
example, if coffee is active, the traders naturally concentrate on it.
Cassia which they may also sell, will not be cut or arrive from the
mountains. As a result shortages can develop. Alternatively, farmers may
take profits in coffee and hold spices which appears undervalued in
comparison. The nutmeg and mace markets were steady this week at levels that
remained very low compared with a few years ago, while a shortage of cassia
supplies from the interior of Sumatra kept prices high.

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enichem, the Italian state-owned chemicals group, should be able to halve
its losses this year after cutting costs. The group, which is wholly-owned
by Eni, the state holding company, made a net loss of L2,668bn (Dollars
1.7bn) in 1993, up from L1,560bn in 1992.
However, in the first four months of 1994, the company has managed to reduce
fixed costs by 10 per cent, while increasing income from its principal
products by 7 per cent. Overall sales are up 7.2 per cent to L3,711bn.
The company's gross operating profit in the first four months reached
L287bn, compared with L385bn for the whole of 1993, helped by a 4 per cent
fall in the cost of raw materials for its petrochemicals products.
Eni is trying to restore Enichem to financial health with a four-year
programme of restructuring and L2,500bn of asset sales.

issue

<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cartiere Burgo, the Italian paper and packaging group, plans a rights issue
to raise about L230bn (Dollars 146.7m). The money is to help pay for a
cellulose factory linked to a recently-acquired Belgian papermaker, writes
Andrew Hill.
The operation will involve the issue of new shares at L9,000 each, on the
basis of one new share for every five held. They will also carry warrants,
giving the right to subscribe to a further 4.33m new shares.
Burgo has an option to buy the cellulose factory, which has annual capacity
of 240,000 tonnes, before the end of September. It said economic and
technical evaluation of the site was under way, and that 'the first
indications are increasingly interesting'.
Proceeds of the rights issue will also be used for existing investment.

<TEXT>
Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecommunications monopoly, yesterday
revealed the first casualties of a drastic financial restructuring designed
to prepare for privatisation in 1996.
Mr Helmut Ricke, chairman, expressed his confidence that privatisation would
begin on schedule in 1996, with a first tranche of up to DM20bn (Dollars
12.7bn) in shares going on sale. His directors believe that up to 40 per
cent of the group's future shareholders will be foreign.
At the same time, Mr Ricke said he was 'extremely relieved' at news that the
privatisation legislation had been approved this week by the German
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. It now faces one last hurdle in
the Bundesrat, the upper house, on July 8.
He revealed that the immediate effect of restructuring was a net loss for
1993 of DM2.87bn, compared with a loss of DM1.27bn in 1992, in spite of a
sharp increase in turnover this time. Turnover rose 9.3 per cent to DM59bn.
Telekom blamed the loss mainly on a DM4.4bn asset revaluation, which reduced
profits before tax and government levies from DM7.6bn to DM3.2bn.
Taxes and levies payable to the federal government, including a straight 10
per cent charge on sales payable instead of corporation tax, totalled
DM6.1bn.
The full scale of the adjustment necessary before privatisation was spelt
out by Mr Ricke, and his finance director, Mr Joachim Kroske, in the annual
results.
The biggest problem for the enterprise is that its equity ratio - capital
and reserves as a proportion of total assets - has shrunk to just 22 per
cent, because of the huge borrowing programme to finance investments in
modernisation, notably in eastern Germany. Total debt is DM107.5bn, or
almost 70 per cent of the balance-sheet total, with a sharp increase in
debenture loans.
The massive investment programme in eastern Germany finally appears to be
slowing, with gross investment in plant and machinery amounting to DM24.5bn,
compared with DM27.5bn in 1992.
Mr Ricke said the key to future flexibility and competitiveness lay in the
development of new and stronger subsidiaries in important areas such as
mobile communications and cable television, and a push into international
joint ventures.
He singled out the strategic alliance with France Telecom to include Sprint,
the US telecommunications company, as 'the milestone of the year'.
The deal would pave the way for global telecommunications services, he said,
providing one-stop shopping to cosmopolitan residential customers, as well
as multinational business customers.
Heavy losses in the initial phase of mobile telephone investment - amounting
to DM800m at DeTeMobil on the D1 mobile net alone last year - should be
rapidly reduced. Losses would be less than half that rate in 1994, Mr Kroske
said.

FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Steel division boosts BHP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in the steel division helped Broken Hill Proprietary, the
Australian steel and resources group, to an after-tax profit of ADollars
1.28bn (USDollars 927.5m) for the year ended May.
The figure compares with profits of ADollars 991m in the previous 12 months,
rising to ADollars 1.19bn with abnormal items, including a ADollars 203.8m
tax benefit. There were no abnormal items in the 1993-94 accounts.
Although the result was broadly in line with analysts' forecasts, BHP shares
fell sharply in the generally weaker Australian market yesterday. They
closed down 24 cents at ADollars 17.74.
The steel side registered a profit of ADollars 537.1m on revenues of
ADollars 6.89bn. This was more than twice the previous year's ADollars
242.5m, before abnormals. BHP attributed the advance to lower unit costs -
thanks to higher production levels - and the combination of an improved
domestic market and higher export returns.
In the minerals division, it notched up profits of ADollars 681.7m, some
ADollars 8.8m above the underlying 1992-93 figure. This year's figure was
boosted by the consolidation of earnings from the Ok Tedi copper mine in
Papua New Guinea, where BHP last year acquired the minority interest
previously held by Amoco.
The petroleum division saw an 8.5 per cent profit improvement - again,
pre-abnormals - to ADollars 500.6m, in spite of the fall in oil prices. The
service companies contributed ADollars 135.7m, up from ADollars 75.8m,
mainly due to the receipt of ADollars 71.1m in dividends from Fosters
Brewing Group, in which BHP is a shareholder.
BHP chief executive, Mr John Prescott, said the group had not adjusted the
carrying value of its 37 per cent stake in Foster's, because it expected
this 'to be restored over time'. There had been speculation that BHP might
write down the holding, currently in its books at ADollars 2.16bn.

FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Restructuring hits profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richemont has reported a 45 per cent decline in net earnings, to Pounds 115m
(Dollars 177.1m), for the year ended March, mainly because of Pounds 87.1m
in net restructuring charges, writes Ian Rodger.
Pre-tax profit, excluding the restructuring charges, was up 4.3 per cent to
Pounds 660.3m. Both the tobacco and luxury goods divisions showed improved
operating profits, in spite of what the group describes as difficult
markets.
Mr Johann Rupert made no comment on the outlook. However, the directors are
recommending a 4.5 per cent rise in dividends, to Pounds 6.15 per unit of
shares and participation certificates.
Mr Rupert said the group aimed to maintain a steady growth in dividends,
above the rate of inflation.
'We look at our cashflows and the condition of our underlying businesses
when we make the decision,' he said.
Although tobacco sales volume was down 8 per cent, sales value rose 3 per
cent to Pounds 2.49bn, thanks to currency effects. Tobacco operating profit
was up 3.3 per cent at Pounds 424.2m.
Jewellery, pen and leather goods sales improved, but watch sales were flat.
Among associates, contributions from the US catalogue shopping business
soared 69 per cent, to Pounds 11m. However, losses on the FilmNet satellite
broadcasting service deepened to Pounds 25.7m from Pounds 7.3m. Mr Rupert
recalled that three years ago he predicted a five-year turnround for this
business.
Of the restructuring charges, some Pounds 75.1m came from costs and capital
gains taxes arising from various changes in shareholdings of the tobacco and
luxury goods interests last summer.
A further Pounds 123.8m in tobacco production rationalisation costs were
announced by Rothmans last week.
The portion of the restructuring costs attributable to Richemont was Pounds
87.1m.

FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Richemont to pay Dollars 180m
for Italian pay-TV holding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Richemont, the Swiss industrial holding company controlled by the South
African Rupert family, is paying Dollars 180m for 25 per cent of Telepiu,
the Italian pay television operator.
The vendor is Compagnie Internationale de Telecommunications.
The acquisition will transform Richemont into a substantial force in
European pay television. It already holds a 46.5 per cent stake in FilmNet,
which broadcasts four pay-TV channels in Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia.
FilmNet has more than 700,000 subscribers.
Telepiu broadcasts throughout Italy two scrambled pay-TV channels featuring
movies and sports events, and one unscrambled channel featuring mainly
documentary and cultural programmes. It has 550,000 subscribers.
Richemont's main existing holdings are controlling stakes in the Rothmans
International tobacco group and the Vendome luxury goods group, built around
the Cartier and Dunhill businesses.
Mr Johann Rupert, managing director, has been attempting to diversify
Richemont's interests, and invested in the lossmaking FilmNet three years
ago together with a South African broadcasting group.
They have overhauled its programming, but losses still rose sharply in the
year ended March, with Richemont's share of the deficit jumping from Pounds
7.3m to Pounds 25.7m (Dollars 35.6m).
Mr Rupert said there was no need for a similar overhaul at Telepiu. However,
he indicated it would take some time to build up the subscription list to a
sufficient level. 'It seems to be endemic in this business - it takes a long
time,' he said.

<TEXT>
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications group with a
stock market capitalisation of Dollars 137bn, plans to list its shares on
the New York and London stock exchanges later this year.
The move comes at a time of increasing interest in Japanese shares among
European and US investors. Although it has no immediate fund-raising plans,
NTT said the move would provide better corporate information and boost
fundraising capabilities in overseas financial markets.
The barriers to foreign investment in NTT, which was privatised in 1985,
were lifted in 1992. Foreign ownership totals 1.3 per cent of the group's
15.6m outstanding shares.
NTT's listing will be the first by a Japanese company in London since Kobe
Steel in September 1992. SG Warburg, NTT's sponsor for the listing, said the
number of Japanese comp-anies indicating interest in similar moves was
increasing.
So far, 29 Japanese companies are listed on the London exchange. However,
the sharp fall in corporate earnings during the past few years has slowed
the trend.
NTT, in which the Japanese Ministry of Finance has a 66 per cent
shareholding, said it would apply for a listing to the NYSE this month and
to the LSE in October.
Tokyo investors welcomed the move. NTT shares rose Y6,000 to Y881,000
yesterday on hopes of an increased investor base for the company.

FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Consortium raises offer for
Austrian bank stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of Austrian, German and Italian investors has raised its bid -
to Sch7.3bn (Dollars 655.9m) - for just under half the Austrian government's
70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt.
The consortium is competing with CS Holding, the Swiss financial group built
around Credit Suisse, to buy an influential minority stake in Austria's
second-largest bank.
Mr Dietrich Karner, chief executive of Austrian insurance group EA Generali
and spokesman for the consortium, presented the revised offer - for 34.05
per cent of the Creditanstalt ordinary shares - at a meeting yesterday with
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister.
Terms of the CS Holding offer have not been published.
After the meeting, Mr Karner said reports that the consortium's bid was
conditional on the government agreeing to a secondary offering of its
remaining shares as soon as market conditions permitted were based on a
misunderstanding.
Earlier this week, Mr Lacina described that condition as 'absurd and
immoral'.
Until now, Mr Lacina has made clear his preference for the CS bid, seeing
the Swiss group as a partner with more to offer. CS has argued it could
bring considerable international market and management knowhow to
Creditanstalt.
The consortium is led by Generali, First Austrian Bank, Commerzbank of
Germany and Banca Commerciali Italiana (BCI).

placing
</HEADLINE>

   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coal Investments, formerly Geevor, is raising Pounds 7.9m from a placement
to fund the reopening of two former British Coal mines and a joint venture
investment with RTZ Corporation.
The company, which was the subject of a management buy-in led by Mr Malcolm
Edwards, British Coal commercial director until last October, is issuing
11.67m new shares at 68p only 3 months after it completed an Pounds 8m
rights issue.
However, the latest acquisitions help achieve the stated intention of
licensing of selected former British Coal mines and setting up other
coal-related operations.
It has taken a 15 year lease on the Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire,
under which it will pay British Coal royalties on sales and additional half
yearly payments to cover surface rental.
In addition, it is paying Pounds 2.8m for a 48.4 per cent stake in the
Inter-Continental Fuels group, which controls Inter-Continental Fuels and
International Mining Consultants. RTZ will be an equal partner.
The companies are involved in coal trading and coal mining consultancy. Mr
Edwards said Coal Investments was considering tendering for some of the
regional mining packages to be offered through the British Coal
privatisation.
The company also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 138,000)
for the year to March, on turnover of Pounds 24,000.

A recovery in its US business helped Fitch, the design services group, cut
losses from Pounds 3.98m to Pounds 3.18m pre-tax in the 1993 year despite
continuing problems in the UK.
At the operating level there was a Pounds 294,000 loss, against Pounds 3.08m
after Pounds 2.43m exceptionals. There was an operating profit of Pounds
790,000 in the US but a Pounds 1.08m loss in the UK.
The pre-tax figure was after a provision of Pounds 2.41m against an expected
loss on the sale of its central London property.
Turnover fell 25 per cent to Pounds 12m (Pounds 15.9m) with a 9.6 per cent
decrease on continuing operations. Losses per share came out at 9.6p
(31.9p).

Donelon Tyson, the construction and civil engineering group, fell into the
red during 1993 and, as intimated in a statement in May, passed its
dividend.
The results, delayed from May following slow settlement of Pounds 3.5m of
contract claims, showed turnover of Pounds 72m (Pounds 66.9m restated) and
losses before tax of Pounds 2.57m, against profits of Pounds 345,000.
While the construction operations remained in the black, operating losses in
the joinery side widened to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 500,000); a rationalisation
programme has involved the loss of some 70 jobs. There were also operating
losses of Pounds 500,000 on the rundown of the industrial insulation
business.
Losses per share were 3.2p (earnings of 0.8p).

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mishaps, bad luck and gaffes - Enterprise
Oil's failed bid for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, must be
wondering whether he should have consulted an astrologer as well as his
merchant bank advisers, SG Warburg and Robert Fleming, before launching his
hostile bid against Lasmo, its fellow explorer.
Ten years ago Enterprise planned to celebrate its separation from British
Gas with a July 'independence day' party. But its plans were scuppered when
a hostile RTZ built up a 30 per cent stake.
With hindsight it must seem to have been tempting fate to have the bid
deadline coincide with another 'independence day' party planned for last
night to celebrate the company's first 10 years.
However, the bid was plagued from the beginning by a series of mishaps and
bad luck that caused investors and analysts alike to focus as much attention
upon Enterprise as its target.
The initial announcement was bungled, with a series of leaks robbing
Enterprise of the valuable element of surprise.
It was followed by a gaffe in which Mr Hearne justified the bid by saying
that oil exploration was a big boys game which required critical mass. The
statement was jumped on by critics as a sign of corporate arrogance, if not
personal megalomania.
Last night Mr Hearne said he could not identify a single event or point at
which the bid became sidetracked. But the remarks over company size clearly
stuck in investor's minds. One industry figure has observed that
'unfortunately Graham Hearne has done for the phrase 'critical mass' what
John Major has done for 'back to basics''.
Mr Hearne yesterday put a brave face on the defeat, saying that the company
would 'get on with other opportunities'. These could include the possibility
of other hostile bids.
'When you have a conviction that an acquisition is in the interests of the
company, you should in no sense be deterred by the process.'
He also rejected the charge by Lasmo that in making the bid Enterprise
effectively admitted that it had a dearth of medium-term exploration and
development projects. 'There are quite a few opportunities in the pipeline,'
he said.
Mr Hearne doubted whether the other charges made by Lasmo, including
questions about Enterprise's accounting standards and dividend policy, would
come back to haunt the company. However, most analysts doubt that Enterprise
will be able to go back to business as usual.
Although the failed bid should have little impact on Enterprise's finances,
with fees to advisers amounting to only about Pounds 5m, the company did
spend Pounds 159m on acquiring the stake of almost 10 per cent in Lasmo. Mr
Hearne last night described it as 'an investment, which as with all
investments we will keep under review'. It was already showing a paper loss
last night of about Pounds 30m.
That purchase, however, has called into question how the company could have
misread investor and industry sentiment so badly.
Mr Hearne said the responsibility rested with him and expressed confidence
that the board would continue to support him. He also denied that a
management shake-up was in the offing.
But Enterprise's reputation as not only the biggest, but one of the most
successful, companies in the exploration and production sector has clearly
been tarnished.
Mr Hearne said Enterprise executives and the advisers 'worked in harmony
throughout' the bid. However, there was speculation last night that there
were deep divisions between the various advisers and company executives over
the bid strategy, in particular the share buying scheme launched last
Wednesday.
Analysts last night speculated whether the blame would be laid solely on the
advisers, or whether it would extend to Mr Hearne and Mr Julian West, the
corporate development director who was also closely associated with the
deal.
It would seem likely that the board may review Mr Hearne's dual role as
chairman and chief executive. All Mr Hearne would say last night was 'that
is a matter for the board'.
The bid has also raised questions about whether the company's past success
has left it arrogant. One institution said it was the 'arrogance' of the
Enterprise presentation which caused it to vote against the deal.
Some investors were also struck by the poor performance of the Enterprise
camp. Another institutional shareholder yesterday said that of the two
competing chief executives, 'Graham Hearne appeared much more anxious. Joe
Darby was much more relaxed.'
Relaxation, however, was clearly at the forefront of Mr Hearne's mind last
night, as he prepared to spend an 'evening dancing with the Mrs'.

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat debenture agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, said yesterday it had reached initial
agreement with its debenture stock holders on the financial restructuring
proposals it intended to put to its shareholders.
Queens Moat said that while the debenture stockholders' steering committee
was still awaiting full details of the restructuring, the agreement in
principle was a significant step forward. The debenture stock holders have
rights over a list of Queens Moat hotels.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said the group's next task was to reach
agreement with creditor banks over the restructuring of its Pounds 1.22bn
debt. He said talks with the banks were making 'encouraging progress'.
The debenture stock holders had agreed not to enforce the security on their
stocks until June 30. Although this date had now passed, Queens Moat said it
was sufficiently encouraged by the agreement it had reached to feel that it
did not need to request an extension.
The holders of the two debenture stocks - the 10 per cent First Mortgage
Debenture Stock 2020 and the 12 per cent First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2013
 -first agreed to waive their right to enforce their security last November.
The waiver was extended a second time in April.

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Electricity dips after job
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy provisions for redundancies were behind a dip in profits at Yorkshire
Electricity last year.
But the Leeds-based distributor said that the underlying business was strong
and growing, and raised its dividend by 15 per cent.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 were Pounds 149m, a drop of 4.7 per
cent. The figure included a Pounds 43.5m exceptional for rationalisation
costs through to 1997, by when the company expects to have shed 1,000 jobs
in addition to the 632 lost last year.
There was also a Pounds 17.4m provision for writing off the investment in
Homepower, its joint electrical retailing venture with East Midlands
Electricity which has been in severe difficulty.
Without these exceptionals profits would have amounted to Pounds 210m before
tax, a gain of 21 per cent.
Mr John Tysoe, chairman, said: 'I am fully convinced that we are pursuing a
well balanced strategy which focuses on the efficiency of our core business
and the development of related activities.'
Before exceptionals, the electricity distribution business increased profits
by 13 per cent to Pounds 162m, with units rising 2.1 per cent. On the same
pre-exceptionals basis supply profits rose 84 per cent to Pounds 20.6m.
Pre-exceptional controllable costs fell 5.3 per cent to Pounds 223m as the
restructuring began to bite.
Yorkshire's share of Homepower's losses was Pounds 5m.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said that new plans for the business
were being prepared. 'It needs to be bigger,' he said.
In other sectors, Yorkshire made Pounds 11.4m from power generation and
Pounds 400,000 from its gas business. The company expects to be making a
Pounds 160m investment for a 17 per cent share of Stockholm Energi, the
Swedish utility. Mr Chatwin said that Sweden met the company's criteria of
growth, market liberalisation and stability, and presented opportunities
that were not available in the oversupplied UK market.
Earnings per share dipped 4 per cent to 51.5p. The final dividend is 16.58p,
making a total of 23.48p, covered 3.4 times by earnings excluding
exceptionals.
COMMENT
Yorkshire, once the sector darling, has slipped to become one of its highest
yielding stocks. Analysts were divided yesterday over whether the results
displayed weakness or strength. The exceptionals were large and perhaps
belated, but at least Yorkshire is getting to grips with its costs. The
Swedish venture is unusual and expensive but it could yield useful upside.

warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Betacom, the telephone equipment company, fell by almost 27 per
cent yesterday after the group, whose main shareholder is Amstrad, issued a
profits warning.
Betacom's shares closed 4p lower at 11p after the company said despite
optimism at the interim stage, its new cordless products 'have not made the
expected contribution in the second half of the financial year ended June
30'.
As a result, the company warned that the results for the second half would
be significantly below market expectations.
Betacom said its insistence on high quality had resulted in an interruption
in the production of cordless products and a shortfall in quantities
required to meet customers' orders, and added 'the performance of high
street customers has been below the company's expectations'.
Betacom also revealed that following the consolidation of its activities at
its head office in Enfield, provision has been made to cover the anticipated
loss on disposal of its freehold property in Bristol.
In February, the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 103,000 for the
six months to December 31, on turnover of Pounds 6.91m.
The market was expecting full year pre-tax profits of some Pounds 500,000,
but in the wake of yesterday's announcement, this estimate was cut to about
Pounds 200,000.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, recorded a strong recovery
in profits for the six months to April 30, writes Simon Davies.
However, the continuing impact of recession on its construction division
resulted in 120 lay-offs, at a cost of Pounds 450,000.
Group pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.94m losses), on house
sales up from 652 to 926 and residential operating margins improved from 4
to 9.5 per cent, as the company benefited from the depletion of its more
expensive pre-1991 land bank.
Residential housing, concentrated in the south-east and south-west of
England, contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 1.45m). Losses
in the commercial property division fell to Pounds 477,000 (Pounds 3.9m).
Construction division pre-tax losses rose to Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 255,000).
The bulk of its redundancy costs will be carried in the second half.
The company is declaring its first interim dividend since 1990 with a
payment of 0.6p. Earnings per share amounted to 1.32p (losses of 4.59p).

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic floats with Pounds 61.5m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in VideoLogic were priced at 45p yesterday, valuing the
Hertfordshire-based multimedia company - which is being demerged from its
parent Avesco - at Pounds 61.5m.
This is significantly less than the Pounds 70m to Pounds 84m that had been
expected.
When the flotation plans were announced early last month SG Warburg,
VideoLogic's adviser, had hoped that shares issued by way of a placing and
offer in conjunction with the demerger would be priced at between 55p and
70p.
However, the issue price had to be scaled back because of the turmoil in the
equity market and the reluctance of institutional investors to pay a higher
price during Warburg's book-building.
Avesco's shares closed 10p lower at 59p yesterday.
Under the terms of the demerger, Avesco shareholders will receive one
VideoLogic share for each Avesco share they currently own.
Avesco shareholders were also given a preferential opportunity to
participate in the placing and offer, which was underwritten by Warburg, and
applied for about 23.5m shares - or 49.2 per cent of the 47.8m shares
available.
The remaining shares were yesterday placed with institutional and other
investors.
The placing was designed to raise Pounds 21.5m of new money before expenses
to help fund VideoLogic's future research and development programme.
Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic chairman, and Mr Anthony Maclaren, managing
director, are entitled to a Pounds 1.6m bonus from Avesco on demerger.
They have agreed to invest the bulk of the sum in VideoLogic shares, after
deducting Pounds 250,000 each and making an allowance for tax.
Following the subscription, VideoLogic's chairman and chief executive will
respectively hold a 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent stake in the demerged
company, which will have a total of about 136.7m shares.
Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on July 6.

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Vendome slips 5% to SFr431.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vendome, the Dunhill and Cartier luxury goods group, saw pre-tax profits
slip 5 per cent to SFr431.5m (Pounds 196.1m) in the year to March. In
sterling terms profits were up 3 per cent.
Lord Douro, deputy chairman, said: 'Considering the very difficult economic
conditions around the world the fact that both companies maintained their
positions is a very remarkable achievement.'
Turnover amounted to SFr2.6bn, against SFr2.5bn. These are the first annual
results since the group was created from the merger of the luxury goods
interests of Rothmans, Dunhill and Richemont. It is now 70 per cent owned by
Richemont, a Swiss holding company.
In addition to SFr48.6m of costs directly related to the reconstruction, it
resulted in a number of non-recurring items which affected profits. These
included royalty income which will not recur following the sale of the
Dunhill tobacco trademarks to Rothmans and the unwinding of Dunhill's
currency hedging arrangement.
Excluding all these factors the company said operating profits would have
slipped only 0.6 per cent in Swiss francs against the 5.3 per cent fall
reported. Mr Joe Kanoui, chairman, said the merger of Cartier with Dunhill
had gone well. 'When the merger was announced some Dunhill shareholders were
worried about a possible culture clash. But there has been a smooth
integration of people who are learning from each other's culture.'
Lord Douro, formerly chairman of Dunhill, said it had performed better than
he expected a year ago. He said economic conditions had improved over the
year, particularly in the US and Europe, although the recovery in its
important Japanese market remained 'uncertain'.
'It would be premature to assume any durable recovery in the majority of the
principal markets,' Mr Kanoui said.
Because of a fall in the tax charge, which will remain below the normal 25
per cent level for another year, earnings per unit were 21.9p.
There is a single gross dividend of SFr0.18, which shareholders can receive
as a net UK dividend of 6.94p excluding any associated tax credit.

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SB hit by US collapse of Tagamet sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's top-selling drug, have collapsed in
the US following the expiry of its American patents on May 17.
Preliminary data suggests the anti-ulcer treatment, which generated US sales
for the Anglo-American group of about Dollars 648m (Pounds 426m) last year,
has lost more than half its share of new prescriptions in its class.
Tagamet's share has fallen from about 15 per cent of new prescriptions at
the time of the patent expiry to 6.9 per cent during the week to June 17.
Generic versions using Tagamet's active ingredient cimetidine have already
captured 11.4 per cent of the market.
The launch of generic, non-patented, drugs using cimetidine has also hit
sales of Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug and the world's best-selling
medicine.
Its share of new prescriptions fell from 39.5 per cent the week before the
expiry to 38.7 per cent during the week ending June 17.

FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fuller attacks cross-border trade after
flat showing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the west London-based
brewer, yesterday reiterated his call for the chancellor to reduce excise
duties to combat rapidly-expanding cross-border beer trade.
'Any cut would be passed on to the customer and the Treasury needn't suffer
in the long term.
'Imports equate to 9 per cent of total French brewing production; the
enormous quantity of beer, legal and illegal, coming into our area from
Calais is now equivalent to five breweries of our size starting up in our
trading area during the year,' he said.
Mr Fuller was speaking as the USM-traded group reported a marginal decline
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.26m to Pounds 8.02m, for the 12 months to
April 2, on turnover of Pounds 82.5m (Pounds 81.9m). The outcome, prepared
under FRS 3 and against 53 weeks last time, was struck after losses of
Pounds 306,000 from property sales and masked a slight improvement to a
record Pounds 9.23m at the operating level.
Mr Michael Turner, managing director, described the performance as
'disappointing'. Tenanted trade volume fell 7 per cent while managed houses
showed a 3 per cent dip. Free trade was up 6 per cent, although this growth
reflected large national and wholesale accounts; traditional free trade fell
7 per cent.
'Competition hotted up. The big brewers are offering legendary discounts. We
need more sanity in the free trade,' Mr Turner said.
On a brighter note, exports, which account for 7 per cent of Fuller's own
beer sales, jumped 28 per cent following a buoyant showing in the US and the
opening of markets in Scandinavia.
Capital expenditure amounted to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 9m) but is anticipated
to approach Pounds 12m in the current year. Gearing dropped from 9 per cent
to 6 per cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 22.93p (23.33p) or 24.19p excluding the
exceptional. The final dividend is increased to 5.25p lifting the total to
7.77p.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Handshakes and sambas: Nancy Dunne rides with Ron Brown's
Latin American roadshow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ron Brown's eyelids were drooping. After five days of tireless campaigning
on behalf of US exports to Latin America, the exuberant US Commerce
Secretary was drained of energy.
He was seated on his sixth dais of the day on his six-day business mission,
when he was seen to nod off for a second or two. The trip offered a snapshot
of the US's new, aggressive export-promotion strategy which, under President
Bill Clinton, has become a cornerstone of US foreign policy. It also
provided an opportunity for Mr Brown to raise the profile of his department
and make it more effective.
Mr Brown began Thursday in talks with Argentine President Carlos Menem, who
was pleased that the US had decided not to bring a trade case or threaten
sanctions over Argentina's 'inadequate' patent protection. This was because,
according to US officials in an elegant display of straw-grabbing, of 'the
accelerated effort of the Menem administration' to obtain passage of
measures which would update Argentina's 120-year-old patent laws.
Mr Brown, for his part, was pleased with progress on an agreement between
the US and Argentina to expand US airline services to the capital Buenos
Aires.
The two moved to the president's newly restored reception area, a blinding
white, gold and mirrored room lit by hundreds of naked light-bulbs. It was
here that Mr Menem informed the 22 company chief executive officers on the
trade mission, and senior US administration officials: 'We have given this
trip high value.'
From there, Mr Brown moved to the press room of the president palace, the
Casa Rosada, where the pop song True Love was inexplicably being piped in.
After a meeting with the Argentine foreign minister, Mr Brown proceeded to a
lunch promoting tourism, a round-table on environmental technology, a
keynote address to bankers, another press briefing and a meeting with
American and Argentine students.
'This is a marathon, an endurance test,' he shouted to his aides as they
slowly mounted the steps of their aircraft on the way to the next stop,
Santiago. A few minutes later, Mr Brown was meandering around, shaking
hands, an ebullient and imposing figure.
He wanted to make sure his CEOs were happy. They were there because Latin
America is the fastest-growing market for US exports, and they were hoping
to line up joint venture partners and to pitch for government contracts. At
the start of the trip Mr Brown met them one by one in his aircraft
compartment; he later met them as a group to plot strategy throughout the
mission.
For all the trappings of government power, the inter-action between Mr Brown
and the CEOs is what most impressed his hosts. He opens the door to senior
government officials in Latin America and brings the concerns of top
businessmen to the attention of officials. One company chairman said he
would now consider manufacturing in Brazil despite the country's onerous
domestic content regulations. These require foreign investors to make some
of their products locally, rather than simply selling them. 'A trip like
this helps you to refocus on what you're doing,' he said. 'This is still a
relatively closed market.'
The presence of officials from the US Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation, both trade finance bodies, indicated that
the delegation meant to do serious business - and it did. One of its first
actions was the improvement of financing terms for Raytheon corporation's
bid to build a multi-billion-dollar radar system for surveillance of the
Amazon. The other contestant was France's Alcatel/Thomson.
Mr Brown said the Brazilians recognised the 'superiority' of the US
technology, but the French could still win with the generous financing
package they are offering.
Behind all the trappings of power, US officials understand that American
clout was not what it was. Since the Latin Americans began to agree free
trade pacts with each other, 'Argentina is more interested in Brazil as a
market than the US,' a senior US official said. 'They used to sell the
industrialised countries raw materials in exchange for manufactures. Now
they can sell manufactures to each other. They have diversified their trade;
they are less dependent on us.'
Mr Brown had two other tasks: to build momentum for the hemispheric summit
in Miami in early December, the Summit of the Americas, at which the US
might announce its strategy after the completion of the North American Free
Trade Association deal, and to stress a shift towards traditional Democratic
party liberalism in US policy, which he did most starkly in a speech to
Argentine bankers. One consequence of the latter is that the Inter-American
Development Bank is raising the amount of funding it allocates to social
programmes to 40 per cent of total disbursements. On Thursday, the bank
announced a Dollars 170m loan to Argentina to train 200,000 workers in the
private sector.
The economic resurgence now under way in Latin America is, however,
threatened by social and economic inequities. 'Economic growth is not enough
if the fruits continue to go to only the top 5 per cent of society,' Mr
Brown told the Argentine bankers. The message was clear: if the benefits of
liberalisation do not trickle down, the US fears for the stability of the
new democracies in Latin America.
His reception was warm. If the trip's co-ordinators made one mistake it was
to schedule the trade offensive during the World Cup competition. However,
in Buenos Aires, when Maradona was eliminated in disgrace from the
competition, Argentina's national tragedy passed without mention. It seemed
to be business as usual for President Menem and pre-game traffic congestion
was as heavy as ever.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Special tax rate would allow low paid
to receive benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R A LEDINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Work and Benefits' (June 27) states that 'the benefits
system needs to be radically shaken up to support people through partial
employment and low paid work as well as during unemployment'.
It is difficult to see the slightest possibility of change from the current
process of shaking down the benefit system. The only potentially helpful
change that is offered by any political party is fuzzy commitment to a
meagre element of universality, and anything more adventurous would attract
widespread derision.
It may be more sensible to leave the benefit system doing the job for which
it is now designed, that of alleviating the most dire misery, and to
concentrate attention on direct taxation, real and nominal.
It may be possible to support people through partial employment and low paid
work by allowing them to pay, say, 50 per cent tax on any income earned, in
return for that income being ignored for benefit purposes.
Such taxation is easy to administer, directly addresses the problem by
providing marginal labour market forces and, above all, is politically
acceptable.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Religion: converging and diverging
with science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICOLAS WALTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Denis Alexander's reply (Letters, June 25/26) to Professor John
Postgate's article ('Religion: are we better off without it?', June 18/19)
seems odd to an outsider. While observation shows that people may be both
scientific and religious, logic suggests that religion and science
themselves have little in common. They work in different ways; both make
claims, but religious dogma can be neither verified nor falsified, whereas
science is based on the verification and falsification of its hypotheses.
They have different patterns; they both change, but religious creeds tend to
diverge, whereas scientific paradigms tend to converge. They have different
results; both offer answers to difficult questions, but religious doctrines
explain nothing, while scientific research has explained more problems than
anything else.
It is true that religion and science are similar in some ways. Religious
people and scientists, like clever people and artists, tend to make
exaggerated claims about themselves. In fact no such group seems to behave
better (or worse) than any other, and the only distinction may be that
religious (and political) fanatics demand and justify atrocities, whereas
scientists and technicians do the dirty work.
But the fact remains that the religious method leads to myth and muddle
whereas the scientific method leads to knowledge and understanding. Religion
once claimed superiority over science, but was defeated in an open contest.
It now claims equality with science, but it will be defeated again.
Theology is no more a science than astrology or scientology. And continuing
attempts to import theism into popular science have more to do with fashion
and marketing than with serious science. In the end religion will be judged
by science and science will be judged by ethics.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Ruthless killers or paper tigers: Tony Jackson says the sums
don't add up in the UK's newspaper price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are lively times for the UK newspaper industry. Mr Conrad Black's
Daily Telegraph slashes its cover price to 30p to match Mr Rupert Murdoch's
cut-price Times. The Times responds with a yet more suicidal cut to 20p. The
Telegraph's stockbroker, the immensely respectable Cazenove, resigns in
apparent protest at Mr Black's share dealings. For the public at large, this
is pure entertainment. Investors, by contrast, are bound to ask themselves
what the blazes is going on.
Two chief theories have emerged on what the press moguls are up to. The
first might be termed the end-game thesis. This argues that the UK newspaper
market is in terminal decline, and that Mr Murdoch and Mr Black are out to
drive weaker competitors to the wall and carve up what is left of the market
between them.
The second we might call the football thesis. This says that newspapers,
like football clubs, attract the kind of owners who are driven by
self-aggrandisement rather than profit. Newspapers have been
uncharacteristically profitable for the past seven or eight years, as a
result of the breaking of the print unions. Now the owners have come up with
a splendid wheeze for throwing that profit away, and the result is business
as usual.
The choice, in other words, is between conspiracy and cock-up. Let us take
conspiracy first. The newspaper, we are told, has had its day. The habit of
reading is dying out, especially among the young. The break-up of the family
means each copy of a newspaper is read by fewer people. The imminent arrival
of electronic media means newsprint is about to be rendered as obsolete as
the wax tablet.
So far as the quality press is concerned, none of this squares with the
facts. There is evidence that the UK tabloid press may be in decline: but
the combined circulation of broadsheet national dailies has been rock steady
for the past 20 years, varying only with the economic cycle. There was a
brief upward blip with the arrival of the Independent in 1986. The market
has now settled back to 2.2m copies a day, bang in line with the 20-year
average.
As for readership, the surprising fact is that the average for the quality
dailies has actually risen over the past decade from 3.1 readers per copy to
3.3. Once more, the trend in the tabloid press has been the other way. The
reasons are a matter for debate: the net effect, though, is that quality
press readership has actually risen by some 12 per cent over the period.
This leaves us with the promised advent of electronic media, a phenomenon of
undeniable significance and uncertain date. Its practical impact on the
market has so far been almost zero. The economic characteristics of
electronic newspapers are unclear, as is their relationship with
conventional media. If Messrs Black and Murdoch are basing their price cuts
on such a hazy prospect, they are gamblers indeed.
In fact, Mr Murdoch's motive in first slashing the price of The Times from
45p to 30p last September may have been rather more prosaic. During the
1980s, the quality press in Britain fared better than the tabloids in
circulation. The qualities also pushed their cover prices up much more
aggressively, so that between 1982 and 1991 their share of national daily
press circulation revenue shot up from 19 per cent to 27 per cent.
With the arrival of the cost-conscious 1990s, this became a dangerously
exposed position. It was also one being experienced by other owners of
branded consumer goods around the world. The most celebrated instance was
Marlboro, America's favourite cigarette, which had become much more
expensive than its cut-price competitors. In April last year, Marlboro's
owner Philip Morris shocked the market by slashing the US price by 20 per
cent. The Philip Morris board which made that decision included Mr Murdoch.
The Times price cut in September was even more aggressive than Marlboro's,
amounting to some 30 per cent over a six-day week. Nevertheless, it was not
without commercial logic. Within six months The Times's circulation had shot
up from about 360,000 to 515,000. Simple arithmetic suggests that
circulation revenue on an annualised basis thus stayed almost unchanged.
At the same time, higher sales should have allowed The Times to charge more
for its advertising space. This is important, since the average broadsheet
gets about twice as much revenue from advertisements as from circulation.
What this has actually been worth for The Times is a matter of guesswork. It
has not raised its official advertisement rates, and the rate cards of most
newspapers are in any case a polite fiction. In the last quarter of 1993,
according to one industry estimate, the qualities as a class were
discounting their advertising space by about 40 per cent.
The net effect of all this on the Times's profits is hard to gauge,
especially since the rise in circulation will have meant a corresponding
rise in newsprint and other production costs. Nevertheless, it can be argued
that until last week Mr Murdoch's strategy was defensible in commercial
terms.
Then came Mr Black's intervention, and the game changed overnight. This is
where the cock-up theory comes in. The Telegraph's cut in its weekly
newspaper bill very nearly matched that of The Times, at 29 per cent. At
that point, however, the sums part company.
The Telegraph's circulation is roughly twice that of The Times. It does not
follow that the Telegraph can therefore lure away twice as many floating
readers. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Telegraph's initiative
is as successful as was The Times's. This means a rise of 155,000 copies, or
15 per cent of the Telegraph's circulation. Put that together with a 29 per
cent drop in price, and a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that
circulation revenue falls 18 per cent.
Mr Murdoch's immediate reaction, to cut the price of The Times by a further
third, means his sums go out of the window as well. But as he will doubtless
have calculated, his hand is stronger than Mr Black's in two respects.
First, Mr Murdoch's global empire is a good deal bigger than Mr Black's, and
his pockets are deeper. Second, the profits or losses of The Times are
buried in Mr Murdoch's group accounts. The paper is believed to have lost
money for years, but there is no knowing for sure.
The accounts of The Telegraph plc, by contrast, are transparent. Every time
Mr Black cuts his price, any investor with a pocket calculator can make a
fair stab at what it means for group profits and dividends. Since last
week's cut, the value of the company has fallen by about a third, or Pounds
250m. At this rate, Mr Black's shareholders will become restive long before
Mr Murdoch's do.
Meanwhile, both papers will be looking for cost savings as a means of
containing the damage. It is not clear where they will find them. The big
savings in production were made in the late 1980s. Cutting editorial staff
during a circulation war would risk defeating the object. Attempts will
doubtless be made to squeeze the margins of the newsagents, but the
newsagents can take care of themselves. Meanwhile, the cost of newsprint is
moving up in its usual cyclical fashion: and since the last upswing in the
cycle, both papers have added to their newsprint bills by increasing their
pagination.
The alternative is to push up circulation still further. Executives at The
Times are talking of raising their circulation to 700,000. If they succeed -
and it is a big if - they may once again have recouped lost revenue. Even
so, the paper will scarcely be breaking even. If it is ever to make a decent
commercial return, its price must eventually be pushed back up again.
The crucial question for the industry is whether this will prove possible.
The argument about the stability of broadsheet circulation, after all, cuts
both ways. In the long run, extra copies won by The Times and the Telegraph
can come only from their rivals. The more numerous these copies, the more it
appears that the UK public is becoming promiscuous in its reading habits;
and that newspapers, like other branded goods in the 1990s, are moving
towards the status of commodities, sold chiefly on price.
In commercial terms, therefore, Mr Murdoch and Mr Black are playing a
dangerous game. How fortunate, one might conclude, that like football
bosses, they are not just in it for the money.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Sponsorship helps all souls: UK universities are keen to
adopt the names of commercial benefactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Oxford dons this week to approve 'Kellogg College' as a new
name for Rewley House, which teaches mature and part-time students at the
university, will have had some of their more reactionary colleagues
spluttering over their cornflakes.
To some observers it appeared to signal a sudden move by universities
towards selling their souls, or at least their names, to vulgar commercial
interests.
On the same day Manchester College, affiliated to Oxford University but not
with full collegiate status, voted to rename itself in honour of its
benefactor Sir Philip Harris, former chairman of carpet company Harris
Queensway.
'It might have been alright if they had just renamed a quad or a building -
but did they have to rename the whole college,' asks one member of the
college's governing body.
Other education institutions have been more conservative: De Montfort
university, formerly Leicester Polytechnic chose a local figure who had died
700 years before, when it changed its name two years ago.
But those who object that the commercialisation of academic institutions is
an anathema to the ethos of a university education are on weak ground.
Naming a college after a generous benefactor with an industrial background
is hardly novel. This century, Oxford has seen the foundation of colleges
named after motor industry millionaire Lord William Richard Morris Nuffield
and Lord Wolfson, whose wealth came from the mail order business. A
Cambridge college is also named after Wolfson while Robinson college is
named after the television rental millionare.
If anything, the practice of paying tribute to donors in college names is
becoming more common - two years ago Liverpool Polytechnic changed to
Liverpool John Moores university in honour of the Littlewoods pools
millionaire.
The wooing of industrialists is a trend the government is encouraging for an
obvious reason: the number of students in UK higher education has doubled in
the past five years, intensifying pressure on the government's education
budget. Any help from wealthy individuals to top up state funding would seem
welcome.
Nor is it necessarily fair to argue that Kellogg and Harris, as well-known
consumer brand names, are unsuitable for Oxford colleges. Kellogg College is
naming itself after the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, a charitable body which is
independent of the breakfast cereal company, although it shares the same
founder. It has given the college about Pounds 9m in the past few years.
Objections to the Harris name came from those at the college who were
anxious to preserve Manchester's roots in the Unitarian church, members of
which founded the college in 1889. Some felt that a college's name was not
an accolade to be bestowed lightly; in the UK and the US, universities have,
literally, set in stone names such as John Harvard and Elihu Yale which
might otherwise have been ephemeral. The question was whether Harris
deserved a similar memorial.
To the college authorities, however, Sir Philip's donation of about Pounds
3.5m offered an opportunity to ensure Manchester's standards meet the
university's requirements for full collegiate status. Moreover a link with
the past will be preserved - the full title of the college will be Harris
College &amp; Manchester Academy.
Far from being embarrassed by help from commerce, universities are exploring
fresh ways of attracting still more money. One example is professorships.
Oxford already boasts a chair in Media Studies endowed in the name of Mr
Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, since 1900, science professorships at the
University of Nottingham have been named after the Boot family, which
founded the chemist chain in the town. More recently the insurance company
Norwich Union has endowed a professorship of insurance studies at the
university.
The benefit to Nottingham University is tangible: in the 1992-93 academic
year it attracted more funding from industry for research than any other UK
university.
Figures from the government's Universities Statistical Record show that
industry funds about 10 per cent of research at UK universities. As the pool
of available funds has risen, ambitious provincial universities are
competing hard to win money for their research work, a phenomenon which they
believe can only benefit UK industry. Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, of
Warwick University, told a conference of educationalists in Paris yesterday:
'Universities and companies can work together without compromising academic
excellence . . . If you do that then you will be a part of their corporate
plan.'
Nottingham last year overtook Imperial College, London, as the highest
earner from industry. Cambridge and Oxford were in third and fourth place
respectively.
The competition among universities for industrial research contracts has
been encouraged by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the
organisation charged with allocating government research funding to
university departments.
Last month the council announced a change in the way it measures the quality
of universities' research programmes for the purpose of deciding future
funding. Instead of looking only at pure academic research and counting the
number of academic publications a department has produced, it will now take
equal account of research commisioned by industry.
That should give an extra incentive to universities to attract commercial
sponsorship - a prize for which replacing the nameboard over the porters'
lodge may seem a small inconvenience.

   From Mr PETER BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent Giles MacDonogh (Food &amp; Drink, June 25/26) rightly
warns of the perils of crossing the Atlantic to arrive in time for
pre-prandial martinis. He does not, however, define the real vintage
American Martini. The ingredients for this, as practised by an old friend of
mine from California, are:
Bottle Extra Dry Martini, corked not screw-topped;
Beefeater 47 per cent gin;
Lemon peel;
Large 'V' glass.
Keep above in refrigerator.
To make, remove ingredients from refrigerator. Add two blocks of white ice
to glass and pour over gin to top of glass. Add twist of lemon rind. Briefly
invert Martini bottle to wet cork. Remove cork and pass over glass. Replace
cork.
Serve.
This makes a truly dry Martini. I have enjoyed many over the last 25 years
and I swear that my friend is still using the same bottle of Martini.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary ('Gummer moots council
housing change', June 30), leaves me with deep concerns over the future for
homeless people. His statement that local authorities should not
automatically provide accommodation for homeless people leaves little hope
for the 135,000 households officially accepted as homeless last year, nor
for the 8,000-plus people who sleep rough every night, the 5,000 families in
bed and breakfast accommodation, or the 38,800 families in other temporary
accommodation.
With the government's green paper on homelessness generating controversial
debate, I await uneasily the white paper later this year.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities create burden on
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N G PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We have seen adverse reactions, in your columns and elsewhere, to the
proposal in the government's white paper that guaranteed minimum pensions
for contracting out of the state earnings related pension scheme should be
abolished. Some scheme members will, it is stated, be worse off. This may be
true, though this depends on a number of factors, not least the definition
of the minimum 'requisite benefits' which a pension scheme must provide
before it can contract out. As yet these benefits have not been defined.
The critical comments, however, seem to smack of all that is worst in
pensions planning, namely the view that nothing should be changed unless no
one can possibly be worse off. This simply fuels the inexorable rise in
administrative complications - among which contracting-out rules have always
ranked highly - and, ultimately, may result in employers withdrawing from
pension provision altogether.
Simplification in pensions legislation must be to everyone's benefit and we
should applaud the government's intention to eliminate unnecessary and
debilitating complications in this area, though I would urge them to go
further. There is much scope for social security legislation to be cut back
without in any way weakening the position of members. Practitioners and
administrators would be even more pleased if this spread to the Inland
Revenue, whose rules on benefit limits, etc, make the complex
contracting-out rules look like child's play]

FT  02 JUL 94 / The defence case for the crown: Prince Charles took his
message to his future subjects - but has it fallen on sympathetic ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Charles has just found safe haven aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia,
anchored, possibly for the last time, in the Pool of London. It is 100 years
since his great-great-grandfather opened Tower Bridge and the present heir
to the throne has returned from the anniversary celebrations. 'At least I
didn't fall in', he chuckles, acknowledging the potential for more,
extraordinary headlines.
The news media have already given saturation coverage to the previous
night's television documentary in which, before an audience of 13m, he
confessed his adultery, mused on the links between church and crown and
conformed to his own caricature as a thoughtful man trapped by destiny but
compelled to prove his worth.
If the avalanche of publicity and 'expert' opinion had rattled him, the
prince who remains calm under fire (witness the little contretemps with a
pistol-waving student in Sydney's Tumbalong Park) was showing no signs of it
aboard the yacht whose fate at least has been decreed.
Any Lord of the Isles who can prang his 'whisper' jet into a Scottish peat
bog as he did this week, adjust his cufflinks and stick to his schedule is
not going to be shot down by a press he says is hooked on 'prurient
speculation'.
On Britannia, where he urges his guests to 'make the best of it', he is
relaxed, smiles through a healthy tan and shows no hint of what a supportive
Bishop of Durham was this week moved to describe as a 'sinful and struggling
man'.
Immediately ahead of Charles lies a low-key weekend in Wales - today he
visits a Rhondda rugby club - to celebrate 25 years as Prince of Wales. He
knew the anniversary would trigger renewed questioning about his suitability
to be the next king and, in a risky move, decided to present his own case on
film. He has no regrets about the final product and knows that, for the most
part, it will merely endorse the views of those who oppose or support him.
The prince hopes that when the brouhaha over his infidelity has died down,
people will be left with a rounded impression of a man doing his best for
'jolly old Britain' in a job he would not have chosen but which he must
ensure changes with the times.
But while the documentary, with its exhaustive, intimate exposure of a man
who loves every tree and stone but who imagines each one conceals a
tele-photo lens, may have been designed as a definitive response to the
critics, it has inevitably raised as many questions as it has answered.
If the exercise was regarded as an important step in the campaign to restore
his badly-damaged public image and reinforce his claim to be crowned King
Charles III, did it help or hinder him?.
His readiness to be grilled on the most intimate and painful aspects of his
life, like some disgraced Hollywood giant seeking renewed adulation through
abject confession, at once renewed the controversy over whether the British
monarchy's best chance of survival lies in retaining some mystique or in
riding bicycles in St James's Park.
Prince Charles' view is self-evident from his decision to make the
programme. 'Who are all these people who speak for me?', he despaired on
camera. The best response, he decided, was to do his own talking. 'There is
no sense it has backfired. He's said what he wanted to say and he won't be
doing it again', an aide volunteered.
Many would welcome a long silence. 'I'm for a little bit more mystery
surrounding the royal family', says Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the
Institute of Directors. 'I think is it extraordinary that we know much more
about Prince Charles than we do about Margaret Thatcher.'
'Ridiculous decision', claims a senior Tory peer: 'The publicity surrounding
the family's problems was all dying down anyhow and he has re-ignited it. He
said himself we have no right to know everything and he should never have
been exposed in that way.'
His Lordship may be out of touch. Early polls suggest that the prince's
decision to bare all has gone down quite well with the general public, which
is still in favour of a monarchy and which does not appear unduly worried
about having an adulterer on the throne. The Daily Mirror's front-page
banner headline - 'Poll Exclusive - Not Fit to Reign' - omitted to mention
that though one-third of its readership believed Charles should be denied
the crown, two-thirds said he should be king.
His personal performance has won support even among some republicans: 'If we
must have a monarch, then I suppose there is nothing wrong with a rather
curious, inquiring screwball doing the job. If we have to have one, then
let's have him', says Prof Richard Hoggart, the author and historian who
believes monarchy perpetrates patronage, sentimentality and contempt. He
adds: 'It is all based on the idea that you must give the little people
something to wave at. But I accept that the great bulk of the public still
want to press on with a monarchy.'
Prof Hoggart, who refuses invitations to Buckingham Palace, thinks Charles
has managed to project himself as a 'dignified, well-intentioned human being
who is not an intellectual but has a lively, intelligent mind'.
Helena Kennedy, QC, chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and an advocate
of constitutional change, agrees with Prof Hoggart that the British public
is not unduly perturbed by the fact that the prince's marriage has broken up
and that he has been unfaithful.
'People increasingly see the royal family as just another family, with all
the usual failings and frailties. Charles, at least, is much more in touch
with the real world than some of his relations. If this was a relaunch, I
think it has been successful'.
The prince's television performance did not dispel the idea that Charles
still inhabits a world alien to most people. Perhaps it is not unreasonable
that when the Colonel in Chief of eight regiments sits down to dinner at
home with a few old chums they should be clad in enough gold braid to sink
Britannia but it hardly carries the common touch. His use of 'boiling' as an
expletive reeked more of Bertie Wooster than Brookside.
However he may be singing a more popular tune in thinking out loud on the
future relationship between church and state, and the possibility of
widening the remit of monarch to become defender of all faiths. Senior
palace aides insist he is not advocating disestablishment of the Anglican
church.
According to Ms Kennedy: 'He is clearly struggling with things spiritual and
temporal in a way which many people will understand.'
The Anglican church has mostly been cautious in responding both to the
prince's disclosures over his personal behaviour and his thoughts on the
future role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.
Lord Coggan, former archbishop of Canterbury, is not alone in pointing out
that Charles would not be the first royal to sin and still ascend to the
throne.
But regular critics of the royal family such as Rev Tony Higton, a member of
the Church of England's ruling synod, is more convinced than ever that
Charles is not up to the job. He believes the prince's views on defending
the faith of Catholics, Hindus and Zoroastrians alike will be profoundly
disturbing to many: 'He is a New Ager rather than a Christian and he is
unprepared to be Defender of the Faith,' says Higton.
The IoD's Peter Morgan adds: 'It is one thing to be clearly identified with
your own faith and to open up to others but quite another if you are not
going to be identified, first and foremost, with your own church. The prince
speaks warmly of Islam but can we really expect King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to
become leader of all the faiths in his country?'
In the view of people such as Mr Anthony Barnett, co-ordinator of Charter
88, the group seeking constitutional reform, the prince's anguished
deliberations form a sideshow to the real agenda for change in Britain.
'Charles' objective is to try to resolve the crisis of the monarchy by
attempting to say I love this country, I can't understand why its going
wrong and I'm trying to do what I can to make it better.
'The real problem is not the prince's behaviour. The crisis is not just
institutional but also lies in our failure to maintain consistent, economic
development. The monarchy used to be the authentic representative of a very
successful political, social and economic order. All that has gone. Now it
is the symbol of a rotten, decayed constitutional order.'
Mr Barnett paints Prince Charles as a man now almost entirely isolated from
any of the surviving institutions: 'He is so alone. There is no real
aristocracy, an ineffective church, the army is a poor imitation of what it
once was. They have all dropped away, leaving the monarchy increasingly
adrift.'
Charles himself invariably portrays himself, still more so since his split
with Princess Diana, as a man struggling alone - despite his staff of 62 -
to carry the burden imposed by destiny; the reality is that he remains,
possibly for many years to come, only the deputy. In the meantime, he will
continue his duties for what he so tellingly calls 'the organisation' into
which he was born. He rejects any suggestions that he is somehow trying to
re-define his role but acknowledges the need to make subtle shifts which
will help make him a thoroughly modern monarch. Few people criticise the
prince's involvement in and encouragement for the range of organisations
aimed at extending opportunity to those needing a helping hand. Even fewer
will criticise the unique ability of someone, by virtue of their
extraordinary position, to bang together ministerial heads and painlessly
extract more cash out of a parsimonious government.
He is ready for more 'ghastly' command performances but he also desperately
wants people to realise there is a substance and sense of deep obligation
underpinning his life.
'I am not', says the Prince of Wales, 'very good at being a performing
monkey'. The years ahead will decide whether his subjects-to-be will
ultimately permit him any other role.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Sizing up the global pot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardly a week has passed since February without the gilt market succumbing
to yet another bout of inflationary angst. And hardly a week has passed
since then without the emergence of some encouragingly benign piece of news
about the trend of underlying inflation. With long gilts delivering an
income of nearly nine per cent and the Treasury's latest forecast for
inflation revised down to a mere 2 1/2 per cent, the angst takes some
explaining. How can gilt yields remain so high in the absence of more
obvious inflationary pressure?
One of the more fashionable explanations is that high real bond yields stem
from a global capital shortage. That is to say, a combination of growing
demand for capital from emerging markets, from businesses in recovering
economies and from governments with big budget deficits has had to be
financed out of a static or dwindling supply of capital. This, it is argued,
has caused the price of capital - real long term yields - to rise.
Certainly the thesis derives some support from the movement of index-linked
gilts, which have risen by around a full percentage point so far this year.
Also from numerous economic studies, which have established that shifts in
long-run real interest rates are substantially explained by changes in
returns on investment and in debt ratios. Over the long run, moreover, the
argument looks altogether plausible.
Between 1979 and 1992 gross national saving as a percentage of GDP in the
OECD area declined from 23.6 per cent to 19.4 per cent. The fall was driven
by the US, where gross national saving slumped over the period from 21.3 per
cent to 14.5 per cent. Budget deficits, meantime, have been rising
uncomfortably, especially in Europe. In its latest Economic Outlook the OECD
estimates that general government budgets weakened on average by the
equivalent of 3 per cent of GDP in the recent downturn. Between a third and
a half of the deterioration was structural, which implies that the related
increase in public spending will not disappear with economic recovery.
Creditors' ranks
The developed countries have, in fact, been hogging much of the
internationally available capital at a time when the ranks of the creditor
countries have diminished. Not only are the oil producers no longer big
capital exporters; Germany, which ran a current account surplus on its
balance of payments for most of the 1980s, has gone into deficit as a result
of German reunification. Since a surplus has to be matched by capital
outflows and a deficit by capital imports, Germany's about-turn imposes a
strain on the global pool of capital. And it leaves Japan as the world's
last big creditor country.
Yet the US, which has recently become the world's biggest debtor with
outstanding obligations to the rest of the world of well over Dollars 500bn,
has been busy trying to reduce the Japanese current account surplus both
through an aggressive trade policy and neglect of the dollar. The OECD
projects that the Japanese current account surplus will fall from Dollars
131bn in 1993 to Dollars 120bn in 1995, while the US current account deficit
is expected to rise from Dollars 109bn to Dollars 153bn over the same
period.
Adverse impact
Since the level of capital investment tends to be insensitive to interest
rate movements, this decline in both the aggregate level of saving in the
developed world and of internationally available capital at a time of global
recovery could indeed be expected to have a big adverse impact on long-term
real rates. And it takes place just when the developing countries have been
raising their net imports of capital from Dollars 37bn in 1986-90 to nearly
Dollars 160bn last year.
Yet this increase in the demand on the global savings pool still looks an
odd explanation for recent bond market behaviour because it pre-dates the
shakeout. The supply of capital to emerging markets has been heavily
curtailed since February. And the budget deficits of most developed
countries, bar Japan, are expected to shrink over the next two years.
Nor is the developing world's use of capital quite as predictable as might
be expected. Domestic savings there have played a much bigger role in
financing investment than external capital; and the Third World has actually
increased its contribution to global savings from 15 per cent in the 1970s
to a remarkable 25 per cent today. Many countries in the Asian Pacific
region have run persistent trade surpluses over the years. Even the regional
giant China is running a substantial current account surplus if taken in
conjunction with its near neighbours Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Other things being equal, the increasing demand for capital from the more
dynamic economies in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe must have an
impact on the cost of capital. But the capital shortage argument rests
heavily on expectations of shortage rather than current financial reality.
It is an important, but still only partial, explanation for the high real
bond yields in the UK and elsewhere.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Man in the News: A novice in deep water - Tomiichi Murayama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the age of 70, Mr Tomiichi Murayama has just discovered he has a lot to
learn - and fast.
To his own surprise and everyone else's, the former fishing union official
was on Wednesday night chosen as Japan's first Socialist prime minister
since 1947, and its fourth leader in the past year. Rather than celebrating
with his favourite meal, fried marinated horse-mackerel, Mr Murayama will
spend the weekend doing homework.
Today, he will receive the first of many hours of briefings from government
officials on what to say to puzzled world leaders, when he faces them next
weekend in Naples for the Group of Seven summit.
It will not be easy. This formerly obscure back-bench politician has never
held a cabinet job until now, never met the officials who will brief him and
has no experience of international affairs.
He will be out of his depth in Naples. Mr Murayama, who hates pomp, speaks
not a word of any foreign language, according to his secretary. He has
travelled to Europe only three times, to the US never, and to China only
once, 30 years ago.
When Mr Helmut Kohl met Mr Murayama's capable predecessor, Mr Tsutomu Hata,
two months ago, the German chancellor joked he could not keep up with the
names of the high-speed succession of Japanese prime ministers. He may now
feel Japan's political instability is no longer a joking matter.
His bushy eyebrows twitching nervously under television spotlights, Mr
Murayama confessed last week he was unqualified for the job. Most of Japan
agrees with him, evinced by the Social Democratic party's paltry 15.4 per
cent showing in last summer's general election.
Yet on closer examination, Japan's unlikely new leader may not be the
disaster he may seem. He is an eccentric, unrepresentative figurehead, yet
the ship of government has a professional crew.
His administration is dominated by the experienced Liberal Democratic party,
which ran Japan for 38 years, with the SDP in opposition, until last summer.
The LDP decided to put its old foe on top because it needed the votes of Mr
Murayama's Social Democratic Party to oust the previous coalition and make a
comeback after a humiliating year in opposition. The SDP was only too keen
to get back to power, after breaking with the former coalition two months
ago.
Sensibly, Mr Murayama accepted the reality of the deal and wasted no time in
stepping smartly to the right, by handing most of the top jobs in his new
cabinet to the LDP and adopting conservative policies.
Mr Murayama's job, therefore, is to keep the peace between the SDP, half of
which are on the far left, and the LDP until the new government is ready to
face a general election under a new electoral system due to be ready by the
autumn. 'The question is not so much whether he can hold the government
together, but for how long the LDP will hold it together for him,' says Mr
Dan Harada, a political lobbyist.
On past performance, Mr Murayama has a good chance of delivering his part of
the strange LDP-SDP pact. Peacemaking between squabbling left and right
factions in the SDP and arcane parliamentary tactics are two areas where he
has useful experience.
Mr Murayama is a relative beginner as a peacemaker, since he has led his
party for less than a year, since last September. He was chosen then, as
now, as a compromise candidate. But he skilfully guided the SDP into two of
the toughest sacrifices in its life: accepting the end of a ban on rice
imports and agreeing to political reforms that will destroy the influence of
the party's traditional support groups.
As a broker of compromise deals, Mr Murayama's main assets are a lack of
firm policies and a kind, old, gentlemanly image. Mr Murayama's SDP
colleagues call him Ton-chan, or Young Tom, in affectionate reference to his
grandfatherly appearance. Privately, some LDP members admitted yesterday
they liked their new boss.
Despite his sell-out on rice and reform, Mr Murayama is also liked on the
left, where his roots are. The fifth son of a fisherman in Kyushu, southern
Japan, he graduated in political science and economics from a red-brick
university and started work in a union spon-sored by the left wing of the
then Japan Socialist Party.
At 31, Mr Murayama was elected to the council of his home town, Oita, later
rising to the prefectural assembly. His wife, Yoshie, a former wartime
nurse, ran the prefectural dining room until her retirement eight years ago.
In his younger days, Mr Murayama used to do early morning motorbike shopping
runs for Yoshie's restaurant.
Mr Murayama's background in local politics, and perhaps his wife's cooking,
assured him loyal support from the voters of Oita, which have re-elected him
seven times to the lower house of parliament over the past 22 years.
During that time, he became expert at parliamentary tactics, such as the
famous 'ox-walk', in which the opposition used to drag out votes for days by
approaching the ballot box at snail's pace. SDP ox-walkers delayed a bill,
two years ago, to allow Japan to send troops to a United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, the first use of Japanese forces abroad
since the end of the second world war.
Mr Murayama promised to give up ox-walking when the SDP joined the former
coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa last July. But the kind old
gentlemen later showed his tactical horns when he pulled the SDP out of the
next coalition, in April, in protest at a backroom plot to marginalise it
from policy-making. That deprived the government of a majority, starting the
chain of events that brought Mr Murayama to the prime ministership.
The big risk, of course, is that Mr Murayama's prickly and erratic party
might find working with its former enemy, the LDP, just as hard as with the
previous coalition, with the same disastrous results. But the first signs
are encouraging. In his first days in power, Mr Murayama has done his best
to co-operate with the LDP rather than impose his party's will. So far,
there has been not a murmur of dissent from his SDP followers

FT  02 JUL 94 / Expiry of London's Pounds 110m ticket to nowhere: Was
CrossRail a popular scheme scuppered by the planning process, or an idea
whose time was past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Five years of detailed preparations, Pounds 110m of public money and
hundreds of hours of costly campaigning by the business community have come
to nothing.
CrossRail, the Pounds 2bn underground railway line intended to link east and
west London, was struck a mortal blow in May when four MPs on a
quasi-judicial private bill committee voted 3-1 to block a private bill
authorising construction.
This week's confirmation that at least two of the MPs will not change their
minds means that the bill is dead, in spite of a Commons motion signed by
279 MPs urging the committee to reconsider.
Supporters will see the bill's demise as yet another example of the failure
of the planning process to deliver the goods. Its critics will welcome the
failure of a plan which they saw as over-ambitious, over-engineered and
overtaken by the swings of the economic cycle.
CrossRail emerged from a far-reaching review of London's public-transport
requirements carried out in 1989 - the peak of the boom. The project
involved the construction of a six-mile tunnel large enough to take British
Rail trains underneath the capital.
This would have provided a through service between Aylesbury and Reading to
the west of London and Shenfield to the east. The five stations on the new
underground section would have provided links with other underground lines.
Like the RER network linking the centre of Paris with the suburbs, CrossRail
would have provided rapid journey times with fewer stops than the Tube. It
would have avoided the need to change from suburban trains to the Tube and
might have persuaded car-driving commuters to switch to rail.
But the detailed forecasts of passenger demand were overtaken by the
recession. By the time CrossRail came up for scrutiny in parliament the
committee concluded that the extra capacity, thought to be necessary by
2001, would not be needed until 2010.
The prospects of raising enough private-sector finance had also faded with
the decline in the number of passengers. CrossRail's financial advisers
calculated that private money could meet half the costs, but one transport
consultancy estimates it would be no more than 25 per cent.
But why have four MPs been allowed to scupper the project? After all,
supporters say, it has the backing of both Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, and Mr Frank Dobson, his Labour shadow, and it is seen as crucial
by its sponsors, British Rail, London Underground and Railtrack, the
infrastructure company.
The private-bill procedure was used to allow property owners on or near the
route to challenge the need for the line, and to question its economic
viability. The MPs on the committee were legally required to consider the
bill on its merits, and to ignore party-political pressures.
The committee has been criticised for refusing to go along with the wishes
of the government and opposition. But members say that the scheme does not
make economic sense.
Mr John Marek, a Labour member, said that the benefits were estimated at
between 0.7 and 1.5 times the cost. He added: 'If the money was spent almost
anywhere else on the London Underground system - which is in a terrible
state - the ratios would have been 5, 12 or even 20.'
There were two other main objections:
The government refused to say how much it would contribute to the project,
and the committee feared that approval would lead to a long period of blight
along the route. The line was not properly integrated into the capital's
transport network. There was strong evidence that it would largely duplicate
the Central line, which is being upgraded at a cost of Pounds 800m.
Even more seriously, CrossRail had been planned before a final decision was
taken to site the London terminus of the Channel tunnel rail link at St
Pancras, north London, and before the building of the Heathrow Express rail
link from Paddington, west London.
The committee was advised that the only way to force the government to
consider adding interchanges with these two projects, which would add more
than Pounds 100m to the cost, was to block the bill.
Ministers are relaxed about the bill, mainly because they believe that BR
privatisation and the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line will
squeeze the available private capital for transport projects until at least
1998-99.
But they have to decide quickly whether to let the project drop, or promote
it through one of the two alternatives to the private bill procedure.
One is the 1992 Transport and Works Act, under which Mr MacGregor could lay
an order for the project in parliament. But public inquiries could delay
construction for 10 years.
The other is the hybrid-bill procedure, used for projects which affect
private individuals but are also in the national interest. Transport
ministers have started to lobby for parliamentary time for such a bill, but
the department is already committed to one hybrid bill next year for the
Channel tunnel link.
It is unlikely to win parliamentary time for a second, particularly as the
government's business managers know that there would be overwhelming
pressure for government cash to provide links with the Heathrow and Channel
tunnel lines.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Tory leaders stress unity on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to cement the
Conservatives' fragile consensus on Europe by claiming widespread European
backing for a multi-speed union.
In a speech to coincide with the start of Germany's six-month presidency of
the EU he firmly ruled out further transfers of sovereignty to Brussels at
the next intergovernmental conference in 1996.
But Mr Hurd also went out of his way to placate pro-European Tories, uneasy
about Mr John Major's decision to veto the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene
at last week's Corfu summit on the presidency of the commission.
He said arguments about the principle of Britain's EU membership were
'yesterday's debate' and insisted that the veto would lead to 'healthier'
decision-making.
Mr Hurd's comments were echoed by other cabinet ministers in a concerted
government effort to build on the common ground established around the
multi-speed concept.
Mr William Waldegrave, the open-government minister and a pro-European, said
the Conservatives were uniting around the vision of 'a Europe of the
nations, not a Europe to supersede the nations'.
Baroness Thatcher, the former Conservative prime minister, broke a six-month
silence on the European issue, describing Mr Major's handling of the Corfu
summit as 'top class'.
Mr Hurd, addressing the Harborough Conservative Association, rejected Labour
claims that the use of the veto had relegated Britain to the sidelines of
Europe.
He said the government's success in reshaping the European agenda was
evident in Germany's programme for its presidency, which focuses on
deregulation, subsidiarity and enlargement.
He said there was no case for further automatic and inflexible pooling of
sovereignty in Brussels. In a clear rebuff to Continental federalists he
warned that 'rigid' EU structures might face disaster.
He said: 'We must respect the achievements of those who dreamt of a 'United
States of Europe', while being clear that it is the wrong model for the new
Europe.
'When the prime minister and I have talked about a multi-track, multi-speed,
multi-layered Europe, we have clearly struck a chord, and not just in
Britain.'
He added: 'All around Europe, people are rejecting the idea that there is
some detailed blueprint for the future of the union. They do not want to
receive decrees from Brussels. They do not want their sense of nationhood to
be affronted.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / Collection of rare books sells for Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the finest collections of incunabula - books printed before 1500 - to
appear on the market for more than 50 years was broken up at Sotheby's in
London yesterday. The 400 books come from the library at Donaueschingen, the
home of the Furstenberg family, and sold, on target, for Pounds 3.2m. Almost
every lot sold.
Four of the books are inscribed by Count Wolfgang, the founder of the house
and of the court library. Perhaps the rarest offering was a broadside
printed in Vienna in 1461 giving the most suitable days in the year for
medicinal blood-letting. It is the first known example of printing in
Vienna, and sold, just below forecast, for Pounds 221,500.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Railtrack tries to cut out union: Horton wants to tell staff
'real story' / Knapp says move is futile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack yesterday launched a 'hearts and minds' campaign designed to
bypass the RMT rail union and appeal directly to its signalling staff to
accept the company's restructuring deal.
But the company refused to give details of how it intends to compensate
about a quarter of the signalling staff who face a Pounds 100-a-week pay
cut.
Relief signalmen stand to suffer a fall in their gross earnings to Pounds
382.78 a week from Pounds 489.51 after the productivity agreement comes into
force. Staff working night shifts would have smaller cuts in earnings.
Railtrack said those affected would receive lump-sum compensation payments
to ensure no loss was suffered over the next 18 months.
But details of those payments - which could be about Pounds 8,000 - have not
been given to the RMT or the individuals. Mr Bob Horton, the company's
chairman, said yesterday this was a 'non-issue that will work itself out'.
Railtrack said its campaign aimed to tell 'the real story about the package
on offer to every member of staff' and 'expose the misinformation that has
been circulated by the RMT'.
Railtrack added: 'With the real information in their hands staff will
pressurise the RMT to come back to the negotiating table so the package can
be implemented.' Telephone hotlines have been set up and letters sent to all
signal staff.
Mr Horton said: 'I hope our work over the next few days and weeks will
enable signalmen to say to their union: 'Take another look at what is on
offer, come back to the negotiating table and resolve this matter once and
for all'.'
He said signalmen and their families were ringing the company to ask how the
dispute could be ended. He suggested that there had been a 'little trickle
back' to work but refused to say how many signalling staff had defied the
strike calls.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, described Railtrack's campaign as an
'exercise in futility'.
He said: 'They should not be wasting their time trying to sell the
unsaleable to individuals. The signalling staff are very solid in the strike
and they are determined to get a just settlement for the contribution they
have made over the past seven years.'
The union executive will meet on Monday afternoon to decide whether to
increase the action that has severely disrupted rail services for the past
three Wednesdays. A further 24-hour stoppage is set for next Wednesday.
Railtrack said many signalling staff could expect 'substantial' increases in
earnings between now and October 1 through the first two parts of the
three-stage deal, with an additional 2.5 per cent as the annual pay rise.
Once RMT agreed to the whole productivity package further rises would be
triggered. Railtrack estimates that those on early shifts would see an
average rise to Pounds 372.47 from Pounds 306.08 for a 50-hour week and
those on late shifts to Pounds 420.39 from Pounds 380.13 for a 56-hour week.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Post Office competitors set sights on niche markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to limit the Post Office's letters monopoly are set to lead
to a growth in small business-to-business mail operators but are unlikely to
make a significant dent in Royal Mail revenues, companies competing against
Royal Mail said yesterday.
They said that unless the Post Office's monopoly was abolished entirely they
would continue to concentrate on niche sectors, particularly services to
City institutions.
The green paper on the future of the Post Office, published this week,
raised the prospect of shrinking Royal Mail's monopoly, which covers all
mail costing less than Pounds 1 to deliver.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, refused to specify a new
figure, but analysts do not expect it to be below 50p - twice the price of a
first-class stamp.
Mr John Ellis, chief executive of Deltec, a London-based company competing
in the public mail market, said: 'If it comes down to 50p, we might grow
about fourfold - but that still makes us a drop of water in the Royal Mail's
ocean.'
Deltec specialises in international mail, over which the Post Office has no
monopoly.
It focuses on customers requiring collection after the last Royal Mail
collection times and offers overnight delivery from the City to 18 London
postal codes. Mr Ellis said: 'At 50p we would think seriously about offering
a similar overnight service in other UK business centres  - but there is no
chance of our going into the residential market.'
Deltec is one of about 15 companies believed to be offering a public
business mail service. Their combined turnover was a tiny fraction of the
Pounds 4.2bn earned by Royal Mail last year.
Mr Edward Davey, a postal analyst at Omega Partners, a London consultancy,
said: 'Further competition is likely in niche markets, particularly in
business-to-business flows.'
Parcelforce, the Royal Mail's lossmaking parcels delivery subsidiary, is
estimated to have only 30 per cent of the UK parcels market. But the Post
Office is more efficient in the letters market and not open to being
undercut on price.
Mr Mark Haynes, chief executive of City and Financial Express, another
carrier targeting the City market, said: 'The Royal Mail does a marvellous
job. Anyone talking about providing a parallel service is talking rubbish.
We are interested in serving needs that the Royal Mail does not meet.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / Swans to be told of CMN demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union leaders at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which is in
receivership, will on Tuesday put to the yard's remaining employees changes
in their terms and conditions that would be required by the only potential
bidder for the company.
French-based Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie has been negotiating with
receivers Price Waterhouse over the severance pay obligations CMN would have
under existing company agreements if it had to declare redundancies after
taking on the yard.
A deal will be put to a mass meeting in Wallsend of Swan Hunter's 660
remaining workers and the 238 laid off.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team for Swan Hunter, said yesterday
that if workforce agreement were not forthcoming this could affect the price
CMN offered the receiver for Swans and lessen the offer's attractiveness,
relative to piecemeal sale of the company's assets.
It is understood that the compromise proposal involves a possible waiving of
severance entitlements after spring 1995.
Mr Henderson said CMN intended to have a core workforce of about 1,000 at
Swans. But because of the need for a mixture of skills some of those
outfitting the yard's last frigate might not become core workforce members
once that order was finished later this year.
Yesterday Mr Iskandar Safa, whose Paris-based company Soffia bought CMN in
1992, said prospective markets for Swan Hunter, under his ownership, were
the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait in the Gulf, Brunei and Indonesia in
south-east Asia, and South Africa.
Mr Safa said he had received from the Ministry of Defence 'all the verbal
assurances we need' that it would give Swans, under his ownership, the same
level of support in chasing export orders as it gave to any other British
company. He would not go ahead with the Swans deal with a 'handicap on the
political side'.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Dockers lose redundancy case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-six workers sacked from Goole docks on Humberside after industrial
action lost a four-year battle for redundancy money yesterday.
Three Court of Appeal judges dismissed by a majority an appeal aimed at
reinstating the workers' entitlement to compensation from the Limb group,
their former employer.
The 26 were dismissed in April 1990 after an overtime ban in protest at a
new bonus scheme and said that their sackings were a 'set-up' to avoid
paying redundancy.
The company, which had been taken over by the EIC Group, then decided not to
re-engage its own direct labour force.
Lord Justice Dillon, giving yesterday's majority decision, said that the
industrial action in support of the bonus generated both the dismissal and
the decision to use contract labour.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Nadir fails to lift court order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former head of Polly Peck International, has
failed in an attempt to lift the bankruptcy order in place on him in the UK,
Andrew Jack writes.
The High Court yesterday extended the order indefinitely. It could otherwise
have expired after three years.
There has been concern that pressure would be applied to allow the order to
lapse after the initial period.
Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, said that to apply for the
order to be lifted Mr Nadir would have to demonstrate that he had
co-operated with his court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy.
This is unlikely given that Mr Nadir failed to co-operate on a number of
occasions and fled last year to his native northern Cyprus.

The Chesterfield-based company is the UK's largest manufacturer of solid

it larger than some of the regional mining businesses into which British
Coal will be divided for privatisation.
Coal Products has four plants and employs about 550 people. Last year's

British Coal said it had received more than a dozen expressions of interest

FT  02 JUL 94 / Smokers win legal aid action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of smokers who claim they were harmed because five tobacco companies
allegedly failed to warn them of the dangers of smoking yesterday won a
battle in their fight to obtain legal aid.
Mr Justice Popplewell in the High Court quashed a decision by the Northern
Area Legal Aid Committee which refused to give the go-ahead to 28 test-case
actions. These related to 227 claims potentially worth more than Pounds 20m.
The claimants have accused Gallaher, Rothmans, Imperial Tobacco, Philip
Morris and British-American Tobacco of failing to minimise the dangers of
smoking or give adequate warning of the risks.
The judge said there had been a misunderstanding leading to the committee
not hearing argument on behalf of individual applicants and remitted the
matter to be heard by a fresh committee.

published next week, probably on Thursday, as the National Heritage
Department mounts what appears to be an enormous effort to clear the decks
before next month's summer recess, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The BBC white paper is likely to be followed by the equally long-awaited
decision on the future of Channel 5, and possibly by the even more delayed
white paper on the press and privacy, although this is viewed more as a hope
than an expectation.
The attempt to get three important pieces of work out of the department in
the next three weeks is being seen as a further indication that Mr Peter
Brooke, national heritage secretary, is likely to go in the summer
ministerial reshuffle.
Few surprises are expected in the BBC proposals, with the corporation
probably surviving intact as an institution funded by a universal licence
fee. The only uncertainty is over ownership of the BBC transmitter system
but the introduction of an element of private investment is more likely than
outright privatisation.
The Independent Television Commission has been waiting since February to
hear whether the frequencies will be available for Channel 5.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Contest revealed Labour's dark side:  A result that tells us
a lot about the parties in Scotland and the politics of sectarianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's narrow victory in the Monklands East by-election was the party's
first stumble after its recent succession of excellent poll results.
Labour may have powered ahead in the local and European elections and a
string of by-elections. But in Monklands East it came within 1,640 votes of
losing one of its safest Scottish seats - poignantly, one that had been held
by its former leader, John Smith.
The bitter contest revealed the darker side of Labour's municipal politics
in Scotland. It also produced infighting between neighbouring Labour MPs
which, coming just before polling day, could have had a catastrophic effect.
The campaign brought to the surface in a disturbing way the latent divide
between Protestants and Catholics in the west of Scotland.
The Scottish National party said yesterday that the recent surge in its vote
 -which brought it success in the regional elections in Scotland and gained
it a second seat in the European parliament - was still running strongly,
even though the party fell short of overtaking Labour.
But Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, insisted that Monklands
East had been an 'atypical by-election' because it was dominated by one
issue: Monklandsgate - the allegation that Labour-run Monklands District
Council discriminates against the Protestant town of Airdrie, which is at
the centre of Monklands East constituency, in favour of the neighbouring
Catholic town of Coatbridge.
At the same time, the attempt by Mr Tom Clarke, the Labour MP for Monklands
West, to deny the allegations appears to have backfired, raising questions
about his long-term future in the shadow cabinet, where his portfolio is
overseas development.
Mrs Helen Liddell, the new Labour MP, has pledged to sort out the
long-standing problem in her new constituency.
But the unusual and bitter circumstances at Monklands do not hide the fact
that the SNP may yet pose a bigger threat to Labour. Some Labour officials
are concerned by this. They fear that the Scottish party organisation is
weaker than in other parts of the country, and that it has become too
complacent following the decline in the Scots Tory vote.
But Mr John Curtice of Strathclyde University says Labour has cause to be
reasonably pleased with the Monklands result. Its share of the vote fell by
11 per cent - not far out of line with its performance in other by-elections
where it was the sitting party.
He said: 'Labour is not making the progress in Scotland it is achieving
south of the border. But its vote did not fall nearly as much as it might
have done. And now that Mrs Liddell has the backing of George Robertson over
the Monklandsgate issue it should be possible to improve the situation with
the council before the next general election.'
The SNP is likely to be disappointed with its performance. Before the
by-election it said that on the basis of its strong performance in the
regional elections it had secured 42.3 per cent of the vote in the
constituency, compared with Labour's 50.1 per cent. It therefore had only an
8 per cent gap to make up.
On polling day it gained 45 per cent of the vote against Labour's 49.75 per
cent. As Mr Stephen Gallagher, the Liberal Democrat candidate - who lost his
deposit - pointed out yesterday, the SNP was shooting at a barn door because
of Monklandsgate, but failed to hit it.
There are indications, too, that the SNP took much of its vote not from
Labour but from the Conservatives, whose candidate Mrs Susan Bell won only
799 votes, giving her the lowest share of the vote (2.3 per cent) of any
Tory by-election candidate in Britain since the war. The by-election
reinforces the immense difficulty the party faces in winning parliamentary
seats from Labour in west/central Scotland.
Labour's vote is too tightly concentrated in its key seats while the SNP's
is well distributed across Scotland.
At the same time Labour's strong performance in UK opinion polls - if it is
maintained - can only undermine the SNP's attraction to voters.
The prospect of a Labour victory will undermine the SNP's argument that
Scotland has too little power at Westminster. One Labour politician said
yesterday: 'What we can offer the Scottish people at the next election is a
chance to change that outlook at Westminster.'
The sectarian issue has resurfaced - but will not necessarily spread because
of the dangers to all parties of playing that card. The more the SNP
appeared to align itself with the Protestants in Monklands East, the more it
alienated the Catholics in the constituency and elsewhere in the west of
Scotland.
The party which most obviously played the Orange card was the Tory party -
and it came fourth.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Nationwide reports 0.7% fall in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices dipped again last month, figures from Nationwide building
society show, providing further evidence of a sharp slowdown in the pace of
the housing market recovery.
Nationwide said the average price of a home fell 0.7 per cent to Pounds
54,221 in June compared with the previous month. The society had reported
price rises in every month since February.
In sharp contrast Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, had
reported price falls in April and May, including a 1.6 per cent fall in May
 -the biggest monthly fall announced by the society since the corresponding
month last year.
The latest decline reported by Nationwide reduces the annual rate of price
increases recorded by the society to 1 per cent, compared with 3.3 per cent
in May.
Halifax is expected to show a similar annual increase of 1 per cent when it
publishes its house price index on Monday. It is likely to show a small
month-on-month increase in June, of less than 1 per cent.
Both societies have reduced their forecasts for price increases this year
from about 5 per cent to about 2 per cent or 3 per cent, reflecting recent
concern that the pace of recovery has slowed. The slide has been blamed in
part on tax rises and increases in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations manager, said yesterday: 'Market
confidence remains fragile, reflecting the moderate pace of economic
recovery and persisting concerns about employment. The initial impact of
recent tax increases and a rise in fixed mortgage rates may also have been
factors temporarily slowing the market's recovery.'
Figures published this week by the British Bankers Association showed that
banks approved 10 per cent fewer mortgages in May than in the corresponding
month last year.
Net new lending by building societies in May was also lower, at Pounds 806m
 -17 per cent down from the Pounds 974m lent in April and 10 per cent lower
than in the corresponding month last year.
Nationwide said yesterday that the picture remained mixed and 'reports from
our estate agents show that whilst activity levels during the spring have
been disappointing in some areas, other localities are seeing more buoyant
demand'.
More than half of the 143 estate agents questioned in a recent survey by the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that sales in the three months
to the end of May had 'either flattened out or declined' compared with the
previous three months.
Housebuilders have also reported lower sales activity since the spring.
Builders say weekly sales are little higher than in the corresponding period
last year. Earlier this year industry sales were 10 per cent to 15 per cent
higher than at the same stage last year.
Experiences differ between sectors of the market and between regions.
According to estate agents, purchases at the top and bottom of the market
appear to be holding up best.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The civvy street campaign: How military skills can be an
asset for businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven years ago Captain Carl Hunter and Sergeant Philip Price of the Royal
Green Jackets worked together on incorporating the Warrior armoured vehicle
into the battle plans of the British army.
These days, in a picture-book village in Sussex, they are engaged in a
different sort of collaboration, devising strategies for a business founded
by Mr Hunter in 1990, now selling nearly Pounds 3m of high-technology
gadgets each year, 80 per cent of them abroad.
Their small companies - Lidbury, Wylam Hill, and Wylam Hill Security - are a
striking, if far-from-typical, instance of what ex-servicemen can do when
they hang up their uniforms.
It is also the sort of thing the defence ministry holds up as an example
when it counsels the 30,000 who leave the armed services every year, and
tries to persuade business that military skills are applicable to the world
of commerce.
Until recently the number of leavers had been projected to fall to about
25,000 a year from 1995, but if - as is widely expected - this month's
conclusion of the defence costs study calls for a further reduction of about
14,000 in the size of the armed forces - the current flow will be
maintained.
The armed forces are already a high-turnover business, and some paths from
the forces to civvy street are well trodden - from military to civilian
flying, or from prestigious guards regiments to prestigious jobs in the
City.
But as memories of national service fade civilian businessmen can be
downright sceptical of the relevance of the armed forces - with their arcane
jargon and exclusive ethos - to their own world.
Hence the importance of a business such as Lidbury, which is based almost
entirely on skills and relationships built up in the services.
Many of its products - devices for fire control, marine safety and military
or commercial security - were developed by Mr Hunter's father Eric, whose 20
years as a naval submariner gave him a fascination with sonar technology.
Mr Price is technical sales director of the business. Mr Marcus McCaffrey, a
fellow Green Jacket officer, is projects manager, responsible for developing
new products, and Mr Richard Lyle, formerly of the Welsh Guards, is export
director.
One product - a device for picking up the sound of human movement at a
distance - was thought up by Mr Price. Working in reconnaissance, he
realised that most of his equipment was meant to enhance vision rather than
hearing.
Mr Hunter and his team, who work from a modest old building, have strong
ideas about the relevance of the service ethos to civilian business.
The military world, they point out, puts a high premium on effective
internal communication. Lives can depend on the ability to impart, exchange
and distribute information with maximum efficiency.
The army also cultivates rigorous planning, with precise formulation of
targets and - more than most business schools - a careful evaluation of
'downside' scenarios, given that the battlefield is a more unpredictable
place than the boardroom.
As Mr Hunter puts it: 'Every plan is a good one until you meet the enemy.'
For the past two years the Ministry of Defence has been running a vigorous
public relations campaign - Access to Excellence - to persuade employers
that the forces are the 'best trained workforce in Britain'.
It is stressing that one-third of an average service career is spent in
training, that entry requirements are rigorous, that promotion depends on
qualifications and performance, and that there is continuous 'culling' of
weaker servicemen.
As evidence of the campaign's success the defence ministry says 85 per cent
of departing servicemen have found work within a year - 50 per cent have
fixed up a job before they leave.
In presentations to employers and chambers of commerce the ministry has
tried to find ways of making service qualifications comprehensible to
civilians. An infantry sergeant, for example, is described as a man who is
used to overseeing 30 men and maintaining Pounds 1m of equipment.
Up to 4,000 of the servicemen affected by the forthcoming redundancies are
likely to be air-force engineers, doing jobs to be farmed out to the private
sector. Many can expect to be re-employed - in large businesses or the small
ones they set up - doing almost the same thing as they were before.
Mr Hunter and his friends think that many ex-servicemen go too far in
playing down their military background and trying to adapt their language
and presentation to the civilian world. He said: 'If you have been in
command of something, you should use the word command and not manage. You
don't want to make yourself sound as though you've been running a
supermarket.'
On the other hand many a civilian business-school graduate would be
sceptical of the idea that he or she had anything to learn from a product of
Sandhurst - at least until encountering the real thing.
The past three decades have probably seen a thickening of the cultural
barriers between the armed forces and the business world. The continuing
flow of skilled personnel from the barracks to the workshop, the laboratory
and the boardroom could help break them down again.

FT  02 JUL 94 / By-election victor says Monklands needs time to heal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour victor of the Monklands East by-election,
yesterday said there should be a period of healing to repair the wounds
inflicted by the bruising campaign.
But she also accused the Scottish National party, which narrowly failed to
win the seat, of stirring up religious tensions in the constituency. She
said it had been 'despicable' for canvassers to appeal to Protestants by
reminding them that she was a Catholic.
Mrs Liddell won the seat with a majority of 1,640 over the SNP. That
compared with the late John Smith's majority of 15,712. The turnout was 70
per cent.
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, rejected Mrs Liddell's accusations, saying
the party had played 'neither the green card nor the orange card, but the
Scottish card'.
The main issue in the campaign was alleged discrimination by Labour-run
Monklands district council against largely Protestant Airdrie, at the centre
of the constituency, in favour of mainly Catholic Coatbridge.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said the government should
use its powers to hold an inquiry into the actions of the council. Mr Ian
Lang, the secretary of state for Scotland, said he could not order an
inquiry without evidence.
Support in Scotland for the Scottish National party is at 30 per cent, its
highest level since 1988, while Labour has 46 per cent, says a System Three
opinion poll for The Herald newspaper in Glasgow. The Tories are put at 12
per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 11 per cent

FT  02 JUL 94 / 'Ex-Services Minister' called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs of all parties yesterday called for more sensitive handling of the
problems of former members of the armed forces, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said in the opening speech of a
Commons debate on the issue that the UK was one of the few allied nations
that had not appointed a minister charged with promoting the interests of
ex-service personnel.
Such a minister's role would be to cut through red tape to ensure that those
who had served in the forces speedily secured their benefits and other
entitlements.
Mr MacKinlay said that a sub-department of ex-service affairs would be
better equipped to co-operate with the Royal British Legion and other
organisations acting on behalf of those who had served in the forces.
Mr Donald Anderson, from the Labour front bench, said his party was
considering whether a unit should be set up in the Ministry of Defence to
look after the needs of ex-servicemen and women.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, agreed to look for
improvements in administrative arrangements but argued against the creation
of a special sub-department which, he said, would 'cut across existing lines
of communication' including those between MPs and ministers.

FT  02 JUL 94 / KPMG to invite outside directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second-largest accountancy firm, is poised to
appoint non-executive directors to its governing board as part of a
restructuring.
Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner, plans to add a number of non-accountants
with outside experience - including senior business executives to help
advise the firm - over the next few months.
The plan emerged as the senior partners met yesterday to debate whether to
incorporate the firm in some form. The 25 'general partners' discussed
possible re-organisation models that might help limit their liability in the
event of litigation.
The plans could be implemented by the beginning of
October, the start of KPMG's new financial year.
Some of its competitor firms have expressed doubts whether incorporation
would be either cheaper or protect partners' assets.
KPMG may ultimately consider restructuring the existing dozen individual
partnerships that comprise the UK firm and modifying the status of the
general partners who receive profits from across all the individual
practices.
It also emerged yesterday that KPMG's affiliate in the Netherlands is
considering changing its structure from partnership to a corporate entity,
while the US firm is preparing to register as a limited partnership in
Delaware in an effort to provide partial protection to the personal assets
of its partners.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Societies hope for more home loans freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater freedom for building societies in how they fund their mortgage
lending business has been signalled by the issue of draft guidance on
securitisation.
The provisional guidance from the Building Societies Commission, the
sector's statutory regulator, does not advocate the financing technique, but
by setting a framework for how it could be done it should remove the
constraints caused by regulatory uncertainty.
It sees securitisation as particularly relevant for large societies which
want a new way of accessing wholesale funds. This might arise where a
society had almost reached the 40 per cent ceiling on the amount it could
raise on the wholesale markets, or where its ability to win mortgage
business outstripped its ability to attract retail savings.
The technique allows mortgage lenders to take loans off their balance sheet,
so removing the risk of default, and freeing up capital.
The assets are placed in a special-purpose vehicle which raises money by
selling the debt securities to investors. Interest on these
'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments.
The system has been widely used in the US for more than 10 years but only
relatively recently in the UK.
The guidance brings greater flexibility to the commission's attitude to the
treatment of the membership rights of borrowers whose mortgages are
securitised, in a way that could make this more attractive to a society's
board.
But it also emphasises the need for societies to be clear and fair in how
they explain any such moves to those borrowers whose mortgages would be
affected.
Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest society, has led interest in
securitisation in the sector. Nationwide and Skipton have also carried out
work on the funding technique.
The draft guidance reflects other recent developments by addressing the
increasing interest from societies in buying mortgage books from other
lenders. It says that any society planning to make a significant purchase
should consult the commission first.
The guidance for societies on securitisation is now closer to that issued by
the Bank of England.
Both Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank have securitised mortgages
and loans in the past year or so.
In February Abbey National acquired the capability to securitise future
mortgages when it bought the Pounds 900m UK residential mortgage book of the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Patten lightens testing workload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday an-nounced a package of
measures to bring an end to the teachers' boycott of compulsory testing in
schools in England and Wales.
From next year teachers will not be required to mark the tests for children
aged 11 and 14. The marking will be contracted out to 'agencies of proven
competence' employing external markers.
Temporary supply staff will be provided in primary schools to give class
teachers time to carry out the compulsory tests of 7-year-olds. External
audit of teachers' assessments for these tests is to be abolished, reducing
the onerous record-keeping involved.
The measures are designed to lighten the workload involved in testing, an
important factor behind the teachers' boycott. They follow the radical
streamlining of the national curriculum and testing programme recommended by
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's curriculum adviser.
Mr Patten said yesterday that Sir Ron's reforms had already halved the time
taken by testing.
He said: 'The arrangements for external marking and supply cover will now
remove any vestige of a case on workload grounds for not carrying out the
tests in 1995.'
Mr Patten's announcement carried a veiled threat of reprisals against
schools that failed to carry out the tests in future. He implied that they
might be subject to more frequent or searching inspection without the hard
information provided by test results.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, said the boycott
would continue. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said external marking
would mean teachers still had to assess pupils and operate the tests, which
disrupted classroom lessons.
He added: 'Mr Patten is throwing tens of millions at educationally flawed
policies rather than sitting down with the teachers and working out a system
which has the profession's support.'
The other teaching unions welcomed the announcement.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said it amounted to 'an
admission of failure'. She added: 'The Tories have wasted almost Pounds 750m
with futile experiments on our children's education.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / PM rules the airwaves: How Berlusconi won control of
broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government has achieved its objective in the battle to
control the future of the RAI, Italy's broadcasting organisation, at the
expense of a bruising battle with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
Yesterday the Official Gazette published a decree on the RAI, rewritten to
accommodate the reservations of Mr Scalfaro. The president had refused for
24 hours to sign the original decree because it gave the government the
direct power both to reject the RAI's accounts and to fire the board.
Now the power of appointing the board has been placed back with the speakers
of the two houses. It so happens that the speakers both represent the
right-wing government coalition. However, Mr Scalfaro insisted to the limits
of his weak constitutional authority that the power be formally in the hands
of parliament rather than directly with the government. He has achieved a
moral victory but he has not endeared himself to Mr Berlusconi and
co-operation, already strained, will in future be difficult.
The net effect of the rewritten decree is the same as its original. Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned prime minister, can now exercise
control over the RAI. He also continues to be the owner of the Fininvest
empire, which controls over 80 per cent of commercial television.
No one disputes the need to reform the RAI, which operates three television
channels and a network of radio stations. It was constructed to accommodate
the old system of political parties, with the Christian Democrats
controlling the first channel, the Socialists the second and the former
communist PDS the third. The RAI was also on the point of bankruptcy, with
losses in 1993 of over L500bn (Pounds 205m).
However, the affair has been badly handled. Mr Berlusconi and his ministers
say the RAI was biased against them. This was true during the election
campaign; it acted as a counterweight to the huge propaganda effort of the
three Berlusconi channels. But lately the news programmes on RAI have become
almost servile in support of Mr Berlusconi.
Only Channel Three is still openly critical and last Sunday earned itself
further opprobrium by screening a film in which Mr Berlusconi's current
wife, Veronica Lario, plays a part in a lesbian love affair. Meanwhile,
Fininvest channels remain firmly behind the government, with Network Four's
presenter Emilio Fede a self-confessed apologist.
It thus looks as though Mr Berlusconi has yielded to the temptation of many
a government to control the media. But in this case the issue is broader
because of the potential conflict of interest with his ownership of
Fininvest.
The problem is further complicated with the financial position of the RAI.
If its funding is now pruned, as promised, it will have reduced scope to
operate. Fininvest stands to benefit from this since it has been competing
on exactly the same terms as the state channels in both programmes and
salaries. If the RAI spends less, so will Fininvest, which is also strapped
for cash.
The government also needs to decide whether the RAI moves to enter the
multi-media era, on which considerable investments have been spent and good
technology acquired. It also has to decide if the RAI can operate pay-TV. In
either case, the removal of the RAI from these areas of business leaves the
field free for competition, which can only benefit Fininvest.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Skandia to boycott Swedish state bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern about Sweden's shaky public finances yesterday rose as Skandia, one
of the country's top two insurance groups, said it had stopped buying
government bonds in protest at the continuing rise in state debt.
The announcement by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, jolted
Stockholm's financial markets, already in bearish mood. Five-year bond
yields moved up sharply to almost 10 per cent, the Swedish krona fell
against leading currencies and the Stockholm stock exchange fell 2 per cent.
'Skandia will not buy Swedish (state) bonds until such time as the
politicians, in a credible way, begin to take seriously the accelerating
state debt,' Mr Wolrath said. 'I really do not feel that I have a mandate
from (Skandia's) owners to go in and buy Swedish bonds, considering the big
risk that implies today.'
Sweden has the fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development member countries - fuelled by a budget deficit
that reached 13 per cent of gross national product last year. State debt
stood at SKr1,132bn (Pounds 96bn), or about 80 per cent of GNP, at the end
of 1993, and is still rising, despite a return to economic growth this year.
The Skandia group holds about SKr50bn in state bonds, about one third of
those held by the insurance sector, which in turn held almost 12 per cent of
state debt at the end of last year. Executives said Skandia would sell some
of its portfolio.
Senior officials at the Finance Ministry said they did not expect any
short-term problems for the government in meeting its financing needs as a
result of Skandia's move. Two rival insurance groups, Trygg Hansa and
Folksam, said they would continue to trade in government bonds.
But the Skandia boycott coincided with new figures showing foreign investors
were net sellers of Swedish bonds to the tune of SKr10.6bn in May. Stockholm
County Council also said it was withdrawing from the market.
Mr Carl Bildt, premier, issued a statement which came close to endorsing
Skandia's move. He sought to shift the onus on to the opposition Social
Democrats, whose loyalty to the welfare state has raised market fears that
they would duck necessary cuts in the public sector if they returned to
power. Last night, Mr Goran Persson, economic spokesman for the Social
Democrats, called for a special session of parliament's finance committee to
discuss the issue.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Turks defy Russia on shipping: Curbs imposed on Bosporus
traffic despite protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey was yesterday set on a possible collision course with Russia, after
unilaterally imposing new shipping regulations for the Bosporus and
Dardanelles.
Russia and other Black Sea states claim the rules are in breach of
international treaties. Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Ukraine, Romania and
Bulgaria have all publicly protested.
Under the new rules ships must forewarn Turkish port authorities of their
cargo and vessels more than 150 metres long must seek permission to go
through the straits that divide Europe and Asia.
The straits are a vital trade route for Russia and newly independent Black
Sea states.
However, Turkey has mounted a diplomatic campaign to win international
support for the measures on safety grounds. It fears the projected increase
in tanker traffic, as central Asian oil finds come on stream, will be an
environmental and navigational threat, a point which was underscored by a
collision in March in which more than 20 people died.
Congestion is likely to increase after the opening of the Danube-Main-Rhine
canal system.
According to minutes from a meeting in May of the International Maritime
Organisation, the London-based United Nations body that handles maritime
disputes, Russia and other states argued that the Turkish proposals
contravened the 1936 Montreux Convention, which guarantees unhindered
passage for merchant vessels in peacetime.
The IMO said yesterday Turkey's regulations were national laws and had no
international application.
Western diplomats are waiting to see if the Turks apply them to
foreign-flagged vessels. Both Russia and Greece want Turkey to support
international action within the IMO to deal with safety concerns. In May,
the IMO's maritime safety committee recommended more modest changes,
including introduction of traffic separation lanes and a requirement that
ships over 200 metres long go through the straits during daylight. Both
measures take effect in November.
Shipping experts say the long-term worry is that if left unchallenged,
Turkey's action may set a legal precedent and provide Ankara with
discretionary powers to impede shipping.
Greek officials confirm that in April a Greek-registered tanker, the Olympic
Armour, was prevented from going through the straits because it was too
long.
Turkey clearly also has a commercial motivation. It is keen to see western
oil companies in central Asia use a proposed Turkish pipeline to the
Mediterranean.
The new rules, if implemented, could result in costly delays in shipping oil
through the straits, currently the main route for Russian and central Asian
oil exports, and persuade oil concerns to look more favourably on Turkey's
proposal.
Diplomats say the disagreement underscores wider differences with Russia
over regional policy. Turkey is at loggerheads with Moscow on a range of
issues from Russian peacekeepers in the Caucasus and central Asia, to
Moscow's diplomatic role in former Yugoslavia.
But the danger is that Turkey, in pursuing commercial gains, is hampering
efforts to deepen trade ties with the region under the auspices of the Black
Sea Economic Co-operation (BSEC) organisation, in which Ankara has been the
driving force. High-level discussions - including a Turkish-Russian meeting
on Thursday at the BSEC foreign ministers' conference in the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi - have provided no breakthrough.

FT  02 JUL 94 / D'Alema chosen to lead Italy's ex-communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) yesterday
elected Mr Massimo D'Alema, to succeed Mr Achille Occhetto as leader.
Mr D'Alema has been the party's number two and heir apparent. But Mr
Occhetto himself and a large section of the grass-roots in the PDS favoured
Mr Walter Veltroni, his rival, who edits L'Unita, the party daily.
The PDS is the largest parliamentary party. It is the acknowledged leader
and organisational force for the five main groupings that form the left-wing
opposition.
But Mr D'Alema now faces a difficult task in rejuvenating the party and
making it appeal to a broader section of the electorate. He is highly
regarded as an astute political operator and a good diplomat. However, his
detractors regard him as formed too much in the old school of the Italian
Communist party (PCI) with its doctrinaire approach to issues and blind
faith in organisation.
Mr D'Alema began his political life in the PCI's youth wing in 1963, working
his way up through editorship of L'Unita. Although he was the recognised
heir, it was only this week that Mr Occhetto revealed the full extent of his
disagreement with Mr D'Alema.
In yesterday's meeting of the party's national council, the balance narrowly
swung in favour of Mr D'Alema. However, grass-roots members clearly saw Mr
Veltroni, with his boyish charm and open admiration for the American way of
life, as more presentable and 'modern' - the Italian version of US President
Bill Clinton, or Mr Tony Blair, aspiring to Britain's Labour party
leadership.
The election of Mr D'Alema does not solve the broader issue of who leads the
left. Critics such as Mr Massimo Cacciari, the influential mayor of Venice,
argue that the left must be led by someone not directly linked to the PDS.
The PDS, Mr Cacciari claims, remains wedded to the old communist structure,
and as such is an electoral liability.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Airbus to rethink test flights after fatal A330 crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Airbus consortium is expected to decide in two weeks when to
pursue flight tests on the A330 airliner powered with US Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines, following Thursday's crash at Toulouse in which seven crew died.
The new compulsory tests for the aircraft's all-weather landing capability
will be conducted at less extreme conditions to see if the consortium needs
to modify the aircraft's autopilot system, being tested at the time of the
accident.
Airbus said yesterday there appeared to be no need to modify the system at
this stage. The accident occurred under conditions not normally experienced
during routine commercial airline service.
The flight was part of the certification requirements for all-weather
landings of the A330 powered with US Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4168 engines. The
same tests had been successfully carried out with the US General Electric
CF6-80E-powered A330, which is already in service with Air Inter, the French
carrier, and Aer Lingus of the Irish republic.
Airbus said the crew performed planned manoeuvres immediately after take-off
on Thursday: capture of an exceptionally high angle of climb of 28 degrees
to fly at a deliberately low speed (by comparison a commercial airliner is
normally limited to an angle of 18 degrees); engagement of the autopilot;
simulation of an engine failure (in this case the left engine) by bringing
it to idle, and cutting off the related hydraulic circuit.
The combination of the simulated engine failure and the high angle of climb
induced a loss of lateral control at 400 metres. 'This altitude did not
allow the crew, which regained control of the plane, to avoid impact with
the ground,' said Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive.
The commercial implications of the crash are difficult to evaluate. It was
the first time an Airbus has crashed during tests. Mr Pierson yesterday
noted that sales of the narrow-body, twin-engine A320 airliners had doubled
since an A320 crash in 1988.
In the last 20 years, 10 Airbus airliners have crashed, but Airbus's safety
record is better than the industry average, which since 1979 has been one
passenger death for every million take-offs. In Airbus' case, the average
has been 0.73 deaths.
However, Airbus has had a particularly bad run of accidents this year,
including the crash of a China Airlines A300-600 at Nagoya airport in Japan
and of an Aeroflot A310 in Siberia.

FT  02 JUL 94 / West Germany's production falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial production in west Germany fell by a provisionally estimated 0.7
per cent in May, tempering hopes of a rapid economic recovery, and
confirming expectations of a new slowdown in consumer spending.
The figure published by the federal statistics office coincided with a
recalculation of April's industrial production growth, reducing the initial
estimate of a 2.5 per cent increase to just 1.3 per cent.
The May figure was the first monthly drop this year, and the underlying
trend remains clearly positive. However it follows a sharp fall in retail
sales in April - down a real 6 per cent - as the combined effects of tax
rises and wage restraint have squeezed disposable incomes.
The sharpest drop in output in May was for consumer goods, down 2.8 per
cent, and capital goods, down 1.9 per cent. Overall manufacturing production
was down 0.8 per cent.
Analysts described yesterday's figures as 'slightly disappointing', but most
doubt they will have any effect on the Bundesbank's monetary policy.
There was some suggestion yesterday that the markets might still speculate
on a possible cut at the central bank council meeting next Thursday, because
of the coincidence of the G7 meeting in Naples, and the confirmation of an
apparent slowdown in the pace of recovery.
Moreover, the bank could be influenced by fears that the strengthening
D-Mark might undermine the classic export-led recovery still under way.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said this week that a
'significant' move in interest rates at this time would not be
'appropriate'.

FT  02 JUL 94 / China-Taiwan trade begins to lose momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in trade between Taiwan and China has slowed from its breakneck pace
earlier this year due to China's economic clampdown and rising concern in
Taipei over the risks of increasing reliance on the mainland market.
According to Hong Kong customs statistics, released yesterday by Taiwan's
Board of Foreign Trade, two-way cross-strait trade totalled Dollars 2.82bn
(Pounds 1.85bn) between January and April, up 7.4 per cent from the same
period in 1993.
Two-way trade advanced at an annual rate of 25.4 per cent during the first
four months of last year and 17.3 per cent for all of 1993. Taiwan bans
direct transportation to China, forcing most cross-strait trade to be routed
through Hong Kong.
The figures are a relief to Taiwan's government, which last year began
encouraging local businesses to diversify their overseas investments away
from China.
Mr Chiang Ping-kun, economy minister, yesterday reiterated Taipei's 'Go
South' policy. This is aimed at boosting economic and trade ties with
south-east Asian countries to offset dependence on China.
In a government-led effort, Taiwan investors will put Dollars 300m into an
industrial estate at Subic Bay, the former US naval base.
Government efforts notwithstanding, analysts say the slowdown in
cross-strait trade is only a respite and that the long-term trend is
unstoppable.
Hong Kong statistics underestimate Taiwan-China trade flows, as the volume
of goods transshipped through the colony without passing through customs is
growing.
Prof Wea Chi-lin, a trade expert at Taiwan University, estimates 1993
two-way trade at Dollars 13bn, against an official tally of Dollars 8.69bn.
Of that, Dollars 10bn is Taiwanese exports to China, representing 15 per
cent of the island's total exports. This does not take into account the
growing volume of goods 'smuggled' across the strait.
After Hong Kong's handover to Beijing in 1997, Taiwan's exports to China
will represent 30-35 per cent of the island's total exports. The figure will
stabilise at 35-40 per cent by the end of the century, Prof Wea estimates.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Hong Kong reforms upset business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An extraordinary week for Hong Kong has left the colony's traditional power
brokers, the business community, feeling isolated and a little angry.
Many were opposed to any change in the political structure which did not
have China's blessing. They view the reforms voted for in the early hours of
Thursday morning as opening the way for Hong Kong to be dominated by
populist politicians over whom they have little control.
At an extended session of the Legislative Council (LegCo), lawmakers passed
Governor Chris Patten's so-called democracy legislation. The law, which
applies to elections due next year, broadened the franchise for 29 of
LegCo's 60 seats. The remaining 31 seats will retain tight qualifications
for voting, such as membership of a professional association or a company
directorship.
Mr Patten said on Thursday he would like to try to build a bridge between
business and the democratically elected politicians in Hong Kong. 'We have
got to try harder to get business to understand it would not be in Hong
Kong's interest to sell out the Joint Declaration as a way of securing a
quiet life,' he said.
But the governor faces an uphill battle in convincing business folk that
their interest best lies with local democrats rather than Beijing
bureaucrats. For Mr David Chu, a property developer and China adviser, the
governor's reforms represent 'a rapid change from an elite-run society to
the other extreme where political power has been put in the hands of the
grass roots'.
Mr Chu's views are typical of Hong Kong's business community which, under
British colonial rule, has been used to making agreements with government
without the irritation of public consultation. The attraction to many local
businessmen of close relations with Beijing is that they think they can
recreate this relationship with the future sovereign.
Mr Chu said he was concerned about the new 'functional' constituencies which
would be created as a result of the governor's bill. Mr Patten has been able
to achieve electorates with an average size of 255,000 by splitting the
workforce into nine broad groups along industry lines.
'I am quite concerned,' he says. 'And I can see it in my own firm. The floor
sweeper, everybody, will be voting in my construction constituency. They
will out-vote me, but they will not represent me. Indeed, my interests are
likely to be misrepresented.'
Mr William Fung, managing director of Li &amp; Fung, a trading company, said Mr
Patten's package was ridiculous when he announced it in October 1992 and
LegCo's passage of it has not made it any less so. He said the 1995
elections would return members of LegCo who represented 'narrow and
parochial' interests. 'We are not talking about democracy in the western
sense, where the majority party becomes the government,' he said. 'LegCo
should be a watchdog, a balance to a strong executive and as such it needs
to be broadly representative.'
Mr Simon Murray, group chief executive of Deutsche Bank Asia Pacific, also
agrees that LegCo should be broadly based, but he thinks Mr Patten has got
it right.
'Personally, I'm delighted with the LegCo vote,' he said. 'This is good for
Hong Kong. If we don't have broadly based elections then we would have got a
LegCo elected by small groups and beholden to them. All the deals would go
to their backers.'
Both Mr Fung and Mr Murray think there is a chance that China, when it
resumes sovereignty in 1997, will not dismantle completely the reforms
passed this week. 'Whether they change everything depends on how it
functions,' says Mr Fung. 'But they will change some things.'
The British government yesterday rejected recommendations by an all-party
parliamentary committee in London for an independent human-rights commission
in Hong Kong, writes Our Foreign Staff.
The rejection was part of a reply to a report on Hong Kong by the foreign
affairs committee, which prompted an angry reaction in Beijing because of
its outspoken comments on Tibet and Taiwan. The British decision confirmed
the view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, that existing legal
arrangements, including a forthcoming Equal Opportunities Bill, are adequate
to protect human rights.
The UK government also told the committee that it was deeply concerned about
human rights abuses through China, including Tibet, but it did not think it
would help the Tibetans for London to try opening discussions on the
region's future.
'Any lasting solution can be found only through dialogue between the Chinese
government and the Tibetans without preconditions,' the report said.
