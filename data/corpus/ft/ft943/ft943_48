FT  02 JUL 94 / Gatt still at odds over entry for China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Developing countries yest-erday stepped up demands for China's early entry
into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the US and European
Union insisted Beijing must make substantial concessions before it can join.
The divergent approaches emerged after four days of talks in Geneva, at
which China reaffirmed its desire to be a founding member of the World Trade
Organisation, which is due to succeed Gatt early next year.
The strength of developing countries' calls for China's early admission
surprised some delegates.
However, the US and EU said they would not agree to China's entry on terms
which diluted the impact of last year's Uruguay Round trade deal. Further
progress in the talks would depend on how quickly Beijing proposed
acceptable arrangements.
'The Chinese have got to deal and compromise, and there has been no sign yet
that they are ready to,' said one delegate from an industrialised country.
The US is adamant Beijing must fully meet Gatt obligations on entry. The EU
is prepared to allow China a transition period after it joins, though it
suggested yesterday it might seek provisions to re-open negotiations on
Beijing's accession agreement after it becomes a member.
Though this week's talks produced no breakthroughs, Gatt members appear to
be edging towards agreement on a draft protocol for China's accession, based
on a paper by Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss economy minister who is
chairing the talks. Gatt members have until July 13 to submit amendments. A
revised version will be put to a meeting of the China membership working
party on July 29.
Substantive negotiations with China are not expected before September.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Japan's PM attempts to ease anxiety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new Socialist prime minister, yesterday
attempted to win confidence in his much-criticised government by pledging to
pursue moderate conservative policies.
He acknowledged that there was anxiety over his appointment and pledged to
'make further efforts to make my cabinet more trustworthy and reliable'.
The three-party alliance of the conservative Liberal Democratic party with
its traditional enemy the Social Democratic party, plus the New Harbinger
party, an LDP splinter group, has achieved instant unpopularity after
seizing power in a parliamentary coup on Wednesday.
Only 33 per cent of the electorate supports the new government, according to
a poll yesterday by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. The figure rose to 40
per cent in a survey conducted by Television Tokyo.
In his first public address since taking office, Mr Murayama outlined
polices roughly in line with those of the dominant coalition partner, the
conservative LDP.
He promised to extend the current one-year income tax cut, in an attempt to
boost domestic demand, and said the government would try to reach a
conclusion by the end of the year on how to finance a tax reduction. Finance
Ministry plans for a law by the end of the year to increase sales tax would
be delayed for many months, a government official said.
The government will press on with plans to reform the political and
electoral system and will hold the next general election under the new
rules, rather than the old ones, the prime minister said.
On foreign relations, Mr Murayama pledged broadly to continue the diplomatic
policies of the previous government. He reassured US President Bill Clinton
by telephone yesterday that Japan would abide by the US-Japan security
treaty, under which US troops are stationed on Japanese soil. The pacifist
SDP has long advocated scrapping the treaty.
Mr Murayama shared the previous government's caution over North Korea's
nuclear ambitions by saying Japan would continue to seek a solution through
dialogue, rather than economic sanctions.
However, he toned down the previous government's attempts to step up Japan's
bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 'I don't
believe Japan should actively manoeuvre,' for the post, he said.
Japan would, however, continue to help with UN peacekeeping duties within
the limits of its pacifist constitution. That is a change from official SDP
reluctance to accept Japan's constitutional right to have armed forces,
another indication of the concessions the party has made to share government
with the LDP.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Confusion ushers in Brazil's Real
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Marcia sleeps on the streets of Sao Paulo and feeds herself and her
six-month-old baby by begging. Yesterday, sitting in front of the shops
along Avenida Brigadeiro, she had her best day ever.
'People keep giving me all their change. It's because of the new currency,'
she said, leafing though a wad of grimy banknotes.
She was happy, but most Brazilians were confused. The new currency, the
Real, came into force yesterday to replace the inflation-plagued cruzeiro at
a rate of 1 to 2,750. This awkward figure was chosen as it sets the Real at
parity with the US dollar, where the government hopes to keep it.
But for people queuing in banks to swap currencies, or doing their weekly
shopping, pocket calculators were essential.
Shopkeepers and restaurants were providing machines to customers having
difficulty understanding the exchange rate, and there were complaints that
some prices were too high in the new currency.
'They've converted to the Real then added 50 per cent,' said one elderly man
as he left his usual lunchtime restaurant without eating.
Customers stood quietly in line at banks to cast off their dirty notes and
receive crisp ones in return. There were nervous smiles as the new notes
were inspected, then held up to the light.
New currencies, and their rapid demise, are common in Brazil.
The Real is the fifth switch since 1986, all the others having been sullied
by inflation, now running at 50 per cent a month.
The dollar link, and a better-planned price stabilisation programme, have
prompted hopes that the Real will last longer than its predecessors.
Inflation is expected to fall to single figures by August.
Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, an economic commentator and former planning
minister, says inflation will stay low for about six months but he does not
believe the Real is the 'strong' currency Brazil has been promised. 'This
currency is so 'strong' that ever since we announced its link to the US
dollar, the dollar has been falling against the yen,' he said sarcastically.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Uzbekistan courts 'His Majesty the som': Tashkent tries to
inflate respect for its new currency, but many fear its glitter will not
last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conservative government of Uzbekistan yesterday introduced a new
currency, the som, without international backing, to the alarm of the few
western traders still toughing it out in Tashkent.
Nor are they the only ones worried by the move, decreed by Mr Islam Karimov,
the Uzbekistan president. Since the announcement the black market rate of
the interim currency, the coupon, has fallen by 33 per cent. Western traders
suggest that even the government is uncertain about the new currency launch.
They point to an unusual government tender planned next month in Tashkent,
in which residential properties will be sold exclusively for dollars.
'It shows that someone in government doesn't believe the som is going to
remain convertible for very long,' a senior western business consultant in
Tashkent said.
In a public relations drive that reflects the lack of any substantial
under-pinning of the new currency, the state media have tried to inflate
respect for the som by referring to it as 'His Majesty the som'.
But the International Monetary Fund has halted talks on currency support,
since Mr Karimov refused to set the stage for the som by first altering
economic policies that have fuelled a 1,500 per cent annual inflation rate.
Uzbekistan left the rouble zone eight months ago. In April, the government
initiated talks with the IMF, which had already awarded support programmes
to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
But IMF officials decided Mr Karimov was not prepared to shift his economic
policies sufficiently to sustain long-term currency stability.
'The government thinks it can avoid strict fiscal and monetary policy,' said
a western economist in Tashkent, 'but this is impossible.'
Lacking IMF support, the government is backing the som with Dollars 700m
(Pounds 466m) in cash and an undisclosed quantity of gold.
The som will circulate at an initial rate of six to the dollar; the
government will exchange the new currency without restriction at a rate of
one som to 1,000 coupons. During the one-month phase-in, the coupon will be
honoured alongside the som.
At current exchange rates, the som will be worth almost seven times the
value of the coupon, a level western analysts say is almost sure to decline
sharply and quickly.
They believe Mr Karimov will continue to try to dictate the value of
Uzbekistan's currency, though with just Dollars 700m in reserves he will not
manage to intervene in support of the new som for long.
Mr Karimov has attempted, at least at first, to restrain expected
devaluation by restricting the circulation of the new currency in its
initial month of circulation.
Uzbekistanis will be required to deposit their coupons in state banks but
will not be permitted for a month to exchange them for the new currency,
thus restricting circulation to the current month's state salaries.
The currency's introduction mirrors Mr Karimov's administration of
Uzbekistan's economy as a whole since independence came with the Soviet
collapse 30 months ago.
On paper, the republic has tantalised western investors, if a bit less than
its richer central Asian neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
During the Soviet period, Uzbekistan served mainly as a cotton bin, growing
most of the Soviet crop and becoming the world's fourth largest producer.
Uzbekistan also produced 60 tonnes of gold a year, and in 1993 extracted
45bn cubic metres of natural gas. About 4m tonnes of oil were produced last
year, and recent discoveries make this figure likely to rise.
Trouble has come because Mr Karimov has expended enormous efforts trying to
conserve the Soviet system that put him in power during the Gorbachev era.
For example, state enterprises still thrive by borrowing money from the
government at a significant negative interest rate, since Mr Karimov is keen
to avoid causing unemployment.
He has rejected western advice that, with a spiralling 3.5 per cent birth
rate and half the population of 21m below the age of 19, Uzbekistan should
move quickly with a reform package of subsidy reduction and industrial
restructuring.
One of Mr Karimov's tendencies has been wholeheartedly to support market
reform and western investment (in January he unveiled a well received
reformist programme) as long as it does not disturb anything.
Thus, his policies have produced only a slight crack in the door through
which just a few investors have managed to pass. Notable among these are
Daewoo, Mercedes-Benz and Newmont Mining. This week, as well, BAT Industries
is to sign a Dollars 190m deal to develop Uzbekistan's domestic and export
market for cigarettes.
Analysts say that Mr Karimov's tight economic grip has also been the main
problem with Uzbekistan's disastrous monetary policy but that he is unlikely
to lighten up soon.
One western business consultant in Taskhent said: 'We hear all the time
here: 'Before you move into your new house you don't destroy your old one.'
Karimov is just going to be very cautious.'

FT  02 JUL 94 / Bosnian embargo backed: Senate votes 50:50 to keep arms ban
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday narrowly avoided the prospect of a big
clash between the US and its European allies when the US Senate defeated by
a hair's breadth a measure requiring the administration unilaterally to lift
the embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia.
A motion sponsored by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader received a
50:50 vote. A tied vote is a defeat in the Senate.
The House of Representatives has already voted by 244 to 178 for the same
measure and, if Mr Dole's motion had passed, Mr Clinton would have faced an
embarrassing choice between vetoing the entire defence budget, to which the
Bosnian motion was attached as an amendment, or defying the United Nations
resolution which bans arms supplies to the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Clinton has said that he supports ending the embargo on Bosnia, but not
unilaterally.
France and the UK, which have warned that a lifting of the embargo could
compel them to withdraw their troops from the UN peacekeeping force in
Bosnia, were pleased at the outcome of the Senate vote.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, had lobbied 19 senators on a
recent trip to Washington in an effort to solidify opposition to any
unilateral move.
While Senator Dole argued that it was wrong to deprive Bosnia, which has
been much harder hit than Serbia by the arms embargo, of the right to defend
itself, Senator Sam Nunn and Senator John Warner, two of the Senate's most
respected voices on national security affairs, warned that the US would be
dragged into the conflict if it breached the UN embargo.
'The implication of lifting this embargo unilaterally is that this becomes
America's war. Lifting this unilaterally carries with it a very serious
moral obligation to follow through,' Mr Nunn said.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Palestinian businessmen eye opportunity

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
While Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
struggles to secure promised aid in support of his self-rule agreement,
wealthy Palestinians in the diaspora have mobilised hundreds of millions of
dollars for private investment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, writes James
Whittington in Amman.
The vehicle for investment is the newly-established Palestine Development
and Investment Company (PDI) which is registered as an off-shore holding
company in Liberia and has a paid-up capital of Dollars 200m (Pounds
131.5m).
The board of directors reads like a Who's Who of successful Palestinian
family businesses.
It includes representatives from the Shoman family, which controls the Arab
Bank, the son of Mr Said Khouri, joint owner of the construction company CCC
(Consolidated Contracting Company), and Mr Kamal Shair, head of Dar al
Handasah, one of the world's leading consultancy firms in engineering and
urban development.
These businessmen, and others, have put their money behind the PLO's peace
agreement with Israel in the belief that it will eventually lead to a
regional peace settlement. 'We have assumed a scenario of comprehensive
peace where there will be free and open trade. Jordan and the West Bank will
form a common market and then a federation, and Palestinians will have
self-determination,' explained Mr Shair, who is the holding company's
chairman.
The head office is in Amman and operating companies are soon to be
established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Feasibility studies have
identified five main areas of investment which will each be managed by one
of the operating companies. These are tourism, financial services and
investment banking, light industry, agriculture and construction.
Mr Shair said he hoped the combined capital of the operating companies,
which should attract equity investment from Palestinians inside the
territories, plus borrowing on international capital markets, will enable
PDI to lever its Dollars 200m to up to Dollars 1bn over the next five years.
Corporate strategy will focus on high quality export-oriented goods and
services. 'The Palestinians have a comparative advantage in terms of low
wages. Labour intensive industries such as (manufacturing) leather and
household goods and agriculture will be profit-making if we aim at high
quality production. We will help the people inside to market their goods not
only regionally but also in Europe like the Israelis do,' Mr Shair said.
In construction the operating company will seek profits by building
middle/upper income housing and industrial estates and in tourism joint
ventures will be sought with Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian
tourist companies.
According to current Jordanian laws in the West Bank, foreign investors are
permitted a maximum 49 per cent stake in local companies. But Mr Shair
explained that the PDI would insist on ultimate control of all projects
which came under its wing. 'Through equity control or a management agreement
we will have all strategic decisions for operating companies,' he said.
The company's first mission to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led by Mr Nabil
Sarraf, who is the PDI's acting general manager and a close associate of
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, returned to Amman recently after
largely enthusiastic receptions in East Jerusalem, Nablus and Gaza. Mr
Sarraf said that concern was expressed by some local businessmen that they
would be overwhelmed by outside investors. But 'after some discussion they
were nearly all convinced that we are coming to make money for everyone, not
just ourselves.'
The stature of the PDI's founding members will be a huge boost to Mr Arafat,
who has already contacted the company for advice on Palestinian investment
legislation and a stock market. With the slow disbursement of foreign aid,
he is desperate for a reconstruction programme and investment to begin
backing-up his peace deal.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Master of surprise charts risky course: Arafat continues to
keep world guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is
proud of his unpredictability; it is a quality which for 30 years has served
him well. It has kept him one step ahead of lethal enemies, out of the
clutches of allies who tried to control him, and helped build the image of a
man who wanted the world to believe that the fate of the Middle East's most
intractable problem rested on his shoulders.
The only surprising thing about the suddenness of his decision to visit Gaza
yesterday was that anyone was surprised by it. Mr Arafat consults, but he
alone decides. On Wednesday morning in Tunis many of his closest aides,
working alongside Mr Arafat, first learned of his decision to go to Gaza
through the media.
They did not know then exactly what had prompted the decision, and yesterday
still did not.
They smile, shrug their shoulders and sigh deeply. This was the sort of
surprise they had come to expect, but not to explain.
By Mr Arafat's standards this was a very modest surprise, merely a matter of
timing, not of strategy. He may not reap such extensive international
exposure as he would like, but he will have marked another stage in the
still long march towards his ambition of becoming president of an
independent Palestinian state.
A year ago, yesterday's events in Gaza would have seemed inconceivable. Then
he was embattled by critics from within his own organisation, was failing to
show any real progress in the negotiations with Israel in Washington, and
appeared an increasingly lonely man whose career might have run its course.
But even as his critics were writing him off, Mr Arafat was secretly
negotiating the deal which would catapult him on to the lawn of the White
House, and Israel into doing the one thing which successive governments
swore would never happen - formally recognising the PLO.
The debate still rages among Palestinians, and among those who promote their
cause, about the merits of the deal negotiated by Mr Arafat: whether it is a
formula for continued Israeli domination of Palestine, or the first
irreversible step towards an independent state.
Whatever the eventual outcome, Mr Arafat is seen as a vital component by
Israel and the US, the two governments which sought longest and hardest to
exclude him from the equation.
To hear Israeli diplomats defending the PLO chairman against his Palestinian
critics has been one of the more remarkable experiences of recent months.
An even bigger surprise would be if Mr Arafat chose to remain in either Gaza
or Jericho for very long. He is a compulsive traveller, in part to avoid the
set patterns which favour assassins, but also to keep the Palestine issue at
the forefront of world attention.
Predictably, his aides have no idea where he will next set up home, and
despite his formal farewell to President Ben Ali of Tunisia this week there
is little evidence of Palestinian offices in Tunis preparing to close down.
Quite apart from security considerations, Mr Arafat will want to keep a
balance between the substantial Palestinian population in the diaspora and
those living in the territories, while also maintaining a greater
geographical distance between himself and Israel as talks begin on the next
stage of the peace process.
If those talks run into difficulties, as seems probable, Mr Arafat will be
looking for the greatest possible room for manoeuvre, both in relation to
Israel and to his own constituency. The fear is that such manoeuvring will
be at the cost of the detailed but unspectacular work needed to establish
the Palestinian self-rule authority in the liberated areas.
A start has been made, but it has been slow and Mr Arafat's unwillingness to
delegate has increasingly irritated the international donor governments
which have contributed Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) to the development of
the West Bank and Gaza over the next five years.
They all recognise that an improvement in basic living standards will
contribute more than anything else to the acceptance of the peace process by
the majority of Palestinians.
However, Mr Arafat, in common with other guerrilla leaders before him, is
finding the adjustment from freedom fighter to chief executive hard to make,
particularly as the largest part of the territory he seeks is still under
occupation.
With elections to the self-rule authority due to be held after the
completion of Israeli troop withdrawals, Mr Arafat is predictably also
seeking to ensure that his closest supporters are in the most advantageous
positions, a further obstacle to the establishment of an efficient
administration.
But however great the frustrations, Mr Arafat again underlined yesterday
that no other Palestinian can rival his political status. 'Not everyone
loves him', said a PLO official yesterday. 'Of course we know that some
people despise him, even hate him. But for now, at least, he embodies the
dream of a Palestinian state, of independence, and freedom for our people.
Whether he will still do so in a year's time remains to be seen.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Robust US economic growth is putting upward pressure on prices in the
manufacturing sector, purchasing managers reported yesterday as separate
reports on business confidence and construction spending underlined the
continuing vitality of the economic recovery.
The purchasing managers' index of prices paid by manufacturers rose two
percentage points to 73.5 per cent, the highest level since August 1988 when
the Reagan boom was still under way.
The index shows the direction of price changes, but not their magnitude as
it is based on the proportion of com-panies reporting increases as opposed
to decreases in prices.
The overall purchasing managers' index - a guide to manufacturing output -
registered 57.5 per cent in June, slightly below the May reading of 57.7 but
still a sign of steady growth; 17 out of 20 manufacturing sectors reported
an improvement in business conditions from May. The overall index has
hovered around 57 per cent since last December. Readings of 50 per cent or
more indicate the economy is growing.
Indices measuring the strength of new orders and new export orders rose last
month, indicating growth of manufacturing production later this year.
Chief executives' 'assessment of the current state of the US economy is at
the highest level in 10 years', said Mr Jason Bram, an economist at the
Conference Board, a New York business analysis group.
The board's index of business confidence dipped slightly to 64 in the second
quarter from 65 in the first three months, but remained well above the level
in the second half of last year when gross domestic product grew at an
annual rate of 5 per cent.
More than 80 per cent of respondents said general economic conditions had
improved over the past six months; fewer than 5 per cent cited a
deterioration. The dip in the overall index reflected a slightly less
optimistic view of future business conditions, probably prompted by the
recent rise in bond yields.
Construction spending rose 0.9 per cent in May to stand 2.9 per cent higher
than its average level in the first quarter, confirming a strong rebound
after severe winter storms. Construction was up 11 per cent from May last
year.
The official index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second
month, but many economists regard it as a barometer of current, rather than
future, economic conditions.

FT  02 JUL 94 / US agrees to sign Law of Sea treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is to sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea at the end of this
month, after more than a decade of opposition.
The treaty, which sets rules on sea-bed mining and oil exploration, fishing
rights and scientific research, has already been ratified by 61 countries
and is due to take effect in November.
Successive US administrations have blocked ratification of the treaty on the
grounds that it restrained private enterprise in sea-bed mining. However, Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told the Senate foreign relations
committee on Thursday that the US had successfully negotiated changes to
make the treaty more business-friendly.
The treaty also guarantees rights of passage through straits and gives
countries full sovereignty within 12 miles of their coasts and control of
fishing and mining rights within a 200-mile zone.
US adherence to the treaty must be approved by the Senate, and some
Republicans are expected to maintain their objections.
The treaty's coming into force is unlikely to lead to a boom in sea-bed
mining. Shortages of key minerals that were predicted when treaty

FT  02 JUL 94 / Dollar ends turbulent week on firmer note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar staggered yesterday to the end of a week in which it fell to a
post-war low against the Japanese yen but avoided a headlong decline.
Attention is now focused on the rash of policy meetings next week which
should reveal whether the G3 countries - US, Germany and Japan - are willing
to take concerted action to support the dollar.
The central bank meetings are followed by the summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations in Naples, which starts on Friday. The weakness
of the dollar and its impact on financial markets is likely to be of key
concern at the summit.
The US currency stood at Y98.65 in late trading in New York after closing in
London at Y98.705, more than a yen firmer than its low of Y97.68 reached in
Tokyo trading. Against the D-Mark it was DM1.59655 in New York after
finishing at DM1.5946 in London.
Earlier the dollar had gained support from rumours, later denied, that the
Bank of Japan might cut its official discount rate. Speculation had been
fuelled by comments made by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary,
that lower Japanese and German interest rates would help the dollar and
world economic growth.
The rally petered out during late European trading amid disappointment that
central banks had not intervened, as they did last Friday. The banks,
however, chose to stay out of the market following the failure of their
earlier efforts which saw the dollar fall below intervention levels.
Traders are hoping for concerted action next week, possibly in the form of
co-ordinated interest rate moves from the US, Germany and Japan.
Analysts warn, however, that all three countries have good reasons not to
want to make policy changes yet. If the market's expectations are
disappointed, this may well leave the dollar vulnerable. Analysts are
divided as to whether the dollar will take to the sidelines until after the
G7 summit or endure a volatile week.
Equity markets had a better week, after suffering heavily when the dollar
first slipped below Y100 on June 21. The FT-SE 100 index finished at
2,936.4, a 2.1 per cent rise on the week, and in Frankfurt the Dax climbed
1.6 per cent higher over the same period. However, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo
and the CAC 40 in Paris each fell by more than 1 per cent during the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 21.69 points up at 3,646.65.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Arafat returns in triumph to Gaza: Palestinian leader
pledges to take struggle to Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An emotional Yassir Arafat took his first chaotic but triumphant steps on
Palestinian soil yesterday after nearly 27 years in exile.
He vowed to take the Palestinian struggle from Gaza to the holy city of
Jerusalem, claimed by Israel as its eternal capital.
'Our blood, our souls - we will sacrifice them for you Abu Amar (Mr Arafat's
nom de guerre). God is Great]' went up the Palestinian battle cry as
euphoric Palestinian fighters-turned-policemen waved victory signs and
automatic rifles and a bagpipe band played nationalist music.
'My brothers, while we are here in Gaza we remember the martyrs of the
al-Ibrahimi mosque,' Mr Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, told the thousands of welcomers, referring to some 30
Palestinians shot dead by an Israeli man in the West Bank town of Hebron in
February.
'We and they are going from here to the mosque (in Hebron), going to Nablus
and Jenin and Tulkarm and Qalqilya and Bethlehem and Beit Sahour and Beit
Jalla and Ramallah and then shortly after to Jerusalem] Jerusalem]
Jerusalem, to pray there,' he said in a 30-minute address, listing the most
important Palestinian towns and holy places.
But he also assured Israel he would honour the autonomy deal signed by
Israel and the PLO last September, calling it 'a courageous peace, a
courageous compromise'. The deal provides for self-rule by the Palestinians
in the Gaza Strip, Jericho and eventually the West Bank as a whole, to be
followed later by negotiations on the final status of the occupied
territories.
Israel's rightwing opposition leaders reacted angrily to the speech, but
government officials viewed the homecoming with either indifference or
equanimity.
Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said Mr Arafat 'can say what he likes, as
long as he acts only on what's been agreed. And so far, he has followed the
self-rule agreement - rejecting terror, preventing terror, dissociating
himself from the PLO charter'.
Earlier, tears streamed down the 64-year-old Palestinian leader's face as he
stood through the open roof of a black Mercedes limousine and waved to
thousands of Palestinians who lined the 40km route clapping and ululating.
In Gaza City, policemen from the Palestine Liberation Organisation, who
blocked streets and guarded rooftops, fired into the air to greet the man
they revere as the embodiment of Palestinian resistance and nationalism.
Minutes before his arrival, Palestinians were still emerging from their
subdued mood to whitewash graffiti-stained walls and hang flags and bunting
from balconies. Policemen were also busy until the last moment painting
checkpoints with flowers and cutting palm branches - a symbol of peace.
Many Palestinians remain deeply sceptical of Mr Arafat and the peace deal he
struck with Israel, which leaves many of the most burning Palestinian
demands shelved to later negotiations. Some at least who turned out to greet
the 'president' did so out of respect for an old leader and a son of
Palestine rather than because they support him personally. Others were
simply curious to catch a face-to-face glimpse of the most famous
Palestinian.
Mr Arafat became chairman of the PLO in 1969 and had last visited the
occupied territories as a clandestine guerrilla leader shortly after Israel
had taken control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Arab-sraeli
war.
But with the homecoming over, Mr Arafat faces his greatest moment of truth.
He can no longer survive as a popular leader on the basis of myth, legend
and theatrics but will be quickly faced with the enormous social and
economic challenges facing Gaza.
Expectations are running high that the 'president' will be able to solve
unemployment of 50 per cent, rampant poverty and appalling sewage, water,
transport and electricity problems.
He will face mounting pressure to share power by holding democratic
elections in the occupied territories, as provided in the Israel-PLO
Declaration of Principles. In the next step in the peace process, Israel and
the PLO will have to negotiate on such contentious issues as the future
status of Jerusalem.
Many in the Palestinian opposition believe all they have to do is sit and
wait for the chairman to fail and diminish in stature. 'He will fail no
matter how much money Arafat brings because the peace agreement is so far
below the basic demands of Palestinian people,' said Dr Mahmoud Zohar of the
Hamas Islamic Resistance movement.
In his ride to Gaza City, Mr Arafat also saw the thorn which remains in the
peace process: the presence of 4,000 Jewish settlers in Gaza and another
120,000 in the West Bank. As he passed the settlement of Kfar Dorom, Jewish
residents waved Israeli flags and banners which said 'Go Home'.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Lasmo wins battle against Enterprise bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo won its hard-fought battle for independence when the Pounds 1.6bn
hostile bid from rival Enterprise Oil failed by an unexpectedly wide margin
yesterday.
Enterprise gained acceptances for only 23 per cent of the shares in addition
to the 9.8 per cent of Lasmo it bought in the market on Wednesday.
The Enterprise camp had been saying it expected a much closer finish. The
disappointing result drew some criticism of S. G. Warburg, the lead adviser
on the bid.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise, refused to
blame the advisers, saying: 'The responsibility rests with me. We are
naturally disappointed at the outcome of the bid. I still believe that the
assets fit together well, the terms were right and the price a fair one.'
However, the commercial arguments failed to convince most observers and the
lack of a cash element is thought to have swayed a number of institutions.
Instead, Enterprise was offering a mixture of new A shares and warrants
which Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo chairman, successfully attacked as 'junk
paper'. Analysts criticised Warburg's handling of the bid and in particular
the apparent misreading of institutions' intentions. One analyst singled out
the actions of PDFM (formerly Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management), Lasmo's
largest shareholder.
On Wednesday Enterprise bought nearly half of PDFM's stake at 169p a share,
suggesting it was worried that PDFM would not accept the paper offer. It
would have done better to buy from someone else as yesterday PDFM was one of
the few institutions to accept on behalf of its remaining stake. 'Tony Dye
(PDFM's investment director) deserves the biggest prize in this bid,' said a
member of the Enterprise camp. 'If he wants to, he will be able to buy the
shares back at much less on Monday.'
The announcement that the bid had lapsed came after the market closed,
leaving Enterprise up 9 1/2 p at 398 1/2 p and Lasmo 1 1/2 p higher at 136p.
Legal &amp; General also accepted the offer but Mercury Asset Management, the
fund manager owned by Warburg which Enterprise's advisers confidently
expected to accept for its 1.7 per cent stake, backed Lasmo. One institution
said: 'We genuinely did not decide which way to go until the last moment.'
The decision to extend the offer to US investors, who accounted for about a
fifth of the shares, was vindicated, with about half accepting the bid.
The Enterprise camp praised the defence campaign, pointing to the good
impression Mr Agnew and Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, made with
institutions.

FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as US
weighs on the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further strength in the yen and Thursday's fall on Wall Street depressed
investor confidence, and the Nikkei index fell marginally on arbitrage
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 100.52 to 20,543.41 while the Topix index of all first
section stocks closed 11.16 lower at 1,662.16. The Nikkei started at a high
of 20,618.22 but fell to a low of 20,274.95 in the morning session as the
dollar fell below Y98 to a record low against the yen.
Volume totaled 380m shares against 454m. Most selling came from unwinding of
arbitrage positions against the futures market while investment trusts and
public fund managers led the day's buying.
The Nikkei 300 fell 2.32 to 302.30. Declines led advances by 661 to 354 with
172 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.11 to 1,347.46.
Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-privatised
telecommunications company, is to list its shares in New York and London
bolstered the stock. NTT, the largest company in the world in terms of
market capitalisation, said that it wanted to offer overseas investors more
corporate information.
The stock gained Y6,000 to Y881,000, while other telecom shares were also
traded actively. Nitsuko rose Y40 to Y1,570 and DDI, the long-distance
telecom operator listed on the second section, rose Y30,000 to Y9.45m.
High-technology shares were mixed in spite of the yen's strength. Hitachi
rose Y10 to Y1,040 and NEC gained Y20 to Y1,240.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 134.77 to 22,957.49 in volume of 18.2m
shares.
Roundup
US weakness, in the dollar and in equities, weighed on the region. Bangkok
and Taipei were closed.
HONG KONG was helped up from its lows by some late bargain hunting after a
day of thin trade. The Hang Seng index fell 124.04 or 1.4 per cent to
8,634.37, after a low of 8,508.93, to finish 2.8 per cent lower on the week.
Among property issues, Cheung Kong fell 85 cents to HKDollars 32.90,
Hongkong Land eased 30 cents to HKDollars 19.20 and Henderson Land dropped

SEOUL finished slightly higher as construction shares and those with low
price/earnings ratios gained ground. The composite index added 1.22 to

SINGAPORE trimmed early losses as interest developed in some index stocks
and the Straits Times Industrials index ended 14.26 lower at 2,210.65, 1.6

Cadbury India, an affiliate of Cadbury Schweppes of the UK, fluctuated
sharply in response to the announcement of a 534 per cent rise in net
profits. The share rose to Rs320, before finishing Rs2.50 ahead at Rs307.50.
MANILA dropped after PLDT's fall on Wall Street, and on news that the
Supreme Court had deferred implementation of a new value added tax law.
PLDT slid by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 on Wall Street, and followed it
with a fall of 40 pesos to 1,630 at home. The composite index fell 51.85 to

expectations but the shares fell 24 cents to ADollars 17.74.
WELLINGTON's NZSE 40 index fell only 13.54 at 1983.34, in spite of Wall
Street and a rise in domestic bond yields on the domestic market. Thursday's
budget made little impact on the market.

FT  02 JUL 94 / Extension of BSE ban based on new experiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's extension of the list of cattle products banned in the UK is
based on new evidence, proving for the first time that BSE or 'mad cow
disease' can infect more of the animal than just the brain and spinal cord.
An experiment by agriculture ministry scientists showed last month that the
small intestines of six-month-old calves, who had themselves been fed large
amounts of BSE-infected brains, could pass the infection to laboratory mice.
The findings prompted an emergency meeting of the government's scientific
advisory committee on BSE. It concluded that the 'theoretical risk of
infection of man via food derived from infected calves is miniscule if it
occurs at all, but information on calves is still very limited'.
The agriculture ministry added intestines and thymus glands of calves under
six months old to the list of prohibited cattle products. Offal from older
animals - brain, spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsils and intestines - has
been banned since 1989.
Calves' intestines are traditionally used in beef sausage production.
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, urged the government
yesterday to extend the ban further to include calves' brains and other
offal. He said: 'No one is going to criticise ministers for excessive
caution when it comes to BSE.' But Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief
medical officer and Mr Keith Meldrum, the chief veterinary officer, insisted
in a joint statement that calves' brains were 'not considered in the light
of the available evidence to present any risk'.
Mr Meldrum said it was 'not surprising' that the BSE agent was present in
the calves' intestines. The agent's incubation period suggested that it
would not show up in the brains of animals less than 1 1/2 years old.
BSE has affected 130,500 animals in the UK since it was first reported in
1985. The epidemic started to decline last year with new cases now running
at about 500 a week, against 1,000 at its peak.
A few microbiologists - notably Professor Richard Lacey of Leeds University
and Dr Stephen Dealler of York District Hospital - have demanded far
stronger government action to reduce the risk that BSE could cause an
epidemic of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, its human equivalent. Such fears have
provoked German moves to ban British beef imports.
Dr Calman reiterated that there was no evidence that BSE - or eating beef -
could cause CJD. 'I must provide the best advice to the public, whatever the
consequences,' he said. 'If there was any evidence that suggested a link
between BSE and CJD, then I would regard it as my responsibility to bring it
to public attention.'
Mainstream scientific opinion continues to support the official line. 'I
have not modified my diet and I still eat beef,' said Dr John Collinge of St
Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, a leading researcher into the
infectious proteins that are believed to cause BSE, CJD and other
brain-destroying diseases.

Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the Italian food and chemicals group, said operating
profits in the first five months of 1994 were 46.5 per cent higher than
during the same period last year, AP-DJ reports from Rome.
The company said at its annual shareholders meeting that gross operating
margins were 6.8 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared to
margins of 5 per cent last time.
It said it expected to cut its debt to L11,000bn by the end of 1994,
compared with L21,950bn in 1993. The reduction will come from restructuring
of the debts, capital increases and sales of assets.
Ferruzzi also said gross operating profits for the first two months of 1994
were L447bn, up 26 per cent from the year-ago period.
The restructuring plan has provided total estimated benefits of L800bn so
far, of which L285bn accrues to Montedison, the chemicals group, according
to the company.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Restructuring pays off as IRI
sees sharp reduction in losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday forecast a large reduction
in losses during 1994, to L1,360bn (Dollars 864m) from more than L10,230bn.
The improved performance was predicted by Mr Romano Prodi, the outgoing
chairman who resigned a month ago.
It reflects the broad restructuring led by Mr Prodi during the past year,
and includes revenue from privatisation.
The main losses, totalling L4,668bn, were blamed on restructuring at the
Ilva steel group and at Iritecna, the civil engineering and construction
subsidiary.
The IRI annual meeting also confirmed the holding's total debt had reached
L79,783bn, equivalent to almost 5 per cent of Italy's GDP.
The much-expected announcement of a replacement for Mr Prodi failed to
materialise yesterday, indicating continuing problems within the Berlusconi
government on the nomination.
A compromise being discussed is that Mr Enrico Michele, the current managing
director, take over in the role of chief executive.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Australian rates speculation grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that Australia's official interest rates may rise in the near
term was fuelled yesterday when monthly economic data showed a large rise in
building approvals for May, and an unexpected widening of the current
account deficit for the same month, writes Nikki Tait.
Building approvals rose 10.4 per cent, compared with market forecasts of a
small fall. This indicated that any slowdown in Australia's booming housing
market is some way off and stoked fears of domestic inflationary pressures.
Meanwhile, the current account deficit widened to ADollars 1.71bn (USDollars
1.25bn) in seasonally-adjusted terms, compared with ADollars 1.65bn in the
previous month. Analysts had expected a deficit of about ADollars 1.4bn.
Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer who has insisted there was no sign
of incipient inflation and that interest rates did not need to rise at this
stage, said the balance of payments figures were 'broadly consistent with
budget forecasts'. He claimed the growth in imports supported the
government's expectation of a strong acceleration in investment spending
over the coming year.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Former Elders executive jailed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Jarrett, the former Elders IXL executive who has agreed to give
evidence against Mr John Elliott concerning the Melbourne-based
businessman's role in ADollars 66.5m (Dollars 48.5m) worth of allegedly
fictitious foreign exchange transactions, was sentenced to 18 months in jail
yesterday.
However, Mr Justice Coldrey suspended 12 months of the sentence, saying it
could not have been easy for Mr Jarrett to 'break ranks' and co-operate with
the authorities. Mr Jarrett had pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to
act honestly between 1986 and 1990 as an officer of Elders IXL, the large
Australian brewing and agribusiness group formerly headed by Mr Elliott.
Theft charges were brought against Mr Elliott, a past president of the
Australian Liberal party and one of Australia's most prominent entrepreneurs
in the 1980s, and a number of other Elders executives including Mr Jarrett,
shortly before Christmas.
Essentially, the prosecution is arguing that the forex transactions were
used to funnel money to companies connected to Mr Allan Hawkins, a New
Zealand-based businessman who is in jail. Mr Jarrett's account supports
these allegations. However, Mr Elliott has consistently denied any
wrongdoing. The matter is due to come to trial next month.

India's plans to deploy a medium-range missile system with its armed forces
threatens to trigger a regional arms race in southern Asia, Ms Benazir
Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, warned in Dublin yesterday.
On a three-day official visit, she said Pakistan has shown 'tremendous
restraint' by not responding in kind to India's testing of a nuclear weapon
and the successful test-firing of its Prithvi missile system.
'We have not detonated a (nuclear) device, although India has detonated a
device. We have shown tremendous restraint.' But the increase in India's
defence budget and its recent decision to deploy the Prithvi missile system
with its artillery corps have been 'highly provocative, (and) threatens to
trigger a missile race in the sub-continent'.
The Prithvi is believed capable of carrying a nuclear warhead up to 250km.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US diplomat said yesterday that former Yugoslavia could be soon be
engulfed by a renewed war inside Croatia, where a ceasefire between Serbs
and Croats is looking tenuous.
The warning was issued by Mr Peter Galbraith, the US ambassador to Zagreb.
He warned that in the event of a renewed war, the Croatian army could be
crushed by better armed and more numerous Serb fighters who would be backed
by Belgrade.
'The danger of a new war remains,' said Mr Galbraith during a visit to
Osijek, north-eastern Croatia.
Complaining about Serb intransigence during peace efforts and the absence of
progress in international mediation, Croat officials are threatening to
seize back nearly one-third of their republic's territory which is under de
facto Serb control. If they fail to gain control over the 'state', which
severs Croatia in half, Croat political and military leaders say they will
not renew the UN mandate.
Zagreb says the UN presence has simply frozen Serb military gains, carved
out during the six-month war in 1991, although diplomats believe that the
14,000 strong force has prevented an all-out conflict.
In Belgrade yesterday, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia met Mr Alexei
Nikiforov, a Russian peace envoy, for talks on a map providing for the
partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines.
The map was unveiled this week by the so-called contact group, composed of
representatives from Russia, the US, Britain, Germany, and France.
So far the warring parties have not formally rejected the map, which gives
51 per cent of Bosnia to the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 per cent to
the Serbs, who currently control 70 per cent. But they have made clear that
war remains an option.
In spite of continuing clashes, the UN yesterday said it wanted to extend
the widely breached month-long truce between the Bosnian army and the
Bosnian Serbs, when it expires on July 9.
'We are going for an extension to consolidate the gains made over the first
30 days,' a UN spokeswoman said.

FT  01 JUL 94 / European road plan widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport has added 17 new sections of road to the British
part of a controversial Europe-wide network intended to improve
communications within the European Union.
Many of the roads in England, Wales and Scotland added to the trans-European
road network (Tern) are linked with ports.
The original Tern network was agreed last October but prompted protests from
some towns which felt they had been neglected and from other communities
fearful that inclusion in the list would lead to large increases in traffic.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the revised list had been drawn
up after consultation with local highway authorities, freight transport
groups and environmental organisations. The list will be put to the European
Commission and the Council of Ministers for their final approval.
Roads to be added to the network in England include the M27 between
Southampton and Portsmouth, the M62 and M58 between Liverpool and the M6,
the A120 between the A12 near Colchester and Harwich, and the A20 between
Folkestone and Dover, the M25 between junctions 3 and 5 and the eastern
section of the M42.
In Scotland the A77 between Ayr and Stranraer, the M8/A8 Glasgow to Greenock
and the A82/A87 from Glasgow to Uig on Skye have been added, and in Wales
the A477 between St Clears and Pembroke Dock and the A465/A40 Heads of the
Valleys route from the M4 near Swansea to Raglan.

FT  01 JUL 94 / CBI calls on EU to open up markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for Europe to press
ahead with opening up its gas and electricity networks to competition as
'part of the drive to restore Europe's international competitiveness'.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal
energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around.
Some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals and steel
which compete in tough international markets where energy costs have a
strong bearing on commercial success, he said.
Mr Davies was speaking as the CBI launched a paper intended to influence the
green paper on energy being prepared by the European Commission. It comes
amid growing calls for an 'energy chapter' in the 1996 revision of the
Maastricht treaty.
The CBI said it viewed such calls as premature.
The commission has for several years been trying to force European power and
gas companies to open their largely monopolistic businesses to competition,
but with only limited success.
Although there are signs of change in thinking in states such as Germany
which were previously suspicious of liberalisation, even the most
enthusiastic supporters of change believe it will be some years before there
is a deregulated market in energy.

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome fell heavily after rival SmithKline Beecham
said it had received approval to sell its anti-shingles treatment in the US.
The treatment, known as Famvir, is a direct competitor to Zovirax,
Wellcome's biggest selling product.
One analyst argued that the SmithKline approval had come earlier than
expected and was a reminder that Zovirax would lose its patent in 1997.
However, others said there was well documented evidence to show that drug
sales actually improved with the arrival of a competitor and the fall was
merely the result of profit-taking after a good run.
Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder said 'the number two player always
expands the market' and that only 40 per cent of Zovirax sales in the US
were for shingles and thus under threat of competition.
There was also some encouraging news for Wellcome - it announced a
co-promotion deal with Upjohn, of the US, for Zovirax - but the shares have
risen sharply over the past few weeks and were easily marked down. They
closed 27 weaker at 590p, with turnover uninspiring at only 1.3m shares.
SmithKline 'A' picked up from a low of 404p to close 3 off at 406p.
Life assurances bucked the overall market slide, with the sector given a
boost by Hoare Govett, whose insurance team told clients to 'build
weightings' in the sector. Hoare said that, in terms of yield relative, the
sector is standing at an historic high, exceeding that of the composites.
'The UK life assurance industry has the potential for a prolonged period of
sustained growth in excess of GDP,' the broker added. Prudential, steady at
287p, remains Hoare's 'nap' selection in the sector.
High street retailer Kingfisher dusted off recent gloom and rose 9 to 499p
after investment bank BZW changed its strongly negative stance on the stock
by removing it from the sell list to tag it as a hold.
Mr Tony Shiret at BZW said there was initial evidence of stabilisation in
the DIY mar-ket which would help to steady margins.
Storehouse firmed 2 to 217p following a visit by analysts to the company's
BHS distribution centre. BPB, the plasterboard group, raced up 13 to 302p
after preliminary profits that exceeded the most optimistic forecasts. UBS
increased its current year profits forecast from Pounds 135m to Pounds 150m.
Shares in Gestetner tumbled 19 to 144p, brushing aside favourable figures,
after stake holder Inchcape said it would not exercise its convertible loan
option to increase its 14.88 per cent stake in the office equipment group.
Profit-taking in industrial group Charter saw the shares shed 15 to 699p.
News of a 97.4 per cent take-up of its recent rights issue helped
conglomerate Wassall advance 13 to 292p.
Prospects of a Saudi Arabian order for GKN subsidiary Westland boosted GKN
shares, which added 5 at 554p.
Chesterton, the property agency which came to the market last week at 100p,
gave a good performance yesterday, rising 5 to 107p.
Universal Ceramic Materials, brought to the market at 86p, closed 2 ahead at
88p after its first day of dealings.

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Telegraph, whose share price has plunged following its decision to cut
its newspaper cover price, suffered a fur-ther blow yesterday when it
announced that it had lost one of its brokers.
Cazenove, generally considered the most blue-blooded of the City's
stockbroking firms, resigned The Telegraph brokership, leaving Panmure
Gordon, formerly joint broker with Cazenove, as sole broker to the newspaper
group. Cazenove stuck to its custom of making no public comment, but rival
brokers said the move could only cause further damage to The Telegraph's
standing.
The perception is that institutional investors have been incensed at the way
Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group run by Telegraph owner Mr Conrad
Black, sold 12.5m Telegraph shares just over a month before the newspaper
cut its cover price to 30p, and have been venting their displeasure on the
company's broker.
'It was an extraordinary sequence of events and any attempt to make it look
respectable has been severely damaged by the Cazenove resignation,' said one
disgruntled analyst. Telegraph shares ended the day 15 lower at 364p

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil battle blazes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more late drama in the Enterprise Oil/Lasmo takeover battle, with
both camps claiming confidence of success. Significantly, Lasmo shares came
under heavy selling pressure, closing 8 1/2 off at 134 1/2 p on big turnover
of 9.5m, with US investors selling the stock aggressively. Enterprise shares
moved up 7 to 389p.
But contrary to the view that the slide in Lasmo indicated that the bid
would fail, some dealers said US holders were taking the view that an
Enterprise victory was likely. US investors, unwilling to accept the new
Enterprise paper, preferred to sell their shares for cash in the market.
Sector specialists said the bid, the outcome of which is expected minutes
after the market closes today, was still on a knife-edge last night. One
view was that Enterprise had made a tactical blunder in buying half of the
16 per cent held by Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management.
Analysts said that, since PDFM was expected to accept the bid in any event,
Enterprise would have done better to have bid elsewhere for the 10 per cent
stake it sought.

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Overdraft moves hit banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banks sector of the market was given a thorough shaking by news that
Abbey National, formerly a building society and now classified as a bank,
had reduced its authorised overdraft rates to below 10 per cent from 18.4
per cent in a move seen by bank analysts as chasing a much bigger share of
the loans market. The Halifax Building Society also moved to reduce rates on
overdrafts.
The moves were viewed by specialists as the first steps in what could be an
increasingly competitive market for the banks, and which could produce a
significant squeeze on profits in the sector.
Abbey National fell 13 to 393p on 2.8m traded, while TSB dipped 7 to 203p on
7.4m, Barclays lost 16 at 519p and Lloyds Bank slid 14 to 525p.
The worst individual performance, however, came from National Westminster,
which registered a drop of 24 1/2 at 431 1/2 p, after 428p, with the market
additionally unsettled by news that NatWest is buying Central Jersey
Bancorp, of the US. Turnover of 12m in NatWest was the highest single day's
activity for three months.

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed worries on inflation reversed an initial recovery in Footsie
futures, with a further retreat brought on by continuing weakness of the US
dollar and a fall in US markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
The strong momentum seen on Wednesday looked set to continue after the
September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,962. Buying, mainly from
independent (local) traders sent September climbing to 2,972 within the
first hour of trading, which turned out to be the high of the day.
A report suggesting UK inflation is higher than had been anticipated,
together with a sharp retreat in gilts, checked a further advance in the
contract. With continuing worries on the US dollar, September went into
decline.
The afternoon only brought further selling as dealers focused on continuing
falls in both US and UK bonds and the decline of Wall Street. At the close,
September stood at 2,919, down 40 from its previous session and about 10
points below its estimated fair value premium of about 13. Volume was 15,211
lots.
Turnover in traded options improved from Wednesday's poor level, reaching
29,220 by the close. Activity in the FT-SE 100 option at 9,286 remained
poor, but there was an improvement in the Euro FT-SE option with a total of
5,924 trades. BP was the busiest stock option at 1,605.

FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond weakness drives shares
lower - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early bout of optimism in the UK stock market was abruptly reversed
yesterday following a sell-off in both the US dollar and Federal bonds when
statistics on US factory orders and personal spending revived inflation
worries. London equities were hit hard by heavy falls in British government
bonds on news of a sharp rise in the Purchasing Managers Index for June.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 27.1 points off at 2,919.2, having rallied at the
close with Wall Street, which showed a fall of 20 Dow points in UK hours.
The wider-ranging FT-SE Mid 250 Index dipped only 1.1 to 3,414.1, indicating
the focus on the blue chip sectors.
It was a volatile session, with the FT-SE 100 gaining nearly 16 points at
first as bond markets across Europe continued to firm in spite of the
weakness of the dollar. Confidence was encouraged by unsubstantiated reports
that the German and US authorities would agree on concerted monetary
co-operation at the meeting of the Group of Seven ministers in Naples at the
end of next week. Growing confidence that the dollar's problems would be
managed without resort to over-heavy action on US interest rates had helped
European markets on Wednesday.
But the indications yesterday, from both the US personal consumption data
and the UK Purchasing Managers Index, has put inflation fears back into the
centre of the market stage, and unsettled hopes in the London market that a
further cut in base rates might be possible this autumn.
UK equities had begun to drift back from their highs, with the banking
sector weakening the overall picture in the wake of the aggressive cuts in
overdraft rates by Abbey National. But underlying confidence remained sound
until UK government bonds began to fall sharply. The FT-SE 100 Index was
down by nearly 36 points at the day's worst of 2,910.6.
The renewed turmoil in bond markets put an end, for the time being at least,
to the recovery in confidence in equities. Some strategists pointed out that
US markets are moving into a holiday weekend, which opens with an early
closure for today's session. This, it was stressed, increased pressure on
European traders to unload bonds rather than hold them over an extended
weekend. However, markets are still believed to be focusing on prospects for
favourable action at the G7 meeting at the end of next week.
Today brings more data on the US economy, notably the latest economic
leading indicators and construction spending statistics. Traders are
resigned to seeing further nervousness in the bond markets which will
continue to restrain share prices.
Selling of equities increased as the session progressed. However, the final
Seaq total of 597.4m shares traded was more than one fifth higher than on
Wednesday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.03bn. Non-Footsie shares
made up only about 55 per cent of business yesterday, further indicating the
market's concentration on the futures-related Footsie-listed stocks.
Several trading programmes were identified as a flow of sizeable deals
crossed the trading screens. Many reflected end-of-quarter tidying up
operations by fund managers. The first half of 1994 has brought highly
volatile trading in UK equities. The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by around
5.4 per cent over the second quarter.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak bonds push Dow sharply
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks suffered a sharp setback yesterday as nervous investors watched
long-term bond yields push higher, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 42.09 down at 3,624.96, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.36 to 444.27. The secondary
markets showed more resilience, with the American SE composite edging
forward 0.60 to 424.08 and the Nasdaq composite firming 1.95 to 705.96.
The morning brought a barrage of fresh economic indicators, none of which
had any direct bearing on the outlook for corporate earnings. Nevertheless,
stocks were derailed by the bond market's bearish reaction to the data.
In particular, fixed-rate investors were put off by a jump in the prices
paid by Chicago-area manufacturers last month. The Purchasing Management
Association of Chicago said its May prices-paid index climbed to 69.7 per
cent, against 63.7 per cent the previous month.
The data was a red flag for the inflation-sensitive government securities
market. In response, the yield on the benchmark 30-year security moved over
the pivotal 7.60 per cent level, sending a shiver through the stock market.
After a positive opening, share prices retreated steadily throughout the
session, which brought the second quarter to a close. Some 293m shares were
exchanged on the Big Board, even though the approach of the long
Independence Day weekend had thinned the ranks on Wall Street.
There were also many investors who preferred to stay on the sidelines
pending the outcome of next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-
setting arm. The dollar's plight remained an unpleasant sideshow, further
encouraging restraint.
However, two headline acquisition stories provided the session with a touch
of spice. CBS surged ahead Dollars 47, or 17.9 per cent, to Dollars 310 on
news that the media group was in the final stages of negotiating a merger
agreement with QVC. Shares in the home-shopping network jumped Dollars 5 5/8
to Dollars 38. Trading in both issues had been halted until mid-afternoon.
The second deal involved the more staid railway sector, in which mergers
have been rare in recent years. Burlington Northern dipped Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 53 3/8 and Santa Fe Pacific appreciated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20
7/8 after agreeing to combine their operations. The move was anticipated.
Caterpillar continued to feel the effect of a week long strike. The issue
led the Dow indust-rials in decline, dropping Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 100.
After an early gain, UAL, parent of United Airlines, retreated to end a net
Dollars 1 1/8 off at Dollars 126 1/4 . The company modified terms of a plan
which would result in an employee buy-out of the carrier if approved by
shareholders.
Health maintenance organisations were marked down in activity which followed
the approval of a health care reform proposal by the House ways and means
committee. United Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 7/8 and US
Healthcare Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 amid fears of a federal move to
control the cost of insurance premiums.
Canada
After staging a further improvement, the Toronto market slipped back.
leaving the TSE 300 index ending a net 2.9 points off at 4,025.2.
Advances still led declines, however, by 466 to 309 after moderate volume of
59.5m shares valued at CDollars 638m. On the shortened week, the composite
index has gained about 65 points. Canadian markets are closed today for the
Canada Day holiday.
Brazil
Equities closed 5.36 per cent down in local currency terms after
profit-taking and speculation that the government might take measures that
were expected to keep foreigners out of the market. The Bovespa index lost
2,052 at 36,232 in volume of Cr476.2bn (Dollars 173.1m.
Brokers said there was speculation that the government may increase taxes on
incoming capital and maintain a high spread between bid and ask prices on
certain dollar exchange rates.
But a trader said he did not think the government would lift taxes on
incoming capital because it would hurt the market and the share prices of
blue chip state companies.
Traders added that investors were also taking advantage of the market's rise
over the last three sessions to take profits ahead of today's introduction
of the real.
Inflation in Brazil was 45.2 per cent in June, a rise of 2.63 per cent from
May, agencies report from Rio de Janeiro.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Intervention rate cut leaves
Paris cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further fall in the dollar, and a negative reaction in global bond
markets, brought bourses back out of the clouds yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS retreated sharply late in the session as the performance in the equity
market was undermined by the expiry of futures and options.
The CAC-40 index dropped 44.33, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,892.00, bringing its
loss over the first six months to 17 per cent, in turnover swelled to some
FFr4bn by technical trading.
A cut of 10 basis points in the Bank of France's intervention rate, while
taking some analysts by surprise, did little to motivate investors.
Bouygues, off FFr26 at FFr580, was given a long term buy rating by Smith New
Court, which forecast a price of FFr750 per share over an 18 months'
timespan.
On the way up, Sanofi was FFr6 firmer at FFr861 following news earlier in
the week that, as expected, it was to sell its diagnostic imaging business
to Hafslund, of Norway.
Eurotunnel slipped a further 60 centimes to FFr22.25 - off 52 per cent over
the first half - on news that the passenger service between London and Paris
was to be postponed yet again due to technical difficulties.
FRANKFURT decided that talk was cheap, and shares expensive. After much
discussion of 'window dressing' on Wednesday, and talk of a 2,100 level for
the end of the quarter, the Dax index closed 20.96 lower at 2,025.34 after
an intraday high of 2,051.32.
Turnover eased from DM7.25bn to DM7bn and, after hours, the Ibis-indicated
Dax eased further to 2,020.85. Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf
calculated that yesterday's trading left the key index down 4.8 per cent on
the month of June, 5.1 per cent lower for the second quarter and 10.6 per
cent off for the first six months of 1994.
Banks and insurers were savaged in the first half of the year, the sector
indices falling by 21 per cent and 19.3 per cent respectively; among
cyclicals, iron and steel rose 6.2 per cent and major chemicals by 1.3 per
cent, engineering and automotive stocks tailing off with 2.2 per cent and
4.5 per cent declines after leading the 1993 charge with gains of 60.8 and
58.7 per cent respectively.
However, said Mr Frahm, defensive stocks - in Allianz, Viag, Dresdner Bank
and Veba - took four of the top six Dax performance slots in the month of
June alone. If long bonds were to recover in the third quarter of this year,
he said, it would be interest rate-sensitive stocks, typically banks,
insurance companies and utilites, which would be expected to respond in the
equity market.
AMSTERDAM featured strength in KLM after a positive performance all week,
the shares improving a further Fl 1.30 to Fl 49.70 as the AEX index added
1.24 at 383.54.
KLM advanced 23 per cent over the first half, lifted by the more positive
outlook for airlines which emerged over the last few months.
Analysts have turned positive on the industry in general and, on a worldwide
basis, Merrill Lynch said in a recent comment on the sector that it expected
a return to profitability in 1994, assisted by an increase in traffic of
about 7 per cent this year and next.
With regard to KLM, Merrill noted that the carrier had demonstrated to its
competitors that costs could be brought down and assets used more
intensively.
MILAN remained indecisive and the Comit index gave up 8.44 to 689.59 during
another day of thin turnover.
Fiat began firmly, spurting to a day's high of L6,525 before turning back to
finish a net L76 lower at L6,376 in spite of an upbeat statement on the
outlook from Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman. Mr Nicholas Potter at
Credito Italiano International, who has been positive on the motor group's
turnround potential since last November, admitted that he was taken by
surprise by the forecast of a return to profits this year after last year's
L1,700bn loss.
Benetton fell L950, or 4 per cent, to L23,100 amid worries that the volatile
dollar could hit the clothing group's export earnings. The shares have
fallen by 8.9 per cent this week.
ZURICH was subdued as late selling overcame a positive early performance,
and the SMI index gave up 22.4 to 2,608.8, under pressure from a weak
futures market.
Banks remained at the centre of attention as CS Investment Research
recommended the sector following the recent steep share price falls, but
Salomon Brothers revised down its profits forecasts.
UBS bearers fell SFr17 to SFr1,162, against a February high of SFr1,499, and
CS Holding slipped SFr1 to SFr558, compared with the year's peak of SFr765.
TEL AVIV accelerated its rate of decline, the Mishtanim blue chip index
falling a further 4.95 to 159.40 to end the week with a drop of 8.2 per
cent, after a decline of 3.1 per cent in the week before.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Spanish telecoms prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago, the Spanish government brought forward to 1998 plans for
the full liberalisation of the Spanish telecommunications market.
Telefonica, the Spanish operator, has risen by 12 per cent relative to the
Madrid general index over the June quarter.
However, European equities have been weak over the past month, and Spain
weaker, so on Monday Telefonica, at Pta1,730, was down Pta110 since the
beginning of June.
At this point Mr Bill Coleman, telecommunications analyst at James Capel in
London, reiterated his buy recommendation for the stock, saying that it
seems now that liberalisation may proceed even faster than expected in the
spring, with the Spanish government poised to enact new legislation for
mobile telephony and cable television networks this summer. The shares held
at Pta1,770 against a weak market last night.
Mr Coleman thinks that Telefonica is also set to form an alliance with
Unisource, the Dutch/Swedish/Swiss joint venture, by taking an equity stake
in the latter, which may take a reciprocal shareholding in Internacional.
'In turn,' he says, 'the Spanish government is likely to dispose of its 23.8
per cent stake in Telefonica Internacional by the end of the year, and pave
the way for a possible spin-off of Telefonica's cellular radio activities.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei unperturbed by
Socialist premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equities moved higher on expectations that the country's overall policies
would remain unchanged in spite of the appointment of the first Socialist
prime minister for 47 years, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 162.93 firmer at 20,643.93, after declining to
a day's low of 20,246.45 during the first half-hour of trading on
index-linked selling, prompted by Wednesday's fall on the Chicago futures
market. Later buying by public funds and dealers lifted the index to the
sess-ion's peak of 20,684.14 in the afternoon.
Worries about the new government receded as important posts such as the
finance minister and the trade minister were filled by Liberal Democrats or
former Liberal Democratic Party members.
Investors were also encouraged by hopes that the new government would be
more fiscally expansionist - the socialists have been advocating income tax
cuts without a rise in consumption taxes.
Meanwhile, speculation that Y440bn in public pension funds was likely to be
allocated to the stock market also triggered buying.
Volume amounted to 440m shares, against 315m. 'We were afraid that foreign
investors would turn sellers, but they ended up net buyers, and that
encouraged sentiment,' said one Japanese broker.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.70 to 1,673.32, while the
Nikkei 300 put on 1.16 at 304.62. Advances led falls by 626 to 381, with 169
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.33 to
1,358.42.
High-technology issues continued to be sought, Oki Electric climbing Y14 to
Y794. Companies linked to the portable telephone market theme were also
strong, with Nitsuko, a telecom equipment maker, adding Y90 at Y1,530 and
Ushio Y20 at Y1,170. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved ahead Y17,000 to
Y875,000.
However, DDI, a long distance telephone operator, which had surged earlier
this week on the same theme, met profit-taking and retreated Y110,000 to
Y9.42m, while Kyocera, its leading shareholder, shed Y80 to Y7,370.
Profit-taking also depressed some large-capital stocks. Nippon Steel dipped
Y9 to Y344, but Mitsubishi Heavy Industries put on Y2 at Y789 and Kawasaki
Steel Y4 at Y418.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 58.63 to 23,092.26 in volume of 20.5m shares.
Murata Manufacturing, the day's most active issue, fell Y50 to Y4,640, while
Nintendo, the video game maker, appreciated Y90 to Y7,140.
Roundup
The region's markets moved on a range of individual stories.
HONG KONG appeared to take the Legislative Council's approval of Governor
Chris Patten's controversial proposals for political reform in its stride,
said Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel. It was, however, heartened by news
of a settlement of the long Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's military
sites.
The Hang Seng index finished 118.10, or 1.4 per cent, higher at 8,758.41,
but was off the day's best of 8,843.68.
Some Japanese demand was noted, but turnover of around HKDollars 3.20bn was
on the low side.
Finance issues were actively traded. HSBC Holdings rose HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 84.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 52.
KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed after a further day of unexceptional trading, with
some blue-chip buying linked to year-end book closures again supporting the
composite index, which gained 1.47 at 1,011.58.
Volume of 110m shares was inflated by 16m shares traded in Damansara Realty,
which continued to be driven by rumours of an asset injection. The stock
climbed to a high of MDollars 2.38 before closing 2 cents easier on the day
at MDollars 2.28.
TAIPEI saw outperformance in the cement sector, up 1.3 per cent, as the
weighted index ended the session off 0.55 at 5,932.60. Turnover fell to
TDollars 38.82bn from TDollars 41.23bn.
Petrochemicals continued to be sought following recent price rises: China
Petrochemical added 70 cents at TDollars 28.70 and Union Petrochemical
TDollars 1.30 at TDollars 46.10.
MANILA rose on a technical rebound helped by a good overnight gain in PLDT
in New York. The composite index improved 14.87 to 2,746.36 in turnover of
936.2m pesos.
PLDT advanced 15 pesos to 1,670 pesos after rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars
60 1/2 in the US.
Brokers commented that many investors were taking positions ahead of the
listing next month of Petron, the Philippines' biggest oil refiner.
SYDNEY remained firm in spite of a bigger than expected rise in building
approvals and a widening of the current account deficit which triggered a
sell-off in bonds. The All Ordinaries index moved forward 14.0 to 1,989.1.
Turnover came to ADollars 452m.
The latest economic data raised expectations that interest rates might have
to be lifted in the near future.
Foster's Brewing was the day's most active issue on rumours that BHP could
be selling its stake to Philip Morris. Foster's ended unchanged at ADollars
1.06, Philip Morris was untraded, and BHP, which publishes its annual
results today, was up 14 cents at ADollars 18.00.
SINGAPORE was mixed, although the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.50
to 2,224.91, supported by renewed demand for some recently neglected stocks.
SEOUL was flat, with persistent consolidation of blue chips keeping pace
with selective gains. The composite stock index eased 0.60 to 933.36.
WELLINGTON was higher ahead of the budget announcement, which came after the
close of trading. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 14.61 at 1,996.88 in
turnover of NZDollars 41m.
Telecom led the risers, firming 8 cents to NZDollars 4.53.
KARACHI encountered institutional support on the first day of the new
account. The KSE index moved up 3.72 to 2,333.02, but overall losers led
gainers by 171 to 140.
BOMBAY was depressed by selling across a broad front on the last day of the
account in specified and cash shares.
The BSE 30-share index finished 53.53 down at 4,086.72 in a continuation of
the correction seen since the market hit a 26-month high on June 20.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar touches new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar touched another new low against the yen yesterday, but there was
still no indication of central bank intervention to support the currency,
writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar closed in London at Y98.645, from Y98.675 on Wednesday, but was
higher against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.5915 from DM1.5825. New York
trading ended with the US currency weaker at Y98.465 and DM1.5872.
Analysts said the market was willing to probe the downside against the yen
in the absence of co-ordinated intervention and policy change.
Although the market is focusing its attention on next week's Federal Open
Markets Committee meeting, it seems confident of probing the downside in the
meantime.
Sterling closed mildly firmer at DM2.4564 from DM2.4482. Against the dollar
it finished at Dollars 1.5435 from Dollars 1.547.
In Europe the Italian lira and French franc weakened against the D-Mark. The
Bank of France reduced its intervention rate to 5.1 per cent from 5.2 per
cent.
The dollar kicked off the day firmer on vague reports of US and German
monetary authorities co-operating more closely.
Also offering cheer to the market were comments from Mr Tomiichi Murayama,
the new Japanese prime minister, to a local newspaper, that he would want to
see 'as much international co-operation as possible' with regard to the
rising yen. In contrast, however, Mr Robert Rubin, an adviser to President
Clinton, said there would be no special dollar discussion at G7.
Analysts said investors wishing to push the dollar lower were also selling
the D-Mark against the yen as a safer route than direct sales of the dollar,
against the yen or the D-Mark.
The D-Mark ended in London at Y61.97, down from Y62.34 on Wednesday.
There was little response to various second line US data released, which
matched market expectations.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist at Citibank in London, said the problem the
central banks faced in supporting the dollar was the lack of short dollar
positions against the yen. This made it more difficult for intervention to
be effective.
Aggravating matters is the political situation in Japan. Mr Gerard Lyons,
chief economist at DKB International in London, said the appointment of
Socialist party leader Mr Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister had mixed
implications for the yen. On the one hand, the fact that there was no longer
a political vacuum in Japan improved the likelihood of progress in the trade
talks with the US.
On the other, the Socialists' opposition to consumption taxes diminished the
likelihood of cuts in personal taxes which the market is hoping for.
Mr Lyons predicted that the dollar would continue to weaken until there was
evidence of portfolio funds flowing in to buy US assets. The trigger, he
said, would be a dampening of US inflation expectations, which would
probably arrive with evidence of a slowing in US economic growth, and
evidence that the Fed had achieved a neutral monetary policy stance.
The outlook for the dollar is also gloomy from a technical perspective. Mr
Brian Marber, an independent analyst, said he had 'no doubt that the dollar
is still headed much lower'. He said that if the dollar finished below Y100
for a third day, this would show that Y100 had given way. Having been
bullish of the dollar, this would leave him 'firmly bearish'.
In Europe the Italian lira had another difficult day, closing at L994.7/DM
from L990.6. Analysts said the currency suffered from the sell-off in
Italian bonds. Markets remain worried about whether the government has the
will to deal with Italy's large budget deficit.
Concerns were also fanned by evidence of a possible conflict between the
president and prime minister over the running of the state broadcaster.
The French franc finished unchanged at FFr3.43 to the D-Mark following the
cut in interest rates. This was a solid performance, considering that it
coincided with figures showing unemployment - a highly sensitive political
issue - had risen to 12.7 per cent in May.
Mr MacKinnon said monetary policy in France remained too tight - money
supply growth is currently negative - for this stage of the cycle. But he
added: 'Betting against the French franc has not been a profitable trade.'
Traders in the futures market said the mood had been skittish, with the
pattern of trade again set at the longer end of the market.
The June UK purchasing managers index, which rose to a record 61.4 per cent,
and revealed signs of inflation, had a negative impact on short sterling.
The December contract closed six basis points lower at 93.71.
The Bank of England provided late assistance to the UK money market of
Pounds 300m. Earlier it had supplied liquidity of Pounds 197m after
forecasting a shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight money traded from 4 to 6
3/4 per cent.
In Germany, call money again traded at the 6 per cent Lombard level as banks
struggled to meet their monthly reserve requirements.

gold deposits

<TEXT>
The rights to the vast Peruvian alluvial gold deposits known as San Antonio
de Poto were successfully auctioned in Lima this week.
Vegsa-Andes Corporation, a Peruvian consortium, outbid rival Brazilian and
Colombian mining concerns with an offer exceeding Dollars 8.5m for the two
deposits and the fixed assets.
With the sale, handled by Morgan Grenfell, the Peruvian state rids itself of
a huge but low-grade goldfield that it has never been capable of developing.
The deposits, located on an inhospitable plateau some 5,000 metres above sea
level, have been virtually abandoned for 20 years.
Vegsa-Andes says it will commence dredging operations almost immediately,
moving 1.5m tonnes of gold-bearing soil next year and 5.4m tonnes in 1996.
The company will pay the Peruvian state royalties on all gold extracted
varying between 2 and 10 per cent according to fluctuations in the
international gold price.
Revenue from royalties is expected to total about Dollars 2m a year.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growers seen as unlikely to
gain from coffee surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COLOGNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Smallholder farmers were unlikely to benefit from the explosive price rise
in coffee futures this week, TransFair, a foundation securing Third World
growers prices above world market levels said, reports Reuter from Cologne.
'Wholesalers continue to buy coffee from the small farms at the old
rock-bottom prices,' claimed managing director Mr Dieter Overath.
'Farmers in countries such as Guatemala and Mexico don't even know of the
Brazil frosts and the price rallies.' German consumers should therefore not
assume that higher retail prices meant the Third World was doing any better.
TransFair works through some 20 licensed roasters who have launched their
own Third World brans, charging the consumer Dm2 to Dm3 (80p to 122p) per
500 grammes than ordinary brands cost.
When the New York price is below 165 cents a pound the difference between
this level and world market prices is passed on to approved businesses.
Nearby New York coffee futures were close to 190 cents a pound yesterday,
but distant positions were closer to 160 cents.
TransFair pays the extra sums to family businesses, co-operatives and
infrastructure projects in coffee growing regions.
It said its system was securing the long term survival of the coffee trade
by offering long-term contracts and forward credits of up to 60 per cent of
sales values.
TransFair has a less than 1 per cent share of the German coffee market but
expects further growth from public sector catering institutions.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand to drop Woolmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New Zealand Wool Board will shortly cease to use the Woolmark brand name
for much of the country's wool production, it announced this week. This
follows its decision to take over the interior wools division of the
International Wool Secretariat.
In future the wool, most of which will end up as carpet, curtaining, bedding
or upholstery fabrics, will be sold under the name Wools of New Zealand,
with a new registered trade mark of a stylised black and white fern. This
will be marketed internationally by the 75 IWS staff, based in offices in
London, Brussels, Beijing and elsewhere, who join the wool board when the
take-over becomes effective today.
The chairman, Mr Pat Morrison, said that the move was being made because New
Zealand was the major producer of interior wools, and wanted a direct
involvement in its production.
New Zealand will remain a member of the IWS, as will the other original
partners - Australia and South Africa - and continue to contribute towards
the cost of promoting apparel products. However, these account for only 20
per cent of New Zealand's wool production.
As part of the change the board will also change its operational name to
Wools of New Zealand, although Mr Morrison emphasised that its role as a
producer owned co-operative of farmers would remain. He said the change in
name was to help ease misconceptions that the board was
government-controlled.
The new identity is part of sweeping changes which include the board
requesting the government to legislate away a number of regulatory
functions, such as the ability to purchase the entire wool clip in troubled
times.
Mr Morrison said that the board had never wanted to exercise these powers.
In future it will concentrate on research, product development and
promotion.
Welcoming the change of name, Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture,
said at a parliamentary function that for many years, through its levy to
the IWS, the board had funded the promotion of wools produced by other
countries. 'Now New Zealand farmers are directly funding the development of
their own wool,' he said. 'That is the way it should be.'
Mr Morrison said that at one time New Zealand carpet wools dominated the
world trade, holding some 70 per cent of the market. But its share had
dropped to 30 per cent.

Heavy offerings in the final week of the 1993/94 selling season in Australia
made little difference to price levels. The market indicator finished at 624
cents a kg., only 3 cents down on the week. Competition at auctions was
good, with China prominent, which is always seen as a strengthening factor.
The season also ended in New Zealand with prices firm. The British wool
selling season opened this week and firmer prices were correctly anticipated
by the trade, though increases only amounted to one or two per cent and are
not universal. Holidays are already an important factor keeping trade quit
and their influence will increase and persist for the next two months. The
UK wool-processing industry is busy but would be a lot happier if higher
wool prices were accepted and passed on by retailers who continue to resist
them.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME base metals prices move higher
 -Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices moved higher yesterday afternoon on the London Metal
Exchange and, although there was some late profit-taking, all markets
finished in the plus column with most set for further gains, dealers said.
'COPPER and ALUMINIUM found the going heavy at the highs, but are still
looking good. They had the reactions earlier this week, and (three months
delivery) aluminium should get above Dollars 1,500 (a tonne),' one said. The
aluminium price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,497.50 a tonne, up Dollars
18.75 on the day, but ended the after hours session at Dollars 1,489.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ended modestly firmer after a
roller-coaster session that saw them test the downside after touching fresh
7 1/2 -year highs in early trading. The September futures position closed
Dollars 25 up at Dollars 3,128 a tonne. 'We came back up on New York's
regained strength,' said one trader.
The market mood remained fundamentally very bullish and further gains were
likely, others said, noting it was 'just the start of the frost period' in
the southern hemisphere.

Australian beef exports to North Asia could almost double over the next four
years, as a result of trade liberalisation, the government-owned Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, forecast this week.
Abare suggested that exports to Japan and South Korea could rise to 580,000
tonnes in 1998-99, from 344,000 tonnes in 1992-93.
The increased exports should underpin prices and could take the cattle herd
and beef production back to the record levels seen in the 1970s, the
forecaster suggested.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further doubt cast on Russian
diamond deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The top official in Russia's diamond industry has again cast doubt on the
future agreement with the De Beers diamond monopoly - saying that Russia
gets prices up to 35 per cent higher for the 5 per cent of its production it
is allowed to sell outside its agreement with De Beers, the south African
group that, through its London-based Central Selling Organisation, controls
at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds.
Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of the state committee on precious metals and
stones, was speaking before the expected resumption of talks with De Beers
in the middle of this month. The two sides talked in June, but were unable
to settle any of the outstanding issues between them.
Exports of rough diamonds - handled by De Beers - brought in Dollars 1.3bn
last year, said Mr Bychkov, while exports cut stones yielded Dollars 680m.
Nearly all of this production came from the republic of Yakutia, with the
Urals, the only other diamond producing region, accounting for no more than
100,000 carats.
Mr Bychkov added: 'Talk of the collapse of the Russian gold industry is very
much exaggerated', pointing to an increased production estimates for this
year of 150 tonnes, compared with 146.8 tonnes last in 1993. Some 30 to 35
per cent of the gold produced in Russia was exported, he said.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc producers conspire in
their own downfall - An opportunity for a return to profitability has been
missed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS BAAK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some years ago the chief executive of a major European metals group
delivered a speech on the future of the European zinc industry. To make his
point he compared the decision makers in the industry with the heroes of
ancient Greek plays - who acted in ways that inevitably led to their
destruction.
In the end that chief executive proved a perfect example of his own analogy.
There is no predetermination, however, that the European zinc industry shall
always be a loss-maker. Its failures have been caused by wrong decisions -
repeated over and over again.
The present situation has been exacerbated, of course, both by the
unforeseeable rise in metal supplies from the former eastern bloc countries
and by the adverse business cycle. But it is not the first time that the
European zinc industry has found itself in turmoil; low profitability has
been its main feature for decades.
Zinc production is characterised by high fixed costs, stemming from high
capital intensity and the structure of power supply contracts, which
sacrifice intake flexibility for low power tariffs.
The European zinc producers, who are at a comparative cost-disadvantage,
have always seen only one way to stay competitive - spreading fixed costs by
expanding capacity. What makes sense for an individual producer does not,
however, work in the interest the whole industry. It inevitably results in
oversupply. No wonder that western Europe, a high-cost region, is punished
by the lowest zinc prices.
Several attempts have been made to remedy the situation by concerted action
of producers and the European Commission. The last attempt to negotiate a
'shut-down agreement' failed some months ago. It was aimed at facilitating
the closure of unprofitable capacity by raising money from the whole
industry in order to get a balanced European zinc market. The high cost of
closing a plant in Europe is the main barrier to withdrawing from the market
place.
This exit barrier would have been lowered by the financial scheme of the
shut down agreement. It failed mainly because the financial weakness of some
of the participants encouraged others to believe that plants would be shut
in any case, without the need for an injection of their money.
They hoped, in other words, that market forces would solve the problem for
them. But market forces have not worked in the European zinc industry for
more than 20 years. Why should they work now?
Cash-strapped companies are in no position to bear the high expenses of
plant closures. In the short run at least, it costs less to keep even an
unprofitable operation open.
The withdrawal of the stronger market players from the shut-down agreement
has backfired, as market developments prove.
Experience in the aluminium sector shows that an agreement to cut capacities
can easily boost prices by Dollars 200 a tonne. On top of that the zinc
smelters would have been able to negotiate higher treatment charges, which
dropped by around Dollars 40 per tonne of concentrate from 1993 to 1994. In
addition removing oversupply from the European market would put the European
producers into a position to earn premiums over metal from their competitors
in other areas of the world.
It is not expecting too much, moreover, to presume that others, especially
the Japanese producers, would follow the European lead in closing down
production.
The damage to the income of the zinc industry as a consequence of the
failure of the shut-down agreement adds up to enormous numbers. A loss of
revenue of Dollars 100 a tonne for the smelters may be a conservative
estimate - it could well be double that amount. Taking Dollars 150 a tonne
as a basis for calculation it amounts to a Dollars 15m annual loss for a
100,000-tonnes-a-year operation.
Calculating the net present value for 5 years, which is not unreasonable as
a shut down has a lasting effect, the result would be Dollars 57m assuming a
10 per cent discount rate. In fact the European zinc smelters could only
dream of a 10 per cent profit rate over a five-year period. Therefore a
discount rate of zero seems more appropriate.
For the 2m-tonnes-a-year zinc industry in western Europe the loss from not
acting in a sensible manner amounts to between Dollars 1.14bn and Dollars
1.5bn - an amount from which compensation for the cost of closures could
easily have been provided.
Thomas Baak, now a consultant, is a former chief economist of
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals group.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Inflation fears drive long-dated
Treasuries lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated Treasury bonds moved sharply lower yesterday as a regional
survey of business conditions suggested mounting inflationary pressures.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 1/8 at
84 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.615 per cent, its highest level since
early May. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/8 at 99 21/32 , to
yield 6.169 per cent.
The market was forced to digest a batch of fresh economic news on a thin
trading day. It not only was the last session before the end of the second
quarter, but it fell a day before the official start of the long
Independence Day weekend. Many traders were already on holiday, while others
were waiting to see if next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making arm would result in the year's fifth increase in short-term
interest rates.
The data did not go down easily. The Purchasing Management Association of
Chicago said its June index of prices paid by manufacturers was well up at
69.7 per cent, against 63.6 per cent the previous month.
The jump, combined with a moderate gain in the employment index, stirred the
market's ever-present fear of inflation, which erodes the value of
fixed-rate investment. The Chicago survey often provides a preview of the
national purchasing management report, due out today.
Offsetting the bad news on prices, the Chicago index of overall business
activity showed a modest decline in May, and initial claims for unemployment
benefit last week were unchanged.
But there was another indication that the economy was continuing to
accelerate. The Commerce Department said that new factory orders in May had
climbed 0.6 per cent, their third consecutive monthly increase.
The net impact of the morning's releases was to drive down bond prices
across the board, though the long end, which is most vulnerable to
inflation, was hit the hardest. The extent of the downturn was exaggerated
by the light activity.
European government bonds fell back sharply in busy futures-driven trade.
Markets were unnerved by the weakness in US Treasuries, the poor response to
the Bank of England's tap offer of tranches of conventional gilts, strong UK
economic data and by aggressive selling of French bonds. 'There was no
single catalyst for the decline, it was rather that the more positive tone
of recent days has faded,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at
Merrill Lynch.
UK government bonds dropped sharply through key psychological levels,
dragged down by fears of rising inflation and by the lack of enthusiasm for
the Bank of England's offer of Pounds 500m worth of tranches of conventional
gilts.
Encouraged by the success of its auction of floating-rate gilts on
Wednesday, 'the Bank thought this was a good time to tap the market further,
and in particular to tap the long-dated market', said Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief
economist at Daiwa Europe.
But although one tranche - a Pounds 150m tap offer of 7 per cent gilt
Treasury stock due 2001 - was quickly exhausted, there was less enthusiasm
for other tranches.
Inflation fears were triggered by the UK purchasing managers' index for
June, which showed a sharp rise in manufacturing activity and strong price
pressures.
The September long gilt future on Liffe was down 2 1/8 at 99 17/32 points in
late trading.
Italian government bonds, hit particularly badly by the renewed pessimism in
Europe, suffered further from weakness in the lire and concern about the
size of the budget deficit.
Investors were unnerved by a warning from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development that decisive action to limit the budget
deficit should not be delayed and by a rise in the minimum rate at the Bank
of Italy's repurchase tender to 8 per cent from 7.85 per cent. The Italian
September BTP futures contract on Liffe was down 2.5 points at 102.70 in
late trading.
A cut of 10 basis points in the Bank of France's intervention rate to 5.1
per cent failed to halt the decline in French government bonds.
The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at
115.26, down 1.24 points on the day.
German government bonds also fell. The German September government bond
contract on Liffe was down 1.03 points at 91.61 in late trading.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P ratings set to reflect
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, plans to introduce a new
type of rating designed to alert investors to the risks, other than credit
risk, involved in structured products such as those with embedded
derivatives.
'During the 1980s, the most significant risk was credit risk; during the
1990s it is still important, but it is becoming overshadowed by the
repayment risk from derivatives embedded in bond issues,' said Mr Leo
O'Neill, S&amp;P's president. 'To continue just to apply credit ratings would
not be alerting investors to other risks.' he added.
In the first phase, S&amp;P will add an 'r' to existing bond ratings - for
example, a bond could be rated AAAr, instead of AAA.
At a later stage, the agency plans to attempt to quantify the nature of that
risk by indicating a high, medium or low level of risk.
Securities which would be likely to merit an 'r' rating include
interest-only and principal-only mortgage securities, because of the risk of
pre-payment; structured notes, with interest repayments derived from swaps
which could terminate at any time; and notes with redemption linked to an
index which could go up or down.
'If these ratings stimulate greater discussion between investors and their
advisers, we will have done our job,' said Mr Hendrik Kranenburg, executive
managing director of S&amp;P.
S&amp;P is setting up a comprehensive database of all such outstanding
securities. The new service is expected to be launched later this month.
The move reflects growing concern over the new risks created by the rapid
expansion of the derivatives market, and is one of a number of efforts to
take account of the resulting changes in the international financial
markets.
In May, Moody's rating agency started assigning specific ratings to
institutions, based on their creditworthiness as counterparties in the
derivatives market.
Those ratings are designed to provide 'a more accurate system for
derivatives claims ratings' which apply specifically to the financial
capacity of individual obligors to meet their contracts, said Mr John Kriz,
managing director of Moody's.
Mr Kriz warned that bond and deposit ratings may not accurately reflect an
obligor's creditworthiness from a derivatives claim perspective.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Italy plans Dollars 4bn global
floating-rate note offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy yesterday announced that it planned to launch an ambitious Dollars 4bn
global offering of multi-currency floating-rate notes, an unusual structure
designed to capitalise on broad demand for floating-rate paper in the
current bear market.
The notes will all have a maturity of five years, and will pay the same
margin over the London interbank offered rate, though they may not have the
same issue price, according to global co-ordinator Merrill Lynch. This is
designed to allow investors to switch between different tranches. The size
of the tranches will be set according to demand.
The pricing of the tranches has not yet been decided, but dealers said
yesterday that a discounted margin of around 10 basis points over Libor is
likely, the same as for Portugal's D-Mark offering earlier this week,
according to traders. The Italy transaction is expected to be launched in
mid-July.
While the unusual structure - it is the first global multi-currency offering
 -may help attract investor interest, there could also be some drawbacks.
'It's a lot of money to raise in a difficult market and the deals will
potentially compete with each other,' said one trader.
The initial response suggested that demand for the yen tranche will be the
strongest, due to lack of supply in that sector. 'I think the problem with
the yen tranche will be one of rationing rather than selling,' said one
underwriter involved in the transaction. The yen FRN market is currently
underdeveloped, but the Japanese domestic market for floating rate
instruments has recently been deregulated, encouraging a number of issues.
However, liquid yen-denominated FRNs are still 'a very rare animal' in Tokyo
and London, one dealer said.
However, some dealers said that both the dollar and D-Mark FRN sectors
appear to be afflicted by oversupply.
In the fixed-rate dollar market, General Electric Capital Corporation
launched its second recent retail-targetted offering, a Dollars 150m
three-year deal arranged by BZW. The deal was priced to yield 10 basis
points over the comparable US Treasury.
In the sterling market, Gracechurch Mortgage Finance launched a Pounds 300m
issue of securities backed by Barclays mortgages on residential properties
in England, the bank's third mortgage securitisation. The notes are priced
to offer a discounted margin of 23 basis points over Libor, assuming an
expected average life of 3.8 years. The pricing reflects the tightening of
margins on mortgage-backed paper in the sterling sector this year, according
to lead manager BZW.
The second securitisation of residential mortgages in France, a FFr2bn
offering for Titrimmo 06 94, backed by Credit Lyonnais mortgages, has been
completed. The deal was guaranteed by MBIA Assurance.

executive from rival
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano, the Spanish bank suffering from weak profits, has
hired Mr Angel Corcostegui, a former top executive at rival Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya (BBV), as its chief executive.
Mr Corcostegui was a BBV board member and the managing director of its
capital markets and international banking division. His move represents an
unprecedented upheaval in the top echelons of Spanish banking.
Banco Central said the move had the consent of BBV and was in a 'spirit of
collaboration' between the two institutions.
Earlier this year chairman Mr Jose Maria Amusategui pruned the Banco Central
board from 39 to 28 members and disclosed that he was seeking a new chief
executive.
The decision to bring in an outsider has avoided a choice between senior
executives of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano, the two institutions
which merged in 1991 to create Banco Central Hispano.
Analysts in Madrid said that Mr Corcostegui had recently been under pressure
at BBV because the large government debt positions built up this year could
have a potentially negative implication for the bank's results.
As Banco Central chief executive, Mr Corcostegui faces the challenge of
increasing earnings from the bank's extensive retail network and of
overseeing a strategy to pare its industrial portfolio. First-quarter
results were disappointing, with an 11.8 per cent fall in attributable net
profit. Banco Central expects to post flat profits this year.
In recent months Banco Central's image has been severely dented by
international rating agencies.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canada dials up long-distance
network price war - Deregulation is shaking up the telecoms market and
squeezing local services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A seemingly insignificant change in the way Canadians make their
long-distance calls, which takes effect today, could prove to be the key
which opens the country's entire telephone network to competition.
Since regulators cleared the way in 1992 for competition in the
long-distance market, any telephone user seeking an alternative to Stentor,
the firmly-entrenched consortium of local phone companies, has had to dial
an access code of up to 17 digits.
Stentor's fledgling rivals have blamed this finger-numbing exercise for the
consortium's continued domination of the long-distance market, where it
still enjoys a 92 per cent share.
From today, however, the local companies must give their competitors equal
access to the long-distance network. Whichever service subscribers choose to
use, they will simply dial the prefix '1' for a long-distance call.
The change has been accompanied by a blizzard of advertising and a
bewildering variety of cut-price offers, reflecting the newcomers' view that
equal access is their opportunity for a breakthrough.
Today's changes mean that 'at least at the consumer level, the playing field
gets somewhere near to being level', says Mr George Harvey, chief executive
of Unitel, the biggest of Stentor's new rivals, which is 20 per cent-owned
by the AT&amp;T of the US. Unitel predicts its share of the long-distance voice
market will climb over the next two to three years, from between 4 and 5 per
cent to 15 per cent.
Bell Canada, the biggest Stentor partner, which provides local services in
Ontario and Quebec, acknowledges it could lose at least 20 per cent of its
market share by the end of this year.
However, many of the new arrivals are not expected to survive a ferocious
price war. There have already been some acquisitions and mergers among the
dozens of resellers which lease lines in bulk from the telephone companies
and then offer cut-rate services to subscribers.
Stentor and its members have responded far more vigorously to the threat of
competition than AT&amp;T did when its hammerlock in the US was broken a decade
ago.
Bell Canada has not only cut its basic long-distance rates by 30 per cent
since 1987, but also offers a host of special deals to frequent users.
Business customers can get discounts of up to 60 per cent. The phone
companies also have the advantage of being able to track every subscriber's
calling patterns.
The long-distance price war is bound to have ripple effects in the local
market. Stentor's members have traditionally used the rich pickings from
their long-distance monopoly to subsidise local services.
A Toronto household pays a basic telephone service fee of only CDollars
16.57 a month. All local calls are free. The Canadian Radio-television and
Tele-communications Commission (CRTC), which regulates telephone services,
rejected an application by Bell Canada last year to raise basic-service
rates.
Long-distance services generated CDollars 6.4bn (USDollars 4.6bn) in
revenues last year. Bell estimates that 15 cents a minute of its revenues,
or a total of CDollars 1.7bn in 1993, is channelled into local services. The
cross-subsidy in the US is only about 3 cents.
The telecoms have so far managed to boost local revenues by selling a
plethora of high-margin optional features, ranging from phones which display
the origin of an incoming call, to beeps which alert a caller to another
call on the line.
This business is unlikely, however, to compensate for the diminishing
cross-subsidy from long-distance services.
'There is a pressing need to move towards local rates which more closely
reflect their underlying costs,' says Mr Richard French, Bell's
vice-president for corporate development. 'The long-distance market can no
longer sustain the levels of contribution required to support basic
service.'
This argument is reinforced by growing competition from wireless phone
services, as well as the impending entry of cable-TV companies into the
local phone business.
It is the cable operators who have the potential to threaten the telephone
companies. Cable service is already available to 95 per cent of Canadian
homes, the highest penetration in the world. Holding prices for local
services far below cost is a disincentive for cable companies to enter the
local market.
Bell will introduce an important local-service reform in 1996 by shifting
business subscribers from a flat rate to volume-based pricing. It maintains
that four-fifths of its customers will see either no change or a reduction
in their phone bills. For the remaining 20 per cent of high-volume users,
however, charges will rise.
Stentor's long-distance rivals will not escape the debate on local-service
pricing. They currently pay a fee, set by the CRTC, for connections from the
local networks.
The phone companies earlier this year asked the CRTC to allow them to
'unbundle' the components required for equal access, with a separate charge
applied to each one.
The aim is clearly to make competitors pay more for the use of their
facilities. Unitel, however, questions Stentor's cost-allocation methods,
and is equally hopeful the CRTC will sanction a reduction in fees.
The commission is expected to rule on the request this autumn, shortly after
it releases a separate report on the regulatory framework for the
telecommunications industry. Whatever the CRTC's conclusions, nobody doubts
today's change in long-distance dialling is merely part of a much wider
shake-up in Canada's entire telephone system over the next few years.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y's US arm agrees Dollars 1bn
debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US arm of property group Olympia &amp; York said it had reached agreement in
principle to restructure nearly Dollars 1bn of its debt, in the first leg of
a planned overhaul of total debts of Dollars 5bn.
Under the deal, O&amp;Y (USA) will sell one building but retain its equity
interest in two others. Since the collapse of its Canadian parent in 1992,
the US company has been fighting to stay out of bankruptcy court while
retaining control of its 11 New York office properties, among them the
prestigious World Financial Centre.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, O&amp;Y (USA) said it would sell a
mainly vacant building on Broadway and use the cash to renovate and maintain
two others, on Park Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The company will also
pay only a proportion of the interest on newly-issued bonds, and forego its
own right to cash interest payments.
By strengthening the cashflow on the remaining two buildings, these
arrangements should benefit holders of the Dollars 970m of debt subject to
the restructuring.
These include Apollo Real Estate Advisers, an investment fund run by Mr Leon
Black, a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
He has been a steady buyer of bank debt in other O&amp;Y (USA) properties this
year, leaving him in a strong position in any restructuring of those
buildings.
O&amp;Y (USA) said the agreement had been reached with holders of more than 60
per cent of the Dollars 970m of floating-rate notes secured on the
buildings, among them Apollo.
The deal is still subject to approval by other noteholders and investors
with a minority equity interest in the buildings, among others. Under the
plan, the noteholders would exchange their floating-rate notes for six-year,
fixed-rate bonds.

<TEXT>
The South Australian government has launched a claim seeking almost ADollars
3.1bn (USDollars 2.3bn) from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The claim
relates to the financial troubles of the State Bank of South Australia in
1991.
KPMG Peat Marwick acted as auditor of the bank in 1991, before the South
Australian government was forced to mount a rescue operation ultimately
costing more than ADollars 3.15bn.
The claim, one of the largest of its type in Australia, was lodged yesterday
in the Supreme Court of South Australia. It follows a ADollars 1.1bn claim
against KPMG Peat Marwick earlier this year from the Victorian government
over the collapse of the Tricontinental finance group in 1990. That action
was settled for ADollars 136m.

A second Chinese company is to list on the Australian Stock Exchange next

The new company is Canada Land, a Hong Kong-incorporated group which is
developing property in Guangzhou. It plans to issue 25m shares at ADollars
0.35 each, and says that money raised will provide additional working
capital.
It has four development projects - comprising a mixture of residential and
office properties - under way in the southern Chinese city. Completion dates
range from 1994 to 2000 for the final phases of the FangCun Metro Station
West.
Most of the projects are being developed by joint venture companies

Harcourt businesses

<TEXT>
One week after withdrawing its Dollars 2.2bn bid for US insurance and fund
management group Kemper, GE Capital announced it is to pay Dollars 400m cash
for the insurance business of Harcourt General.
The financial services arm of General Electric will acquire three life
insurance companies owned by Harcourt which between them have assets of
Dollars 3bn and generated revenues in the year to last October of Dollars
550m.
The proceeds of the sale, which amount to Dollars 375m after tax, will boost
Harcourt's war chest for future takeovers. Mr Robert Tarr, chief executive,
said the company now had cash balances of Dollars 800m and 'continued to
look for acquisition opportunities'.
Harcourt announced in February that it was planning to sell the companies in
order to concentrate on its publishing and specialty retailing businesses.
It had acquired the three - Federal Home Life, PHF Life and Harvest Life -
as part of the acquisition of the publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in
1991.
GE Capital said it would operate the companies as part of GNA, its existing
insurance business. The companies underwrite individual life, health,
accident and credit insurance, and sell annuity products.
GE Capital dropped its bid for Kemper last week after its offer was topped
by Conseco, another insurance group.
GE Capital and GTE said the GTE Spacenet satellite communications business
would be acquired by GE American Communications, a GE Capital company,
Reuter adds from Stamford, Connecticut. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Anglovaal's global issue oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first international equity offering for a South African company since
the recent elections - Dollars 68m of N shares for Anglovaal - was three
times oversubscribed.
S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank which was bookrunner for the
underwriting group, described it as 'a landmark issue that bodes well for
South Africa's future in the international capital markets'.
Mr Basil Hersov, chairman of Anglovaal, a diversified industrial and mining
group, said the placing 'has shown that premier institutions in Europe and
the US are not just interested in learning more about the South Africa story
but are also willing to take the step to invest'. About half the demand for
shares came from the US.
The Anglovaal shares, to be listed in South Africa and London, were priced
at Dollars 27.33 each share or American depositary receipt, which, when
translated at the rand exchange rate at the time of pricing, represented
R129. This compared with a closing bid price on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange of R130.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Trump project boosts New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The struggling economy of New York City was yesterday given a significant
boost when Mr Donald Trump, the property developer and casino operator,
announced the go-ahead for a Dollars 2bn project on Manhattan's largest
undeveloped site.
The Riverside South project, comprising 5,700 apartments, 1.8m sq ft of
office space, 350,000 sq ft of retail space and parking for 3,500 cars, will
be built on the 75-acre site of the old Penn Central rail yards on
Manhattan's west side, between 59th and 72nd streets.
Mr Trump acquired the site in 1984 but spent years arguing with community
groups about his development plans. By the time he won approval for the
plans in 1992, his property and casino empire was on the brink of bankruptcy
and he no longer had the money to proceed.
Yesterday the money became available, when Mr Trump signed a joint venture
agreement with a consortium of Asian investors led by two of Hong Kong's
biggest property developers, the New World Development Company and the Shui
On Group.
The consortium has undertaken to fund the development of the site over the
next six to 10 years in return for a share of the profits.
Mr Henry Cheng, managing director of New World Development, said Mr Trump's
company, The Trump Organisation, was a good strategic partner because
members of the consortium were interested in diversifying their holdings.
'We intend to jointly become a major player in New York's recovering real
estate market,' he said.
Mr Trump paid tribute to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City for helping
the east Asian investors 'feel comfortable' with development issues in New
York.
Mr Giuliani said the project would create thousands of construction jobs,
thousands of permanent jobs, and bring hundreds of millions of dollars in
sales and tax revenues to the city.
The Trump Organisation said the development would also help keep the middle
class and the affluent in Manhattan by offering new, high quality
accommodation. Construction work was expected to begin shortly.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: United Airlines revises offer of
compensation to shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the US carrier days away from putting the world's biggest
employee buy-out to the vote, yesterday announced a last-minute change to
the compensation deal for existing shareholders.
It said it was dipping into company resources and producing another Dollars
300m in cash to replace the proceeds it had hoped to receive from selling a
tranche of preference shares.
Under the deal, to be put to a shareholder vote on July 12, employees will
eventually gain control of United by trading Dollars 4.9bn worth of labour
concessions over the next 12 years for a minimum of 55 per cent of the
company's stock.
Existing shareholders are to be offered a mix of cash and new United shares
for the stock they now hold.
Part of the cash is to be raised through the sale of preferred stock and
loan notes.
Yesterday, however, United acknowledged that it had been unable to sell as
much preferred stock as it had hoped. Merrill Lynch, lead manager, said the
issue had been aimed primarily at retail investors, and there had been
insufficient time to market the whole of it at the target price with the
July 12 deadline looming.
As a result, the contribution coming from United's internal resources will
rise by Dollars 12.20 a share to Dollars 38. Merrill Lynch said using the
company's cash balances was a less expensive alternative to lowering the
price of the preferred stock.
On a positive note, United said it had reached 'a tentative understanding'
to settle shareholder litigation pending in the Delaware Chancery Court
relating to its recapitalisation plan.
It also said that Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent adviser
to institutional investors on proxy voting, corporate governance and other
shareholder issues, had recommended its clients to vote in favour of the
plan.

Vard, the Norwegian cruise group, has completed its asset disposal programme
with the sale of the cruise ship Royal Viking Sun for Dollars 170m to Cunard
of the UK.
The move, which completes Vard's exit from the luxury cruise market, will
improve its balance sheet and liquidity.
Cunard, part of the Trafalgar House group, has also acquired the rights to
the Royal Viking Line name, the RVL logo and rights to use Royal Viking as
the brand name on its vessels.
The disposal will enable Vard's Miami-based subsidiary Kloster Cruise to
boost its position in the premium cruise market by concentrating on its
remaining cruise lines, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Cruise Line.
Mr Bernt Karlsen, president and chief executive of Vard, said the sale price
of the Royal Viking Sun was about 45 per cent above book value and the
disposal would clear a revolving credit facility of Dollars 110m.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Malaysians find gambling the
best bet - Companies are using the sector as a haven from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day an average of 12,000 people crowd into the Genting Highlands
casino complex in the hills above Kuala Lumpur. Some are locals. About 20
per cent have driven up from Singapore. Many have come from as far away as
Taiwan and Indonesia.
Gaming is big business in Malaysia, accounting for as much as 4 per cent of
gross domestic product. Sector turnover in 1993 is estimated at MDollars 4bn
(Dollars 1.55bn), with an additional MDollars 10bn thought to have flowed
through the illegal, unlicensed market.
Some of the country's biggest and most profitable companies derive the bulk
of their revenues from gaming. Gaming related companies account for about 10
per cent of the Kuala Lumpur stock market's total capitalisation.
When the Kuala Lumpur stock market took off last year, gaming related shares
were among the most heavily traded by Malaysia's eager punters, with the
sector rising 180 per cent in the 12 months. Average earnings in the sector
rose by more than 20 per cent in 1993.
Many gaming orientated companies are starting to use their considerable
financial resources to diversify into other areas. Some are going
international.
The Genting group is the largest gaming associated company in Malaysia. It
has plantations and interests in rubber manufacturing, but the bulk of
earnings come from gaming. Last year its profits rose 38 per cent to
MDollars 959m.
The group's separately listed gaming and leisure arm - Resorts World, which
has a casino and entertainment complex outside Kuala Lumpur - is Malaysia's
fourth largest listed company with a market value of nearly MDollars 17bn.
Genting itself ranks number five.
Analysts estimate that Genting now has cash assets of MDollars 1.5bn. 'Its
main problem seems to be searching out investment opportunities and making
its accumulated holdings work,' says a Kuala Lumpur broker. Last year
Genting spent MDollars 150m on a 6 per cent stake in Lonrho, the UK
conglomerate. It is now believed to have sold the majority of that stake.
Genting is controlled by the family of Mr Lim Goh Tong, a Malaysian Chinese
financier. Recently Mr Lim has taken controlling stakes in a MDollars 1bn
paper mill outside Kuala Lumpur and in an adjacent 740MW power plant being
built in partnership with British Gas as part of Malaysia's independent
power producer programme.
The diversification is for both financial and political reasons. Gaming,
although big business in Malaysia, is also an extremely sensitive area of
activity. Malays, who make up about 50 per cent of Malaysia's population,
are Moslems. In Islam, gambling is unlawful. No Malays are allowed to enter
the Genting casino complex. The word gambling is never mentioned in official
company literature.
Genting and other gaming companies are dependent on government goodwill for
their operating licences. Political connections are vital: it is also
important to invest in projects seen as important to Malaysia's overall
economic development.
Tanjong, Magnum and Berjaya are the three other stock market listed
companies which dominate the gaming sector. A total of 1,600 retail outlets
throughout Malaysia deal in variations of the numbers forecasting game, a
form of gambling which came to Malaysia from southern China.
In spite of a recent rise in gaming tax to 7 per cent, gambling still chalks
up big corporate profits. Magnum, the biggest numbers operator with a 40 per

Magnum and Berjaya are venturing into gaming operations overseas, with
limited success. However Berjaya has won lottery management contracts in a
number of Chinese cities. Berjaya has also taken an interest in a casino
operation in Argentina.
Tanjong, listed in both Kuala Lumpur and London, is moving aggressively into
other ventures.
Controlled by Mr Ananda Krishnan, a Malaysian Indian, Tanjong last year
expressed interest in buying William Hill, the UK betting shops chain.
'We are definitely making moves to go international,' says Mr Ralph
Marshall, a senior Tanjong executive. 'William Hill was one of the
opportunities that we looked at.'
Tanjong runs Malaysia's racing tote system. Through Tanjong's part ownership
of the former turf club grounds in central Kuala Lumpur, companies
associated with Mr Ananda are developing a new city centre at a cost of
MDollars 5bn. Other companies associated with Mr Ananda are involved in a
multi-million dollar sat-ellite telecommunications programme.
'There is no better business to be in in Malaysia than gaming, ' says a
Kuala Lumpur industrialist.
'Gambling is the great sport of the Chinese (who make up about 35 per cent
of Malaysia's 19m population) and appears to be recession proof.'

<TEXT>
Vard, the Norwegian cruise group, has completed its asset disposal programme
with the sale of the cruise ship Royal Viking Sun for Dollars 170m to Cunard
of the UK.
The move, which completes Vard's exit from the luxury cruise market, will
improve its balance sheet and liquidity.
Cunard, part of the Trafalgar House group, has also acquired the rights to
the Royal Viking Line name, the RVL logo and rights to use Royal Viking as
the brand name on its vessels.
The disposal will enable Vard's Miami-based subsidiary Kloster Cruise to
boost its position in the premium cruise market by concentrating on its
remaining cruise lines, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Cruise Line. RCL
will take on the Royal Viking Queen cruise ship from RVL.
Mr Bernt Karlsen, president and chief executive of Vard, said the sale price
of the Royal Viking Sun was about 45 per cent above book value and the
disposal would clear a revolving credit facility of Dollars 110m.
Kloster will book a gain of Dollars 35m on the disposal and Vard will have a
considerable accounting profit on the sale.
In April the group sold a cruise ship for Dollars 24m which allowed debt to
be reduced by Dollars 20m.
Early last month it sold the ferry division for NKr1.1bn (Dollars 159m)
which reduced the parent company's debt by Dollars 136m.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal paper brings SA back
to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first international equity offering for a South African company since
the recent elections - Dollars 68m of N shares for Anglovaal - was three
times oversubscribed.
S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank which was bookrunner for the
underwriting group, described it as 'a landmark issue that bodes well for
South Africa's future in the international capital markets'.
Mr Basil Hersov, chairman of Anglovaal, a diversified industrial and mining
group, said the placing 'has shown that premier institutions in Europe and
the US are not just interested in learning more about the South Africa story
but are also willing to take the step to invest'.
About half the demand for the shares came from the US. In Europe the biggest
demand came from fund managers in London and Edinburgh, said Mr Oliver
Baring, a director of Warburg. French and other continental European
investors were also interested.
Mr Baring said Anglovaal was a good choice to open the South African market
because it offered investors a broad range of interests under proven
management. 'For many investors this was their first chance to buy a
significant holding of South African stock since the political situation
obliged them to divest in the 1980s,' he pointed out.
The Anglovaal shares, to be listed in South Africa and London, were priced
at Dollars 27.33 each share or American depositary receipt, which, when
translated at the rand exchange rate at the time of pricing, represented
R129. This compared with a closing bid price on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange of R130.

<TEXT>
China's growing international commercial links will be strengthened today
when its Export and Import Bank begins operations.
Mr Lei Zuhua, the bank governor, said the bank would focus on export credit
initially and already had plans to support three projects.
These include the launch of an overseas satellite, the sale of aircraft to
Pakistan and a ship to Norway. Some Yn500m (UDollars 57.5m) has been
earmarked for these projects.
Mr Lei said the new bank would approve loans worth Yn3bn to exporters this
year, with about Yn2bn of the funds being disbursed.
The bank's registered capital is Yn3.38bn. It plans to raise additional
funds by issuing three-year bonds with a target this year of Yn1bn-Yn1.5bn.
The Exim bank's charter also permits it to float bonds internationally and
participate in syndicated loans.
The bank is being launched as part of a far-reaching shake-up of China's
banking system, which includes the formation of policy banks responsible for
lending to infrastructure and agriculture. The new export credit bank falls
into the same category as the policy-lending institutions.

Mr Robert Ferguson, chief executive officer of Continental Airlines of the

1994, Reuter reports from Houston.
Mr Ferguson was responding to a question after the annual meeting about
whether the Houston-based carrier would be profitable for the year.
But he added that he expected the airline to achieve sustained profitability
in 1995.
Mr Ferguson also expected the first phase of the new no-frills, short-haul
service, nicknamed Calite, to be profitable this summer and looked for
expansion in the autumn.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: German bank lifts profits 'more
than 30%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank's total operating profits climbed by 'more than 30 per cent' in
the first five months of the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's
chairman, said yesterday.
Partial operating profits, which exclude the profits generated from the
bank's own-account trading activities, increased by more than 13 per cent,
he said.
The comments come only weeks after the bank reported an 11 per cent increase
in partial operating profits for January to April this year, serving to
emphasise the robustness of the bank's earnings in spite of bad market
conditions and poor share price performance, in common with other German
bank shares.
Commerzbank's shares, unchanged yesterday at DM324, have dropped nearly 17
per cent since the beginning of the year whilst German bank shares as a
whole are down by more than 20 per cent.
Provisions for the year as a whole would be high, Mr Kohlhaussen predicted
at a press conference in Luxembourg, but would not necessarily be higher
than last year when Commerzbank was the only one of the big German banks to
reduce total provisions.
The total operating profits are calculated after taking account of
provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Mr Kohlhaussen said the result to date included a 'good three-digit'
contribution from own-account trading - that is, more than DM100m.
Interest income rose by 7.6 per cent in the five months while fee income
rose by 5.6 per cent.
The preliminary figures did not as yet include any extraordinary profit from
from the sale of a stake in the Karstadt retailer or the DBV insurance
group, the chairman indicated.
For last year as a whole total operating profits rose by nearly a quarter to
DM1.33bn (Dollars 810m).

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: German-Italian consortium buys
Ilva special steels unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A German-Italian consortium led by Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest
steelmaker, yesterday paid almost L600bn (Dollars 374.3m) for Acciai
Speciali Terni (Ast), the special steels section of the state-run Ilva
group.
The German-Italian consortium, 50 per cent of which is owned by the three
Italian steelmakers Riva, Agarini and Falck, made a better offer than an
earlier bid from a Franco-Italian group which had only weeks ago threatened
to contest the bid with a court case.
It remained unclear last night whether the rival group - led by
Usinor-Sacilor, the French steelmaker, and including Lucchini, Foroni, Spc
and Euroacciai - would press ahead with a complaint to the European
Commission.
A spokesman for Krupp Hoesch would not reveal details about the
German-Italian consortium, but said that the German company's worldwide
distribution network and strong position in the special steel markets left
it in an 'optimal position to take over Ast'.
Special steels have fared much better than other steel products during
recent turbulence on world steel markets. New uses in catalytic converters
and construction meant the sector was developing better than other areas of
the steel business, according to Mr Jurgen Claasen, a spokesman for Krupp
Hoesch.
With Ast in its portfolio, Krupp Hoesch's share of the European stainless
steel market will rise from 27 to 43 per cent.
Had the French consortium won, Usinor's share would have increased from 18
to 33 per cent.
As part of its continuing restructuring, Krupp Hoesch last week broke its
steel division into four separate units in order to be able to adapt more
quickly to different markets.
The Krupp Hoesch-led consortium entered a bid for Ast only in mid-May, just
at the time when Riva, the private Italian group, gave up its interest in
Eko Stahl, the ailing east German steel plant. There has been speculation
that Krupp Hoesch persuaded Riva the Ast venture would be more interesting.
The Ast sale is part of a broader restructuring of Italy's state steel
interests grouped around Ilva, a process being carried out by Iri, the state
holding company. The special steels operations based round Terni are the
first to be sold and have been separated from the flat products produced at
the loss-making complex in Taranto.
The 50 per cent stake in Ast will become part of a joint venture between
Krupp Hoesch and Thyssen, Germany's largest steelmaker, which is due to come
into being on October 1. Krupp Hoesch will hold a 60 per cent stake while
Thyssen will hold the remainder.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fiat confident of return to the
black
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, should return to profit
this year, Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman, said yesterday.
Fiat recorded the largest loss in its history last year - L1,783bn (Dollars
1.11bn) after tax and minority interests - but Mr Agnelli told shareholders
at yesterday's annual meeting that the company's full-year result would
'certainly be better than break-even'.
At a press conference after the meeting, the chairman indicated that, unless
market conditions deteriorated, the board would also consider paying a
dividend on ordinary shares this time next year. This year Fiat did not
propose an ordinary share dividend, for the first time since 1947.
In the first four months of 1994, Mr Agnelli said Fiat had increased
turnover by L1,865bn to L19,819bn - up more than 10 per cent on the same
period in 1993. Operating profit for the period was about 1 per cent of
sales, after L700bn of research and development expenditure, compared with
an operating loss in the first four months of last year.
For the full year, Mr Agnelli said Fiat was expecting an increase in
consolidated sales to more than L62,000bn, from L54,556bn in 1993, and an
improvement in net borrowings, which stood at L5,247bn at the end of 1993.
Mr Cesare Romiti, group chief executive, said net debt was L3,700bn at the
end of May.
Mr Agnelli blamed the effects of the international recession, and in
particular the difficult situation in the European automotive sector, for
the poor results last year. 'To some extent this had been expected, but no
source had predicted the scale of the disaster until well into the year,' he
told shareholders. 'It can only be matched by the collapse in demand after
the first oil shock 20 years ago.'
He said the overall European car market had begun to recover in 1994,
recording a 5 per cent increase in sales during the first five months. But
in Italy, car sales declined by 4 per cent against the equivalent period
last year, adding to the 20 per cent drop in 1993.
Mr Agnelli pointed out that in France, Spain and Denmark - where the
governments have taken measures to improve demand - car sales had increased
substantially in the first five months of 1994. However, Mr Agnelli denied
that Fiat had lobbied the new Italian government for incentives.
Fiat is placing a lot of faith in the Punto, its new small car launched last
year, and its new 'integrated' factory in southern Spain which began
producing the vehicle in January. The group said yesterday that by the end
of May it had received 420,000 orders for the Punto and delivered 225,000
vehicles.
Separately, Mr Agnelli said negotiations between Fiat and Renault of France,
about pooling their foundry resources around the world, had ended.

Danisco, the Danish food and beverages, food ingredients and packaging
conglomerate, proposed an increase in dividend to DKr14 from DKr12 after net
financial items by 25 per cent to DKr1.03bn (Dollars 166m) from DKr826m.
Sales in the year to end-March were down slightly to DKr12.84bn from
DKr13.02bn, reflecting the disposal of manufacturing company Niro Atomizer.
Sales by other units increased by 16 per cent, two-thirds of the increase
coming from Swedish sugar producer Sockerbolaget, which only featured in the
accounts for part of the previous year.
Net profits were ahead to DKr830m from DKr809m. An increase of about 10 per
cent in pre-tax profits was forecast for the current year.
The food and beverages division, which includes Danish Sugar and Danish
Distillers, lifted sales 22 per cent to DKr8.25bn and operating profits 34
per cent to DKr1.00bn.
Sugar production reached 1.02m tonnes, of which half was produced in
Denmark, 380,000 tonnes in Sweden and 120,000 tonnes in Germany.
The food ingredients division lifted sales 11 per cent to DKr2.02bn and
operating profits by 52 per cent to DKr290m. Packaging sales fell 2 per cent
to DKr2.59bn and operating profits gained 12 per cent to DKr209m.
The board proposed a one-into-five share split and a DKr6m share issue for
employees, priced at DKr40 per share.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US rail groups plan to merge
in Dollars 2.8bn deal

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the biggest railroads in the US, the Burlington Northern and the
Santa Fe Pacific, yesterday announced that they planned to merge in a deal
worth Dollars 2.8bn.
If allowed, the merger will create by far the biggest railroad in the US,
joining two complementary networks spreading from the west coast to the
midwest. It will be called the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
However, the deal faces an investigation by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, a federal regulatory body which seven years ago ordered the
unbundling of a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, another
railroad in the same region, on the grounds that it was anti-competitive.
The proposed deal will take the form of a takeover of Sante Fe Pacific by
Burlington Northern, the bigger of the two companies. Santa Fe shareholders
will receive 0.27 of a Burlington share for each Santa Fe share they hold,
putting a value of Dollars 2.8bn on Santa Fe.
In other respects, the deal looks like a true merger of two healthy and
profitable companies. Burlington made net profits of Dollars 296m on
turnover of Dollars 4.7bn last year, while Santa Fe made net profits of
Dollars 338m on turnover of Dollars 2.7bn.
Although passenger trains in the US are operated by the state-owned Amtrak,
all the country's track infrastructure and freight trains are owned and
operated by private sector railroad companies.
Recently the freight railroads have enjoyed a surge in profitability caused
by a combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency
and productivity, and a lack of capacity in the road haulage industry
resulting from driver shortages.
West of the Mississippi, Burlington and Santa Fe are two of four big
railroads. The others are Southern and Union Pacific.
Burlington and Santa Fe said the proposed merger was not anti-competitive
because their networks were complementary rather than competing, connecting
with one another at the ends of their routes. The combined railroad would
compete mainly with Union Pacific.
The two companies said the merger would result in substantial cost savings
though operational improvements, higher traffic densities and reduced
administrative costs.
Customers would benefit from being able to use a single railroad to reach a
wider range of destinations, eliminating the costs and delays associated
with interchanges.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bosch slips to record operating
loss - Two leading forces in Europe's motor industry are struggling to
regain ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Bosch, the privately- owned German electronic and vehicle parts
manufacturer, made an operating loss of more than DM100m (Dollars 61.3m)
last year, the first time it has gone into the red since the second world
war.
The group refused to give any details of the loss, saying only that it ran
into 'high three figures'.
The loss reflected the combination of recession, pressure on prices from the
car manufacturers which are Bosch's biggest customers, low capacity
utilisation, the strength of the D-Mark and the costs of introducing
swingeing rationalisation measures, Mr Hermann Scholl, the group's chairman
said at a press conference in Stuttgart.
There had been an improvement in the general economic climate during the
current year to date, Mr Scholl said, with turnover up just 6 per cent to
DM13.7bn in the first five months of 1994. This was mainly due to a pick-up
in demand outside Germany, and the chairman predicted that sales for the
current year would rise by 4 per cent and that there would be modest
turnover growth in 1995.
But in spite of the improvement in the economy and extensive rationalisation
measures, Bosch would make an operating loss again this year, the chairman
warned.
The cluster of negative factors last year led to a 5.7 per cent drop in
sales to DM32.5bn after DM34.4bn in 1992, the first fall in the group's
turnover since 1967. Pre-tax profits dropped by 63 per cent, from DM1.36bn
to DM510m, while net after-tax earnings fell 17 per cent from DM512m to
DM426m.
While economic conditions had improved since last year, the chairman warned
that price pressures would not diminish and that measures to cut costs and
improve productivity would have to continue. In 1993, 13,200 jobs were cut,
and the plan is to reduce the payroll by a further 4,100 this year, bringing
the total down to 152,500 by the year-end.
Bosch said that it would be restructuring its communications technology
activities: public communications technology, private communications
technology and radio technology are to be brought together into one division
as of July 1.
The division, which generated turnover of DM5.5bn last year, will be divided
into 12 product areas while the businesses will pool their research and
development, marketing and other resources.
The new structure is designed to strengthen Bosch's position in a growing
but intensely competitive market, Mr Scholl said.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: First National reduces its half year losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit and commercial
lending company, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 3.2m in the
six months to April 30.
The company, which agreed a refinancing deal with banks a year ago to cut
debt, said it had already made a Pounds 9m payment due in October. Total
debt had been cut to Pounds 860m, compared with Pounds 910m at its October
31 year end.
Mr George Cracknell, executive vice-chairman, said the company had 'broadly
done what we said we would do' by reducing losses from discontinued
commercial lending and property business while developing consumer credit.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5p per share, despite a losses per
share of 4p (2.5p). Mr Cracknell said the payment was a continuation of the
policy of 'making a modest payment to shareholders as a declaration of good
faith'.
Its consumer credit arm, specialising in home improvement loans and second
mortgages, was Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 10.4m which included a Pounds
3.9m exceptional gain from the purchase of debt in a bank subsidiary.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Expansion widens British Bio loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bio-technology Group, the UK's leading biotechnology company,
yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 21.5m for the year to April 30 -
which was within forecast. The result compared with losses of Pounds 13.1m
last time.
Mr James Noble, finance director, said the increased losses were primarily
caused by a rise in expenditure, which increased from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds
25.5m, mostly linked to additional research and development.
'At the beginning of the year there were less than 100 people who had taken
our drugs, now there are more than 1,000,' he said.
The result was also affected by a fall in net interest received from Pounds
4.21m to Pounds 1.66m.
Turnover totalled Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 7.85m) of which Pounds 1.67m (Pounds
5.33m) related to British Bio-technology Products which was sold in July
1993. Of the continuing operations' figure of Pounds 2.3m about Pounds 1m
was from government grants, and most of the rest from research agreements
with Techne of the US and Glaxo.
The company has set up a commercial department and US office which cost
acombined Pounds 1m.
The group had net cash of Pounds 28.6m at the end of the financial year. Net
proceeds from the rights issue in May this year were Pounds 45.8m.
Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said no further funding should be
required until after the exercise of Pounds 47.6m of warrants in January
1996. These are priced at 525p per share.
Yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at 365p.
Mr Noble said the available funding was sufficient for the company to
develop its lead compound, Batimastat, an anti-cancer drug, and submit it to
the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in 1996. The
drug is presently in phase II trials to evaluate its effectiveness.
Mr Noble said the company would market Batimastat itself. He believed the
group could reach the specialist oncology market with a salesforce of only
110 in Europe and 80 in the US.
The company said it was looking for partners to help it develop products
outside the cancer area in an effort to keep down costs. The company already
has an agreement with Glaxo for an asthma compound.

Greenalls Group, the pubs, drinks and hotel operator, is closing its
Cambrian Soft Drinks subsidiary. The decision will result in a Pounds 4.3m
write down of assets and Pounds 5.5m in redundancy and other costs and the
loss of more than 90 jobs.
Shaw Soft Drinks (Midlands) made an offer for Cambrian, Mr Sudarghara
Dusanj, its managing director, said. Greenalls said, however, Shaw had
failed to come up with a fully financed offer.
Greenalls said it had tried to sell the company but closing Cambrian was
ultimately the best decision for shareholders.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hadleigh advances to Pounds 832,000 -
Margins improve in tank container division as volumes rise by 45%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher operating margins in its tank container division helped Hadleigh
Industries, the USM-quoted storage tank and trailer manufacturer, continue
the improvement seen at the interim stage.
Following its return to the black after six months, pre-tax profits for the
year to April 1 were Pounds 832,000, against FRS 3-restated losses of Pounds
329,000.
Operating profits surged from Pounds 170,000 to Pounds 1.14m on turnover of
Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.3m). Net interest payable was Pounds 309,000 (Pounds
499,000) as borrowings fell from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 1.51m, reducing
gearing from 44 to 26 per cent.
Gross margins improved from 15.8 to 17.1 per cent as sales per employee rose
by 9 per cent to Pounds 72,058 (Pounds 66,325).
Mr Freddie Fane, chairman, said the strategy to focus on the core
engineering businesses had proved correct and future development would be
centred on these activities.
The tank container division, Universal Bulk Handling, which contributed
Pounds 14m to turnover, saw volumes rise by 45 per cent. The division
finished the year with a Pounds 10m order book and has opened sales offices
in Chicago and Singapore.
Mr Anthony Cookson, chief executive, said Hadleigh saw the US and east Asia
as target growth markets. 'We will be looking for acquisitions to achieve
this.'
Mr Cookson said production facilities for Cookson and Zin, the storage tank
and pressure vessels division, would be expanded to meet increased demand
for stainless steel containers.
He added that AI International, the maintenance division, and Truckline, the
distribution facility, continued to generate profits but Lynton, the
lossmaking Manchester-based lightweight trailers manufacturer, would be
disposed of.
Mr Fane announced he would stand down as chairman at the next annual meeting
but remain as a non-executive director. He will be replaced by Mr Don
McFarlane, a non-executive director for two years.
A proposed final dividend of 1.5p makes a total for the year of 2p (0.5p)
from earnings per share of 9p, against losses of 3p.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester reopens its doors
to savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to reopen its doors to savers
today. The decision ends a three-week period when the society stopped taking
deposits after the High Court ruling which disallowed the terms of Lloyds
Bank's Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid.
The new accounts are all deposit - rather than share - accounts, meaning
that investors will not become members of the society and will have no
voting rights.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said it was not appropriate for new
shareholders to join C&amp;G while it was still working on a revised cash
payments plan in order to meet the terms of the court ruling 'as an
alternative to making an appeal.'
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that the provisions of the
1986 Building Societies Act barred the 220,000-plus C&amp;G investors who had
been shareholding members of the society for less than two years from
receiving cash payments.
C&amp;G has not ruled out an appeal. But a decision on whether to launch an
expedited appeal would have to come within 28 days of the formal court order
which was made last week. C&amp;G is likely to announce its intention within the
first half of this month.
If the society can devise a new cash payments scheme which is lawful and
looks likely to deliver the necessary high proportions of support from
members, then such a course would appear preferable to risking the delay
which even an expedited appeal process would mean.
That is the prospect which seems to lie behind C&amp;G's ban on new members,
even though those joining now would not be able to vote on the Lloyds offer
in terms of the original schedule.
The society closed its savings accounts because it believed that even though
the court ruling would not allow new depositors to receive a windfall
benefit from the Lloyds offer, some potential customers might wrongly
interpret the judgment.
The three new accounts - the London account, the Gold deposit account and
the Tessa deposit account - offer the same rates of interest as the share
accounts they replace.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eurocamp forecasts 'significant'
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurocamp, the tour operator specialising in self-drive camping holidays,
yesterday reported an increased interim loss, but forecast 'a significantly
improved' result for the full year.
In the half-year to April the pre-tax loss rose from Pounds 5.12m to Pounds
5.88m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 368,000 to Pounds 316,000, reflecting a fall in
demand for Easter breaks to Euro Disney.
An interim loss is normal for the group, which relies heavily on the second
half for the bulk of its revenues. Sales for the last full-year were Pounds
56.7m, and pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.25m.
The shares closed 8p ahead at 265p.
Mr Gordon Harman, finance director, said yesterday that overall bookings had
increased by 20 per cent for the coming season. Only part of the gains
reflected an element of recovery in both the camping market and the market
for French holidays.
Camp site occupancy rates, which fell 6 per cent last year, were improving,
and there had been 'substantial growth' in mobile home, or caravan,
bookings, which now represented 21 per cent of total bookings, up from a
previous 17 per cent.
Margins declined last year from 15 per cent to 11 per cent. A small
improvement is seen this year, but Mr Harman did not expect them to regain
15 per cent for some time. Nevertheless, margins were good by tourist
industry standards.
Germany and the Netherlands were now responsible for 50 per cent of total
bookings, and were showing good demand for mobile homes.
Mr Harman believed the mobile homes sector of the business and the sale of
holidays through travel agencies were potential areas for further growth.
Losses per share were 15.2p, up from 13.2p. Theinterim dividend is increased
from 3.45p to 3.6p.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: RTZ gold mines may be sold to Royal Oak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, is believed to be negotiating to sell
most of its US gold mines to Royal Oak Mines, the ambitious Vancouver-based
company headed by Mrs Margaret 'Peggy' Witte.
Neither company would comment on market rumours about the potential deal,
fuelled by Mrs Witte's comments at Royal Oak's annual meeting on June 17.
She said the company was considering acquiring a large gold producing
property or amalgamating with another intermediate-sized producer with the
aim of doubling gold output from the 500,000 troy ounces projected for 1996.
This would put Royal Oak - which was formed by Mrs Witte in 1991 from the
merger of five 'penny' stocks - among the handful of world gold companies
with an annual output of 1m ounces.
Mrs Witte, a 41-year-old, US-born metallurgist, said the potential target
was not Canadian and that she expected to release details by mid-summer.
Analysts suggested that the tone of Mrs Witte's comments indicated that the
deal would be friendly and the most likely candidate was Kennecott Minerals,
which incorporates most of RTZ's US gold mines.
Kennecott owns and operates three open pit gold mines: Ridgeway in South
Carolina; Barneys Canyon in Utah and Rawhide (51 per cent-controlled) in
Nevada.
In addition, Kennecott has a 40 per cent partnership interest in the Cortez
mine in Nevada which is managed by Placer Dome of Canada, and owns and
operates the Flambeau copper and gold open pit mine in Wisconsin. Last year
RTZ's share of production from these mines was 411,000 ounces.
Analysts suggested that RTZ has never been particularly keen on gold, and
the mines apparently for sale are not of the quality or scale it prefers.
The group quickly sold three similar gold mines it acquired in the US last
year with the Nerco coal business.
At present investors are paying about Dollars 120 (Pounds 79) an ounce for
'gold in the ground' in the US. Reserves at the Kennecott mines total about
2m ounces, giving a theoretical market value of Dollars 240m.

The management of GKN Vending Services has staged a Pounds 7.6m buy-out from

The buy-out team, led by Mr Rod Tompsett, managing director, was advised by

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Matthew Clark to
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An aggressive programme of acquisitions helped Matthew Clark, the drinks
group, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 95 per cent, from Pounds 5.28m
to Pounds 10.3m.
Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said that integrating Grants of St James's
had yielded Pounds 8.5m of cost savings on an annualised basis, as promised
at the time of the Pounds 30m acquisition last October.
Of Pounds 10m provisions made to cover the purchase of Grants and
Freetraders, a drinks wholesale business, Pounds 4m had been spent in the
year to April 30. The remainder would be spent largely in the current year,
although the resulting cost savings would largely fall in the year after.
In the course of the year under review, the group raised Pounds 45m through
two rights issues, increasing its capital base from 9.8m shares to 22.7m.
The cost of acquisitions came to Pounds 51m.
Turnover tripled from Pounds 58m to Pounds 174m. The inclusion of
Freetraders for 10 months and Grants of St James's for six months added
Pounds 122m to turnover and Pounds 5.4m to operating profit.
Interest payable increased to Pounds 370,000 (Pounds 90,000) and after tax
of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 1.74m) and minorities of Pounds 912,000 attributable
profit was Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 3.54m).
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 33.5p (29.3p). The final dividend
is raised by 7.5 per cent, in line with the company's forecast, to 10.75p
(10p), making a total of 18p (16.75p).
Net cash at the year end was Pounds 6m.
The shares rose 3p to 550p.
COMMENT
Assuming pre-tax profits of some Pounds 15.5m this year, headline profits
will have almost tripled in the space of two years. This indicates the pace
of change at Matthew Clark, and also the risks. The replacement of the old
family management by drinks industry professionals has had a galvanising
effect. There is no shortage of opportunities, particularly given the
structural upheavals still afflicting the brewing and pubs industries. But
the acquisitions being contemplated in principle are pretty varied, from
branded wine to cider manufacture. Shareholders will doubtless be called on
to assist the process further. Buying the shares is an act of faith in the
man-agement, but it might pay off.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sweb lifts pay-out by 17.5% - Distributor
backs calls for demerger of the National Grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity, the Bristol-based distributor, yesterday threw
its support behind a demerger of the National Grid from the regional
electricity companies that own it.
The company also reported a 17.5 per cent increase in dividend payments, one
of the highest in the current power reporting season which ends today.
Mr John Seed, chief executive, said he thought most of the recs would
support a National Grid demerger after a review of its future later this
year.
Options include selling a part of the company and keeping the cash. But Mr
Seed said his company favoured a full demerger of the Grid, to be achieved
by handing over shares in the new company to the recs' existing shareholders
on a pro rata basis.
Swalec has adopted a similar stance on the Grid.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were 15.5 per cent ahead at Pounds
116.8m (Pounds 101.1m), achieved on turnover of Pounds 899.6m (Pounds 892m).
A proposed final dividend of 16.5p gives a total for the year of 23.5p (20p)
covered 3.2 times by earnings of 75.4p (63.1p) per share.
Mr Seed said the dividend increase could not be interpreted as a signal for
a favourable outcome of the distribution review. 'The dividend rise is based
on our performance during 1993-94 and our desire to maintain the dividend
cover at 3.2.'
Mr John Sellers, finance director, said the company would also want to
review its balance sheet following the distribution review. It would be
comfortable with gearing levels of up to 40 per cent.
Sweb had net cash of Pounds 43.5m at the year end, against borrowings of
Pounds 105.7m last time.
Excluding the effect of VAT receipts, gearing would have been 3 per cent.
The performance was helped by a higher than average 2.2 per cent growth in
units distributed, weather-corrected.
COMMENT
Here are yet another set of impressive results from a rec, which if
anything, understate the underlying growth. After adding in the effects of
Pounds 27m for provisions and subtracting money taken from customers
relating to previous years and pension provisions, the total could have been
about Pounds 10m higher. Assuming a 14 per cent dividend rise this year, the
shares, up 14p to 615p yesterday, are trading on a prospective yield of
about 5.5 per cent. That is fair for a company which has performed well but
faces a tougher time than most because it must convince the regulator that
its high cost base is fully justified by the expense of servicing a
sprawling rural area. But at the end of a week in which rec share prices
have risen strongly, investors in all 14 companies affected by the
distribution review should stop and consider. While it is almost certain
that the review will be less tough than the worst fears, there is as yet
very little hard information to work on. The market is working on hunches,
not knowledge.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pascon in Pounds 28m buy-out from BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of Pascon has paid Pounds 28m to buy the scaffolding and
plant hire business from BTR, its former parent.
The buy-out team raised a total of Pounds 33.5m, including a Pounds 5m loan
for future capital investment.
3i, the venture capital group, provided Pounds 12.5m, a further Pounds 11m
was provided by National Westminster Bank while Lombard Business Finance
invested Pounds 10m.
The business, established in 1880, claims to be the country's oldest
scaffolding concern still operating.
Management, led by Mr Keith Bright, managing director, is thought to have
acquired a stake of more than 50 per cent in the company.
Pascon also manufactures pumps as well as hiring scaffolding and other
equipment to the construction and allied industries from a national network
of 30 branches.
The buy-out was negotiated by Price Waterhouse which said that Pascon's main
markets were showing steady signs of recovery which had led to a rise in
orders and customer inquiries.
Pascon, which is thought last year to have earned pre-tax profits
approaching Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 38m, is forecasting higher
profits in the current year.
Mr Bright said the forecast was underpinned by scaffolding contract work
worth Pounds 8m already in hand. Plant hire revenues also were running at
record levels, while orders at the company's pump manufacturing subsidiary
were the best for four years.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SB challenge to Wellcome as Famvir gets US
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced
the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its anti-viral drug Famvir
for the treatment of shingles.
The approval ends effective monopoly of Wellcome, the UK drugs group, over
the US shingles market. Zovirax, its anti-shingles compound, was its largest
selling product last year, generating sales of Pounds 760m, equivalent to 37
per cent of group sales of Pounds 2.04bn. The drug, whose US sales last year
were Pounds 286m, was also the world's fourth biggest selling medicine.
Wellcome's shares fell 27p to 590p, while SmithKline Beecham's dropped 3p to
406p.
Wellcome reacted to Famvir's approval by announcing it had signed an
agreement to co-promote Zovirax in the US with Upjohn, the Kalamazoo-based
drugs group. The company said Upjohn's salesforce of 1,400 would work with
Wellcome's 800 representatives.
The Anglo-American group said it planned to launch Famvir in the coming
weeks. The company refused to reveal at what price it would launch Famvir in
the US. In the UK earlier this year, SmithKline Beecham set Famvir's price
at Pounds 107.35 for a week's course for shingles, a 5 per cent discount to
Zovirax. Wellcome matched SmithKline Beecham's price within hours.
Wellcome insisted the launch of an additional shingles treatment in the UK
had increased the overall size of the market by 25 per cent, and that
Zovirax sales had not fallen as a result.
In the same market, the company has recently launched an over-the-counter,
non-prescription version of the drug for cold sores, in anticipation of the
expiry of Zovirax's patents next year. Its application to market the drug
over-the-counter for genital herpes in the US is still pending.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New management team at Starmin as losses
double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
cabinet minister, doubled its pre-tax loss for last year to Pounds 23.2m.
The total loss included Pounds 11.2m relating to the write-down of fixed
assets, and Pounds 7.9m of goodwill written off.
The losses and exceptional charges have cut shareholders' funds from Pounds
19.6m to Pounds 3.42m. This has raised gearing from 39 per cent to 271 per
cent, putting the group in breach of its banking facilities.
Ernst &amp; Young, the auditors, pointed out that the accounts have been drawn
up on a going concern basis, dependent on future funding being made
available. The notes say there is 'fundamental uncertainty as to the
appropriateness of the going concern basis'.
The banks have extended the group's facilities until the end of August. The
board believes that talks 'will result in the provision of new financing
arrangements for the group'.
The reappraisal of fixed assets was related to the group's plans, announced
last February, to acquire a large, privately-owned construction group. But
market conditions have prevented the deal from going through.
The group has called in a new management team headed by Mr Michael Gurner,
an associate director of Postern Executive Group, a management consultancy
firm specialising in financial reconstruction. Mr Owen Rout, acting chief
executive since June 1993, is relinquishing his executive responsibilities
and will resign from the board at the AGM.
Lord Parkinson said in his statement that 1993 had 'proved to be a demanding
year'. But the group had made reasonable progress in its strategy to get
back to the profitable core business of landfill and the extraction of
aggregates and other minerals.
Losses on continuing operations rose from Pounds 4.34m to Pounds 13.3m,
including a profit of Pounds 228,000 from acquisitions.
Total turnover fell to Pounds 16.3m from Pounds 18.7m in 1992, when the
pre-tax loss was Pounds 11.9m.
Interest payable rose from Pounds 713,000 to Pounds 931,000, reflecting
higher borrowings.
Losses per share were 6.6p (3.6p). There is again no final dividend.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US input helps raise Ivory &amp; Sime to Pounds
6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund managers, lifted pre-tax profits by
27 per cent, from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 6.2m, during the year to April 30.
Mr Allan Munro, managing director, said the company was continuing the
progress made in the four years since management changed in 1990. Managed
funds increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.8bn at the year end, though the
rise was 'not as fast we would like'.
During the year the company lost the contract to manage portfolios
controlled by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, leading to Ensign
Trust selling its 16.7 per cent stake to investors including Abtrust and
Scottish Value Trust. I&amp;S also lost the contract to manage New Frontiers
Development fund.
However, funds under management in North America doubled to Pounds 470m
despite the loss of one client worth Pounds 110m. Mr Munro said I&amp;S could
present a good five-year record in managing UK pension funds which meant it
attended 'beauty parades' to win new mandates.
Profits were boosted by the high level of world stock markets over the year.
Sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 14.3m).
Administrative expenses rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 11m.
The final dividend is 5.25p, making a total of 7.5p, up 15.4 per cent, and
payable from earnings up 20 per cent to 12.87p per share.

Gestetner shares fell 19p to 144p yesterday after Inchcape, the
international services and marketing group, said it would not exercise an
option to increase its stake in the distributor of office equipment and
photographic supplies.
At the same time Gestetner reported a sharp turnround to profits of Pounds
6.6m in the six months ended April 30 compared with a loss of Pounds 45.4m
which reflected extensive restructuring costs.
Last year Inchcape spent Pounds 38m on a 15 per cent holding and acquired
the right to raise this to 25 per cent by today for a further Pounds 41m.
Ricoh, the Japanese manufacturer of office equipment, bought a large stake
in Gestetner in 1991 and now controls 29.9 per cent.
Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape chief executive, said that it had become
'increasingly apparent the best strategy available to Gestetner, ourselves
and Ricoh, may be for the three companies to work together in developing
business opportunities, while generally maintaining separate distribution
channels for the Ricoh and Gestetner brands.
'However, it has already become clear that, with this strategy, it is not
necessary to increase our investment in Gestetner.'
Inchcape shares yesterday rose by 5p to 448p. The shares have been
underperforming the market recently, partly because of concern that the
group might launch a full bid for Gestetner, which would probably have
involved a rights issue.
Mr Mackay said he was confident of continuing progress at Gestetner. Mr
David Thompson, Gestetner's chairman, said: 'We are comfortable that
Inchcape remains a major investor in Gestetner and will continue to explore
with them opportunities of mutual advantage . . . We continue to enjoy a
good relationship with Ricoh as a major shareholder and as an important
supplier of office automation equipment.'
Gestetner's principal supplier is Ricoh, but the group said it was shifting
emphasis towards flexible sourcing from a variety of suppliers. The
distributor also expressed determination to exploit its muscle to gain best
buying terms and terms from suppliers, including Ricoh. Gestetner
distributes 24 per cent of the Ricoh products sold outside Japan.
Gestetner trading profit rose to Pounds 14.1m compared with Pounds 10.7m
before exceptionals. Mr Thompson said the group was beginning to reap the
benefits of the restructuring actions taken last year.
Earnings per share rose to 2.7p, compared with losses of 22.2p or earnings
of 0.3p, excluding exceptionals. The interim dividend is 1.2p (1.8p).

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Asda shows resilience despite write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, warned yesterday of continuing
pressure on profit margins in UK food retailing, as he unveiled a resilient
performance from his own company, with underlying profits up 43 per cent.
Net property write-downs of Pounds 179m and a Pounds 130m write-off
connected with the sale of the Allied Maples business meant that Asda
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 126m for the year to April 30. But
disregarding these exceptional items, profits rose from Pounds 140.4m to
Pounds 201.4m.
'We are still in what we call the watershed period,' said Mr Norman, who was
the first leading industry figure to predict tougher times ahead for food
retailers in 1992.
'If (food retailing) space is expanding by 8 to 10 per cent a year, but
demand is relatively flat it doesn't take me to point out there is going to
be pressure on margins.'
He added that Asda was entering the final year of a three-year recovery
programme based on 'meeting the needs of ordinary working people, who demand
value' and designed to equip the company to deal with the new 'market
realities'.
Asda's shares closed up  3/4 p at 52 1/4 p, bolstered by a 10 per cent
increase in the final dividend to 1.21p, taking the total to 1.76p (1.6p).
Losses per share of 5.91p after exceptional items compared with earnings of
6.4p last year.
Group turnover, excluding Allied Maples, increased by 9 per cent to Pounds
4.8bn (Pounds 4.41bn), and Asda said that with only one new store opened
during the year, like-for-like sales increased by 8.9 per cent.
That far outstripped like-for-like growth at competitors J Sainsbury, Tesco,
and Argyll, owner of Safeway. Mr Norman admitted that Asda's figures were
recovering from a weaker base, but he added that the performance had beaten
his own expectations.
Asda said the increasingly competitive market and moves to more conservative
accounting by other grocery groups had persuaded it to make a Pounds 154m
property write-down, reducing the value of older stores to their alternative
use value. It was starting to depreciate other stores by between 2 and 5 per
cent per year depending on age, resulting in a recurring additional charge
of Pounds 18.4m.
Asda also wrote down the value of its investment in Burwood House, a joint
venture with British Aerospace, by Pounds 30m to Pounds 73m.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: NatWest pays Pounds 195m for US retail bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank yesterday announced that it would expand its US
retail banking subsidiary further by spending Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) in
shares and cash to buy Central Jersey Bancorp, a retail bank with assets of
Dollars 1.8bn.
NatWest Bancorp, its US retail subsidiary, will pay Dollars 33.50 per share,
or 2.4 times book value. The deal follows the acquisition by NatWest in
March of Citizens First Bancorp, another New Jersey bank.
Some 55 per cent of the Dollars 300m will come from the issue of up to 25m
ordinary shares - 1.5 per cent of share capital - in the form of American
Depository Receipts. The acquisition will increase NatWest Bancorp's assets
to Dollars 30bn.
Mr John Tugwell, NatWest Bancorp's chairman and chief executive, said that
Central Jersey was attractive because its franchise covered 'horse-farming
country, some sea-shore, and a lot of small businesses and prosperous
consumers'.
He said that NatWest could cut Central Jersey's cost base by 35 to 40 per
cent, mainly by cutting duplication in central functions. Earnings per share
were unlikely to rise in the first year because of initial integration
spending.
NatWest was 'comfortable that we will earn an appropriate return' by raising
income from the sale of financial products. Some 11 per cent of Central
Jersey's income comes from such items, compared with 34 per cent for NatWest
Bancorp.
It would also be able to cut its funding cost by gaining access to Central
Jersey's retail deposit base, which wholly funds its lending.
Central Jersey was 'a very clean bank' in which only 1 per cent of the loan
book was non-performing, and reserves stood at 116 per cent of bad loans. It
has a very strong 12.3 per cent ratio of core capital to risk-weighted
assets.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Insurers move in on EU market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, RICHARD LAPPER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's largest insurers - Scottish Amicable and Equitable Life -
will today launch new European operations as part of plans to take advantage
of the expected liberalisation of the continent's insurance market.
Competition in the market is expected to increase in the wake of today's
deadline for implementation of the European Union 'framework' directives,
which allow insurers to sell home, motor and life insurance across national
boundaries for the first time.
Scottish Amicable European, based in Dublin, will become operational today,
with the launch of products into the UK. These feature flexible, regular
premium protection-based policies, and will benefit in terms of pricing from
the differences in how life assurance is taxed in the rest of Europe
compared with the UK.
The company aims to start selling products in Germany early next year, said
Mr Paul Bradshaw, chief executive.
Equitable Life will launch UK-style life products in Germany, which will be
sold alongside its range of traditional German policies by its direct sales
force there.
The legislation should be implemented in 10 of the EU's member states by the
end of the year. Companies will be free to operate throughout the EU on the
basis of a licence obtained from regulators in their home state.
Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK are expected to have
transposed the insurance directive into national law by the July 1 deadline,
while Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg would be ready by the
end of the year, EU officials said. Spain and Greece are being allowed until
December 31 1996 and December 31 1998 respectively to effect the changes.
The greater competition ensuing as a result of the directive is expected to
lead to lower prices, especially in traditionally more regulated markets
such as Germany. Officials acknowledge, however, that differences in tax
regimes of member states may restrict the impact of the directive.

FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Close finish likely in battle for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil's increasingly bitter takeover battle for fellow explorer
Lasmo ends today, with both sides saying that the result is too close to
call.
'There will be a few sweaty palms' among Lasmo and Enterprise executives and
advisers as the counting of votes gets under way in London, according to one
of Lasmo's larger institutional investors yesterday.
Many institutions are unlikely to tip their hands until close to the 1pm
deadline for votes to be received by the registrar. Phillips and Drew Fund
Management, the biggest single shareholder, yesterday decided against making
a public announcement of which side they would support.
PDFM, which sold 77m Lasmo shares in Enterprise's controversial share raid
on Wednesday, is thought to be uncomfortable with the notion that undecided
investors might simply follow its lead.
The two sides spent much of yesterday dealing with the fall-out from the
share raid, in which Enterprise picked up 9.8 per cent of Lasmo's shares.
The head of investments for the US's largest pension fund reacted angrily
yesterday to the fact that US investors were excluded from Enterprise's cash
offer.
Mr Virgil Cummings, chief investment officer of Teachers Insurance and
Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund (Tiaa-Cref), said:
'It's very, very frustrating. But this is nothing new. This is something we
continually experience in the UK.'
Mr Cummings said restrictive legal interpretations obtained by UK companies
frequently resulted in US investors being excluded from some transactions,
such as tender offers and dividend reinvestment schemes. Similar problems
did not arise in other European capital markets, he added.
The Enterprise camp though, maintained that regulators in the US had
prevented Lasmo shareholders there from participating, rather than the
company's own legal interpretation. Such partial cash offers during takeover
bids are not permitted under US takeover law, forcing Enterprise to obtain a
special exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its
action. That exemption did not extend to Lasmo shareholders in the US, the
Enterprise supporters said.
Enterprise sounded out some of Lasmo's US shareholders before paying cash
for 10 per cent of the company's shares on Wednesday. However, it later told
them that they could not accept the offer for legal reasons.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Ready to tune into the Diller sizzle: Martin Dickson on why
mighty CBS may merge with a modest cable television shopping channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What Hollywood wits call the 'Diller sizzle' may soon be back in US
prime-time television after a 2 1/2 year absence.
Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive behind such hits as
'The Simpsons' television cartoon series and the 'Indiana Jones' adventure
movies, is negotiating a possible merger between QVC Network - the modest
cable television shopping channel which he heads - and CBS, one of America's
big three national television broadcasting networks. CBS yesterday confirmed
it was discussing a merger with QVC.
Mr Diller, 52, could become chief executive of the combined entity,
returning to national television broadcasting for the first time since
February 1992 when he stepped down as chief executive of Fox Inc, the film
and television arm of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation media empire.
His resignation from Fox shocked the film world because Mr Diller had built
the upstart Fox Broadcasting into a fourth national television network -
defying industry opinion that there was no room for a fresh challenger to
the established trio of CBS, NCB and ABC.
Mr Diller wanted to build a media empire of his own. After finding a quoted
vehicle for his ambitions - the far-from-glamorous QVC - he made his first
big foray last autumn, an unsuccessful Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) bid for
film and publishing giant Paramount Communications, which merged instead
with cable programmer Viacom.
A deal with CBS could bring big benefits to the network.
CBS has ranked first in prime- time television ratings for the past three
years, but has come under Wall Street criticism for its strategy under Mr
Laurence Tisch, the 71-year-old investor who took a controlling stake in the
group eight years ago, knowing little about the entertainment industry.
There are two main complaints. First, Mr Tisch has pursued a strategy unique
in the entertainment industry of maintaining CBS as a pure, stand-alone
television broadcasting business. He sold off peripheral assets, including
the magazines division and CBS records.
He also refused to follow NBC and ABC when they acquired interests in cable
television, which has whittled down the broadcast networks' share of
national audience from around 90 per cent 20 years ago to just over 60 per
cent now.
Mr Tisch is proud of the fact that this policy, combined with a clamp-down
on costs and a stable management, has allowed the network to vault from
third place in the ratings to first, while also giving CBS a cash pool of
more than Dollars 1bn.
But critics say his 'pure-play' strategy exposes a passive frame of mind,
leaves the group exposed to a cyclical downturn in broadcasting and gives it
too little clout in forging the complex multi-media alliances reshaping the
entertainment industry.
Second, critics say CBS may be losing its programming edge and its hold over
affiliated stations, a concern highlighted in May when 12 television
stations owned by media group New World Communications announced they were
changing loyalty from the big three networks to Fox. Eight were defectors
from CBS.
The switch was due to a complex set of financial factors, but one catalyst
was Mr Murdoch winning an auction to broadcast American football games
featuring the National Football Conference for the next four years - beating
CBS, which had shown the NFC games for almost 40 years.
CBS's sports line-up is generally regarded as weak and its nightly news
broadcast humdrum, but opinion is divided over the rest of its programming.
Many advertisers think the network's prime-time line-up for autumn is
strong.
A deal with QVC could help CBS overcome both weaknesses perceived by Wall
Street. First, it would bring in the immense creative energy of Mr Diller,
who boasts one of Hollywood's most distinguished track records. He made his
name at ABC in the early 1970s and between 1974 and 1984 headed the
Paramount film studios.
He could help CBS capitalise on changes in US anti-trust regulations which,
for the first time in 20 years, will allow the big three networks to own and
produce the bulk of their prime-time entertainment programmes.
Second, a deal would thrust CBS into the cable programming industry. QVC
runs two home shopping channels which sell products ranging from jewellery
to clothing and cookware.
Home shopping is still in its infancy, but it is predicted that it will show
spectacular growth when inter-active technology is eventually introduced,
allowing viewers to click on a remote control to place an order, rather than
dialling a phone number as now. It is the boundless opportunities of
inter-active entertainment which has attracted Mr Diller to the sector and
which could be capitalised on by CBS.
A link-up with QVC would also give CBS ties to two of the most powerful
cable service companies in the US, Tele-Communications Inc (TCI) and
Comcast, both of which have significant investments in the shopping channel.
It would be an ironic twist of fate for Mr Tisch, proud defender of
broadcasting against the inroads of cable.

FT  01 JUL 94 / ABF reorganisation runs into Charity Commission hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charity Commission has intervened in the proposed reorganisation of
Associated British Foods, the milling, baking and food products group, in a
move that could scupper the plan.
ABF said yesterday it had agreed with the commission that it would seek High
Court guidance on whether it could proceed with its proposals, which were
announced in May. The plan involves restructuring the highly complex
ownership of ABF, which is held through a series of Weston family trusts and
charitable foundations. The reorganisation is designed to improve the
family's tax planning.
ABF's minority shareholders would be offered equivalent shares in a newly
quoted company and a 10p special dividend. Mr Garry Weston is chairman of
ABF and about 40 members of the family work for the company.
The Garfield Weston Foundation, ultimate controller of ABF, would have
increased its indirect stake in the company from 36 to 40 per cent.
ABF said it had sought legal and financial advice on the reorganisation. It
had been told by its lawyers at Slaughter &amp; May and Herbert Smith that there
was no need to seek approval from the courts or the Charity Commission.
The commission confirmed yesterday that it had spotted the proposed
reorganisation and raised the matter with the trustees as part of a more
active approach to monitoring charities.
It has questioned whether approval of the proposals would be 'expedient in
the interests of' the foundation. The phrase refers to trustee law dating
back as far as 1925. 'We have so far not been able to satisfy ourselves on
this and have agreed that the matter should be resolved by the court as the
trustees have requested,' the Commission said.
ABF must first seek formal approval from the commission to go to the High
Court, and then make an application to the court to resolve the legal
principle. It said the foundation's trustees were 'confident of their
position'.

FT  01 JUL 94 / BPB profits rise 87% after price war ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard
manufacturer, rose 87 per cent to Pounds 107.7m during the year to March as
the company continued to recover following the end of a 'destructive price
war'.
The profits increase announced yesterday was higher than expected and BPB's
shares rose 4 1/2 per cent to 302p. The price war, which concluded in 1992,
was waged between the UK group, which controls about 50 per cent of the west
European market, and Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany, which
split the remainder roughly equally.
BPB said the price of plasterboard in Germany, France and the UK had risen
on average by about a quarter since March 1992 but was still about 25 per
cent lower than at the beginning of 1990.
A 27 per cent fall in manufacturing costs since 1990, however, meant that
prices did not need to reach previous peaks for margins to recover. Margins
on plasterboard and plaster sales last year improved from 8.6 per cent to
12.3 per cent, while sales volume increased by just 4.5 per cent.
Mr Alan Turner, chairman, said that prices might rise by 2 or 3 per cent
this year, but future growth was more likely to be generated by increased
sales rather than price rises. He said the three manufacturers had finally
seen commonsense and ended a price war estimated to have cost the industry
Pounds 200m in lost revenue since 1989.
Prospects now looked bright with European construction activity forecast to
recover over the next two years, led by housebuilding and sharp growth in
eastern Germany where BPB plans to build a large new plant in Berlin costing
almost Pounds 50m. The company also predicted that European sales would rise
as plasterboard continued to increase its market share against other
products.
BPB's advance in pre-tax profits was achieved in spite of a Pounds 3.9m
increase in redundancy and reorganisation costs to Pounds 15.2m.
Turnover grew 2.3 per cent from Pounds 1.12bn to Pounds 1.15bn. Earnings per
share rose by 85 per cent to 15p (8.1p), and a final dividend of 5.3p (4.8p)
makes a total of 8.1p for the year, up 8 per cent on the previous year's
7.5p.
All of the company's main building materials businesses, other than plaster
in Spain and Italy, recorded strong profits growth, while Canada had moved
from break-even to profit.
Lower costs, better prices and higher sales volume had prompted a net cash
inflow of Pounds 95m, helped by a low tax payment of Pounds 2m, a reduced
interest charge of Pounds 18m (Pounds 29.6m) and 'a minimal acquisition
spend'.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 104.2m to Pounds 138.2m, reducing gearing from
35 per cent to 19 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Prudential leads bidders for National Car Parks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, SIMON DAVIES and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of venture capital investors, led by UK insurance giant
Prudential, is understood to be behind the bid for National Parking
Corporation, which owns National Car Parks and the fast-growing National
Breakdown Recovery service.
It is believed that the bidding consortium also includes Electra, the
unquoted companies investment trust, CinVen, the venture capital arm of
British Coal's in-house funds manager, and Morgan Grenfell Development
Capital, part of Morgan Grenfell - NPC's financial adviser.
Morgan Grenfell has been sounding out potential buyers for several months
for the 64 per cent of NPC owned by founder Sir Donald Gosling, 65, and Mr
Ronald Hobson, 73, after flotation was ruled out.
The shares, which stood at 450p at the start of the week, rose further to
575p yesterday in over-the-counter trading, valuing the private company at
Pounds 675m. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.3m on Pounds 233.5m
turnover in the year to March 26, 1993.
Aside from its enormous cash flow, NPC's major attraction would be its
freehold and long-leasehold interests in around 600 car parks, and a number
of property investments.
The properties used by its operating businesses are all valued at cost,
despite the fact that many of the car parks were purchased during the 1950s
and 1960s and are situated in prime locations.
Collins Stewart, the stockbroking firm, estimates that assuming valuations
based on an 11 per cent yield on its car parks, NPC is sitting on a Pounds
200m surplus to its balance sheet property valuation of Pounds 197m. There
is potential for redeveloping prime sites, although in many cases the local
authorities may not be prepared to change the land usage.
The company dominates the provision of private car parking spaces in the UK,
with no sizeable competitors after its 1990 acquisition of rival Europarks.
A near-monopoly has prevailed because of a quirk in the law: car park owners
are not considered to be providing a service and are therefore outside the
auspices of the Office of Fair Trading.
NPC has utilised the cash flow from car parking to build up its highly
successful vehicle breakdown operation, which made Pounds 9.8m profit last
year. Its phone and computer network is now supporting a push into urgent
domestic repair services.

FT  01 JUL 94 / 'Baby Bell' groups combine cellular forces in new venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of America's largest 'Baby Bell' local telecommunications groups - Bell
Atlantic and Nynex - are combining their cellular wireless interests in a
new company.
The new venture, announced yesterday, will compete aggressively with
long-distance rivals trying to establish national networks in the
fast-growing mobile communications market. The companies said it might have
a market value of around Dollars 13bn.
Bell Atlantic, which serves the Mid-Atlantic region, and Nynex, which serves
New York and New England, are each among the 10 largest cellular telephone
companies in the US. The combined group will be in second place, in terms of
potential customers, behind McCaw Cellular Communications and ahead of GTE.
The deal, which will require the approval of federal regulators, is the
first alliance on such a grand scale by two 'Baby Bells' since these
companies were spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in 1984. It comes as
America's two largest long-distance carriers are trying to establish
networks linking the nation's fragmented patchwork of cellular telephone
licence areas, each of which supports two operators.
AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance group, is waiting for regulatory approval to
buy McCaw for Dollars 12.6bn, while MCI Communications, in which British
Telecom has a 20 per cent stake, has allied with wireless operator Nextel
Communications.
Both local and long-distance companies are also preparing to bid for
licences to provide a new kind of wireless communication - personal
communications services (PCS) - which the Federal Communications Commission
is due to auction at the end of 1994 this year. The various groups want to
incorporate PCS into their national wireless networks.
Mr Lawrence Babbio, who will head the management committee of the Nynex-Bell
Atlantic joint venture, said: 'We have the foundation for building a
national wireless presence by obtaining PCS licences and by bringing
like-minded PCS providers into our new alliance.'
Bell Atlantic will own 62.35 per cent of joint venture and Nynex 37.65 per
cent, but it will be controlled equally by both.
If approved, the deal could pave the way for other cellular alliances
between Baby Bells.

FT  01 JUL 94 / CrossRail plan doomed despite MPs' support: Commons
committee remains opposed to route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The private bill authorising the Pounds 2bn CrossRail plan for an east-west
London railway link is dead, despite an attempt by hundreds of MPs of all
parties to revive it.
More than 250 MPs have signed a Commons motion tabled by Mr David Lidington,
Conservative MP for Aylesbury, calling for a private bill authorising
CrossRail to be sent back to a quasi-judicial committee which rejected it
last month.
The move is backed by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Frank
Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, as well as the bill's joint sponsors -
British Rail, London Underground and Railtrack, the rail infrastructure
company.
But two of the four MPs on the committee say they will continue to oppose
the scheme, which would authorise a six-mile tunnel linking Paddington and
Liverpool Street main line stations. A third is also thought likely to
oppose.
The MPs' stand means that under parliament's procedures for private
legislation the bill has no hope of success, even if the Commons votes for
Mr Lidington's motion.
It is understood that two of the three committee members who voted against
the project would change their minds if it was amended to link up with the
proposed Heathrow Express and the planned high-speed line from London to the
Channel tunnel.
However, that would require a government commitment to provide up to Pounds
100m in extra public finance, which would be unlikely to be approved by the
Treasury.
The project only reached the committee stage because Mr John Major, the
prime minister, over-ruled attempts by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary
to the treasury, to block it on cost.
Mr John Marek, one of two Labour MPs on the committee, wrote to all Labour
MPs yesterday insisting that the economic case for the project 'simply did
not stack up'.
In a 13-point critique of the scheme, Mr Marek said that the funds required
to build CrossRail would produce up to 20 times more benefit if spent on the
existing Underground system.
He said the project would duplicate the Central Line, and could cost BR up
to Pounds 100m a year in lost revenue.
The government has ruled out the alternative options of taking over the
project under the 'hybrid' bill procedure - which involves both public and
private interests - or using the 1992 Transport and Works Act.
The DoT is already committed to one hybrid bill for the high-speed rail
link, and is unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a second.
Under the Transport and Works Act, Mr MacGregor could simply lay an order
before parliament. But public inquiries could delay the project for at least
10 years.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Protest and celebration awaiting Arafat in Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'In the name of God the compassionate, the merciful - brother citizen please
help to clean the streets and whitewash the walls for the visit of our
leader.'
Palestinians in Gaza hurriedly picked up broom and paintbrush yesterday in
answer to the plea broadcast by loudspeaker vans after Mr Yassir Arafat, the
veteran Palestinian leader, decided that today would be the day of his
triumphant visit after decades of struggle and exile.
Mr Arafat, who brought forward his plans after a request by Israel's chief
Sephardic rabbi that the visit should not take place on Saturday during the
Jewish sabbath, also jolted the Israeli right wing into a frenzy of
activity. Rightwing leaders, some threatening Mr Arafat's life, were last
night co-ordinating a nationwide effort to muster demonstrators against a
man who one rabbi called a 'modern-day Hitler'.
The government put 8,000 policemen on alert to deal with Israeli protests.
Officials described the move as one of the biggest mobilisations ever
carried out to thwart the threat of civil disorder.
Even the most senior PLO security officials were caught off guard by Mr
Arafat's decision. He is scheduled to pass through the Israeli-Egyptian
Rafah crossing at 2.30pm and travel in a long convoy to Gaza City to a
hero's welcome. Up to 350,000 Palestinians are expected to turn out for
their first glimpse of the legendary figure who has embodied the spirit of
Palestinian resistance and nationalism.
Roadsweepers and repairmen were busy cleaning away dust and filling in pot
holes outside beachfront hotels where Mr Arafat and his party are expected
to stay.
Mr Arafat's supporters in Gaza mixed awe with disbelief at the impending
visit of a man many Palestinians believe has superhuman powers.
'It will be the most important day in Palestinian history,' said Mr Hamdi
Abu Sultan, a shopkeeper in the Jabalya refugee camp.
But opponents, who believe Mr Arafat has sold out Palestinian rights and
aspirations to Israel in return for limited local powers, said they would
boycott the visit. The Islamic resistance movement Hamas said it was
considering raising black flags as a sign of mourning for the Palestinian
cause.
In Israel, Mr Arafat's visit has ignited similarly high emotions. The Yesha,
the council of some 100,000 Jews who have settled on Israeli-occupied
Palestinian land, offered a reward for Mr Arafat's capture alive.

FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed in a positive light, Inchcape's decision not to increase its stake in
Gestetner can be seen as a reaffirmation of the company's commendably
cautious approach to acquisitions. Rather than make a blind bid for the
whole of Gestetner a year ago, Inchcape preferred to proceed on a
suck-it-and-see basis by buying a 15 per cent stake, two seats on the board
and the chance to peruse the internal accounts. The acquisition of a Pounds
3m option gave Inchcape the chance to buy more if it liked what it saw. That
it has not is no disgrace.
The more negative interpretation, though, would be to question what Inchcape
was up to in the first place. Given Inchcape's long-standing relationship
with Ricoh, it was always going to be tricky to deepen its involvement with
Gestetner. It is understandable that Ricoh would want to keep its
distribution options open. That suggests Inchcape's adventure was was
somewhat misconceived from the start.
Inchcape has been left with a fair chunk of capital and management resource
tied up in a different business. Inchcape may be able to develop some useful
trading relationships with Gestetner in the far east but the linkage must
count as a strategic diversion. Still, Inchcape has more pressing issues to
worry about. The inexorable rise of the yen against the dollar will be
causing greater headaches given Inchcape's reliance on selling Japanese
goods abroad.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At one level, falls of some 3 to 5 per cent in leading clearing bank shares
yesterday were a strange reaction to Abbey National's decision to halve its
current account overdraft rate. Since Abbey has only Pounds 13m in overdraft
business in its balance sheet, its overall lending margin will hardly be
affected. That does not seem to warrant a fall of over 3 per cent in its
shares. Since it has only around 3 per cent of the market in current
accounts, it could double its own business in this area without having much
impact on the competition. It would have been different if a large player
like National Westminster had slashed its rates. Then its own fall of 5.4
per cent would have seemed a modest reaction.
Still, after cigarettes and newspapers it is clear that the equity market
does not like price wars. Banks look vulnerable to the phenomenon. While
many complain bitterly about over-capacity, their actual returns in the
retail sector are quite high: net return on shareholders' funds at TSB, for
example, was an annualised 15.5 per cent in the six months to April. That
leaves plenty of room for margins to come under pressure.
The uncertainty is about timing. The example of credit cards shows that
established issuers like Barclaycard can hold out against new entrants who
undercut them. While overall loan demand remains slack, there is little
incentive for big banks to cut their high retail margins on activities that
really matter. They simply risk losing profit without adding volume.
Paradoxically it is when loan demand picks up that price wars could really
start.

FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate strategies are often a matter of post facto rationalisation. So it
has been with Asda. The company's dedication to improving sales from
existing space largely reflects the lack of any alternative. With the
weakest of the big grocery brands and severe financial restraints in the
past, Asda was forced to stop opening new stores some time ago. So it sought
another means of salvation. Fortunately, its emphasis on permanently low
prices and increased productivity has anticipated the needs of the 1990s
perfectly well.
Asda is therefore at present registering the strongest like-for-like sales
increases in the sector. It is, of course, easier to make such gains from a
low base. But one should not dismiss the real progress being made. The
harder task will be to devise a new store format that can compete with the
best in the business and fuel long-term earnings growth. On that score, Asda
still has it all to prove.
Asda's impressive trading recovery, though, does not yet translate into a
compelling financial case. Those shareholders who backed Asda's cash call 18
months ago will be dismayed that the shares still languish 1p below the
rights price. They will also be irritated at Asda's habit of revising the
value of its properties. The decision to depreciate ageing stores should
have been taken long ago. Clearing the accounting decks twice in two years
either reflects a present obsession with cleanliness or - more plausibly - a
somewhat careless approach in the past. Asda is not alone.

FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Plaster model
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether companies can restore profit margins to the levels of the late 1980s
is a recurring question for the UK equity market. Yesterday's full-year
figures from BPB give reason for optimism. While plasterboard prices are
still 25 per cent below the peak - and are unlikely to rise much from here -
the company's drive for efficiency has started to show results. Operating
margins widened from 7 per cent to almost 12 per cent last year, with more
to come as capacity utilisation improves. Another two or three points of
margin combined with gently rising turnover would more than justify the
current rating of the shares.
In many respects, plasterboard is a special case. Unlike petrochemicals or
steel, recession has dramatically thinned the ranks of manufacturers.
Competition among the three dominant European companies is hardly cut-throat
and selling prices are already well above the trough reached in the early
months of 1992. What Pilkington would give for a similar recovery in glass
prices. Plasterboard is a growth product thanks to changing construction
methods, so the remaining overhang of capacity is less of a worry than in
other industries.
BPB has also made an unusually bold move into continental Europe, which now
accounts for more than half of turnover. Companies which have all their eggs
in Mr Kenneth Clarke's basket may face the future with less confidence. Even
allowing for such caveats, though, yesterday's figures serve as a reminder
of how geared to recovery many UK industrial companies have become.

FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD calls for firm action against inflation
</HEADLINE>

The turbulence on the world's financial markets could be eased if monetary
authorities in the industrialised world took more action to underline their
commitment to low inflation, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development said yesterday.
The call came as the OECD unveiled its latest half-yearly outlook, which
revised its forecasts of growth upwards for the first time since 1991, with
industrialised economies expected to expand by 2.5 per cent this year and
nearly 3 per cent in 1995.
With the recovery now well entrenched in the US and UK, growth in
continental Europe will be boosted by rising exports, said the Paris-based
OECD, which represents 25 of the world's industrialised nations.
Meanwhile, Japan's economy will begin to grow by the second half of this
year, boosted by rising domestic demand.
But the recent bout of market instability and the rise in long-term interest
rate expectations could undermine those projections, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara,
the OECD's chief economist, warned yesterday.
If the yen strengthens significantly - as it has done in recent days - this
is likely to slow the pace of the Japanese recovery by reducing Japan's
exports, Mr Shigehara said. And though the dollar's slide against the yen
has not yet been repeated against other currencies, a weaker dollar would
fuel US inflation.
Meanwhile, the recent rise in long-term interest rates, and the broader
market turbulence, suggests that governments should make more effort to
emphasise their commitment to low inflation, without overreacting to every
market movement, Mr Shigehara said.
'More effective articulation of clear commitments to sound public finances
and price stability, and, where necessary, decisive corrective actions . . .
would contribute importantly to the stabilisation of market expectations.'
Although Mr Shigehara declined to point the finger at any particular
government, the OECD's outlook suggests that the US may be one country where
such clearer commitments would be particularly welcome.
Nevertheless, Mr Shigehara warned against 'overreacting' to erratic market
swings and stressed that the recent rise in interest rate expectations could
not be solely attributed to inflationary pressures but also reflected
traders' rising bond yield expectations and growing aversion to risk.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Hard work to be free and single: A look at the opportunities
and constraints of a single European market in insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buy a simple 10-year-term life insurance policy in Portugal and you can
expect to pay more than three times what you would spend on exactly the same
contract in France. The difference demonstrates clearly the case for a
single European market in insurance.
From today, such big price discrepancies may begin to fade as a result of
new rules freeing up restrictions on cross-border trade in the European
market. But the continent's 320m consumers will not see benefits overnight.
Experts inside and outside the insurance industry expect change to be slow.
The European Union expects that five of its 12 member states will implement
the so-called 'framework directives' by today's deadline. All but two
countries - Spain and Greece - should have done so by the end of the year.
The directives mark the final stage in a programme to liberalise the Dollars
470bn (Pounds 309.2bn) a year life and general insurance industry, extending
changes introduced in the commercial market in 1990.
The directives do two things:
First, they make genuine 'cross-border' trade possible by allowing insurance
companies to sell their products anywhere in the EU on the basis of
regulations in their home state, the so-called 'single licence' or 'single
passport';
Second, insurers throughout the EU will be allowed to set their own rates
for all classes of insurance policy. They will no longer need to submit
policy wordings to local officials for approval, thus effectively
dismantling the highly regulated, protectionist regime behind which much of
the industry has sheltered.
National regulators will focus their attention on the underlying financial
health of companies, following the practice already well established in the
UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. 'Supervision will be based on the
undertaking itself, its solvency, its shareholders, its management - and no
longer on its products or its rates,' says Mr Francis Loheac, secretary
general of the Comite Europeen des Assurances, the European industry
association.
Today's directives are the culmination of legislation started in the 1970s,
which gave European companies the right to set up subsidiaries throughout
the Common Market. An initiative approved last year, the insurance accounts
directive, should make it easier for investors to compare the financial
strengths of competing companies.
Although many countries - notably France and Belgium - have liberalised
regulations well in advance of today's changes, the rules will have an
immediate impact elsewhere in the EU. The changes will lead to what Mr
Loheac calls a 'veritable revolution' in Italy and Germany, the two
countries slowest to adapt to a deregulated environment. For example, the
two countries will be required to remove controls on their motor liability
insurance rates - the sector where minimum rates still apply.
The overall effect of the changes in regulatory approach will further
increase competition, eroding the cartel-like arrangements through which
large national companies - such as Allianz of Germany, Union des Assurances
de Paris of France and Generali of Italy - have long dominated their local
markets.
In more regulated markets such as Germany, companies are being forced to
underwrite more selectively, varying premiums in areas such as home and
motor insurance according to the risk and the likelihood of a claim. New
products such as unit-linked life insurance contracts, which offer consumers
potentially greater returns on their investment, are being introduced.
'Our companies are now competitors. Before, it wasn't seen as gentlemanly to
be envious of the market share of a rival,' says Mr Wautier Robyns de
Schneidauer, an adviser to the Belgian Union of Insurers, which introduced
new rules in 1991.
Nevertheless, despite the injection of greater competition into the
industry, price differentials are likely to stay in place for the immediate
future. Mr Jean-Paul Coteur, a legal adviser for Test-Achats, the Belgian
consumers' association, says he has had to disappoint dozens of recent
callers anxious to benefit from lower prices.
'I have to tell them that it won't be possible to go abroad,' he says. 'They
know they can get it cheaper but it won't be possible. We've had a dozen
people a week ringing us over the last six months.'
Factors ranging from price, to local tax and legal conditions and consumer
buying patterns will conspire to hold up implementation of a true single
market.
First, the incidence of claims varies widely across the EU. For instance,
motor insurers must take into account varying degrees of road safety and
different levels of court awards to accident victims across member states.
Second, the level of service offered by insurers can differ. 'Belgian
consumers expect their brokers to drive to their homes at all hours of the
day to settle claims. I don't know whether that makes economic sense or not
but that is what people have come to expect,' Mr Robyns explains.
Third, despite the common regulatory framework of today's directive, legal
disparities remain. Some classes of insurance - kidnap and ransom policies
in Italy, for example - are illegal in parts of the EU. There are fears that
interpretations by national regulators of the 'general good' - a Europe-wide
legal principle could restrict the commercial freedom of companies despite
the provisions of the single licence. Moves to vary premium rates for
certain classes of customer could be seen as discriminating against groups
such as ethnic minorities.
Fourth, variations in tax regimes will have an impact on life insurance
business because sales are often driven by tax advantages. While
restrictions to cross-border sales have been lifted by the new directive, a
European Court ruling of 1992 keeps others in place. Individual member
states can still limit the scope of tax advantages to some life insurers.
Mr Jean-Pierre Fevre, director of financial institutions at the European
Commission, says 'it will take a long time to deal with the tax differences.
We have to reach a compromise between people's freedom to contract services
and the rights of tax authorities to collect money.'
Fifth, cultural factors will also inhibit cross-border trade. Most
continental insurers market home, life and motor insurance through networks
of exclusive local agents, who enjoy long-term and loyal relationships with
customers. Many people are thus unlikely to switch companies on price alone.
Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British
Insurers, expects inter-EU trade to be restricted to specialised niches,
such as sophisticated investment policies for wealthy individuals.
Despite all these constraints the directive opens up long-term opportunities
for insurance companies to penetrate each other's national markets. But to
do so, they are likely to be forced to set up operations elsewhere rather
than to rely on cross-border trade. In particular, control of retail outlets
will be essential if products are to be sold successfully. Thus mergers and
acquisitions are gathering pace.
EU reports on competition policy show a constant 20 per cent annual growth
in the number of insurance company mergers as the pace of takeover activity
in the sector picks up. A flurry of recent purchases, which has seen Union
des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurer, buy Germany's Colonia for
about FFr20bn (Pounds 2.36bn) and Switzerland's Winterthur buy DBV of
Germany for an estimated DM900m, culminated in early June with the
announcement by Commercial Union of the UK that it proposed to pay Fr12.5bn
for France's Victoire.
Mergers are not the only strategy, however. Recently, in a bid to enter the
German market, companies such as Zurich of Switzerland and Axa of France
have started to focus on forming direct telephone sales offshoots, following
the success of similar methods developed in the UK by Direct Line and
others.
Ultimately, these strategies are likely to spur the development of a single
market. But it will not depend for success on customers' response to the
cheaper and more attractive products on offer. Rather, the pace of change
will depend on the level of corporate activity and the ability and
willingness of individual companies to take risks in exploiting a more open
environment.

The break-up of British Rail has given the various operators a field day in
passing the buck. Wednesday's rail strike afforded a signwriter at Guildford
station this opportunity to confuse:
'Whilst South West Trains are not directly involved in the dispute we regret
the problems that this will cause.'
It's not our fault guv - but we'd like it to be.

Guess where the National Union of Mineworkers is holding its annual
conference this weekend? No, not Scarborough, Eastbourne or even Jersey.
Arthur Scargill will rally what's left of his union in Blackpool's Miners'
Convalescence Home. But the agenda's familiar enough, including a motion for
a Pounds 90 a week across-the-board pay rise and the threat of strike action
if they don't get it. They will also be discussing Angola etc. No wonder the
NUM has shrunk from nearly 200,000 members in 1985 to fewer than 10,000. The
physiotherapists' union has more members.

A final savoury from Corfu. When European Union leaders were asked to mark
their cards in favour of candidates to succeed Jacques Delors as president
of the European Commission, the only piece of paper to hand was the dinner
menu.
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian premier, came top with eight votes; but cote de
veau came in second, with Ruud Lubbers third, and a Greek dessert fourth.
Sir Leon Brittan managed only fifth with just one vote, from John Major.
Brittan is upset. The Greek presidency's decision to hold a formal vote,
rather than simply register disagreement or consensus, meant he was unable
to retire gracefully without anyone discovering the level of his support.

Brazilian dexterity is not limited to the soccer field. The Dart family, the
polystyrene-cup billionaires holding Dollars 1.4bn of old Brazilian bank
loans, who refused to join the giant bank debt restructuring in April, has
sued the Brazilian central bank. They are seeking Dollars 60m of back
interest and accelerated payment of the Dollars 1.4bn.
The Darts are about to find out that their cup runneth not over. In
anticipation of their attitude, the Brazilians ensured the collateral which
backs the debt restructuring was not held - as is traditional - with the New
York Fed. Instead, it was placed with the Bank for International Settlements
in Basle, in the hope of keeping it beyond any court action. Sensible move.

No word yet on Sir Andrew Hugh Smith's plans after he steps down as chairman

he will succeed Rosalind Gilmore as chairman of the Building Societies
Commission.
A former Treasury boffin, he helped draft the Building Societies Act. One
drawback - does the BSC have a long-term future? And the job is only a
Grade-II civil service post - so Hall might have to take a hefty pay cut.

Why did Hong Kong's legislative council cram its deliberations on governor
Chris Patten's democracy proposals between the start of Wednesday and the
ungodly hours of Thursday morning, when matters wound up at 4.50am?
Patten wanted the session to span two days. To his annoyance - he must be
getting annoyed at the frequency with which he is annoyed these days  - he
was overruled by John Swain, LegCo president.
Swain had an urgent appointment elsewhere. He had to be at Britain's Sandown
Park for today's big race - the Pounds 80,000 Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club
Trophy.

One day it's random shelling by the Serbs, the next it's goat for supper;
who'd be a Bosnia-based British squaddie?
Among the weighty topics pondered by the House of Commons' defence
committee's statement on Britain's 1994 defence estimates, paragraphs 42-45
consider the rations of British forces serving in former Yugoslavia.
The British army is apparently under pressure from the United Nations to
adopt a (cheaper) UN rationing system. The UN is fed up with paying the
Brits 'twice the UN per capita rate'.
Mind you, they have funny ideas about these matters at the UN. A UN 'food
week' is either six or seven days; 'even-numbered' weeks have six days,
'odd-numbered' seven. On six-day weeks the poor old UN campaigner must eat
the rations he carries with him - 'to turn over stocks'.
Leaving that little problem aside, there is the question of the UN's menu.
Its idea of a square meal is 'faloukorv without garlic', while such
delicacies as black pudding, Marmite, steak and kidney pudding, shredded
wheat and muesli, are off-limits.
This is a 'far from trivial concern' thunders the defence committee, which
is counting on ministers to intervene to prevent any deterioration in either
quality or quantity of food on British mess tables. So okra-bashing may not
replace the spud awhile yet.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Hosanna in oasis: Bruce Clark follows the trail of western
diplomats to an Orthodox Christian enclave in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual number of black limousines with diplomatic plates have been
spotted recently in the winding alleyways of Fener, a rundown stretch of
waterfront on the Golden Horn of Istanbul.
Travelling in these august vehicles have been foreign ministers, or top
diplomats, from France, Italy, the US and Greece; and the man they visited
is Patriarch Bartholomew I, senior spiritual figure among the world's 160m
Orthodox Christians.
For a churchman who keeps a low profile, at least in his native Turkey, the
270th Patriarch of Constantinople is receiving an impressive flow of
callers.
At the same time, the 53-year-old prelate - a shrewd, genial and erudite
figure who speaks six languages - is getting some less desirable sorts of
attention.
The windows of his residence, a wooden mansion where the scent of
floor-polish and fresh flowers mingles with more pungent odours from the
street, are continually broken by stones, apparently cast by local hotheads.
Attacks on him in the Turkish press have increased since the March
elections, when an Islamic-leaning party captured the municipality of
Istanbul. In May, three small bombs were discovered on his doorstep.
There is a growing threat to the delicate compromise that allows the
Patriarchate, a 1,600-year-old legacy of Byzantium, to remain on the soil of
mainly Moslem Turkey.
That in turn explains why he is getting so many high-level visitors: for the
importance of the Patriarch, and his right to remain in Istanbul, is
increasingly clear to the governments of the world. With the parting of the
Iron Curtain, a much older division - between eastern and western
Christendom - has recovered its relevance in the affairs of Europe.
The ancient rift between Orthodox Christians (who include most Serbs,
Russians, Greeks, Romanians and Bulgarians) and Roman Catholics (who include
most Croats, Slovenes and Slovaks) is now an issue in modern geopolitics. It
is stoking passion in former Yugoslavia and threatening to divide western
and eastern Ukrainians.
So for diplomats as well as theologians, it matters more and more what the
Patriarch says; and also where he resides.
His existence as a tiny island of Christianity in a Moslem Turkish sea is
precarious; and for that reason, he has a vested interest in advocating
ethnic and religious tolerance. Interviewed in his dignified but far from
luxurious quarters, he presented the Orthodox view in much more conciliatory
language than is generally heard in countries where his flock are the
majority.
On the future of Turkey, a country of which he is legally obliged to be a
loyal citizen, he is a strong advocate of the liberal, pro-western ideals of
Kemal Ataturk, the state's founder.
'There are obstacles to Turkey's full entry into Europe, but they should be
overcome. Turkey should become a full member of the European family, where
she has so much to offer.' He welcomes the fact that some fundamentalists
have been purged from Turkey's army and education system; but he is alarmed
by the sight of women wearing Islamic dress, and by calls for Islamic law.
'The fundamentalists have become better organised, more emboldened . . . It
will be harder now for anyone to rein them in.'
Yet the Patriarch - in contrast with the frank intolerance of many churchmen
in Greece and Russia - is an advocate of dialogue with the 'great
monotheistic traditions' of Islam and Judaism as well as with the other
branches of Christianity.
Patriarch Bartholomew is unequivocal in denouncing the anti-Jewish prejudice
which informs the public comments of some hardline Russian bishops. 'It is
to be condemned, because it runs counter to religious freedom.'
He acknowledges that links between the Orthodox world and the Vatican have
deteriorated, because of jostling for souls in Romania and Ukraine. For
three years, the Orthodox side has suspended talks about theological matters
until quarrels over believers and buildings can be settled.
Yet he continues to make conciliatory gestures, even at the risk of
appearing 'soft on Rome' to his flock. This week he sent an envoy to the
Vatican who was warmly greeted by the Pope.
As for the Anglican churches, he predicts, with a certain mischievous
relish, that they will soon accept the Eastern view on the key theological
dispute, concerning the significance of the Holy Spirit, which divided East
and West in 1054.
'We say that the truths of the undivided Church are as follows: alpha, beta,
gamma, delta . . . You have added certain things - where do you get them
from?'
But as he speaks, his measured Greek phrases are almost drowned out by
another sound, carried across the sweltering air: a muezzin is calling the
Moslem faithful to prayer.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Privatising Post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The green paper on the future of the Post Office published yesterday
contains no surprises. The government's preferred option is to sell 51 per
cent of the Royal Mail, with a regulator and statutory guarantees to protect
universal service. The counters division would be hived off into a separate,
state-owned body to meet concerns about wholesale closures among Britain's
20,000 sub-post offices.
The object, now widely agreed, is to free the Post Office to act
commercially, while meeting public concerns about the maintenance of a
universal postal service and village post offices. The government's favoured
plan meets that object in all respects. There is no good reason to delay
legislation beyond the next parliamentary session.
The green paper sets out two other options: first, to privatise the Royal
Mail in its entirety; second, to keep the utility wholly within the state
sector, with guarantees of greater commercial freedom.
A case could be made for either course, but neither is practicable in
today's circumstances. Public opposition to a sale, already evident, might
become irresistible if complete privatisation were proposed. In any case,
the usual practice is to sell a company the size of the Post Office in more
than one tranche. Once 51 per cent has been floated, it would be open to a
future government to seek parliamentary approval to proceed further.
The other option - commercialisation within the state sector - is more
problematic. On the continent such a policy has worked effectively; and
since the Post Office will remain, for most of its business, a monopoly
utility, it has attractions. However, obtuse Treasury restrictions make it a
non-starter in Britain. It was difficult enough getting the Treasury to
agree to allow fishing licences to be sold across Post Office counters.
There is no chance of it allowing Post Office managers to run their business
like others aiming for strong medium-term growth and profitability.
The green paper's proposal - under all three options - to give the Post
Office's counters division greater freedom is to be welcomed. Far better to
allow sub-post offices to offer more banking services and sell lottery and
concert tickets than to profess an undying commitment to their future while
closing them by stealth.
However, the future of the Post Office's letter monopoly is inadequately
treated by the green paper. The monopoly currently extends to all addressed
letters costing less than Pounds 1 to deliver. The government says it wants
to reduce that towards the price of first-class postage. How far towards it?
And does such a reduction imply that the monopoly will rapidly wither on the
vine of inflation? Those questions, vital to the future of competition and
universal service, need to be addressed directly before legislation is
introduced.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Building on the recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since 1991, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development has been able to revise its projections upwards. It now
expects the output of its members to grow 2.6 per cent this year and 2.9 per
cent in 1995, up from 2.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively, in its
forecasts of last December. Never mind the forecast, the upward revision is
itself an excellent indicator of recovery. The principal question now is how
to make recovery as long and as strong as possible.
The recovery in OECD countries - still divergent, but becoming less so  - is
an important element in a brightening global picture. Aggregate growth in
the dynamic Asian economies - Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand
and Malaysia - is expected to remain at about 7 per cent in 1994 and 1995.
China's economy is growing faster still. The Latin American economies are
expected to grow at about 4 per cent in 1994 and 1995, while output is even
beginning to rise in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Market-led growth has not only become global, but the Uruguay Round trade
agreement should, if ratified, ensure that it stays so. OECD-wide inflation
is also lower than since the 1960s, with aggregate inflation in the group of
seven leading industrial countries forecast at only 2 per cent in 1994.
The effort to eliminate the high inflation of the 1970s has now succeeded
and must not be repeated. All OECD countries need to create institutional
arrangements that not only prevent inflation from getting out of hand once
more, but do so credibly.
Perhaps the most important obstacle to securing that goal is their fiscal
positions. Between 1989 and 1995 the ratio of general government gross debt
to GDP in the OECD countries is expected to rise from 58 per cent to 72 per
cent. It should then stabilise, argues the secretariat, though under what
seem to be optimistic assumptions. Worryingly, real interest rates are now
higher than the likely long-term rate of growth of most OECD countries. In
addition, members have substantial net pension liabilities - of more than
twice GDP in some cases.
The question investors in bonds ask themselves is whether governments might
find an inflationary default tempting. The answer depends on how heavily the
burden of debt weighs upon them. On some countries, it weighs heavily
already: in Italy, for example, net debt interest makes up a fifth of all
government spending. There are other important reasons for undertaking
further fiscal consolidation. But the most important is to make sustained
low inflation more credible and inflation-risk premia in long-term interest
rates correspondingly smaller.
Inflation, like fiscal deficits, is not an immediate problem for most major
countries. But the beginning of a recovery is the ideal time to tackle
longer-term constraints. The world enjoys a splendid economic opportunity.
Governments should be thinking now about how to ensure it lasts.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Not the SFO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The division of labour between Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the
Fraud Investigation Group (FIG) of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has
always been somewhat arbitrary. While the SFO has more draconian powers both
to investigate and prosecute, both organisations deal with serious and
complex fraud cases. It is therefore hard to argue with the suggestion of an
official review body that the less difficult element of FIG's case load
should be shunted elsewhere in the Crown Prosecution Service and the heavier
stuff handled in a merged organisation, as foreshadowed by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice.
The review nonetheless flunks an important test in failing to decide whether
the merged body should be placed in an enlarged SFO or within the Crown
Prosecution Service. This is admittedly a hot potato, since it invites
questions about why the government felt impelled to set up a separate
high-profile agency in the first place and whether it remains committed to
attacking serious fraud. While administrative logic would point to the
merged body going into the CPS, such an approach would clash with the CPS's
existing policy of remaining independent of the police and not being
directly involved in the investigative process.
Part of the advantage of a merger is that the SFO's very effective powers of
questioning and evidence gathering under Section Two of the Criminal Justice
Act 1987 could be extended over a larger number of serious and complex
cases. This would imply either a big increase in investigative resources, or
an extension of Section Two powers beyond the SFO's lawyers and accountants
to the police. Yet there is bound to be unease about any increase in the
area of the criminal justice system in which the right to silence no longer
applies - especially since the review body found that the authorisation
procedures for the service of Section Two notices were surprisingly
informal. A wide debate on the procedures suggested by the review body for
the issue of such notices is needed.
That said, the administrative case for a merged organisation to deal with
serious and complex fraud is overwhelming on resource allocation grounds and
is further strengthened by the recent decline in the SFO's case load. The
real question is how to go about it. Practical considerations point to an
enlargement of the SFO, since the alternative option of putting the merged
body within the CPS would require legislation. The Criminal Justice Act
would have to be amended and the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 might also
require adjustment. This would delay implementation of the reform until at
least 1996, which would cast doubt on the government's enthusiasm for the
task. Given the mixed record of the SFO since its inception, that is a poor
political signal to be sending now.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Bloomin' bureaucrats: Japan's unloved, overworked civil
servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just before 8pm, in the heat and humidity of a Tokyo summer evening, a
young, grey-suited bureaucrat sits back in his chair in his office on the
15th floor of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, tugs at
his grey tie and takes a breath of the stale air around him.
Under the ministry's regulations, the air conditioning was turned off at
5.45pm when business officially finished for the day. But for Tatsuya
Terasawa, 33, deputy director of the Americas division, work is far from
over.
As is the case most nights, he will be lucky to make it home on the last
train, a little after midnight. More likely, he will take a cab from
Kasumigaseki, where Japan's central ministries are concentrated and the
cream of its civil servants work, to his flat in suburban Tokyo in the early
hours of the morning.
Even by Japanese standards, Terasawa's lifestyle is not an enviable one. Yet
his devotion is being appreciated less and less. Once seen as the architects
of Japan's postwar economic success, the country's 1.2m bureaucrats are
increasingly seen by politicians, businessmen and the public as relics of an
antiquated order, scheming to protect their authority and privileges at the
expense of economic and social progress.
Japan's uniquely pervasive web of official regulations, which govern most
aspects of life and give the bureaucrats their authority and power, is
criticised for stifling entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth.
'Bureaucrats say they don't have money, but they dig up the roads several
times a year, build unnecessary dams, luxurious public offices and cultural
halls. They are like blinking traffic lights on a deserted road,' complained
one letter this week in the Nikkei, Japan's business daily.
Outside Japan, US negotiators have blamed the intransigence of Japan's
bureaucrats for the failure of the two countries to reach a trade agreement
when President Clinton met the then Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa in February.
In response to these pressures, the Japanese government is trying to weaken
the influence of bureaucrats. On Tuesday, a detailed deregulation package
was unveiled identifying a number of regulations, implemented by the
denizens of Kasumigaseki, that could be abolished. The package aims to
reduce business costs in housing, telecommunications, imports and
distribution, and financial markets. Japan's new prime minister, Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, has promised to continue the previous government's policy of
deregulation.
The powerful business group, the Keidanren, the federation of economic
organisations, wants the government to go further. It recently asked Prime
Minister Tsutomu Hata, who resigned last week, to halve the number of
regulations policed by the bureaucrats of Kasumi-gaseki.
The response of Mr Terasawa to this assault sounds almost hurt. 'We must
realise that the bureaucracy has its limitations but at the same time it is
critical to getting things done,' he says. The belief in his own importance,
shared by many of his colleagues, has been bolstered by Japan's political
turmoil, which has left the running of the country in the bureaucrats' hands
while the politicians have been pre-occupied with political survival.
The political vacuum has also strengthened Mr Terasawa's conviction that
'bureaucrats are the ones who make the policy options, who implement policy
and, in many cases, determine policy'. He believes the role of politicians
should be restricted to making a small number of decisions on controversial
issues - such as taxation, opening up Japan's rice market, and national
security.
But it is such self-assurance that has fuelled much of the criticism of the
civil service. 'The problem with Kasumigaseki today is that policy
determination and implementation have become muddled together and have
hampered administrative efficiency and led to the unnecessary expansion of
the bureaucracy,' says Mr Shino Namikawa, secretary general of the Citizen's
Forum for Renewal, an organisation set up by the government to make
suggestions for administrative reform.
Mr Terasawa's defence is that the Japanese bureaucracy is in fact an agent
of change in Japanese society. 'Bureaucrats are often described as being
like Chinese mandarins. But I think the reality is very different,' he says.
Mr Terasawa, who was educated in the US, says the role of Miti is to
encourage deregulation and act as a 'catalyst to speed up social change'.
That, he says, is a very different attitude from that of the bureaucrats who
were running Miti even a few years ago.
As a further example of how Japan's bureaucracy is changing and catching the
public mood, he cites the latest trade talks with the US.
'My generation does not feel that we have to bow to every wish of the US,
but the US has not been able to keep up with this change. They still expect
Japan to come to a summit meeting with an omiyage - a gift. That is one
reason why the February summit failed to produce an agreement,' Mr Terasawa
says.
But the flaw in his argument is that the pressure in Japan is not for a
civil service prepared to take political decisions - but for one that does
not impose a political point of view at all.
An elite corps of administrators which believes it has the right to make
decisions of national interest and direct every detail of the country's
economic and social life no longer seems relevant to a highly educated and
well-informed public which increasingly seeks the freedom to make its own
choices. It is a message that, if heeded, would force the the Japanese
bureaucracy to rethink its raison d'etre. 'The belief that we are doing
something good for the public is the source of our pride,' Mr Terasawa says,
as he reflects on the modest 1960s flat he calls home and the long hours
away from his wife and two chil-dren.
The compensations for such self-sacrifice are meagre. As a graduate of the
University of Tokyo law department with a second degree from Harvard
Business School, he would probably be earning double his current salary if
he had gone into banking instead of the civil service. During his two years
in Miti's Americas division, dinner has more often than not been a box-meal
from a local caterer.
'Unless you have a strong belief that you are doing something for the good
of Japan, you won't be able to work under such conditions, he says. 'There
just wouldn't be sufficient motivation.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Floated on a royal wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We Republicans for Charles are right. Most of the opinions expressed by the
Prince of Wales are sound. As the founder and to date sole member of R4C, I
can say that we agree with nearly every word he said in his self-promotional
film on Wednesday night.
Not about his private life. That is none of your business, or mine. The
public life of the heir apparent is what concerns us. The charities he
supports are admirable. Their beneficiaries are found in all sections of
Britain's ethnically mixed population. Indeed, the Prince projected himself
as the opposite of a nationalistic little Englander. He would have no place
in the xenophobic wing of the Conservative party. The respect he showed for
other faiths, including Catholicism, Judaism and Islam, is in tune with his
affirmation that there is a spiritual dimension to life.
He may or may not be a Tory, but he appears to be of the one-nation
persuasion. He is right about the ugliness of much contemporary
architecture. He is a Green, and a believer in civic virtue. Like many of
us, he thinks that some form of national service, not necessarily military,
should be re-introduced. This could be a winner. Rootless, jobless school
leavers have to be found something constructive to do.
Clearly, Charles is running for king. His theme is the return of quality to
British life. Lovely platform; shame about the office. This is the point
upon which Mr Jonathan Dimbleby failed to press the Prince. I am too kind.
'Failed to press' be blowed. The younger Dimbleby dodged the key question.
He might have have put it softly thus: should the British monarchy be
privatised, sir? Not abolished. There is no call for that. Turning the
dynasty into the independent Palace Trust would suffice. As purchaser of
head of state services the government could award a contract to this or that
hereditary institution to become sole provider. There might be competitive
tendering. Other European or more far-flung royal houses would be qualified
to bid. The monopoly should be regulated, by Ofthrone. Lord St John of
Fawsley would be an ideal choice for First Regulator.
Don't mock. The arbitrary use of the royal prerogative by ministers and
civil servants is no joke. It constitutes a fatal flaw at the centre of the
British non-constitution. To put it right, the crown must be detached from
the letterhead under which the executive does as it pleases. Let royalty be
a living flag for all to salute, not a fig-leaf for an elective
dictatorship. This is a serious constitutional proposal. Arguments for,
against and around it will be found in Power and the Throne, a forthcoming
book arising out of the debate on the monarchy organised by the Times and
Charter 88 last year*.
As Lady Williams, the former Shirley, puts it, 'the executive in Britain has
something very close to absolute power; it hides behind the Crown as a way
of hiding from us the extent of that power'. Let us list the areas in which
such power is exercised. The result is breathtaking. Under the royal
prerogative ministers may conclude treaties, move interest rates, appoint
anyone they please to any public position they like, award honours and
peerages, manage the civil service, and fill endless volumes with delegated
legislation, all without requiring prior approval from parliament. Most of
the real deciding is done by officials.
The courts act as an uncertain brake upon the exercise of this huge quantity
of authority. Prince Charles intimated in his film that he finds it
difficult to influence the Home Office or the Foreign Office, let alone the
Treasury or other departments. Yet all of them take thousands of decisions
every year, under cover of his mother's name, and free of any check or
balance.
Change may come. Mr Jack Straw, campaign manager for Mr Tony Blair in the
Labour leadership contest, favours a new Act of Settlement. That would
reposition the Crown within the British polity. 'We should aim for a
situation where all powers exercised by the executive, and by the monarch,
are based upon statute, sometimes . . . reinforced by direct decisions of
the electorate through referenda,' he writes. Mr Straw's ideas are not
always taken up by his party. Labour is, however, committed to a number of
constitutional reforms, all of which would diminish the power of the central
executive. Give Scotland its own parliament. Entrench local government. Pass
a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. Replace the House of
Lords by a senate. These little things add up. Suddenly you have constrained
Whitehall.
The Prince of Wales was not asked about these matters, but it cannot be
taken for granted that he would oppose all or indeed any of them. He might
well support some, if only his interlocutor had the wit to inquire. His
desire to be sworn in as defender of all religions rather than the church
founded by Henry VIII for concupiscent reasons suggests a willingness to be
separated from at least one of Britain's constitutional arrangements. Good.
But the monarch is one thing, disestablishment quite another. The prince
could be defender of the spiritual life and bishops could still sit in the
Lords, if that is the way we chose to arrange matters.
Republicans for Charles can therefore claim that the House of Windsor would
benefit from becoming semi-detached. The monarchy is in difficulties because
it is under intolerable pressure. In my hot-headed youth I was an
uncompromising republican (Ofhead), but I have since been persuaded that in
Britain there is merit in the continuity of a floated-off royal house. It is
a fine tourist attraction. On a more elevated plane it serves as a focus for
national sentiment.
Cutting it free from the barnacled substructure of our unwritten
constitution would strengthen it. The occupant of the throne could become a
private person, the essence of nationhood. As Sir John Stokes, former
Conservative MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, put it: 'It is very important
if you are going to war your oath is to the Queen and not to the . . .
secretary of state for defence . . .' Fine, so long as said secretary of
state derives his authority from the people, and not merely from his
officials' ability to deploy the royal prerogative according to whim.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Over-stated case against
herbicide-resistant oilseed rape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor MICHAEL J CRAWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While it is prudent to exercise great caution before introducing any
novel organisms into the environment, Dr Alan Wrelton (Letters, June 23)
over-states the case against the introduction of herbicide resistant oilseed
rape.
Dr Wrelton writes that 'it is obvious to anyone that oilseed rape is
colonising set-aside land and marginal habitats such as motorway verges'.
Precious little in ecology is obvious] Oilseed rape is not colonising
set-aside land. The plants you see growing there have come from a bank of
seeds in the soil, left over from previous cultivation. As to motorway
verges, oilseed rape is rare on older, undisturbed sections. Detailed study
shows that most of the populations of oilseed rape are ephemeral: here one
year and gone the next. The fact that many more rape plants are seen on the
side of the M25 motorway heading towards the seed processing plant compared
with the opposite verge suggests strongly that the source of the plants we
see each spring is seed spilled from lorries en route to the crushing plant,
rather than recruitment from an established population.
Detailed experimental work comparing invasiveness of conventional oilseed
rape and genetically-modified, herbicide tolerant rape showed no evidence at
all that genetic engineering led to increased invasiveness (1993, Nature
363, 620). It is important to remember that genetic modification which
creates tolerance to one herbicide does not confer tolerance to other,
different kinds of herbicide. If ecological risk assessment is to be taken
seriously, then it needs to be based on firm evidence rather than idle
speculation.

Sir, Observer criticises Railtrack's presentation of its case and suggests
that this failure may be because my heart is not in my job ('Wrong track',
June 28).
I cannot pretend that restructuring the grading and working practices of
4,600 key Railtrack staff presently grouped in 14 grades with a wide range
of allowances and enhancements for their varied responsibilities is easily
simplified. I hope that effort and persistence will enable us to explain the
value of our offer.
I am concerned, however, at the suggestion that I lack the commitment to do
so. That is wholly untrue.
I have been extremely fortunate in my recent career. It was a privilege to
work for the late leader of the opposition and his team, as it has been
since to work for ScotRail, among the most talented and high-achieving of
the BR profit centres. I am equally enthusiastic to be able to play a part
in Railtrack's task of safeguarding the future prosperity of the rail
network. I am touched by your concern for my heart but can assure you that
it is, as ever, in my work.

<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Gillian O'Connor's comment (Serious Money, June 25) in which
she states that 'sticking to the UK (stock market) is the global equivalent
of keeping your life's savings in a box under the bed'.
This could hardly be less true today when an increasing proportion of UK
national product is earned in trade with the 'global market' and as a result
of the UK's high level of investment overseas. The UK stock market is
unusual because, unlike other leading stock markets such as New York or
Frankfurt, its largest constituents trade predominantly outside their home
markets.
Although it is reasonable to spread investments across other markets,
including (for the brave) the emerging markets, it is also possible to have
a globally balanced portfolio with the majority of constituents quoted in
London.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: G7 must be more democratic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor H W SINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Ground rules wanted' (June 29), Edward Mortimer writes
of 'the intense suspicion with which the G7 is regarded by many third world
governments'. As he indicates, the G7 is suspected of 'colonial nostalgia or
greed for oil'.
This, however, is not the full story, nor even the main story. The main
limitation of the G7 must be seen in the fact that it is highly
unrepresentative. The countries of the G7 represent little more than 10 per
cent of the world's population. This is surely a thoroughly undemocratic
method of handling problems of global macroeconomic management. In
particular the third world, with a majority of mankind, is completely
unrepresented, even though it is deeply affected by decisions in the G7.
There is a strong case for the enlargement of the G7 by at least adding,
say, Brazil for Latin America, South Africa or Nigeria for Africa, and India
for Asia. One alternative would be for the UN in the person of the
secretary-general to act as a spokesman for third world countries. Another
alternative suggestion for making the process more democratic is to vest
global economic management in a new UN Economic Security Council - this is
elaborated in the current 1994 Human Development Report published by the UN
Development Programme.
Whatever the method chosen - and there are other alternatives apart from the
three mentioned here - the case for broadening the scope of global
management is incontrovertible. Hopefully this will make the process more
effective as well as more democratic.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Printing price fall not so great
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The UK printing industry has maintained its efficiency through
recession but prices have not tumbled as Mr Erwin Konigs, of Linotype-Hell,
suggests (Technology: 'Death of a craft', June 28). He says 'the price of
printing has been cut in half in the past two years or so'. Printers have
competed hard during this recession and continue to give extremely good
value. Let's not exaggerate, however; today's price for printing ranges from
1990 levels to 5 per cent below that.
At the depth of the recession it was 6-10 per cent below the peak touched in
mid-1990. We believe this to be achievement enough and would not like to
pretend to have done better.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iniquitous measure for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T S SHUCKSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex ('Securing Goode returns,' June 24) described the initiative of the
actuarial bodies formally to downgrade cash equivalent by assuming higher
(equity-based) returns for all but older pension scheme members as 'nifty
footwork by the actuarial profession'. What for shareholders and corporate
management may look like nifty footwork will look like sleight of hand to
cognisant scheme members. The government should not condone deception of
scheme members based on esoteric (and unconvincing) argument.
I believe I am not alone in the actuarial profession in thinking that
equity-based 'cash equivalents' are iniquitous. They should be condemned as
a false measure. It cannot be right for a value to be elastic according to
the convenience of pension schemes for meeting minimum funding (solvency)
standards and easing the burden of debt on employer liabilities in the event
of winding-up.
It is disturbing that when preservation in final salary schemes is still far
from satisfactory, proposals should be countenanced which degrade an
important early-leaver right, viz to a transfer payment properly reflecting
defined preserved benefits. After all, most members will be early leavers
and few full-term retirement cases.
The government should by contrast be introducing clarifying legislation
making it crystal clear that cash equivalents must be calculated by
reference to comparable investments, ie on a gilt-edged basis with cautious
allowance for reinvestment of income and full credit for the relief of
schemes from expenses of future administration.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: The Russians bring drama to Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARKADY OSTROVSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's first big season in Paris was in 1909, with Diaghilev's Ballet
Russe. Now, Theatre De L' Europe Odeon in Paris has decided to revive the
tradition. It has announced a Russian season, this time of drama, and
invited two directors - Lev Dodin, the well-known artistic director of the
famous Maly Theatre from Petersburg; and the completely unknown 25-year-old
Ivan Popovskii, director of the new Studio of Petr Fomenko.
'This was a huge risk', says the Odeon's director, Borja Sitja, 'but we
wanted to give a chance to a young Russian company'. For the young Russian
company, however, touring in the west is not just a chance to show their
work to the world, but also the only way to survive economically; Lev
Dodin's company, for example, spends more time abroad than in Russia -
prompting the Russian critic Anatoly Smelyanskii to remark: 'It will soon be
necessary to set up a Russian season in Moscow, not in Paris'. But the young
actors of Fomenko Studio realise the primary importance of their work in
Russia.
For the Russian season in Paris, Ivan Popovskii did not just chose a
'typically Russian play' but one which interested him artistically:
Aleksandr Blok's The Show-Booth, or Baraque de Foire, which is little-known
in the west and rarely done in Russia. Written in 1906 and originally not
intended for theatre, this 'lyric drama', as Blok called it, was produced
the same year by the great Vsevolod Meyerkhold and was seen as a sign of a
new century.
In this symbolistic drama, mysticism and death are confronted with the
life-enhancing theatre element in the form of commedia del' arte characters.
Pierrot, Colombina and Harlequino break through the boundaries of their
stories and start living lives of their own. Death turns into Colombina;
masks conceal facelessness; Harlequino breaks through the window made out of
paper and the whole world turns out to be just a dream.
Ivan Popovskii's production lacks any tragic atmosphere. This young director
is not in the least interested in linking his work to the modern history;
his imagination is occupied with theatrical effects. Although not the most
deep, it is certainly one of the most beautiful productions done by a
Russian company in recent years. The scenery, designed by Vladimir Maximov,
plays a role of its own.
The production turns into a series of beautiful pictures, full of
breathtaking, almost cinematographical, effects. In the last scene all the
characters walk out through the white walls of an irregularly shaped room,
made out of paper, leaving man-size dark holes. The wind makes the scraps of
paper tremble and a draught brings into the room a strange woman in black
who goes through the lighted aisle of the auditorium and disappears in
darkness.
This strange, almost shadow-like, dark figure comes from another play by
Blok, The Unknown, or L' Inconnue, a play about vulgarity, a poet and his
illusions. Here Popovskii has given the poet the opportunity to meet his
double from Show-Booth - Pierrot. These two romantics, one in black, the
other in white, go through the series of Popovskii's tableaux like two
Picasso figures, never looking at each other but as if connected by an
invisible string.
Popovskii's production reminds one that besides everything else, theatre can
be beautiful and rich in its visual effects. The main problem of this
production in Paris, however, is that the lighting, scenery and sound
effects take the priority and leave little space to actors and the author.
Popovskii gets carried away by theatre facilities that are not available in
Russia. Like someone who has not eaten properly for a long time, he falls
upon the cakes and forgets about the meat.
The Show-Booth tours France next year.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Hamlet from the Cape - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A difficult evening. British ballet owes a great deal to South African
dancers in such crucial figures as Nadia Nerina, Maryon Lane, John Cranko,
David Poole, and it is pleasing that the Cape Ballet should make its first
overseas tour under the new dispensation to London. We know that the past
decades have been difficult for South African ballet, and artistic isolation
has inevitably thrown the troupe on its own resources. But the Hamlet with
which the company opening its Wells season on Tuesday night is an odd
calling-card.
Veronica Paeper, Cape's artistic director and chief choreographer, is a
prolific creator, her works including John the Baptist, Sylvia in Hollywood
and Nell Gwynne. Alas, her Hamlet is an altogether too innocent guided-tour
of the play. With many danced versions of literary masterpieces, you tick
off the Great Moments as they lumber past: 'Here's To be or not to be', and
'Caramba] we've only got to the Player scene - there's a hell of a long way
to go yet'.
So it was on Tuesday. Peter Klatzow's commissioned score is effective,
atmospheric, a sure support for the drama. Peter Cazalet's clever permanent
set can be castle (one wonders a bit about the gigantic candelabra that edge
on and off, trembling the while) or battlements, with costuming that gleams
very brightly. Miss Paeper dresses the stage efficiently in crowd-scenes.
The problems lie in the naivetes of her choreographic manner, and of the
company's dance style.
What we see is uneasy and superficial as step and manner. Narrative
procedures are no more than hints of what Shakespeare tells us, movement
trapped rather than transcending. Expression becomes dumb-show of a
predictable kind - a sexy Gertrude climbing over Claudius in a sub-MacMillan
duet; Hamlet with two expressions: anguished and more anguished - while the
cast make sudden and impulsive irruptions into classic dance, as if wanting
to take it by surprise and thus get the better of it. They do not succeed.
The academic style of the company is not well served, nor did I see the
assurance and clarity that classical movement should have. Some dancers were
vivacious - and rather too much so; others looked ill at ease. The
choreography skittered around its subject; the dancers did not provide the
emotional weight, the technical gravitas, to convince me that the evening
was anything more than a display of the flimsy. Two later programmes will, I
trust, be a better portrait of the ensemble.
The Cape Ballet is at Sadler's Wells until July 9. Sponsored by Unifruco

FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Allied pushes upmarket with the RSC - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is six months now since Allied-Lyons announced the biggest arts
sponsorship in the UK - Pounds 1m a year, for three years, to support
overseas touring, educational work and new productions at the Royal
Shakespeare Company, plus another Pounds 100,000 to help advertise the
company. How is it shaping up?
Well, the budget has already grown by a couple of hundred thousand a year,
thanks partly to Allied's acquisition of Domecq which will mean plenty of
reprinting of the sponsor's new name, but mainly to an enthusiastic early
response to the consumer promotions linked to the sponsorship.
Allied-Domecq is an unusual arts sponsor, being a packaged goods company
with millions of consumers each day. This month its first promotion
exploiting the RSC connection starts to appear in its chain of Victoria Wine
off-licences, which it is pushing upmarket: buy RSC tickets for this August
and you get a free programme, a free interval drink, and Pounds 5 off your
next purchase of wine.
In the near future similar special offers on tickets for the RSC are likely
to appear in its smarter pubs, and on Allied brands, which range from Tetley
tea bags to Teachers whisky, in the more middle class supermarket chains,
like Sainsbury's. The company is deliberately using the sponsorship, and the
reputation of the RSC, to raise its image.
The first promotions were aimed at shareholders and employees, and offered
free membership of the RSC and discounts on tickets. The initial take up
exceeded forecast, hence the need to raise the budget. The main benefit from
the link, helping Allied to expand into overseas markets on the back of
visits by the RSC, has yet to happen, although the RSC is booked to visit
California in October. The only problem to arise to date is that the
meticulous advanced programming of a packaged goods company does not match
the more immediate, improvisational, scheduling of a theatre company, but
Allied-Domecq already sees the sponsorship extending way beyond the initial
three years.
It also envisages extending its theatrical links to embrace the Fringe as
well as the RSC. Allied owns three of the main pub theatres in London: the
Bush, the Gate, and the Kings Head. It has already helped the first two and
intends to support the Kings Head, as well as getting behind pub theatre
nationally.
A few years ago there was deep concern about the future of the great British
university museums. As the universities were starved of funds to educate
students, shoring up the collections at the Ashmolean, the Fitzwilliam, the
Courtauld, and others, came low in their order of priorities.
But the museums themselves seem to have risen magnificently to the crisis,
thanks mainly to the rallying round of sponsors, both corporate and
charitable. The Courtauld is currently displaying some of the finest
Impressionists in London, thanks to Pounds 250,000 funding from Cantor
Fitzgerald, the American finance company, which supports art in the US but
has never before backed a show in the UK, while the Ashmolean at Oxford has
just announced one of the most lavish bequests in its history.
The Headley Trust, the personal charitable foundation of Tim and Susie
Sainsbury, has put up Pounds 4.5m to create beneath the museum forecourt a
cafe, shop, lecture room, and more. This is the biggest donation by the
trust since it made the major contribution to the Sainsbury wing at the
National Gallery.
In the last six years the Ashmolean has raised Pounds 8.5m from sponsors and
is well on the way to securing the Pounds 1.5m needed to build four new
galleries for Eastern art and antiquities.
Reuters has never been a major arts sponsor in the UK but it is getting
behind the Endellion String Quartet for its four concerts at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall, starting on Wednesday. To add spice to the events it is
mounting an exhibition in the QEH foyer of photographs and videos with a
musical theme drawn from its archive, including the young Menuhin, Bernstein
at 70, and more.
Reuters will also support the Endellion Quartet in a residency at MIT in
Boston next April, with a total budget approaching Pounds 40,000.
The National Lottery seems likely to make life even tougher for those
companies with a reputation for sponsoring the arts. For the government is
intent on linking the money destined for the arts and heritage to the
success of arts organisations in drumming up matching funding.
Last week, for example, the National Theatre announced that it was planning
a Pounds 7m rebuilding programme, and anticipates lottery money, but it
knows that it must raise half the total, Pounds 3.5m, by appealing to its
corporate friends, rich patrons, and Trusts.
So companies will be courted twice - for sponsorship to make possible live
performances, as at present, and for donations to act as the trigger for
lottery cash for capital developments. It may work for the big
organisations, like the Royal Opera House, which has already assembled a
band of rich patrons ready to write out their cheques when the lottery money
arrives, but it could prove an impossible challenge for smaller and medium
sized regional arts companies - and for their long suffering sponsors.

Having been scraped off the highway (again) only last week by paramedics
from the ambulance service, I will not have a word said against these
splendid people. But do we really need another ambulance-chasing series? I
would have been less than keen to have a film crew record my every groan as
we charged into casualty, yet that is precisely what Paramedics sets out to
do (8.30 BBC1). Broadcasting bosses would sooner drink Sauternes with their
salmon than countenance a series called 'Women Behaving Badly', but in this
age of rampant feminism it is OK to have a series poking fun at men and
called Men Behaving Badly. To be fair, men do have the toughness and
emotional stability to let such stuff wash over them whereas women, poor
frail things, need the broadcasters' protection (9.30 BBC1). Does ITV's new
chat show, Tarbuck Late, hosted by comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, have any chance
of taking viewers from C4's new series of the improvisation contest Whose
Line Is It Anyway? (both 10.30). In tribute to the late Rudolph Cartier BBC2
shows his Nineteen Eighty Four (11.15).

FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Mamet goes minimalist - Martin Hoyle finds the
playwright's latest work too flimsy for words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Oleanna's shock tactics fresh in the collective theatregoing memory and
Glengarry Glen Ross revived at the Donmar, a third David Mamet play has
opened in the West End. The Cryptogram flutters into the Ambassadors Theatre
like an insubstantial wisp of memory; a sensitive and elusive short story of
childhood, perhaps, unwisely spun out to theatrical length (only just: even
with interval the evening is short though not, alas, rapid). For a world
premiere by America's leading playwright the occasion is strangely flat. The
management has offered London first refusal. I for one refuse it.
For all his popular identification with strong language and thrusting macho
values, Mamet is a versatile writer. Glengarry presents a frieze of flat
characters as frozen in hieratic postures as in an ancient Egyptian
inscription. All immediacy and impact, they lack a past, history,
backgrounds. His new play is the reverse, soggy with significance, every
action and sentence setting off resonances that will plainly affect the
small boy at the centre of the action for the rest of his life.
This is John, aged ten, who cannot sleep and hears voices, and whose father
has just left his mother. She finds out by accident and is at first
comforted by Del, a family friend and for some reason homosexual. In the
course of their talk it emerges that the departed Robert had borrowed Del's
room for assignations with another woman. As a sort of hush-money he passed
on a German survival knife, as one does to compliant chums, that he won in
the war (this is Chicago, 1959). Donny, the wife, reveals that the knife,
far from being the spoils of combat, was a souvenir bought in the streets of
London. Devalued, it is finally given to the child, as guilt and shame are
passed from one generation to another.
Little effing and no blinding; but there remains the Mamet trademark of
elaborately jagged, and perfectly interlocking, jigsaw dialogue. Equally
calculated is his shy at Pinterese: a teasing, repetitive interrogation
which squeezes out revelations with the almost ritualistic spareness of
minimal music. Bob Crowley's sets desperately attempt to add something to
this flimsy meandering: a dark room, a staircase, suddenly transparent walls
that give glimpses, big deal, of kitchen or child's bedroom though no sign
of the emperor's new clothes.
The piece is acted for more than it is worth by Lindsay Duncan, a stylishly
intelligent actress who has been wasted in more bad plays and/or misguided
productions than Equity has resting members. She manages to make lines like
'I am not God; I don't control the world' sound deliberate instead of
autopilot domestic-drama writing. Interest naturally focuses on Eddie Izzard
as Del. Parted from the drag that he frequently affects, the stand-up comic
plays from his own persona: rueful, puzzled, inquisitively following a line
of thought that results in a slap in the face. A fleshy young man in a
sports jacket bearing a more than passing resemblance to a youthful Michael
Grade, Izzard is remarkably assured in his first dramatic assignment, apart
from an occasional anticipated cue that increases his air of naturalness.
Danny Worters is a touchingly reproachful boy.
If minimalism appeals to you, The Cryptogram may prove rich with hidden
meanings, allusive, echoing. Or you may find it precious, pretentious and
pompous and the hell with it.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology: Smart selling to big spenders - Databases will
soon be able to tell stores what individual customers like for breakfast,
explains Victoria Griffith in a series on electronic retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every salesperson would like to see into the minds of customers, to know
exactly what they want and when they want it. While telepathy is beyond
modern technology, many retail businesses are turning to the next best thing
 -databases with extensive information about consumers.
In the US, Europe and Asia, companies are developing sophisticated
computer-based programs to store customer details, from addresses and
telephone numbers to monthly consumption of fax paper and expensive wines.
Clever marketing executives can turn this information to their advantage.
If a New York resident shops regularly at Giorgio Armani on Madison Avenue
and is known to spend time in France on business, Armani might be well
advised to tell the consumer about its Paris store.
Information can also help retailers screen out less attractive customers -
ones who only buy deeply discounted items, for example, may not be worth
courting.
Most marketing is still highly unselective. Gourmet cooks are unlikely to
dine at McDonald's but still see commercials for Big Mac hamburgers on
television. A proportion of McDonald's advertising budget, therefore, is
spent on people who will probably never enter the fast-food outlet.
Targeted marketing, on the other hand, allows companies to reward loyal
customers and avoid wasting money on promotions to unlikely buyers. Because
it can cost so much to attract new customers, maintaining a loyal customer
base can make a huge financial difference.
'The longer a company keeps a customer, the more money it stands to make,'
says Frederick Reichheld of Bain and Co, a Boston-based consulting group.
'This is not only because companies do not need to spend as much money on
advertising to recruit new customers. Faithful customers are also important
because the longer they have done business with a company the more money
they tend to spend.'
The methods that retailers use to build their databases vary. Consumers must
be enticed to reveal information about themselves. For catalogue companies,
which have addresses for all their customers, the task is easier. LL Bean, a
Maine-based sporting and leisure goods mail-order company, has sales
histories that go back decades.
Retail stores, such as consumer goods manufacturers, have a harder time
tracking purchasers. Asking people to write in for free products is one way
to build up a database. US cigarette companies have used this method
extensively over the past few years, maintaining comprehensive lists of
smokers. The scheme also means that smokers may be the only ones to receive
magazines that carry cigarette advertisements - the non-smokers receive the
same publications without the advertisements.
Retailers often ask customers to fill out a card so they can be informed of
forthcoming sales. In this way, shops can build up a substantial mailing
list. But such methods produce limited results, usually nothing more than an
address and perhaps a telephone number. Retail tracking is more efficient
when done with magnetic stripe cards that automatically register purchases
in a computer program.
Staples, the Boston-based office-goods retailer, offers shoppers a free
membership card when they make their first purchase at the store. The card
entitles shoppers to discounts on selected items and provides valuable
information to the chain. Since customers are encouraged to use their card
with each purchase, the company can track how much of certain items the
customer is buying, at what times of the year and at what prices.
Staples can evaluate a number of company strategies. It can assess the
impact on sales of a particular fax paper being displayed prominently in a
store. It can also use the database to bring back customers who have
defected. If a consumer has purchased large amounts of copy paper each month
for two years and suddenly stops, a company representative can try to find
out why and respond. Staples now provides a delivery service after
discovering that the lack of one was a main reason for defections.
The widespread use of credit cards means they can be an important source of
information. American Express provides a service to retailers that can help
target specific customer needs. In the UK, it is about to experiment with a
new system that would provide information about products to likely buyers on
the monthly credit card bill.
'If someone buys a lot of food at a department store but has never entered
the wine section, the store might offer a free bottle of wine with the next
purchase,' says Maureen Bailey, for the group. 'That information would show
up on the American Express bill.'
Companies are increasingly exchanging information, maximising information
about consumers and cutting the cost of building and maintaining the
database. An important cross-fertilisation scheme is being launched later
this year in the UK. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph of the US is setting up
a new scheme, called Istel, to help retailers build databases and provide
incentives to loyal customers. Under the programme, customers will be
invited to join the Istel club, entitling them to a magnetic stripe card and
potential discounts on various items available in do-it-yourself shops,
grocery stores, petrol stations, clothing and toy shops, and other retail
groups.
The scheme has a recruitment target of 8m card holders, and AT&amp;T estimates
that consumers will be able to save about Pounds 180 a year by using the
card when they shop at member stores. AT&amp;T will process the information
obtained from the card users for the retailers.
'The grocer may like to know who is a high spender within the scheme but is
not shopping with them,' says Ruth Kemp, for the group. 'Then they can offer
incentives to use their store. Retailers will also know for the first time
who their customers are.
'When people move house, for example, retailers often lose valuable
customers. With the information on the database it will be possible to track
customers. They could tell them where their nearest store now is, offer them
incentives to shop there and provide them with a 'welcome to your new home'
pack.'
Not everyone is happy with retailers' new love affair with databases. The US
media has heavily criticised the 'Big Brother' aspect, which allows
companies to record so many details about people's lives.
AT&amp;T says it will proceed with caution. 'All the current data protection
laws will be strictly adhered to and the card holder information will remain
confidential to each individual retailer,' says Kemp.
'Customers may choose not to be sent any direct marketing. Our research
shows that consumers' irritation with direct marketing is with unsolicited
mail that is of no interest to them.
'The information held will result in tightly targeted direct marketing, so
consumers should receive information that is genuinely of interest to them.
For example, if we see you are buying a lot of garden products, you may well
be interested in receiving a spring bulb catalogue.'
Despite concerns over information flow, membership schemes that offer
discounts and purchasing incentives seem to be the retailers' best chance of
keeping track of customer purchases. 'As part of a scheme or club, people's
sense of belonging is established by regular communication,' says Kemp.
'Participants do not see this type of communication as invasive.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Human genetic blueprint scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French researchers have launched an Dollars 11m programme to sequence and
analyse the regulatory regions of the human genetic blueprint, which make up
about 5 per cent of all human DNA. They are responsible for activating genes
and controlling the way the genes produce proteins, Clive Cookson writes.
The programme will be carried out jointly by Genset, a biotechnology company
based in Paris, and Genethon, a charity funded by an annual telethon.
Together they are setting up a Tres Grand Sequencage laboratory, which they
believe will be the first in the world dedicated to sequencing and analysing
the regulatory code - as opposed to the genes themselves.

Brightly lit advertising displays come into their own at night but can look
washed out in bright light. A new display screen that adapts to different
lighting conditions has been designed to overcome this. Black Box Vision, a
start-up company, has developed a liquid crystal display screen that will
show high-resolution, animated graphics throughout the day using relatively
low power.
The system is designed to consume less power and give a higher-quality
picture than traditional systems which use bulbs or neon light. The system
works by combining back-lighting with a reflective display, which reinforces
the picture in the daytime.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Data density with IBM sensor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM researchers in San Jose, California have made a highly sensitive sensor
for reading computer data on magnetic hard disks. They believe it will allow
information on disks to be stored nearly 20 times more densely than
currently possible by the turn of the century.
The new sensor, called a 'spin-valve' head, is five times more sensitive
than the disk-drive sensors available now. It is the first high-density
recording head designed to take advantage of the giant magneto-resistive
(GMR) effect, discovered six years ago.
Until recently, all recording heads used electrical induction for reading
and writing data on a disk. The GMR effect, which depends on changes in the
electrical resistance of very thin films of a magnetic material in a
magnetic field, is more sensitive than the induction method for reading
data.
The strength of the signal from the spin-valve allows the disk-drive
designers to reduce the width of the magnetic bit track by six times,
allowing a greater density of data on the bit head. IBM said products
containing 10bn bits of data per square inch of disk surface will be
available by 2000.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Property: Atlantic alliance - The outlook for the US and
west European markets is positive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BARTRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs are emerging of rising investment activity by US property groups in
Europe at the same time as a corresponding show of interest by their
European counterparts in the American market.
This intriguing cross-Atlantic activity reflects the difference in the speed
at which markets are moving in America and Europe.
The speed of the rise in UK commercial property values over the past 18
months, for instance, has been greater than anyone had forecast. However,
the high returns that have been generated are now at risk with the present
rise in long-term UK interest rates. This vulnerability is most evident in
over-rented investments - where rental income is considerably in excess of
today's rental value.
As a consequence, there is increasing interest in so-called 'rack-rented'
investments - where income is equal to present market value - currently the
focus of domestic investor activity in the UK largely on the back of rising
confidence in the outlook for rental growth.
A strong home market - such as the UK's - is often the precursor to a move
overseas by investors. This appears to have been the case for German
investors recently and the same factor may underlie confidence among UK
institutions' renewed engagement in European and US markets.
In west Germany commercial property yields in all sectors in the big cities
remain stable and are supported by the liquid German open-ended funds
(dedicated property invest-ment vehicles similar to unit trusts).
It is unsurprising, therefore, that German open-ended funds have been active
abroad in the 24 months since they were given the freedom to invest outside
of Germany. Today, there is still an advantage for these funds to invest in
the UK compared with their own domestic markets because property offers a
higher yield.
France, in contrast, has a quiet investment market and evidence of market
activity is scarce. Transfer costs associated with property purchases in
France add an additional 15 per cent to the overall cost, largely because of
the high level of stamp duty (in the UK total transfer costs is a relatively
low 3 per cent), a deterrent to overseas groups weighing the various merits
of different markets.
Spain, too, is the focus of attention from UK and other international
investors. After three poor years for property, values look relatively cheap
and the prospects for growth are considered excellent in an economy emerging
from recession. In both retail and office sectors investors expect good
growth and recent changes in landlord and tenant law are regarded as helpful
to investment returns.
Dutch and Belgian markets appear to be missing out on overseas investor
scrutiny; activity in Belgium in particular is low. Dutch institutions and
property funds have nevertheless always been at the forefront of those
groups active overseas, with renewed interest in the UK, US and other
European markets typical of Dutch overseas forays.
In the US, in all sectors of prime commercial property other than the best
shopping malls, yields are in the region of 8-10 per cent, while in selected
locations improved rental values are forecast within the next 12-18 months.
This suggests that on the international stage the US looks to be one of the
most attractive markets.
The combination of good growth prospects in rental value in the medium term,
the high initial yield and the ability to borrow locally at competitive
rates make the US a compelling target for international investors. German,
UK and Dutch investors as well as Middle Eastern and far eastern groups are
all actively looking at the US market.
Continental European markets all have some attraction for UK investors with
Spain and France receiving particular attention. These markets are
nevertheless relatively illiquid compared with the UK; in addition, with the
exception of Paris which is a larger office market than London, the big
cities of the continent are small by comparison with UK or US investment
locations.
Continental cities' capacity to absorb large international investor cash
flows may therefore curb the overall level of activity. By the same token,
those quickest off the mark in identifying opportunities in relatively small
European markets are likely to be well rewarded.
The principal US investors interested in Europe are the larger pension funds
keen to diversify beyond America. US funds' interest in Europe is gathering
pace at the same time as an increasing awareness of the attractions of their
home market. American investors will inevitably be better placed to spot
opportunities in their own backyard in the face of rising interest from
European competitors.
As the year unfolds, activity is likely to accelerate in markets on both
sides of the Atlantic. The speed of change has already surprised market
observers in the UK and it is gathering pace in the US. By contrast most
leading European capitals are lagging but the attention being paid to these
markets suggests that activity may soon rise there, too.
Investors are motivated by the search for high yields combined with good
quality growth prospects - a heady cocktail for those in economies with low
growth prospects and high real interest rates.
However, it is possible that there will be an insufficient number of quality
properties on the market for the large pool of investment funds available;
if this situation arises, it will add an extra dimension to the debate about
the interplay between property prices and long-term interest rates.
The present fragility of prices in the UK for over-rented investments
represents the first round in this encounter.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Management: Taxman on the move - A look at changes in UK
staff relocation prompted by new tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not every company necessarily followed the notorious example of a chemicals
multinational that once picked up the vet and tranquiliser fees for a
traumatised pet. But at least the important things in life - golf club
entrance fees near the new place of work, for example - were routinely
reimbursed.
The golden age of staff relocation, however, came to an end in Britain with
dramatic suddenness 15 months ago. The reason was not so much the adverse
economic climate - though that has certainly played its part - as the impact
of tough new tax measures announced in the March 1993 Budget, which became
effective on April 6 last year.
Described by Sue Shortland, manager of the Confederation of British
Industry's Employee Relocation Council, as 'the greatest change in the tax
treatment of relocation expenses for over 40 years', the new regime imposes
a cap of Pounds 8,000 on items deemed eligible for relief and a time limit
by which costs have to be incurred to qualify.
It also lays down stringent Inland Revenue reporting rules requiring
companies to keep track of their payments.
Eligible expenses include the cost of transporting the belongings of
employees and their families to a new residence, the normal costs of buying
and selling a home, and house hunting and familiarisation trips for employee
and family.
Expenses and benefits that could be claimed tax-free under the old rules but
which are debarred for tax-relief under the new rules include any loss on
the sale of an old residence, the initial cleaning costs of a new property,
and help with the additional costs of moving to a more expensive area.
Almost overnight, employers found themselves with tax inefficient relocation
packages and an unpalatable range of choices: meet their employees' new tax
liabilities in full by 'grossing up' any expenses over the Pounds 8,000
ceiling - an option that could mean a 50 per cent increase in the cost of a
typical relocation package; ensure that no tax problem arose by cutting the
benefits offered - easier said than done when a domestic move typically
costs Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 25,000; or force employees to meet the new
liability themselves in part or in full - hardly the most popular or
enlightened approach.
First indications of the strategies being adopted by British companies were
disclosed on Tuesday when the CBI and the accounting firm Ernst and Young
published the results of an exhaustive survey* of almost 600 businesses.
The message from the research is that while employers are not cutting back
on relocation activity as such, a growing number are seeking - and finding -
ways to contain and offset the additional expenses.
The main trends identified by the survey were:
A preference for grossing up. Before the 1993 Finance Act most companies
operated policies within the Inland Revenue's then generous guidelines. Of
the 152 respondents who indicated a change in their thinking, a majority (57
per cent) were planning to pay tax on their employees' behalf, a tenth were
making employees meet their own tax liability, a tenth were introducing a
selective policy, and another 10 per cent were capping relocation expenses
at Pounds 8,000.
Some employers have evidently adopted a compromise by grossing up direct
costs and items that they genuinely feel should be tax-refundable (such as
school uniforms) but leaving the tax on other items such as golf club
subscriptions and carpets to the employees themselves.
Others are keeping their cards close to their chests. The subsidiary of a UK
food and drink company said it will 'probably' gross up - but it has no
plans to tell employees this. 'We do not want people to spend money knowing
that the company will bear all the costs,' said a respondent to the survey.
A new enthusiasm for outright house purchase schemes, as distinct from
schemes where employers guarantee a minimum price for the property. Under
the new tax rules the acquisition and disposal costs of employees'
properties purchased outright by the employer (or a relocation company) fall
outside the Pounds 8,000 limit. The tax position regarding gains returned to
the employee had been unclear, but in April it was confirmed that these can
now be handed back without penalty provided the house contract is worded
correctly.
A tendency to withdraw or reduce the so-called 'additional housing
allowance'. This allowance no longer attracts tax relief but has
traditionally been paid to employees moving from low housing cost areas to
areas where prices are high.
The survey highlighted ways in which companies are now restricting the
allowance - cutting back the number of years it is paid, setting minimum
house price differentials (for example, 10 per cent) which have to be
triggered before employees qualify for the extra money.
More temporary accommodation reviews. Costs have been controlled by the
introduction of overall spending and time limits. 'Employees do not need the
smartest hotel in town - they can make do with something that is clean and
comfortable,' was one comment made in the survey.
A greater use by companies of external advisers (particularly in areas
connected with property), though a degree of scepticism remains.
The introduction of more efficient purchaser indices for UK expatriates
going abroad. The number of companies indicating changes in their
international relocation policies was very small, but the survey revealed
that one-third of companies pay for transportation of pets.
A widespread lack of sound reporting procedures. Almost half the respondents
either had no system or had an inadequate method for tracking and reporting
their relocation expenses as required by the 1993 Finance Act.
According to Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, employers face a
penalty of Pounds 3,000 for each incorrect submission.
Many companies, it seems, are still reviewing their policies, as
presentations this week at a CBI conference by an international oil company
and an international pharmaceuticals company underlined. Both are awaiting
board approval for proposed changes designed to address the new tax rules
and - in one case at least - likely to reduce costs substantially.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Management: Re-engineering in small doses only
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like powerful new drugs, fresh management concepts and techniques have a
nasty habit of being lapped up by gullible and voracious consumers, who
often misunderstand, misapply and abuse them.
In the 1970s this happened with the Boston Consulting Group's (in) famous
'cash cow' portfolio planning matrix. Over-zealous use of it led many
companies to dump or neglect perfectly sound businesses, and to diversify
dangerously into others. An embarrassed BCG had to re-educate many clients,
as well as its own publicity machine.
In the late 1980s the malady hit total quality management: careless
consultancy selling of it, plus inept client application, led many companies
to ignore some of its basic principles, notably customer- focus and lack of
bureaucracy. Painful experience taught them a salutary lesson, but in the
process TQM got an unjustifiably bad name in some quarters.
Now the same plague is infecting business process re-engineering. Barely a
year ago it was being promoted as a clear concept, with two specific
interpretations.
The first was the redesign-from-scratch of broad, competitively 'core'
business processes, such as product development and order fulfilment, in
order to span previously separate departments (or 'functions'). As a result,
companies were told, they could cut time and cost enormously, and also boost
their revenues.
The second interpretation was more far-reaching and, as yet, futuristic: the
reconfiguring of entire organisation structures on to a 'horizontal' process
basis.
Now the concept, or at least the term, is being misapplied to all sorts of
other changes, lesser as well as greater. Like a patient taking only a
fraction of the prescribed dosage, far too many organisations are
're-engineering' narrow, isolated parts of secondary processes within
individual departments, and are then losing heart, complaining that the
results are too meagre. In reality, they are not re-engineering at all,
merely improving their standard activities.
At the other extreme, a few consultancies are attempting to extend the
meaning of re-engineering from the 'hard' aspects of organisational change -
structures and processes - to territory hitherto occupied by experts in the
'softer' aspects of change and transformation, notably managerial behaviour,
attitudes and 'culture'.
Like a doctor trying to extend specialist knowledge to related areas of
medicine, this is an understandable strategy for an ambitious consultancy to
adopt. But it risks stretching its expertise too thin, and creating even
more confusion among the already bewildered business public.
Evidence of just how far things are going awry, for all but the small
minority of organisations applying the principle properly, came yesterday
from probably the largest survey yet conducted into the 'state of
re-engineering' in both Europe and North America.
Covering 600 companies in a wide range of industries, the study was
conducted by CSC Index, the management consultancy whose chairman, James
Champy, helped create the current frenzy in collaboration with Michael
Hammer.
The survey reveals a string of problems. CSC Index's advice about how to
deal with them is helpful for the most part, but not entirely consistent.
Nor is every aspect of its own subtle but significant shift of emphasis from
process re-engineering to fully-fledged corporate transformation.
In essence, the main problem areas are:
Poverty of ambition. Too few organisations are preceding their
re-engineering of processes with a hard look at whether their ways of doing
business - and even their corporate and business strategies - are still
competitive. As a result, processes that should be dropped are being
re-engineered, often at great pain and cost, while opportunities to use
fresh ones for the creation of new businesses are being missed.
Far too few companies are focusing on revenue growth; most are obsessed with
cost - and staff-reduction.
Not enough top and senior managers are sustaining - and demonstrating
continually - their professed initial commitment to re-engineering
programmes. Running such projects is very tricky, and cannot be assigned
wholly to lower levels.
Index argues correctly that re-engineering works best in organisations where
employees really trust their managers, make many of their own decisions,
believe they are paid for performance, operate well in teams, share
information freely, and take risks.
But such nirvanas are rare. The degree of change required to create them is
so considerable that it is unrealistic for the consultancy to say merely
that cultural change must start early in a re-engineering initiative. It
must often precede it by several years, as it did in Champy and Hammer's
original company 'models', Hallmark Cards and Bell Atlantic.
This qualifies Index's frequent claim that 'real' re-engineering requires
what it calls 'big change fast, to achieve big results fast'.
In the narrower of the two original definitions of re-engineering - the
redesign of processes - this is probably true, especially in situations
where opposition can only be overcome through a crash programme. But this is
not the way to win people's hearts and minds. In the wider sense of complete
organisational transformation, 'big change fast' tends to be a contradiction
in terms.
As Index concludes, re-engineering needs to be applied much more judiciously
than at present. For that to happen, managers and consultants alike must be
clearer-headed about the nature of this potentially potent medicine.

FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Burgess takes on worldwide role at Andersen
Consulting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Burgess, head of Andersen Consulting in the UK, is to take on a new
role as one of the worldwide firm's managing partners from the start of
September. He will become managing partner for business integration and
practice competence, which he says means 'making sure what we do and how we
do it is right'.
His replacement as managing partner for the UK will be James Hall, 39, who
joined Andersen as a graduate trainee in 1976. Hall (right) says his theme
is 'continuity'.
The change is part of a restructuring of top jobs within Andersen
Consulting, with the creation of a managing partner for 'packaged knowledge'
and two other managing partner roles (market developments, and technology
and products) being combined in Burgess's new job.
It reflects its international growth and represents a shift away from the
firm's predominant US roots; several other UK partners have recently taken
on senior roles in the international firm.
Burgess, 47, who has spent 24 years with Andersen since he gained his PhD in
solid state physics, has been UK managing partner since 1989. He was
approached about the new job by Andersen Consulting's chief executive on a
lakeside walk during the annual meeting in Geneva in May.
'I am very excited about what we have done. Being able to operate and shape
the worldwide firm were challenges I found irresistible,' he says. He will
continue to be based in the UK but will spend more time travelling and
co-ordinating activities around the world.

Pearle Vision, a US-based subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, which acquired
Pearle Health (as it was then known) in around September 1985, has got a new
president, Glenn Hemmerle, 49.
He reports to David Nash, 53, Pearle's chairman, and replaces David Hardie,
49, the former chairman, chief executive and president of the company, who
is taking up a new position in GrandMet's drinks sector, as president,
International Distillers &amp; Vintners' international operations; IDV is

Hemmerle's background is solidly in retailing, having spent 23 years with
companies such as The Gap and Musicland. Between 1987 and 1992, he was
president and chief executive of the Athlete's Foot group, and Atlanta-based
sports shoe retailer and franchisor. Most recently he was president and
chief executive of Crown Books, the retail book chain based in Landover,
Maryland.
At Pearle, Hemmerle will be responsible for day-to-day operations of the
company's 950-plus retail stores across the US and Europe. GrandMet acquired
Pearle Health's eye-care businesses in the late 1980s. The company's
six-month results, reported in March this year, showed break-even
profitability, a Dollars 33m profit improvement over an 18-month period.

FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Development Securities - on its Marx
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur who bought into Development
Securities last June, has made a further move to reshape its management with
the appointment of Michael Marx to replace joint managing director Robert
Ware.
Ware was running the troubled property developer at the time Landau
spearheaded a financial restructuring for the loss-making Clayform
Properties, which was renamed Development Securities.
Ware's contract was reduced from three years to one year last July, and his
role was widely regarded as transitional.
Anthony Bodie was brought in as the other joint managing director to manage
the company's rapidly growing property portfolio.
Ware's departure was described as 'amicable', and a spokesman said no
compensation would be paid.
His successor has also had experience of troubled property companies, as the
finance director of Gerald Ronson's Heron Corporation, where he has been
central to the group's recent restructuring.

FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Evans picks md from Yorkshire Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Evans of Leeds have been on tenterhooks this week. The
property investment company's final results are out next Tuesday and they
are supposed to be in purdah, but gossip was swelling among the business
community that Evans was about to get its first md.
Evans, though quoted, is largely owned by the locally well-known Evans
family and mostly run by vice-chairman Michael Evans, who also has interests
in a boatyard near Nice, where he would like to spend more of his time.
The company and Yorkshire Water decided to come clean yesterday with
simultaneous announcements that John Bell, managing director of Yorkshire
Water Enterprises, is indeed making the transfer, which 'will not be earlier
than October 1'.
Bell, who is 45, is a lawyer. He was a young chief executive of a small
Scottish local council before going into the water business as the old
Yorkshire authority's secretary and solicitor in 1985. He ended up as a main
board director of Yorkshire Water in charge of diversification after
privatisation and was in the news in May setting up a joint venture with
Ogden Corporation in the US water and waste treatment market.
Another diversification, however, was a series of joint ventures with Evans
of Leeds, under the corporate appellation White Rose, to develop spare
Yorkshire Water Land, which is how the property company got to know him.
So did Evans poach him after this extended interview? 'Relationships remain
friendly,' William Gibson, Evans' company secretary, said yesterday. 'They
are not waving a big stick at us. Everything is going ahead in a smooth and
amicable fashion.'
He would have liked to have kept the lid on the news until after next
Tuesday but decided rumour and gossip might be more damaging.

Michael McLintock, 33, who joined M&amp;G from Barings less than two years ago,
is following in his father's footsteps and taking a seat on the board of
Britain's biggest independent fund management group.
McLintock, who looks after M&amp;G's institutional investment business, is one
of two new faces joining the main M&amp;G board. Richard Hughes, 37, who joined
the group in 1987 and manages the M&amp;G Recovery fund, has also joined the
board.
M&amp;G portrayed the appointments as routine promotions but they do suggest
that the group is keen to rejuvenate an increasingly elderly top management
team. Paddy Linaker, the chief executive, retires at the end of the month
and is being succeeded by a man of similar age, David Morgan, 60. This has
led to some speculation that Morgan will have little more than a caretaker
role.
Michael McLintock will not be able to enjoy sitting next to his father at
board meetings. Alan McLintock, a senior figure in the accountancy
profession, retired in February after 12 years on the M&amp;G board.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Energy policy praised by IEA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's free-market approach to energy does constitute a policy -
and that is official.
The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based group of industrialised
countries, yesterday gave its blessing to the laisser-faire stance - often
denounced as a 'non-policy'.
It says in a review that while Britain's energy policy does not have targets
and prescriptions, 'it is based on a clearly articulated principle of
reliance on market forces'.
Moreover, 'the overall direction of UK energy policy can be commended as
consistent with the IEA shared goals' of open and free markets. The UK
experience could be useful to other members of the IEA who are restructuring
largely state-owned energy industries.
The accolade was accepted gratefully by the government. Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, said: 'I welcome this endorsement of our liberalisation policy.
The UK is pleased to be in the vanguard of change and a model for others to
follow.'
The IEA was not wholly unreserved in its praise. It said there were still
imperfections in the gas and electricity markets and urged action to remove
restrictions on the movement of oil and gas.
The government could do more to raise energy efficiency and improve the
environment, particularly by ensuring that the transport sector bore its
share of energy costs.
Mr Eggar said that many of the IEA's criticisms were already being acted on.
The IEA reviews members' energy policies every four years. The UK review
will be published later this year. The Confederation of British Industry
yesterday called for Europe to press ahead with opening up its gas and
electricity networks to competition as 'part of the drive to restore
Europe's international competitiveness'.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal
energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around.
He said some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals which
competed in tough international markets where energy costs had a strong
bearing on success.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Managers say strong manufacturing rise hitting supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The manufacturing sector is growing strongly, but at the cost of creating
some supply bottlenecks and price pressures, according to figures published
by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply yesterday.
The purchasing managers' index rose to 61.4 per cent in June, the highest
level since the figures were first published in 1991. The institute
constructs the index from components including new orders and employment. A
figure above 50 per cent indicates that activity has grown since the
previous month, one below 50 per cent indicates a fall.
The index was last below 50 per cent in December 1993, since when it has
risen steadily.
New orders and employment both reached record levels on the month. Order
books improved across all industries and regions, and for domestic and
export markets. Employment was particularly strong in the electrical and
electronic industries, but was described by companies as 'temporary' or
'seasonal'. Output was particularly strong in Wales, the south-east and the
Midlands.
Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at Warburg Securities, warned that the
index's short history meant that record levels might not be greatly
significant.
The institute also said that raw materials shortages, particularly in pulp
and paper, had raised prices. Its prices index rose from 57.8 per cent in
May to 59.1 per cent in June.
Furthermore, bottlenecks are appearing in the system, indicating further
potential price pressure. Delivery times have been lengthened by suppliers'
inability to meet demand requirements. The institute said that unanticipated
strong demand led to a fall in stock levels in June.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the prices data
'will worry some people because it resonates with the recent CBI survey'
which showed a jump in the number of companies planning to raise prices.
However, Mr Smith said: 'What we see in the institute survey is the
consequence of higher world commodity prices. It doesn't necessarily mean it
will feed through to retail prices.'
The institute compiles its data by interviewing a panel of managers from 300
manufacturing companies.
The UK economy will grow at 3 per cent this year and at 2.6 per cent in
1995, says National Westminster Bank. It predicts underlying inflation will
rise to 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995, near the top of the
government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range and well above the
Treasury's forecast of 2.75 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Go-ahead for Opera House scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera House was given the go-ahead on its Pounds 150m
redevelopment scheme last night by the planning and transport committee of
Westminster City Council.
The committee voted to give planning consent to the scheme - the third
master plan to emerge from the Royal Opera House in an 18-year battle to
secure public funding and planning permission to modernise its facilities,
some of which date from 1858.
The proposals approved last night were significant revisions of previous
plans. Most significantly, the opera house has dropped its controversial
proposals to build commercial offices to fund the project after the it was
advised that the plan would not work due to the decline in the property
market.
Mr Jim Monahan, chairman of the Covent Garden Community Association planning
committee, which has opposed all proposals, said: 'We will continue to
protest because the scheme is bad for the area.'
Westminster planners also gave the go-ahead last night to a controversial
scheme to create a pedestrian plaza in front of Buckingham Palace. The local
authority said it was concerned about the number of accidents at the site,
and had taken the views of the palace into consideration. However, the Royal
Fine Art Commission said it had doubts about the scheme.

Cuts in beer duty would ultimately increase tax revenues to the Treasury,
the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said yesterday.
In 'A Real Alternative', the association's 1994 Budget submission, the
brewers called on the chancellor to halve the excise duty on beer - 29.7p
per pint - in his November Budget. By 1997 they want to see beer duty
lowered to the European Union average of 8p per pint.

The number of companies failing during the first half of the year fell 15

the business-information group, said yesterday.
In the period 21,887 businesses in England and Wales entered liquidation or
receivership which did not lead to the rescue of the company.
The number of failures in Scotland over the same period fell 77 per cent to
1,529, which Dun &amp; Bradstreet said reflected changes to Scottish bankruptcy
regulations.

received an offer, Laura Tyson and Andrew Baxter write.
An Feng, the Taiwan steel group, said it was in the final stages of a deal
with Grupo F Jacinto of the Philippines to buy jointly the main equipment at
the plant, closed two years ago.
A finance manager at An Feng, Taiwan's biggest private-sector steel company,
yesterday said a deal had been agreed in principle but the price was under
discussion.
British Steel confirmed the plant was for sale but said: 'We cannot agree
that we have 'agreed in principle'.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Names see their losses judgment overturned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Appeal Court yesterday ruled that a group of 500 Lloyd's Names were too
late to begin legal action to recover insurance losses, overturning a
judgment made last year by the High Court.
The Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market,
were all members of Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year of account
and allege breach of duty by their agents.
They did not participate in a successful earlier action by fellow Names on
the syndicate which resulted in a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in
February 1992.
The ruling is a setback for Names, but has no impact on other cases
currently before the courts. The biggest action, by 3,095 Gooda Walker
Names, began in April and another large case by some 2,000 Feltrim Names is
scheduled to begin later this year.
Last year Mr Justice Saville ruled that the Names could take action against
RHM Outhwaite (Underwriting Agencies), which managed syndicate 317/661, and
approximately 80 members' agents.
Yesterday, however, the Court of Appeal ruled by two to one that the claim
was time-barred.
The Names had attempted to rely on a provision of the Limitation Act of 1980
by alleging that the defendants had deliberately concealed their own
breaches of duty, thereby denying the Names of the knowledge of their right
to sue.
The Court of Appeal's decision, which involved a detailed review of the law
of limitation over the last 350 years, was described as a 'landmark
decision' by Denton Hall, the firm of solicitors acting for the Names.
Mr Kevin Ryan of Denton Hall said: 'It will affect all litigants hoping to
rely on these limitation provisions,'
The Names will appeal against the decision to the House of Lords.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Treasury grants British Library extra cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is to put up extra money for the new British Library building
in central London in the expectation that the cash will be recovered from
contractors.
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, told the Commons national heritage
committee yesterday that the Treasury held the contractors responsible for
delays and cost overruns.
He said the cost of the library would exceed the Pounds 450m ceiling imposed
in 1990, at least in the short term.
The Treasury had agreed to fund the extra spending, having been convinced
that the extra money could be recovered from contractors, whose mistakes in
planning and installing equipment contributed to the spiralling cost of the
project.
Laing Management is the main contractor, but there are dozens of
sub-contractors.
Mr Brooke said he was confident that, after recoveries, the cost would not
exceed Pounds 450m. The alternative was for the British Library to be asked
to take possession of a building lacking some of its planned features.
MPs on committee were sceptical the government could bank on winning
possible legal actions against suppliers to the development, the most
expensive government-financed building this century.
When the new library was approved by the then Mrs Shirley Williams in 1978
on a site in London's Euston Road, it was costed at Pounds 116m and was
expected to be completed by the mid 1980s.
Poor building controls by the Property Services Agency, privatised in 1992,
and continuous cuts by the Treasury delayed the development until a much
smaller building - adding only an additional 76 readers' seats to the 1,100
in the old reading room in the British Museum - was approved.
Mr Brooke said he hoped that the British Library could take over the site in
1996. There could then be a further delay of up to two years while the stock
of 12m books was brought from almost 20 sites around London.
The latest setbacks to the development involve cabling and the sprinkling
system. Consultants are assessing the extent of the problem, and the
responsibility for malfunctions, and are expected to report in August. The
government will then be better able to give a timetable.
Mr Brooke denied allegations of illegal practices, involving contractors
spinning out the work and repeating installations. He blamed the
drip-feeding of cash in the 1980s for the rising costs.
Since becoming heritage secretary in 1992, Mr Brooke has increased
investment in the project - a move criticised by many in the performing arts
who believe that extra funding contributed to the reduction in the grant for
the Arts Council in 1994-95.
Dr Brian Lang, the British Library chief executive, told the committee that
the library wanted to take over a safe, healthy, efficient building but it
was not being over-scrupulous about the condition of the fixtures and
fittings.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Merger of anti-fraud agencies is proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office and the Fraud Investigation Group of the Crown
Prosecution Service should be merged to improve the effectiveness of the
fight against financial crime, an inquiry ordered by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC,
the attorney-general, concluded yesterday.
The report by Mr John Graham, a senior Treasury civil servant, makes no
recommendation about whether the merged body should be controlled by the
prosecution service or be in effect an enlarged fraud office. But it does
propose extending the fraud office's 'Section 2' powers to the police. The
powers, which remove the right to silence and compel witnesses to answer
questions, can be used only by the SFO's lawyers and accountants.
Sir Nicholas gave no indication of the direction of government thinking, and
said yesterday that studies into the possibility of executive agency status
for the fraud office and CPS would have to be completed before any final
decision was taken.
The report identifies a series of shortcomings in the operations of both the
fraud office and the investigation group which have different powers and
approaches to combating fraud. It makes a number of recommendations for
immediate organisational and managerial improvements.
The fraud office's management systems are not exploited fully, while the
investigation group has few useful systems in place, it says. Both
organisations should improve their use of outside barristers while the fraud
office should review its use of police officers brought in on secondment.
The report concludes that the main advantages of a merger would be to
improve resource allocation and the extension of Section 2 powers, which it
said had proved 'an effective investigation tool'.
Although it does not make a final recommendation, the report suggests the
fraud office should be brought under the control of the prosecution service,
provided it can be ring-fenced from the rest of the CPS. However, it
acknowledges that this could be politically damaging.
The report also concludes that both fraud bodies should accept cases
involving Pounds 1m or more. However, the fraud office, which accepts cases
involving at least Pounds 5m, rejected the recommendation, saying that it
does not make sense for both organisations to adopt the same financial
threshold.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Most British Coal staff face axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vast majority of British Coal's 3,000 managerial and clerical
white-collar staff face redundancy as the corporation prepares for the
run-down of activities in preparation for an end-of-year handover to
private-sector mining companies.
British Coal, which employs 12,000 to 13,000 compared with more than 200,000
a decade ago, said run-down of staff levels will start almost immediately.
Mr Kevan Hunt, employee relations director, said the majority at national
and group headquarters were unlikely to transfer to the successor companies
but would be made redundant before privatisation.
According to Coal News, the corporation's newspaper for employees, about
half of staff at national and group headquarters and ancillary activities
will leave by the end of November.
Several hundred more will go by the end of the financial year next March.
Every department will be affected, although formal discussions on the
rundown and severance arrangements have still to be held with the
appropriate unions.
The corporation said the staff rundown would be arranged to minimise the
impact on normal business.
The newspaper quotes Mr Hunt as firmly denying rumours that a pay and
redundancy package made available to employees until May 20 is about to be
re-offered.
According to the corporation more than 9,200 management, clerical,
weekly-paid staff, opencast supervisors, pit officials and mineworkers
accepted the package but 3,000 did not.
The package offered redundancy terms of up to Pounds 27,000 and a one-off
payment of Pounds 6,000 but required employees to work more flexible hours.
It was opposed by both the National Union of Mineworkers and the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers.

FT  01 JUL 94 / CSO publishes first country breakdown of invisible trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK runs large invisible trade deficits with the rest of the European
Union and the European Free Trade Association, but these are offset by big
surpluses elsewhere in the world, according to figures published by the
Central Statistical Office yesterday, Peter Norman writes.
The CSO's first ever country-by-country breakdown of Britain's invisible
trade, covering services, investment income and transfers, showed that in
1992 the UK ran a deficit of Pounds 3.94bn with the rest of the EU and one
of Pounds 3.22bn with the EFTA countries. But surpluses elsewhere produced a
positive balance of Pounds 4.79bn on the global account.
The UK had invisible surpluses of Pounds 4.39bn with Japan, Pounds 2.26bn
with the US and Pounds 1.59bn with Australasia. Inside the EU, the UK ran a
Pounds 4bn surplus with Italy, but deficits of Pounds 1.86bn with the
Netherlands, Pounds 1.26bn with Germany and Pounds 1.18bn with Spain.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Savings from recycling 'low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recycling aluminium cans and glass bottles can save energy and help the
environment - provided people do not make too many trips in their cars to
the bottle bank, according to a report published yesterday.
However, recycling is ranked low for its energy saving potential in a list
of household energy efficiency measures identified by the report.
The report was commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the generator, from the
Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment at
University College London. It concludes that if households adopted all of
the 12 energy saving measures which it identifies, then Britain would cut
emissions of carbon by 8m tonnes a year. Carbon dioxide is one of the main
gases implicated in global warming.
Under the climate change convention agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit,
Britain has agreed to cut carbon emissions by 10m tonnes a year.
More than a quarter of households are deterred from making improvements to
energy efficiency by cost, according to two Gallup polls carried out for the
centre. Only 56 per cent of respondents in the surveys had loft insulation,
a much lower figure than several government estimates.
Although recycling is 'one of the most well-known energy saving measures',
the report says, it scores lower than insulating cavity walls and lofts,
draught-proofing or putting reflective foil behind radiators.
Moreover, while Britain imports much coloured glass in wine and beer
bottles, this cannot be recycled into the clear glass required by most UK
manufacturers, the report points out.
The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors has been lukewarm
about the environmental and commercial benefits of recycling glass, because
of the transport costs and the lack of demand.
It has been more enthusiastic about recycling aluminium cans on the grounds
that it saves valuable raw materials as well as energy.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Lautro fines mutual life insurer Pounds 200,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Order of Foresters, a mutual life insurer, has been fined
Pounds 200,000 by its regulator for failing to organise its business
responsibly.
Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry,
highlighted weaknesses in the suitability, training and supervision of
staff, and in operating procedures to ensure that regulations were met.
The charges relate to a 3 1/2 year period from the beginning of 1990. The
failures were detected by Lautro during its second round of routine
inspection visits.
The Independent Order of Foresters said yesterday that it was reviewing past
business in some areas, including areas where Lautro had expressed
particular concern that mis-selling could have taken place - the sale of
whole-of-life policies and the sale of endowment policies for the benefit of
children. All its new business is being reviewed by a firm of actuarial
consultants.
Mr Arno Kitts, the insurer's chief executive and compliance officer, said
yesterday that all customers who had been disadvantaged would be fully
compensated. It has about 140,000 policyholders in the UK.
While the level of the fine falls short of the recent Lautro records of
Pounds 300,000 imposed on Norwich Union and on Premium Life, it is
significant given the relatively small size of the company in the UK - a
factor the regulator said it took into account. IOF Foresters must also pay
Lautro's costs of Pounds 17,000.
In the financial year to December 31 1993 the company reported premium
income of Pounds 25m and assets of Pounds 240m against liabilities of Pounds
180m.
Details of the charges by Lautro and admitted by the insurer are that it
failed to ensure that its sales force gave best advice to customers and to
keep full records justifying the advice; that it contacted investors who had
decided to cancel a policies within the allowable cancellation period; and
that it failed to ensure that customers had enough information about
products to make informed decisions.
Among changes made since the compliance problems were identified is a
reduction in the size of the direct sales force, from about 120 in September
last year to about 90 now.
Mr Kitts said that about half of those leaving had decided to go and half
had been de-authorised by the company. He said: 'We accept Lautro's findings
and have been working with them to ensure that we have the highest standards
of compliance in place. We are confident that the effectiveness of our
current systems will be confirmed by Lautro in due course.'
IOF Foresters is a separate organisation from the Ancient Order of
Foresters, which is a friendly society. In the late nineteenth century what
is now IOF Foresters was a part of the Ancient Order of Foresters, but split
from it in North America in 1874.
It later set up as a separate organisation in the UK, turning from a
friendly society into a mutual life insurer in the late 1890s. About
three-quarters of its customers are in the US, although its head office is
in Canada.

FT  01 JUL 94 / European road link plan widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport has added 17 new sections of road to the British
part of a controversial Europe-wide network intended to improve
communications within the European Union.
Many of the roads in England, Wales and Scotland added to the trans-European
road network (Tern) are linked with ports.
The original Tern network was only agreed last October but prompted protests
from some towns which felt they had been neglected and from other
communities fearful that inclusion in the list would lead to an upgrading of
local roads and large increases in traffic.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the revised list had been drawn
up following consultation with local highway authorities, freight transport
groups and environmental organisations. The list will be put to the European
Commission and the Council of Ministers for their final approval.
Tern consists of nationally and internationally important routes which the
EU wants to identify as a preparation for future transport needs.
Pan-European networks are also planned for rail, water transport,
telecommunications and energy.
The government and the EU have said that inclusion in the Tern list does not
mean that roads will necessarily be upgraded. But the commission is keen to
improve cross-border links and is looking at ways of raising finance for
them.
Among roads to be added to the network in England are the M27 between
Southampton and Portsmouth, the M62 and M58 between Liverpool and the M6,
the A120 between the A12 near Colchester and Harwich, and the A20 between
Folkestone and Dover. Others include the M25 between junctions 3 and 5 and
the eastern section of the M42.
In Scotland the A77 between Ayr and Stranraer, the M8/A8 Glasgow to Greenock
and the A82/A87 from Glasgow to Uig on Skye have been added. In Wales
additions include the A477 between St Clears and Pembroke Dock and the
A465/A40 Heads of the Valleys route from the M4 near Swansea to Raglan.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Merseyside faces creditors' action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, faces legal action
by creditors over the opera concert to celebrate the visit of the Columbus
Grand Regatta tall ships to Liverpool and Birkenhead in 1992.
Only about Pounds 10,000 of assets remain in Carroll Promotions, the failed
company set up with a share capital of Pounds 2 by Mr Brendan Carroll, the
corporation's public relations consultant, to run the concert.
Mr Sandy Jack of Parkin S. Booth, the liquidator, yesterday told creditors
he would not apply for a winding-up order until the Commons public accounts
committee has published its report.
Creditors include the corporation, which had to inject more than Pounds
400,000 to save the concert after poor ticket sales. Smaller creditors say
they believed the event was in effect sponsored and underwritten by the
corporation, which should therefore be held responsible for all the debts.
Mr Nicholas Corke, owner-manager of Freehand Design, who represents himself
and 13 other creditors, said yesterday: 'We believe we have a fair chance of
proving the relationship between the corporation and Carroll Promotions was
that of principal and agent, so the corporation would then be liable to pay
us.'
A contract putting Carroll Promotions at a legal arm's length from the
corporation was signed only days before the concert, when it was already
clear there would be substantial losses.
Mr Corke said a loss of Pounds 187,000 was already projected in a budget
attached to the contract. He said the contract was only supposed to operate
if they event went into profit.
The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said in a critical
report in April that eventual losses would be about Pounds 695,000.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Free-market policy on energy praised by IEA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's free-market approach to energy does constitute a policy -
and that is official.
The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based grouping of industrialised
countries, yesterday gave its blessing to the UK's laisser-faire stance -
often denounced by critics as a 'non-policy'.
The IEA says in an in-depth review that while UK energy policy does not have
targets and prescriptions, 'it is based on a clearly articulated principle
of reliance on market forces'.
Moreover, 'the overall direction of UK energy policy can be commended as
consistent with the IEA shared goals' of open and free energy markets. The
UK experience could even be useful to other members of the IEA who were
restructuring their largely state-owned energy industries.
The IEA's accolade was accepted gratefully by the government. Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, said: 'I welcome this endorsement of our liberalisation
policy. The UK is pleased to be in the vanguard of change and a model for
others to follow.'
The IEA was not wholly unreserved in its praise. It said there were still
imperfections in the gas and electricity markets and urged action to remove
restrictions on the movement of oil and gas.
The government could do more to raise energy efficiency and improve the
environment, particularly by ensuring that the transport sector bore its
share of energy costs.
Mr Eggar said that many of the IEA's criticisms were already being acted on,
and others were technical.
The UK's present policies, formulated in the mid 1980s, are intended to
return as much as possible of the energy industry to the private sector, and
to allow energy prices to find their natural levels.
The policy has come under attack from those who believe the UK should take a
more hands-on approach. Last year's coal industry crisis raised doubts about
whether the free-market policy was in the country's best interests.
The IEA reviews members' energy policies every four years. The UK review
will be published later this year in a compendium entitled 'Energy Policy of
IEA Countries'.

to sell.
The painting had a top estimate of Pounds 2.5m - but bidding dried up at
less than Pounds 1.5m. The sale of contemporary art brought in Pounds 3.3m.
and was 57 per cent sold by value. Top price was the Pounds 430,500 paid for
Black Peacock, a mobile by Alexander Calder.
On Monday Christie's failed to find a buyer for the most important work in
its auction of impressionist and modern art, one of Braque's Atelier
studies, bought in at Pounds 1.8m. That sale totalled Pounds 9.3m, but was
only 51 per cent sold.
In contrast Sotheby's had a good week. If Bacon is reckoned to be the UK's
greatest 20th century artist, Lucian Freud is regarded as probably the best
living British painter. On Wednesday night Sotheby's sold The Painter's
Room, an early work from 1943 when he was 22, for Pounds 507,500,
comfortably above estimate.
An equally youthful work by David Hockney, painted while he was a student at
the Royal College of Art, did well at Pounds 221,500. Sotheby's contemporary
sale totalled Pounds 5.15m, with 75 per cent sold by value.
This was in line with its Tuesday auction of impressionist and modern art
which brought in Pounds 19.8m and was 78 per cent sold, with an early
version of Un Bar Aux Folies Bergere by Manet making Pounds 4.4m and one of
Monet's poplar series Pounds 4.84m.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Blair promises Labour will raise rate of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday set out his plans for a 'partnership economy' in a
keynote speech intended to demonstrate his economic credentials to be Labour
leader.
Aiming his remarks as much at business as at voters in Labour's leadership
election, Mr Blair said Labour was the only party which could raise the UK's
low rate of growth.
Mr Blair, who was a Labour economic spokesman in 1987-88, is the runaway
favourite in the three-cornered contest to succeed John Smith as Labour
leader.
His address to the Engineering Employers' Federation in Birmingham was his
first attempt to set his modernising philosophy in a detailed economic
framework.
Mr Blair said Labour could win power by showing that it was the party of
opportunity and competence, and setting out a framework for coming to terms
with economic, technological and social change.
He said the way forward lay through a partnership with industry in which
government would improve education and training, encourage innovation and
technology, strike a balance in industrial relations law, and promote
longer-term investment through the tax system.
Labour had to demonstrate that the 'simple market theory' of the
Conservatives was incapable of correcting the low levels of investment that
lay behind Britain's sluggish economic growth.
On macro-economic policy he said Labour had to advance beyond a choice
between traditional Keynesian economics and the blind alley of monetarism.
He said both theories had yielded to the reality of global financial
markets, leaving an incoming Labour government with the choice of running a
siege economy or using diplomacy to influence the economic policies of main
trading partners. 'The latter is the only serious alternative,' he said.
Mr Blair attacked Tory 'incompetence' which offered Labour an opportunity to
win the intellectual battle over economic policy. He said the Tories had
created a low-success and high-tax economy in which low growth and
insufficient wealth creation led to the high costs of unemployment and
social decay.
But he also offered a challenge to his two left-wing rivals for the
leadership - Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott - by saying clearly
that the market economy was in the public interest.
Mr Blair said the 'era of corporatist state intervention' was over, and 'the
battle between public and private sector, or market versus state, is as
relevant today as the ideas of medieval schoolmen.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / TSB to shed 150 senior managers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group is to shed about 150 senior managers as part of a restructuring of
its branch network, it announced yesterday. The bank has been slimming its
staff by integrating its formerly separate banking and insurance operations.
TSB, which cut about 1,000 jobs in the first half of the year, said the
management jobs would be lost because it was consolidating three regions
into a single national structure and cutting the areas within it from 22 to
10.
The banking union Bifu said it had been told as many as 600 clerical jobs
were also threatened. TSB said that although it expected more job losses in
the second half of the year, Bifu's figure might be exaggerated.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Fresh job blow at Du Pont hits 720
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Du Pont, the world's largest nylon maker, yesterday announced it was cutting
more than 700 jobs at its British operations. Most of the job losses will be
from former Imperial Chemical Industries facilities which Du Pont acquired
last year, Paul Abrahams writes.
The UK bore the brunt of a previous round of cuts by Du Pont in September
last year when 860 lost their posts and a plant in Pontypool, south Wales,
was closed. Most of the latest job losses will be at Wilton, Teesside, where
520 posts will disappear. An additional 200 jobs will go at Gloucester and
Doncaster.
Du Pont's announcement drew sharp reactions from unions. Mr Fred Higgs,
national secretary of the TGWU general union, which represents most of the
workers due to lose their jobs, said the Teesside closure was 'a cynical
betrayal of more than 500 loyal workers who were promised by Du Pont, only a
year ago, that their jobs were secure'.
Du Pont intends to close a plant at Wilton which manufactures adipic acid, a
raw material for nylon, by early 1997. The company is setting up a joint
venture with Rhone-Poulenc of France to expand an adipic acid facility at
Chalampe, Alsace.
The group also plans to close the Wilton plant manufacturing
hexamethylenediamine, the other main raw material for nylon. The chemical
will be supplied from other Du Pont facilities, primarily in Texas and
Canada. About 160 Du Pont employees will be left at Wilton.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Creditors may sue Merseyside agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, faces legal action
by creditors over the opera concert to celebrate the visit of the Columbus
Grand Regatta tall ships to the area in 1992.
Only about Pounds 10,000 of assets remain in Carroll Promotions, the failed
company set up with a share capital of Pounds 2 by Mr Brendan Carroll, the
corporation's public relations consultant, to run the concert.
Mr Sandy Jack of Parkin S. Booth, the liquidator, yesterday said he would
not apply for a winding-up order until the Commons public accounts committee
had published its report on the matter.
Creditors include the corporation, which had to inject more than Pounds
400,000 to save the concert after poor ticket sales. Smaller creditors say
they believed the event was in effect sponsored and underwritten by the
corporation which should therefore be held responsible for all the debts.
The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, expects the losses
to be about Pounds 695,000.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Beckett puts emphasis on leadership continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, yesterday presented herself
as the candidate of unity and continuity in Labour's leadership election.
In a personal manifesto, Mrs Beckett set out to challenge the widespread
view among party members that she is the candidate of the left.
She said she believed she could win the leadership, in spite of indications
that she is trailing badly behind Mr Tony Blair, the modernist shadow home
secretary.
Mrs Beckett declined, however, to say whether she was still interested in
the deputy leadership, which she is also contesting, or if she would serve
in the shadow cabinet under Mr Blair or Mr John Prescott, the third
leadership candidate.
Mrs Beckett's eight-page glossy manifesto sets out to capitalise on her
experience as the interim leader and the only former minister in the race.
It pictures her with US President Clinton at the Detroit unemployment summit
earlier this year, in a factory, and visiting a school, recalling her three
years as a junior education minister in the 1970s.
The manifesto offers few insights into the character of a Labour government
led by Mrs Beckett, mainly because of the inability of leadership candidates
to change established party policy.
But it offers strong support to the concept of Labour as 'a very broad
church' and promises to unite the party behind an 'honest, straight-forward,
inclusive style of leadership'.
Launching the manifesto, Mrs Beckett said she knew 'the party and the
movement from the bottom up better than anybody else in the race'.
She urged the party to challenge the 'myth' that there was no alternative to
the Conservatives, who she said were 'stuck in a political and ideological
cul-de-sac'.
Mrs Beckett said Labour must change the political culture of Britain. 'We
must set people free to dream. Then we must build up a programme of how to
begin to deliver that vision,' she said.
Friends of Mrs Beckett said that the release of the manifesto had been timed
to coincide with the despatch of voting papers to the 4.5m members of the
party's electoral college.
It is designed to raise questions about the electoral appeal of the other
candidates, such as the ability of Mr Blair to defend Labour's heartlands,
and whether Mr Prescott can win fresh support in the south of England.
Mr Prescott is expected to deliver his personal manifesto - the last of the
three - early next week. The election result will be declared on July 21.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Lautro fines life insurer Pounds 200,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Order of Foresters, a mutual life insurer, has been fined
Pounds 200,000 by its regulator for failing to organise its business
responsibly.
Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry,
highlighted weaknesses in the suitability, training and supervision of
staff, and in operating procedures to ensure that regulations were met. The
charges relate to a 3 1/2 -year period from the beginning of 1990. The
failures were detected by Lautro during its second round of routine
inspection visits.
The Independent Order of Foresters said yesterday that it was reviewing past
business in some areas, including areas where Lautro had expressed
particular concern that mis-selling could have taken place - the sale of
whole-of-life policies and the sale of endowment policies for the benefit of
children. All its new business is being reviewed by a firm of actuarial
consultants.
Mr Arno Kitts, the insurer's chief executive and compliance officer, said
yesterday that all customers who had been disadvantaged would be fully
compensated. It has about 140,000 policyholders in the UK.
While the level of the fine is less than the recent Lautro records of Pounds
300,000 imposed on Norwich Union and on Premium Life, it is significant
given the relatively small size of the company in the UK - a factor Lautro
took into account. IOF Foresters must pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 17,000.
In its last financial year to December 31 the company reported premium
income of Pounds 25m and assets of Pounds 240m against liabilities of Pounds
180m.
Details of the charges by Lautro and admitted by the insurer are that it
failed to ensure that its sales force gave best advice to customers and to
keep full records justifying the advice; that it contacted investors who had
decided to cancel policies within the allowable cancellation period; and
that it failed to ensure that customers had enough information about
products to make informed decisions.
Among changes made since the compliance problems were identified is a
reduction in the size of the direct sales force, from about 120 in September
last year to about 90.
Mr Kitts said that about half of those leaving had decided to go and half
had been de-authorised by the company. He said: 'We accept Lautro's findings
and have been working with them to ensure that we have the highest standards
of compliance in place.'
IOF Foresters is a separate organisation from the Ancient Order of
Foresters, which is a friendly society. About three-quarters of its
customers are in the US, although its head office is in Canada.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Sectarianism sours Monklands contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attending the Monklands East by-election count was a bit like going to a
match between Rangers and Celtic, the pre-eminent Glasgow football teams.
It was not the signs of virtually every pub saying, 'No team colours.' Nor
was it the crowds outside the small town hall of Airdrie near Glasgow with
songs and slogans, with their benign early evening ebullience turning
predictably to nastiness as the drink took hold.
It was not even the excitement arising from an unexpectedly close fight
between Labour and the Scottish Nationalists.
The tension arose because this particular battle has been dominated, not to
say defaced, by a sectarianism relieved only by some almost farcical own
goals.
As every Scottish schoolboy knows, Rangers is a Protestant team and Celtic a
Catholic one. As in football so it would seem in politics. The main issue in
the by-election - caused by the death of John Smith - was widespread
discontent with Monklands district council's alleged favouring of Catholics.
Airdrie in Monklands East is predominately Protestant. Coatbridge in
Monklands West is Catholic. The council straddles both. It has 17 Labour
councillors out of 20, all of the Labour councillors are Catholic.
Ms Helen Liddell, 47, the Labour candidate, former employee of Robert
Maxwell, a novelist and once general secretary of the Scottish Labour party,
tried to stay aloof from the controversy, saying it was just tittle-tattle.
Then a poll showed that she was just 3 per cent ahead of the Nationalists.
Smith's own personal popularity notwithstanding, she could lose the seat.
Unthinkable.
Ms Liddell did a quick about face, said she had seen documents that indeed
showed Coatbridge had been favoured. She added that she would fight for
Monklands East irrespective of whom she would have to fight with - implying
she would take on Mr Tom Clarke, Labour MP for Monklands West, friend of
Catholic councillors and shadow spokesman for international development.
The home team were fighting among themselves.
Scottish Nationalists one, Labour nil.
Then Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, 51, a social worker, made a mistake
of her own. She said that the nationalist party would spend Pounds 23bn on
Scottish economic development, a modest over-estimate of Pounds 22bn.
Scottish Nationalists one, Labour one.
As the game went into injury time, Ms Liddell was still not predicting the
outcome. Nor was Mrs Ullrich. It was really too close to call.
Mrs Susan Bell, the Thatcherite Conservative candidate, who was heroically
defiant that she would hold her deposit amid all the religious turmoil,
looked as if she wanted to go home to put her feet up.
In the circumstances it was perhaps just as well that Ireland wasn't playing
in the World Cup last night.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Abbey cut raises prospect of price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a price war between banks and building societies to attract
personal customers was raised yesterday by Abbey National's decision to
halve the interest rate it charges on authorised overdrafts.
Bank shares fell sharply after Abbey said that it was reducing the annual
percentage rate (APR) on overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent.
Investors feared that it was the first move in a battle for retail
customers.
Most banks dismissed Abbey's move, saying that because it had only 1.4m of
an estimated 33m current account customers in the UK they would not need to
retaliate. However TSB Group said that it would 'review the position very
closely'.
Abbey's move coincided with the launch of a new current account including
24-hour telephone banking by Alliance &amp; Leicester building society. The
society will charge 15 per cent APR on authorised overdrafts, with no
monthly fee.
Earlier this month Halifax building society lowered its APR on authorised
overdrafts from 14.9 per cent to 12.4 per cent. Midland, Lloyds, Barclays
and National Westminster charge between 16.7 per cent and 19.2 per cent APR.
Barclays and Lloyds said they did not intend to reduce overdraft charges
because a high APR rate was needed to cover the cost of monitoring
overdrafts. They said they believed that Abbey might be forced to raise its
APR rate again.
Mr Peter Waller, Abbey's banking product director, said it had calculated
that overdrafts would be profitable in spite of the reduction in price. 'We
have an efficient clearing system and we are passing on the benefit to
customers,' he said.
Mr Waller said Abbey intended to maintain a lower APR rate because it saw it
as a pivotal part of an attempt to attract new customers. 'We have set our
stall out and we believe that this is a viable pricing strategy,' he said.
As banks have recovered profitability from lending losses in the early 1990s
they have started to accumulate capital. This has led to fears that they
will compete for business on price.
Abbey shares closed 13p down at 392p. Barclays shares lost 16p to 518p,
Lloyds lost 14p to 521p, and National Westminster lost 24.5p to 428p.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Mayhew assurance on north-south body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any joint administrative body proposed by the British and Irish governments
would be accountable to democratic institutions in Belfast and Dublin, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
He insisted that there was no truth in suggestions that the British and
Irish governments aimed to run the affairs of Northern Ireland jointly 'over
the heads of the people'.
Sir Patrick's assurances were challenged by Mr David Trimble of the Ulster
Unionists and brushed aside by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Ulster Unionists.
Mr Paisley also rejected a fresh appeal that he should join with leaders of
the other constitutional parties in the talks aimed at achieving a political
settlement involving the Dublin government.
Sir Patrick said that the role of the north-south body which had been
discussed would enable common cause to be made in areas of common interest.

FT  01 JUL 94 / New money for British Library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is to put up extra money for the new British Library building
in London in the expectation that it will be recovered from contractors.
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, told the commons national heritage
committee yesterday that the Treasury held the contractors responsible for
delays and cost overruns.
He said the cost of the library would exceed the Pounds 450m ceiling imposed
in 1990, at least in the short term.
The Treasury had agreed to fund the extra spending, having been convinced
that the extra money could be recovered from contractors, whose mistakes in
planning and installing equipment contributed to the cost of the project.
Laing Management is the main contractor, but there are dozens of
sub-contractors.
Mr Brooke said he was confident that, after recoveries, the cost would not
exceed Pounds 450m. The alternative was for the British Library to be asked
to take possession of a building lacking some of its planned features.
MPs on the cross-party committee were sceptical the government could bank on
winning possible legal actions against suppliers to the development, the
most expensive government-financed building this century.
When the new library was approved by the then Mrs Shirley Williams in 1978
it was costed at Pounds 116m and was expected to be completed by the mid
1980s.
Poor building controls by the Property Services Agency and continuous
Treasury cuts delayed the development until a much smaller building - adding
only an extra 76 readers' seats to the 1,100 in the old reading room in the
British Museum - was approved.
Mr Brooke said he hoped that the British Library could take over the site in
1996. There could then be a further delay of up to two years while the stock
of 12m books was brought from almost 20 sites around London.
The latest setbacks to the development involve cabling and the sprinkling
system. Consultants are assessing the extent of the problem, and the
responsibility for malfunctions, and are expected to report in August.
Mr Brooke denied allegations of illegal practices, involving contractors
spinning out the work and repeating installations. He blamed the drip
feeding of cash in the 1980s for the rising costs.
Since becoming heritage secretary in 1992, Mr Brooke has increased
investment in the project - a move criticised by many in the performing arts
who believe that extra funding contributed to the reduction in the grant for
the Arts Council in 1994-95.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Details in place for Bank shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's biggest internal reorganisation for more than a decade
will come into force on Monday when the Bank's main activities will be
divided into two 'wings' - charged respectively with securing monetary and
financial stability.
The shake-up, in preparation since December, means the departure of nine of
the Bank's top 45 managers and between 10 and 15 of the 150 high-level staff
immediately below head-of-division level. About 80 clerical staff will also
go. But the Bank will recruit more analysts, junior managers and graduates.
The reorganisation has caused considerable distress at the Bank. However, it
said yesterday that there were no compulsory redundancies. Some senior staff
have found jobs elsewhere, others have been offered severance terms, while a
special severance scheme has been opened for clerical staff.
The Bank's four existing executive directors will head the two wings,
forming the top management layer under Mr Eddie George, the governor, and Mr
Rupert Pennant-Rea, his deputy. Five officials have been appointed to a new
rank of deputy director, just below executive director level.
The deputy directors - who must count as the Bank's rising stars - are Mr
Graham Kentfield (chief cashier and banking and market services), Mr John
Townend (market operations), Mr Bill Allen (monetary analysis), Mr Michael
Foot (bank supervision) and Mr Alastair Clark (regulatory policy and
liaison).

FT  01 JUL 94 / Customers unsure of need for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, CHRIS TIGHE and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heseltine's plans for the Post Office ran into a mixture of cynicism and
fear among shift workers taking a break in Royal Mail Street, Birmingham,
outside one of the biggest sorting offices in Europe.
Among their customers, the large postal users, there was a general welcome
for the proposals - but disagreement over whether privatisation was
necessary.
As the Birmingham postal workers leaned against a wall, passing around a
news agency report on the government's favoured partial privatisation
option, there was little argument. One said: 'I can't see why they want to
sell it off when they're making these profits - Pounds 306m, wasn't it?.'
Another said: 'Everybody believes the public is going to suffer.'
Some argued that greed for profits and shares was the main motivation for
change, and that the postal workers would suffer. One said: 'They're only
out to make a quicker buck and bigger profits for the shareholders. I don't
think it's for the good of the public. To do that, to make the bigger
profits, they've got to cut jobs.'
Some said the Post Office was already cutting postal workers' jobs. There
were more casuals and part-time staff. 'It's going to get worse,' they said.
'They're going to run the post office on a part-time basis.'
There were some who regretted what they saw as the passing of the Post
Office culture. One worker said: 'The Post Office isn't the Post Office I
joined as a lad. Now it's all down to cost. A few years ago they said it was
a job for life. I can't see that going on.'
There was support for the public-sector option. 'If you keep us in the
public sector and give us the right to compete, we'd put a lot of the
competitors out of business.'
Among the large postal users there was more support for the government.
Mr Mark Elwes, director of postal and telecommunications affairs at the
Direct Marketing Association, said there was a clear need for change.
He said: 'The Post Office does need to be freed from political control. If
it is to work properly it must have long-term financial freedom as well as
political freedom. The question is whether it needs to be privatised to
achieve that.'
Mr Leon Morelli, chairman of the Mail Users' Association, said that
ownership was 'in a sense a side issue'.
He said: 'What we want to see is commercial freedom. We don't see why that
can't be given within the public sector.
'We would want to see it very strongly regulated if it were privatised.'
He added that there needed to be 'some permanent legislative link' between a
privatised Royal Mail and a publicly-owned Post Office Counters in order to
safeguard small post offices.
Mr Colin Mitchell, chairman of the European Mail and Express Services Users'
Association, said the most important issue was to remove the
Treasury-imposed external finance limit from the Post Office.
He added: 'That would be very difficult under state ownership because of the
government's attitude. I think the solution has to be one of the other two
options.'
The British Printing Industry Federation said the green paper was 'long
overdue' and that 'anything that gives greater commercial freedom to the
Post Office is to be desired'.
It was anxious, however, that a universal service with uniform prices should
be maintained.
Ms Sally Greengrass, director-general of the charity Age Concern, emphasised
the need to protect local post offices which had a 'social value to old
people and should not be sacrificed for financial targets'.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Brent Walker documents 'missing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants investigating the finances of Brent Walker received no
supporting documentation for transactions alleged to be responsible for
boosting the property and leisure group's profits, the Old Bailey heard
yesterday.
Mr Michael Oldham, a Touche Ross accountant, told the court that he was one
of a team appointed by the group's bankers in October 1990 to investigate
and report on the financial state of the Brent Walker group.
The team's inquiries were separate from those carried out by the Serious
Fraud Office at about the same time.
Mr Oldham asked for documentation about two Pounds 4.5m payments by Brent
Walker to a Tunisian bank, but was told by Mr George Walker, the group's
former chairman and chief executive, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, its former
finance director, that these records had gone missing, he said.
The two Pounds 4.5m payments were part of the attempt to conceal the
profit-boosting, it was alleged.
Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina deny charges of theft, false accounting and
conspiring to falsify the accounts of the Brent Walker group.
The prosecution alleges that the two men conspired to inflate the company's
profits by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987. The trial continues today.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Union pledges all-out protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Union of Communication Workers intends to mobilise its 160,000 members
employed in the Post Office to campaign among the general public against the
government's privatisation plans.
Postal workers have already handed out more than 2m anti-privatisation
leaflets and stickers to customers.
Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said yesterday there were
'no limits' to what the union would do to try to thwart privatisation,
although it opposed any industrial action.
Some workers may campaign unofficially in their working time against
privatisation but this will not be encouraged by the union.
Mr Johnson warned that the government would pay a heavy political price at
the next general election if it went ahead with privatisation.
The union will target Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies as part of
its campaign. Mr Johnson said: 'Conservative MPs should think long and hard
about the views of their constituents and their electoral majorities before
deciding to support such a madcap and illogical plan as that of Michael
Heseltine.'
He was confident that his union could win its campaign: 'I don't believe the
Post Office will be privatised. It is a privatisation too far.' There would
be an 'enormous public outcry' against the government's plans, he added.
Mr Johnson welcomed the government's decision to include the option for
allowing the Post Office to enjoy greater commercial freedom as an
integrated network in the public sector.
'This will achieve the goals the industry seeks without the unnecessary and
irreparable damage that privatising and breaking up the Post Office would
inevitably bring,' he said.
The union aims to appeal to the traditionally patriotic instincts of the
customers. Mr Johnson claimed that what the government proposed would
'deeply offend the national character' as the Post Office is a 'facet of
British life, woven into the fabric of society'. He added that Mr Michael
Heseltine's option of splitting the Post Office's counter services from
Royal Mail and Parcelforce was a 'mixture of political expediency and
personal ambition'.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Heseltine settles for 'new partnership' plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's preferred option for the future of the Post Office is
partial privatisation, which it calls 'a new partnership' between the
public, the state, and the industry's employees and sub-postmasters.
Dubbed the 'BP option' - after the semi-private status of the oil company
prior to its full privatisation in 1987 - the policy would involve:
The government retaining 49 per cent of Royal Mail and of Parcelforce, the
Post Office's parcel-delivery subsidiary. The government would pledge to
retain that stake 'indefinitely', and any further reduction would require
explicit parliamentary approval. In law the Royal Mail would count as a
private-sector company, and ministers would pledge not to use their stake to
intervene in commercial decisions.
The sale on preferential terms of about 10 per cent of the shares to the
Post Office's 180,000 employees and 20,000 sub-postmasters.
The sale of the remainder of the company - about 40 per cent of the total
shares - in a public flotation.
The creation of Post Office Counters division as a separate entity, which
would continue to be state-owned. Post Office Counters covers 20,000 post
offices, 19,000 of them sub-post offices owned and managed by individuals or
companies on a franchise basis. Although profitable as a whole, state
control would be a guarantee against wholesale closures of subsidised rural
sub-post offices.
The establishment of an independent regulator - the director-general for
postal services - with responsibility for ensuring that that the Post Office
continues to provide a national, affordable and efficient service. Like
Oftel and the other utility regulators, the regulator would be appointed by,
but legally independent of, the government.
The opening of the postal market to greater competition. Royal Mail might be
able to strike more commercial deals with the private sector for bulk
deliveries and pre-sorted mail, and its existing monopoly over the delivery
of all letters costing Pounds 1 or less might be reduced.
Mr Heseltine and the Post Office see this package as a principled compromise
between the two other options set out in the green paper.
The first option would retain the Post Office as a nationalised industry,
but give it greater freedom from Treasury controls. The most onerous of
these controls concern capital spending, profits, and performance targets.
The Post Office claims that its capital spending is far below that needed to
compete long-term in new postal technologies such as electronic messaging.
And the sum it has to pay the Treasury out of profits - Pounds 181m last
year - is almost twice as much as it would pay as a reasonable dividend.
Mr Heseltine pours cold water on this option, pointing to 'serious
difficulties' in removing 'all controls' from the Post Office if it remains
more than 50 per cent state-owned. Although common in continental Europe, no
industry in Britain has succeeded in establishing a fully commercial status
within the public sector.
The green paper's other, more radical, option is to sell 100 per cent of
Royal Mail.
This would be to treat Royal Mail in the same way as the other utilities -
including British Telecommunications, which was once part of the Post Office
 -which were sold in their entirety. The other proposals outlined above
would still apply.
Given the government's strong commitment to privatisation, it is not
surprising that Mr Heseltine claims that the 100 per cent option 'has much
to recommend it'.
The case against this option is wholly political. As the green paper puts
it: 'Many people would prefer a closer link between the government and the
Royal Mail, (reflecting) the important role which Royal Mail plays in our
national life.'
In that case, why not keep 51 per cent of the shares in state hands? The
argument for the 51 per cent sell-off is based on accepted international
definitions of private-sector companies, which require a majority of their
equity to be in non-state hands.
All three options are likely to require legislation, particularly if the
government decides to open the postal market to greater competition, which
it is committed to doing.
The green paper refuses to specify precise reforms to promote competition,
but raises the possibility of three: a narrowing of the Royal Mail's
existing letter monopoly; an increase in discounts available to companies
which pre-sort their mail; and 'niche licences' for companies proposing to
deliver specific services within the monopoly.
The crucial limitation is that 'additional competition must not be allowed
to put at risk Royal Mail's ability to maintain a universal service at a
uniform and affordable tariff'.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
SELL-OFF CHOICES
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Government's preferred option
 -State to retain 49 per cent of Royal Mail
 -About 10 per cent sold to post office employees and sub post-masters
 -The rest sold in a public flotation.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 2
 -Total privatisation: a 100 per cent flotation either in one or several
  tranches
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 3
 -Continued state control: the status quo, but with greater commercial
  freedom
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Under options (1) and (2) Parcelforce would be privatised with the Royal
Mail, but the Counters division would remain nationalised

FT  01 JUL 94 / Backbench concerns on sell-off eased: Post Office green
paper sets out compromise option - Labour threatens summer offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary yesterday appeased
the doubts of Tory backbenchers with his green paper on the future of the
Post Office.
His campaign to privatise the Royal Mail has been dogged by the fears of
Conservative MPs over the past two years. It seems, however, that the
government can now confidently push ahead with the privatisation legislation
in the next session of parliament.
In recent months, Mr Heseltine has met backbenchers to convince them of the
merits of privatising the Post Office. Yesterday's green paper reflects a
compromise between his approach and the anxieties of MPs not to undermine a
cherished institution.
He has achieved his minimal goal of getting the government to propose a 51
per cent share flotation of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, leaving the
remainder in state hands.
At the same time Tory backbenchers are satisfied with the safeguards that
the government has proposed. These include statutory guarantees for the
continuation of nationwide deliveries and a single national tariff.
Tory MPs were also satisfied yesterday that parliament would have to pass
special legislation before any sales of the government's minority
shareholding could take place. Some had feared that the Treasury might push
for a 100 per cent sell-off at a time when it needs to acquire additional
funds to offset public borrowing.
Acording to the green paper, 'preparatory work' for legislation has already
begun. Some ministers have argued that it would be politically dangerous to
introduce the legislation in 1996, when a general election is likely, adding
to the pressure to implement changes as quickly as possible. One minister
said yesterday: 'The prospects for the bill look very good indeed. A few
rebels may come up out of the woodwork but nobody will vote against the
principle of privatisation.'
Nevertheless some uncertain voices could still be heard. Sir Teddy Taylor,
Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'The great danger is that privatisation is
a way of getting a lot of money at a time when the government badly needs
it.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, also served notice of a
'summer offensive' against the plans. He said: 'We will make the future of
the Post Office Labour's top campaign priority. Labour will turn up the
summer heat on Tory MPs by taking our campaign into the rural shires who
have most to lose from privatisation of the Post Office.'
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said that a
privatised Post Office 'will lack proper accountability'. He added: 'How can
a commercial company remain responsible to the whole nation's needs?'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, yesterday called on the Lord
Chancellor to investigate a petition made to the Legal Aid Board by the
solicitors to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi.
In an early day motion he criticised Simmons &amp; Simmons for writing a letter
to the board suggesting there was no cause for legal action in a proposed
case from former employees of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Mr Vaz said he considered it 'an outrage' that Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in the bank, was questioning possible legal aid in the UK to
former employees when the emirate had claimed immunity from jurisdiction in
the courts.
Simmons &amp; Simmons said last night: 'We were acting perfectly properly in
accordance with those procedures developed by the Legal Aid Board over the
years.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Delay 'surprise' for Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the Channel tunnel, said yesterday that
the announcement of delays to the start of Eurostar train services had come
as a surprise and that it might seek compensation for any loss of revenues.
The British, French and Belgian railways said on Wednesday that their
long-distance passenger services between London, Paris and Brussels, due to
start this month, would not start until September at the earliest.
They said the extra delay had been caused by the complexity of the testing
and commissioning of the Pounds 24m trains.
According to Eurotunnel, the reasons for the delay to the Eurostar services
appeared to be caused by the rolling stock and the trains' ability to run
reliably on the rail network of south-east England. As far as it was
concerned, certification for Eurostar services was still scheduled for July.
It said the launch of Le Shuttle services, which carry cars with passengers
through the tunnel, will not be affected by the Eurostar delay.

Demand for consumer credit remained strong in May, in spite of the impact of
tax increases, figures released today by Infolink, the credit information
organisation, show.
Infolink measures the number of consumer credit inquiries from finance
houses and from companies offering retail, home and car loans.
The number of inquiries in May in the retail sector was 9.8 per cent higher
than in May last year, down from the 10.7 per cent annual increase in April.
In the home loans field inquiries were up 8.3 per cent over May last year,
compared with a 7.5 per cent annual rise in April.

The purchase was described by Richard Ellis, commercial estate agents, as
'the biggest West End investment deal for many years'.
It is the second large commercial property purchase to be announced by
German institution in less than a week.
Electricity Supply Nominees, the electricity industry pension fund, on
Monday announced that it had sold for Pounds 106m a City of London office to
Deutsche Immobilien Fonds (DIFA).
The John Lewis headquarters building was constructed in 1975 and has an
unexpired lease of 37 years. The original tenant was BP Oil.

The cabinet yesterday agreed an autumn legislative programme based on the
twin themes of supply-side and welfare state reform as Mr John Major kept
open the options for an early ministerial reshuffle.
The core bills for the Queen's Speech in November will include measures to
equalise the pension age at 65 and reform pensions law, to cut the cost of
unemployment benefit by introducing a job-seekers' allow-ance and to
establish a new Environmental Protection Agency.
But in an apparent victory for the cabinet's 'consolidators', ministers have
deferred plans for an omnibus privatisation bill and early legislation to
pave the way for the introduction of motorway tolls.
Other casualties of the cautious approach being adopted by the prime
minister include measures to liberalise licensing laws and a proposed reform
of local government housing rules. There remains a question mark over a
further criminal justice bill.
In deference to the sceptics on the Tory back benches, Mr Major has also
resisted pressure to introduce a bill to scrap British summertime in favour
of alignment with European partners.
But senior ministers offered a clear hint last night that the cabinet's
leading radicals - Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary - had all but won their battle
for a Post Office privatisation bill. Ministers said that, subject to the
consultation announced in yesterday's green paper, room had been allowed
within the programme for legislation to allow the sale of the Royal Mail.
Among other controversial legislation will be a bill to provide for the
dismantling of regional health authorities and the extension of fund-holding
by GPs. Ministers have decided against committing themselves to a bill to
reform the operations of the Child Support Agency.
But if political controversy over the CSA refuses to die down - the agency
will be the subject of a Labour-inspired Commons debate on Monday - space
can be found later in the legislative programme.
The programme may also have to include a potentially difficult bill to raise
the limits on Britain's contributions to the European Union, a move almost
certain to spark unrest among Tory Euro-sceptics.
Meanwhile, speculation about the timing of the reshuffle intensified last
night after the government broke with normal practice and delayed announcing
the date of the parliamentary recess. Mr Major is expected to reshape the
cabinet within a week or so of the break.
It is understood that the prime minister has all but finalised the details
of what is promised as the biggest government shake-up since the 1992
general election.
Party managers insisted that MPs would continue to meet at least until the
third week of July - but ministers raised the possibility that the summer
break could start in two weeks time. That in turn would allow Mr Major to
bring forward the cabinet changes. Whitehall insiders have pencilled in the
week beginning July 11 as the most likely for the shake-up but have refused
to rule out earlier changes.

FT  01 JUL 94 / MPs say promises to forces broken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain's forces have been so stretched by their engagement in former
Yugoslavia that promises about conditions of service for soldiers and
sailors have been abandoned, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday.
In a report two weeks before the expected announcement of wide-ranging cuts
in defence spending, the Commons defence committee argues that even now the
armed forces are thinly spread.
The committee questioned whether the Treasury was qualified to judge which
forms of defence spending were dispensable and pointedly reminded Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, of a comment in the April white paper: 'The
possession of such a valuable and prestigious national asset as our armed
services is not a luxury.'
The committee said: 'This is a message which, it seems, is yet to be fully
received by the Treasury.'
The MPs reserved their harshest words for the capacity limits shown up by
the deployment of 2,500 ground troops in central Bosnia and ships in the
Adriatic.
It says guarantees to sailors about the proportion of time they would spend
overseas had been broken as a result of the Adriatic operation.
'It is a shocking comment on the degree to which the Royal Navy's resources
are overstretched that even the Navy's relatively unambitious welfare
targets are being constantly breached,' the committee added.
The government has said next month's defence cuts, designed to shave at
least Pounds 750m from the annual defence budget, will have no effect on the
armed forces' fighting ability because they will focus on trimming the cost
of support services.

FT  01 JUL 94 / NZ surplus 'is beginning of virtuous circle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand recorded a budget surplus of NZDollars 527m (Pounds 201m) in the
year to June 1994, its first since 1978 and the start of what Mr Bill Birch,
finance minister, called the start of a 'virtuous circle'.
As a result of the painful economic reforms of the past decade, New Zealand
would now reap the benefits over the coming years, he said. 'The stronger
growth we now have creates more jobs, which increases taxes, and the
surpluses we will achieve will be used to repay debt, leading to stronger
growth.'
The surplus was a big improvement on the projected deficit of NZDollars
2.3bn forecast by the Treasury in last year's budget, although this was
revised to a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn last November. The improvement is
due to higher-than-expected tax receipts as the economy grew faster than
predicted at about 5 per cent of gross domestic product. This led to a rise
in employment of about 86,000.
Corporate earnings were up sharply, as many companies came to the end of tax
loss, and started paying full tax. The government also kept a tight rein on
its spending, while social welfare costs remained at a low level after the
cuts of 1991.
Mr Birch forecast that the budget would show a surplus of Dollars NZ730m in
1994-95, rising to Dollars NZDollars 2.5bn in 1995-96 and NZDollars 4.5bn in
1996-67. He said this would allow tax cuts.
Meanwhile, New Zealand would have to continue to show restraint and the
emphasis would be on repaying overseas debt.
The better economic times meant the government was able to start repaying a
'social dividend' for those who had been hurt hardest during the reform
period.
Mr Birch said he would be spending an extra Dollars NZ450m over the coming
year in various social welfare areas.

FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: World recovery gathers pace - Steady
growth and low inflation forecast but unemployment remains a serious concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery is now well under way in the industrialised world, with
the US, Japan and Europe all forecast to see steady growth and low inflation
over the next two years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development reports in its latest half-yearly outlook.
At the same time, turbulence in the world's financial markets could be eased
if monetary authorities in the industrialised world make more effort to
underline their commitment to low inflation, the OECD says.
It also cautions that the forecast growth may not be enough to solve the
longer term problem of government debt, and the industrialised economies
will need to expand more rapidly than in the last two decades if they are to
return to a period of high employment.
The Paris-based body, which represents 25 industrialised nations, paints an
upbeat picture of current prospects. For the first time since 1991 the OECD
has revised its forecasts of growth upwards, with the industrialised
economies expected to expand by 2.5 per cent this year and nearly 3 per cent
next. Its last forecast, made in November, envisaged 2.1 per cent growth
this year and 2.7 per cent in 1995.
The US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand are at the forefront of this
growth, with recovery there now well entrenched, the report says. But the
outlook for Japan has also brightened. And though domestic demand remains
weak in continental Europe, rising exports are expected to lead to steady
growth and a significant turnaround in Europe's trading position.
European OECD countries reported a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) trade deficit
in 1992, and a Dollars 66.7bn surplus last year. The trading position is
expected to rise to a Dollars 112.7bn surplus this year.
However, in spite of this optimistic forecast, the OECD insists that 'this
is not the time for any relaxation of policy effort'.
'The most pressing basic policy problem remains high, and in Europe still
rising, unemployment,' Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist,
said yesterday, echoing the OECD's jobs study released earlier this year.
Although unemployment is projected to decline slightly next year, most of
the improvement will be in the US.
The report warns that unemployment in Europe will remain at some 12 per cent
of the labour force.
Another cloud on the horizon is the high level of government debt, which
seems set to be a continued drag on economic growth, the report adds. During
the recent recession government budget positions across the industrialised
world weakened by, on average, 3 per cent of GDP, the report notes.
In the short term the OECD believes that this deficit will drop slightly
because recovery should boost budget positions and most OECD countries -
with the notable exception of Japan - have tightened fiscal policy since
last year.
But even if the governments stick to these fiscal measures, this will still
only stabilise the deficit at 1-2 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade -
a level that would leave the total public sector debt running at around 75
per cent of GDP for the OECD as a whole, well above the 60 per cent levels
seen in the late 1980s, the report warns.
And if growth slows - a distinct possibility, according to the OECD - the
debt position could be far worse. 'Only slightly lower growth - by half a
percentage point per year - could lead to debt levels in 2000 averaging
close to 85 per cent of GDP,' the report says.
A third worrying sign, the OECD says, comes from the recent rise in
long-term interest rates on financial markets.
The policy implications of this rise vary for different countries, the OECD
says - though the increase in rates may reflect rising inflation
expectations or public sector debt concerns in some countries, it is also
being driven by greater market volatility and increased risk-aversity among
market traders, the report says.
In the US, where recovery is strong and spare capacity levels low, a
'neutral' policy is needed to ward off inflation, the report suggests.
In other countries such as the UK and Canada, which are also seeing recovery
but with higher levels of spare capacity, the same forces that pushed up US
interest rates will increasingly come into play.
But in countries where recovery has barely begun - such as Japan - there may
be more room for easier monetary conditions. Nevertheless, the OECD
concludes: 'In all countries, insofar as real long-term interest rates are
considered to be too high, the solution is more likely to be found in more
ambitious reduction of budget deficits.'
Mr Shigehara said that the recent rise in long-term interest rates, and the
broader market turbulence, suggested that governments should make more
effort to emphasise their commitment to low inflation, without overreacting
to every market movement.
'More effective articulation of clear commitments to sound public finances
and price stability, and, where necessary, decisive corrective actions . . .
would contribute importantly to the stabilisation of market expectations,'
he said.
Although Mr Shigehara declined to point the finger at any particular
government, the OECD's outlook suggests that the US may be one country where
such clearer commitments would be particularly welcome.

FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Rise in British investment forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in Britain will become more broadly based this year, resulting
in a steady pace of growth, the OECD forecasts in its outlook, writes
Gillian Tett.
Although the UK's economic improvement is now well entrenched, business
investment was, until recently, 'the missing ingredient', the outlook says.
But in the coming months private investment should start to support the
recovery 'as company balance-sheet positions and cash flow continue to
improve', the report adds.
The OECD's overall forecasts for the economy are slightly more upbeat than
the UK government's own estimates.
Whereas the UK Treasury forecast earlier this week that GDP would grow by
2.75 per cent this year and next year, the OECD predicts growth of 2.8 per
cent this year, followed by 3.2 per cent in 1995.
Consumers are forecast to continue spending, in spite of April's tax rises -
although private consumption growth is expected to dip slightly in the
second half of this year, it is expected to pick up after that. The main
factors boosting this growth, the OECD says, will be a rise in employment, a
further fall in the household savings rates, and a mild rise in house
prices.
The inflation outlook 'remains benign', the report says, although the OECD's
forecasts are slightly higher than those of the Treasury. The OECD's
internationally compatible measure of consumer price inflation forecasts a
rise of 2.9 per cent this year, while the government forecasts underlying
inflation will be 2.5 per cent at the end of this year.

FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Debate on 'zero inflation' reopens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle against inflation is proceeding well - but governments now need
to gear up for the next stage of the campaign. With inflation forecast to
remain at low levels across the industrialised world, it is time to clarify
the longer term inflation goals, says the OECD, writes Gillian Tett.
Part of the problem stems from the monetary authorities' own success, it
says. In the past, most governments have assumed that their goal was to
achieve 'low inflation', often implicitly defined at around 2 per cent.
But inflation is now running near this level in many countries, and is
forecast to remain stable over the rest of this year before rising slightly
in 1995.
As a result, the question of whether governments should be aiming lower for
'zero inflation', has re-entered the policy arena, the report says.
Supporters of this zero target, the OECD points out, claim that this would
'provide a clear, easily communicated goal'.
However, the OECD suggests that a 'zero' goal is dogged by problems.
Governments which announce a zero goal run the risk of looking overly
ambitious and losing market credibility. Indeed, once inflation falls to
these very low levels, there may be problems assessing the target number
itself - consumer price indices in the US and Canada in particular become
more ambiguous once inflation falls below 3 per cent.
As a result, the OECD concludes that most governments will continue to aim
for above zero targets - although it warns that 'a good deal of judgment is
required as to what they might imply in numerical terms'.

FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Japan's growth may be slowed by
strong yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strengthening of the yen could undermine economic growth in Japan by
reducing the level of Japanese exports, the OECD outlook warns, writes
Gillian Tett.
Though the Japanese economy is expected to pick up this year, it is still
the slowest growing of the 'big three' industrialised economies, lagging
behind the US and Germany, the report adds.
With the Japanese economy still very weak, the main factor in the projected
turnround in the economy will be the fiscal package unveiled by the Japanese
government in February, the OECD says.
The combination of tax cuts and higher public spending is expected to boost
consumption and residential investment, leading to higher growth later this
year.
But Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, OECD chief economist, yesterday warned that in
the light of the yen's recent strengthening on the markets, 'recent
financial market developments entail the risk of weaker growth of output in
Japan'.
A weaker dollar could also add to inflationary pressures in the US, Mr
Shigehara added. However, he pointed out that in spite of the dollar's
decline against the yen, it remained strong against most other currencies.
And though growth in US GDP is forecast to slow to 3 per cent next year,
from 4 per cent this year, this rate is still expected to reduce the
unemployment rate 'below levels consistent with stable inflation', the
report says.
The strong US demand is expected to suck in more exports, leading to a
deterioration in the US balance of trade.
In European countries such as Germany, in contrast, rising exports are
expected to be a key factor in economic growth - though the OECD also warns
that German output growth will be slow in 1994, with domestic demand not
expected to pick up until 1995.

FT  01 JUL 94 / French save hundreds of badly wounded Tutsi: Survivors tell
of man-hunts by day and night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GISHYITA, RWANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of famished and badly wounded Tutsi were yesterday saved from
ethnic slaughter when the French intervention force in west Rwanda moved
into the hills above Gishyita to protect them.
For almost three months the Tutsi of this region have been hiding in the
forest by day and scavenging for food at night as the army and militia of
the majority Hutu tribe have hunted them down.
Less than four miles from the French army base at Gishyita, on the shores of
Lake Kivu, a mountain road lay strewn with corpses. Survivors of the
massacre said Hutu government soldiers and militia had launched daily raids
to exterminate Tutsi hiding in the woods. The last search-and-destroy
mission took place on Wednesday.
The 350 survivors who gathered on a windswept mountain top yesterday, under
the protection of French troops, bore the wounds and scars of Hutu attacks.
One elderly Tutsi had had his eyes gouged out because he had been a 'man of
learning'. Many had been hacked with machetes and knives. Others bore
festering gunshot wounds.
There were few women and children. 'They couldn't flee as fast as we did, so
they were the first to be killed,' explained Mr Eric Nzabihimana, a village
schoolteacher who has been in hiding since April 13, a week after the death
of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash which unleashed the wave of
slaughter against the minority Tutsi tribe. The Hutu government blames Tutsi
guerrillas for shooting down the president's aircraft.
Mr Nzabihimana believes that of the 10,000 Tutsi who lived in the hills,
less than 1,000 survived a campaign of genocide spearheaded by Hutu
extremists. 'The soldiers, the militias and the local Hutu population have
chased us day and night to kill us,' he said. Of his numerous family, only a
sister survived.
On the mountain top the Tutsi are dressed in discoloured rags; their sunken
cheeks and skeletal ribs bear the signs of advanced malnutrition. 'If the
French had not come we would have begun to die of hunger soon,' Mr
Nzabihimana said.
The emaciated survivors cheer and clap when French reinforcements arrive.
From another hill, Hutu militia sullenly watch the Tutsi gathering. The
French soldiers aim their assault rifles at the hostile force. 'If we were
to leave them now, these Tutsi would all be dead by tonight,' explained
Adjutant Prungnaud of the French Special Forces.
One week after France launched its humanitarian mission in Rwanda, the
troops on the ground are just beginning to uncover the scale of the problem
they have come to solve. Rather than a mission to save civilians trapped in
Rwanda's civil war, be they Hutu or Tutsi, the French troops find themselves
drawn into the need to protect the Tutsi ethnic group, virtually
exterminated by systematic genocide.
It will be difficult for the French to maintain their avowed neutrality for
long. Because they were the main military and financial backers of President
Habyarimana's government, the French were welcomed by the Hutu community.
The goodwill may not last if France's main task comes to be seen as
protecting Tutsi from further massacres.
As 40 French soldiers prepared to guard the Tutsi survivors last night,
pick-up trucks with Rwandan soldiers drove by. The Tutsi shouted: 'They are
the ones who have been killing us.' The French do not have the mandate to
stop the army convoys. The Rwandan soldiers give the thumbs-up to the French
as they pass.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Aid pledges of Dollars 2.4bn leave PLO with a cash
shortfall: Donor's stance is angering Arafat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, will
today head to the land he has sought for so long, supported by more than
Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in pledges of aid but few dollars in his
pocket.
The once-wealthy PLO is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and
international donors seem determined that its coffers will not be
replenished to the detriment of the West Bank and Gaza strip's development.
In Tunis last week, Mr Arafat did not disguise his anger at the 'derisory'
cash sums he was being offered to help set up the Palestinian organisations
required to take over the administration of territories freed from Israeli
occupation.
The conflict between immediate, and partly political, needs and the longer
term economic and social requirements of the territories can only be
resolved by the international aid donors.
The two largest, the US and the EU which together have pledged more than
Dollars 1bn over the next five years, recognise the need to sustain Mr
Arafat politically.
But the amount of pledged aid that can be diverted into start-up costs and
budget support for the new administration is often limited by the legal
restraints under which the donor governments must work. Even more difficult
is to provide Mr Arafat and his colleagues with what American politicians
describe as 'walk about' money. Such requirements sit uneasily alongside
demands for 'transparency and accountability' in the use of funds.
For the past two months these issues have dominated the PLO's contacts with
donors, at some cost to the urgent work needed to translate pledges into
projects and to answer the criticism from Palestinians in the territories
that nothing on the ground has changed since Israel and the PLO signed their
initial agreement in September.
Of the Dollars 2.4bn in development funds on offer over the next five years,
Dollars 720m has been earmarked for the first 12 months of the new self-rule
authority, a figure well beyond the capacity of the territories to absorb.
A key task now is to resolve priorities and persuade the donors to be
flexible in their selection of projects.
'We are finding that some countries only wish to be involved in certain
prestige projects where they can see long-term commercial benefit. And there
are also many difficulties in different demands for bidding procedures, and
with those governments which insist that contracts can only be awarded to
companies from their own countries,' said a member of the Palestinian
economic council for development and reconstruction.
These complications have been compounded by the lack of urgency demonstrated
by Mr Arafat in appointing staff and his unwillingness to delegate
authority.
He has, however, also been handicapped by the belated recognition that
start-up costs of the new administration and its projected budget deficit
for the first two years would be substantial.
The gap to be covered until the end of 1994 is put at Dollars 168m. Of this
Dollars 133m has so far been committed, with Dollars 60m of it in a special
fund administered by the World Bank and named after Johan Joergen Holst, the
late Norwegian foreign minister.
The Holst fund has been financed by governments which were persuaded to
switch development funds into direct cash aid. They include Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait which, because of Mr Arafat's support for Iraq during the Gulf war,
had been adamant that none of their contributions should be used to sustain
the PLO.
It was the World Bank's suggestion that the Holst fund should be drawn down
by Dollars 10m a month that Mr Arafat characterised as 'derisory', and
prompted him to dispatch Mr Ahmed Qurei, the economy supremo in the new
administration, to Washington for talks at the end of last week. The result
has been an agreement to step up the monthly payments to Dollars 13m, but
the quest continues for more donations to the fund.
The danger is that the Palestinian self-rule authority will become addicted
to international aid, a risk compounded by the further delays certain to be
prompted by the weight of unresolved political issues.
There has also been an underlying assumption in drawing up financial
estimates that Israel will be generous, both in the repayment of a
proportion of tax already collected and in reopening its borders to
Palestinian workers.
These are not the sort of assumptions on which professional gamblers would
place much of a wager. Neither would they bet on Mr Arafat accepting that
much of the Dollars 2.4bn is not money in the bank, but funds which will
only be disbursed on the implementation of projects.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Alliance's architect: Yohei Kono
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's new deputy prime minister and foreign minister, was
the principal architect of the incongruous alliance of socialists and
Liberal Democrats now ruling Japan, writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo.
Elected to lead the LDP following its defeat last summer, he has spent most
of the past year attempting to unseat the governments of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, finally patching together a deal with the
socialists minutes before Wednesday night's vote in the lower house of the
Diet.
Mr Kono, a 57-year-old former cabinet secretary in the last LDP government
of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, has a reputation as a firm supporter of Japan's
pacifist constitution. He moves to the Foreign Ministry as a lively debate
is under way about Japan's international role.
Some in the ministry favour giving the country a stronger presence in the
international arena, but Mr Kono has said that Japan should be a 'soft
power', developing its political and economic role rather than a military
one.
He has tried to distance the LDP from its scandal-ridden past, building on a
reputation earned in the 1970s as an early member of the party's reformist
wing.
Mr Kono left the party in 1976 to form a breakaway group, the New Liberal
Club, following the Lockheed payoff scandal. But his reputation was not
enhanced by a decision to rejoin the LDP in 1986, even though the party had
changed little.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Slower move to more open economy: New cabinet will steer
clear of sensitive issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new three-party cabinet is populist, conservative and likely to mark
a pause in Japan's progress toward a more open economy and power structure.
As expected, most of the top jobs went to the right-wing Liberal Democratic
Party, which holds the foreign, defence, home affairs and international
trade and industry ministries among its 13 cabinet seats. It gives the
cabinet the experience lacking in its coalition partners.
The left-wing Social Democratic Party gets five, while the New Harbinger
Party, a former LDP splinter group, which forms the smallest member of the
coalition gets two, including the vitally important finance ministry. The
previous pronouncements and track records of Mr Tomiichi Murayama's team
indicate the new government's main policies will be as follows: coalition
partners will focus on the few areas where they have something in common.
They will steer clear of sensitive matters such as energy, where the SDP
believes Japan must freeze its nuclear programme, or defence, where the
Socialists believe Japan's army is unconstitutional.
The Economy: The government is expected to push for a several-year income
tax cut, possibly in a tax reform bill this autumn, but to leave the timing
and scope of any increase in consumption tax vague.
The finance ministry and fiscal conservatives in the LDP will fight for a
rise in consumption tax, on grounds that extra revenue is urgently needed to
curb the rising public-sector borrowing requirement (5 per cent of gross
domestic product, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development). But the decision will be swayed by the New Harbinger
party's tax-cutting Mr Masayoshi Takemura, whose arrival will cause alarm
among ministry mandarins.
He yesterday repeated his opposition to finance ministry plans to raise
consumption tax, a row over which caused Mr Takemura to walk out of a former
coalition government. Mr Takemura's appointment is a boon to the SDP, which
opposes a rise in sales tax even more than his party does.
Deregulation: Large sections of both the LDP and SDP prefer deregulation to
proceed at an even slower pace than under the previous two reform-minded
coalition governments. The LDP is sensitive to its small business support
base, reluctant to face an increase in competition. The SDP is pulled in
opposite directions by its two main types of supporter, conservative farming
communities and the pro-deregulation trade union movement, Rengo.
On balance, it has a record of being unenthusiastic on deregulation, as
shown by its resistance to last year's ending of the ban on rice imports.
Foreign and trade policy: The LDP's Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, and his
Socialist boss, Mr Murayama, are staunch pacifists, which suggests they will
press for a soft line on North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Here, they will have the support of Mr Takemura, who has been close to
Pyongyang since arranging a meeting between Kim Il-Sung and a senior member
of the LDP four years ago. All three members of the coalition oppose
non-United Nations sanctions against North Korea. Mr Kono, but not all his
LDP followers, and his two partners agree Japan should not revise Article
Nine of the constitution, which forbids the use of force to settle
international disputes.
The prime minister and foreign minister may also, because of their pacifism,
tone down Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and
for wider participation in UN peace-keeping. As a result, Japan may take a
generally lower profile on the world stage while this government is in
office. The strong hawkish streak on the right wing of the LDP is likely to
enliven this coalition's reign.
Political reform: Mr Murayama surprised critics yesterday by pledging to
speed the re-drawing of electoral boundaries and hold elections under the
new rules opposed by many of his own party members only last January. The
new boundaries will be ready by autumn, but the coalition might hold on
longer if it can control its internal differences on this and other
policies.
The new boundaries are the final stage in the re-design of the political and
electoral system, including curbs on political fund-raising. Mr Kono
equivocally supports reform.
Mr Murayama's electoral pledge disappointed the SDP and LDP old guard, who
suspect they would do less badly in a quick election under the old system
than under the new. Against that, they fear a public backlash if they are
seen to be resisting popular reform.
The new prime minister symbolically signalled he wanted to break with the
LDP's record of political corruption by giving the construction ministry to
a Socialist. Public-works contracts were at the centre of a recent judicial
crackdown on corruption.
One entirely legal vestige of the old political way is present in
yesterday's cabinet: the strength of family ties. Ms Makiko Tanaka, the
straight-talking daughter of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, becomes
director-general of the Science and Technology Agency, during her first term
in parliament. Few politicians land a cabinet job so early in their careers.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Let's try to keep things moving - Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics of Hong Kong's governor Mr Chris Patten have often said he would
have to trade advances in Hong Kong's political development for Chinese
concessions in economic matters.
Yet yesterday, just hours after denouncing the vote in Hong Kong's
Legislative Council that extended the franchise in the British colony, China
initialled a treaty with Britain on the use of military land after
sovereignty is returned to Beijing in 1997.
'I am just pleased that 'the-end-of-the-world-is-nigh' brigade will now have
to hang up their clapper boards,' said the governor in an interview
yesterday.
The view in the colony now is that Beijing has separated the economic from
the political.
With the vote in LegCo early yesterday morning securing the political
reforms he sought, Mr Patten is keen to move on and deal with practical
issues of transferring sovereignty to China in 1997.
Although the development of democracy in Hong Kong has been the most
contentious issue dividing Britain and China in the past two years, the
governor detects a willingness by Beijing to deal with the nitty gritty.
With the military land deal on the way to being resolved, talks about
airport finance may also be nearing completion.
'I think it is possible to co-operate across the board and we will be
looking in the coming months for ways to build on the momentum,' Mr Patten
said.
In the early hours of Thursday morning Mr Patten scored a narrow victory in
LegCo when lawmakers voted for his plans to extend the franchise in next
year's elections.
'The decision has been taken by the people of Hong Kong, not imposed upon
them,' he said. 'The process is almost as important as the institutions
which (the) vote put in place. Hong Kong stood up for itself.
'But we've got to try to increase China's understanding and remove its
mistrust about Hong Kong - a feeling that somehow Hong Kong's aspirations
represent a threat.
'(The) vote wholly involved the United Front (pro-Beijing) politicians in
Hong Kong. Chinese officials played an active part in trying to influence
the outcome of the vote. It was good that they were involved in that way.'
Beijing's official position yesterday was that fresh elections will be held
in Hong Kong after China regains sovereignty in 1997.
Next on the agenda is resolving the long-running dispute with Beijing about
funding Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project. 'We are extremely
close to an agreement,' said Mr Patten.
Yesterday Mr Guo Fengmin, China's chief representative to the Joint Liaison
Group, said that in drafting the agreement 'some problems emerged which need
to be further clarified'. It is understood these relate to allowing the
government corporations building the airport and connecting railway to
approach bankers. Mr Guo said he hoped a draft agreement could be 'completed
in the near future'.
Mr Patten said there was much that Britain and China had to get done in the
coming three years. This included the localisation and adaptation of Hong
Kong's law and air service agreements with other countries.
China's co-operation was also needed when it came to the government's social
agenda. The government will soon be publishing a consultation paper on its
plans for a state-funded old age pension. 'It is essential to carry China
with us.'
Mr Patten said a meeting with Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong,
would be a boost to relations. When Mr Lu visited the colony in early May he
snubbed the governor.
'I would like to (meet him) whenever Mr Lu thought it possible, practicable
and desirable. I happen to think it is desirable now and I think the Hong
Kong people think it is desirable.'
Mr Patten is under no illusion that the events of this week will mean plain
sailing until 1997.
'This job is not going to get any easier. I don't seek to alarm or to
forecast typhoons, but the job is going to be intensely difficult and
intensely challenging right down to the wire.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Traders at Nikko Securities, who started their morning with long faces
yesterday on prospects of a plunge on the Tokyo stock market, were
pleasantly surprised after Japanese shares closed moderately higher.
Many analysts had expected financial markets to react negatively to the
uncertainty posed by the new socialist leader, but investors chose to look
on the bright side, seeing the new administration as fiscally expansive,
supporting further cuts in income taxes, and discarding tax rises.
After a brief plunge, the leading Nikkei index closed up 162.93, or 0.8 per
cent, at 20,643.93, on hopes of a imminent recovery of corporate earnings
and the economy.
But investor confidence was virtually unaffected due to the belief that
bureaucrats will continue running state affairs, including economic
management. 'There is no socialist government, just a socialist prime
minister within a coalition,' Mr Tom Hill, strategist at brokers SG Warburg
in Tokyo, said.
Favourable news for the economy, on the other hand, suggested higher
interest rates, depressing the bond market. Currency traders were more
unsure of the new regime as doubts over the prime minister's handling of
trade talks with the US and the Naples summit kept the yen above Y99 to the
dollar. It closed up Y0.32 at Y98.95.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Masayoshi Takemura has made a spectacular comeback at the head of Japan's
Finance Ministry, its most powerful bureaucracy, despite being constantly
undermined, in his days as chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa
administration, by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the backroom strategist, writes Emiko
Terazono.
Not only does the Finance Ministry govern state budget, tax policy and
financial markets, it also supervises the Bank of Japan's monetary policy.
So far his pronouncements as finance minister have been sweet to the
public's ears. Yesterday he stressed he would pursue income tax cuts but
ruled out an immediate consumption-tax increase. He has gained electoral
popularity through his low-key style, is a self-professed environmentalist,
and has been calling for a green tax to help conserve the regional
environment.
Along with members of the Socialist party, Mr Takemura is known for his
strong ties with North Korea. He has visited the country three times,
including a trip he organised for Liberal Democrat and Socialist elders to
meet President Kim Il-Sung in 1990.
Such ties pose risks for swift Japanese decision-making towards North Korea
were a crisis to erupt. In contrast to Mr Ozawa, he envisages a more
discreet role for Tokyo in the international arena, claiming Japan should
maintain its role as a pacifist country, and strongly opposes its financial
involvement in regional military crises.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Japan's new PM calls in conservatives: Thirteen cabinet
posts go to traditional political foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new Socialist prime minister yesterday took a step to the right, by
selecting a cabinet dominated by conservatives and pledging to work for
stable economic growth.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, elected the first left-wing leader for 47 years on
Wednesday night, yesterday allotted 13 cabinet posts - including foreign
affairs, international trade and industry and defence - to the Liberal
Democratic party, his traditional enemy and the largest member of his
three-party coalition.
Two seats, including the Finance Ministry, went to the smallest coalition
partner, the New Harbinger party, which is devoted to cutting income tax. Mr
Murayama's Social Democratic party took three cabinet posts.
Mr Murayama, on the moderate wing of a deeply-divided SDP, promised to
continue previous governments' policies of political reform and economic
deregulation. This suggests that the recent red-tape cutting package, the
final act of the former government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, will survive intact.
The prime minister also called for international co-operation to stem the
rise of the yen, which touched Y98.75 in Tokyo yesterday, fuelling fears
that resulting damage to Japan's export earnings might choke the early
stages of recovery.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the new finance minister, said he would seek a
multi-year income tax cut, to be financed by lower public spending, rather
than through a rise in sales tax as proposed by the Finance Ministry.
The unexpected victory of the three-party alliance, dominated by the older
generation of politicians, prompted varying degrees of puzzlement and alarm
from the US, Japanese business leaders and Tokyo's influential bureaucrats.
They fear the new government will restrain Japan's halting economic
liberalisation and be an inexperienced advocate of its foreign interests.
The LDP and SDP, in government and opposition for 38 years until last
summer, have few policies in common, although they have a history of
backroom parliamentary co-operation on some matters.
'I am shocked,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren business
federation. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers'
federation, said: 'Mr Murayama's capability as prime minister is unknown.
But we call for his leadership to overcome this chaotic situation.'
However, a US official in Tokyo believed the LDP would be a 'tempering
influence'.
China and South Korea warmly welcomed the new government, a reflection of
their close links with the SDP.
The downfall of the former coalition, after two months in power, left the
opposition in disarray. Mr Shoichiro Ozawa, the previous government's
strategist, offered to resign as secretary-general of Mr Hata's Japan
Renewal party, to take the blame. However, party leaders persuaded him to
stay.
Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa said he was interested in forming an
alliance with LDP and SDP defectors, while Mr Toshiki Kaifu, an LDP elder
who left his old party to stand unsuccessfully against Mr Murayama, said he
might form a new party.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: An early bath for some patchy performers -
Farewell to the first-round losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not all their spirits were blithe, but eight teams were saying farewell to
the World Cup yesterday. Last night's matches determined whether Nigeria,
Bulgaria or Russia would be the last to go, but here is a valediction to the
seven who know there is no tomorrow.
South Korea proved again that there is something about the World Cup and
teams from that tense and divided peninsula. They play their best against
the best.
In 1966, the North, about whom nothing was known, put three fast goals past
Eusebio's Portugal before succumbing. This year, the South, not much more of
an open book, nearly pulled the trick in reverse against mighty Germany and
had the brass nerve to score twice in the last six minutes to draw Spain.
They were as fit as any team here and faster than most. They made chances
but were wasteful, though four goals in three games is pretty close to the
average.
Soccer is a coming sport in Asia, but only a small handful of its stars play
outside Korea. Japan, with a professional league now flourishing, and South
Korea are favourites to stage the 2002 World Cup.
Greece deserve a charitable veil drawn over their performance. Considered in
advance the weakest team to come to America, they left with that opinion set
in concrete. The easiest explanation is that all their players only play in
Greek leagues, not Europe's strongest, and several are quite ancient.
But politics also come into it. This is appropriate for the historical home
of democracy but less for soccer. Several players complained that their
training was constantly interrupted by the need to make public and political
appearances with local Greek communities.
Being drawn to play Bulgaria was also not helpful; had Turkey qualified, it
would have been worse.
Of Bolivia, participating after an interval of 44 years, little can be said,
beyond noting that they scored a goal (against Spain) for the first time in
World Cup history. There was some pretty football on display, especially
against Germany, but more is needed if 44 more years are not to elapse.
Colombia have not enjoyed a great fortnight. Relations with the US are tense
over the alleged narcotics connections of the new president. Far worse, the
soccer team - Pele's pick to win it all, a team laden with talent, toughened
by the experience of failure in Italy four years ago and no longer needing
the erratic talents of Rene Higuita in goal - blew it.
The irony is that for long periods in their first match against Romania,
Colombia lived up to their advance billing. They played dazzling attacking
football and should have won comfortably. Part of the problem is that they
played as if they knew that, too.
Cameroon's luck ran out in the US. All the familiar characteristics were
there: opportunistic attacking, rough-edged defending, post-goal wiggles,
rows over money. Though they were no longer an unknown quantity, they still
came close to repeating an opening-match ambush, this time against Sweden.
But once that match had ended in a draw the Indomitable Lions were in
trouble.
They finished their group games as they did in Italy: thrashed by a Russian
team which had lost their first two games. Roger Milla became the oldest
goal scorer in the World Cup finals, serving only to emphasise that this
team are over the hill.
Morocco have been a contradiction: no points, two goals, beaten by the
Saudis, yet one of the revelations of this World Cup. They ran the Belgians
ragged, hitting the bar twice but were beaten by one goalkeeping error.
Against the surprising Saudis, the Moroccans again dazzled, again failed to
turn attack into scores, again lost by one goal. They attacked with flair
for spells against the Dutch and again lost by one goal.
The gap between the two Arab teams and the Belgians and Dutch in Group F was
tiny. Later rounds may confirm that the Moroccans shone partly because the
Lowland defences are not very good, but they can draw comfort from the fact
that they were able to play two highly-fancied, highly-experienced and
highly-paid western European teams as equals.
Norway may moan that they are unlucky to be going home after picking up four
points. They got no more than they deserved. They were dull and ineffective.
For such a small nation with so little soccer tradition they have done well,
but the Irish and Italians exposed their limitations. Indeed, part of
Norway's problem, particularly against Ireland, was that they seemed
constricted by worries.
For England fans gripped by Venables fever, it is worth noting that Norway
created fewer goal chances against Italy and Ireland combined than against
the English in May.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: World crashes in on soccer's prodigal genius
 -Diego Maradona's spectacular tournament comeback has been obliterated by a
positive drug test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's best-known soccer delinquent, Argentina's Diego Maradona, was
booted out of the World Cup yesterday for taking a common - but banned -
anti-asthma medication which is also a powerful stimulant. In a two-part
drugs test, Maradona tested positive for ephedrine and was expelled from the
tournament.
Immensely talented and super-rich, Maradona had clawed his way back to the
pinnacle of international soccer at this World Cup following a career marked
by wine, women, drugs and song - plus suspension for cocaine abuse.
Fifa, soccer's governing body, announced Maradona's suspension minutes after
Argentina had withdrawn him from the competition anyway.
Maradona led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986. This was his fourth
appearance in the tournament - he should have made a World Cup record 22nd
match appearance, against Bulgaria, late yesterday.
Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Association, originally
claimed that the incident might be a 'minor issue,' but blamed Maradona's
private dietician for allowing the star to use ephedrine during World Cup
play.
Dietician Daniel Cerrini had prescribed the drug and was 'very sorry because
it was something that was done unintentionally.'
Ephedrine is a common nasal decongestant available over the counter in
Maradona's home country. It is used to treat asthma, hay fever and allergies
and acts on the body much like adrenalin, increasing blood pressure and
heartbeat.
It was ephedrine that caused American swimmer Rick DuMont to be stripped of
a gold medal at the 1972 Olympic Games. DuMont said he was taking ephedrine
only under a doctor's prescription for a long-standing asthma condition.
Maradona, in the midst of a spectacular World Cup comeback after cocaine
almost blotted out his career, led Argentina to victories in their first two
games of the present competition.
Late yesterday Argentina were playing Bulgaria in the last of their
first-round matches at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas. They have already qualified
for the next round.
This is not the first time the flamboyant Maradona has failed a drugs test.
He was banned from international soccer for 15 months in 1991-92 by Fifa
after testing positive for cocaine, following a game for Napoli of Italy in
March 1991. The next month he was arrested in Buenos Aires and charged with
possession and use of drugs.
Scornful of critics who said he was as 'fat as a pig,' Maradona shed 26lb
and nursed himself back to health and fitness so as to join the present
Argentine side. He had been making an impressive come-back when  - yet again
 -he ran off the rails.
Sources close to Fifa said that it normally considered drug offences 'on a
case-by-case basis.'
Fifa has declined to join a world-wide effort to standardise drug punishment
in sport sponsored by the International Olympic Committee. The IOC's accord
generally splits drugs into two groups - those such as caffeine, which can
act as a stimulant if taken in large doses, and others such as anabolic
steroids, taken only to enhance performance.
Argentina would remain in the World Cup, with or without Maradona, Grondona
said.
Two players have been banned by Fifa for positive dope tests at previous
World Cups: Ernest Jean-Joseph of Haiti, in 1974, and, four years later,
Scotland winger Willie Johnston, who tested positive for an illegal
substance he used medicinally. He was sent home.
Simon Kuper adds: Prior to his latest troubles, Maradona had felt himself
part of the best Argentine side he has played for - better, even, than the
World Cup teams of 1986 and 1990. In 1986 Maradona more or less was
Argentina. In 1990 their line-up was Maradona, Claudio Caniggia - and nine
thugs.
'We've got the stuff that makes world champions,' Maradona said of the
present team. Napoli, Boca Juniors and Bolivar of Bolivia have been jostling
to sign him.
The big question is why, at 33, after nearly a year out of soccer, Maradona
bothered to turn up for his fourth World Cup. This is a man with nothing
more to win - so full of cortizone injections that he could end up in a
wheelchair and so rich that 'my daughters will eat caviare every day for the
rest of their lives.'
He keeps going because he is not only rebellious but intensely competitive.
He said that on the night Argentina scraped past Australia to qualify for
this World Cup, he 'wanted to be the last guy to leave the stadium. I wanted
to turn off the lights and walk out with the last fan.'
Maradona had talked of managing the Argentine side soon, but it was hard to
see that working. Somehow he will have to find something else to keep him
off the streets.

FT  01 JUL 94 / 'State takeover' of Venezuelan banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan cabinet has approved a decree which effectively gives the
government full, direct control over the country's troubled banking system.
This is the most recent measure taken by the five-month-old government of
President Rafael Caldera to confront a crisis in the financial system first
made public last January, when the country's second-largest bank, Banco
Latino, failed. Earlier this month, the government closed down eight
financial institutions that had been kept afloat by official financial
assistance.
The decree calls for the establishment of an Emergency Financial Board with
the power to order banks and other financial institutions to take any
measures deemed necessary, remove and replace directors and executives,
suspend an institution's licence to operate, and take over any or all of the
company's shares in the name of the government.
Among its powers, the board can order a healthy bank to 'recycle' its
deposits to banks that are in trouble. One local banker, who asked not to be
identified, warned: 'If this is not handled intelligently, it could mean the
end of Venezuela's financial system.'
The panel, chaired by the minister of finance, includes the president of the
Central Bank of Venezuela, the president of the Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund
(Fogade), and the Superintendent of Banks.
Earlier this week Mr Julio Sosa, the minister of finance, said: 'I hope it
will not be necessary to nationalise Venezuela's banks, but this cannot be
dismissed. Everything depends on the financial system's performance.'
However, as he announced the new decree on Wednesday night, Mr Guillermo
Alvares Bajares, minister of information, said, 'In fact, we can call it a
state takeover.'
At the same time, the finance minister asked the presidents of some of the
country's largest banks to reduce their interest rates on loans by 15
percentage points as part of the government's anti-inflation programme.
Rates on 30-day commercial loans are now at an annual 66-67 per cent, while
rates on passbook savings and longer term-deposits range from 10 to 56 per
cent.
On Wednesday, the cabinet also approved a decree ordering the payment of a
special bonus of Dollars 30 (Pounds 19.70) a month (equivalent) to workers
earning up to Dollars 225 per month. This means that both the government and
private companies will be in effect obliged to provide a big wage rise to
most employees starting on July 1.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Brazil's answer to inflation: get Real: A look at the
biggest currency switch 'in the history of the planet'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From midnight last night, all bank accounts in Brazil were switched
electronically from cruzeiro real to the Real (RDollars ), the new currency
which the country's monetary masters hope will wipe out an inflation rate of
50 per cent a month.
'There has never been such a replacement of money in the history of the
planet,' said Mr Alcir Augustinho Caliari, president of Bank of Brazil.
Preparations for the changeover have been under way for several weeks.
Armoured cars, escorted by the army, have been delivering new currency to
bank branches around the country and the central bank has started
incinerating cruzeiro real notes - and is likely to do so for months.
The old currency will continue to be legal tender for two weeks, at a set
exchange rate of RDollars 1=CrDollars 2,750, while the Dollars 3bn or so of
outstanding notes and coins are swapped into Reals.
It is not the first time Brazil has changed its currency. The four previous
occasions since 1986 involved simple changes of the unit's name or the
slicing off of zeros. This time a completely new currency regime is being
introduced.
The Real has been set at parity with the US dollar. A special interim
accounting unit introduced in February, called the Unidade Real de Valor
(Urv), also equal to the dollar, has helped prepare most wages and prices
for the switch.
Salaries which were quoted in cruzeiro reals were switched to Urvs from
April and, from today, will be switched from Urvs to Reals at a rate of 1:1.
Contracts covering everything from housing rents to school fees, which
previously had to be corrected regularly to keep pace with inflation, are
being transferred into Reals based on average prices over the last four
months.
Shopkeepers were encouraged to use the Urv in preparation for the Real. But
most shop prices will be switched into the new currency from today.
Supermarkets were closed yesterday while price labels were changed.
Despite a TV and pamphlet campaign and a telephone information service, the
government is worried many people still do not understand the mechanics of
the changeover.
The parity link with the US dollar will be maintained for an 'indeterminate'
time - probably until after presidential elections in October - through
intervention in foreign exchange markets with the help of the country's near
Dollars 40bn in reserves.
The supply of the new currency will also be limited, to RDollars 9.5bn
between now and April, a slightly higher limit than expected. But the
central bank will have a 20 per cent cushion in the case of emergencies.
There is concern that the targets could be shifted.
Dollar parity and issuance limits are likely to reduce inflation at least
for a few months, according to economists. And with the interest rate
futures market for July indicating a nominal rate of about 7 per cent, some
say inflation will fall to 2-3 per cent a month by August.
This price stabilisation could lead to a Dollars 20bn 'windfall' for
consumers as their salaries' purchasing power remains stable. This has led
to fears of a consumer boom and widespread shortages. As a result, real
interest rates are likely to remain high for some months.
President Itamar Franco is keen that interest rates fall quickly. However,
Mr Pedro Malan, president of the central bank, said that if interest rates
fell too quickly, money invested in government debt would flee to other
assets, such as land and cars, leading to an 'explosion of consumption'.
President Franco is thought to have vetoed original plans to boost the
autonomy of the central bank and strengthen its role in the National
Monetary Council, Brazil's chief financial authority, because of this
dispute over interest rates.
State and federal banks, which rely on profits from inflation to pay for
overstaffing and often politically inspired loan policies, may face
difficulties if inflation stays low. In an election year, the government is
unlikely to close loss-making banks. Instead, the central bank may be told
to provide short-term support, again placing in question the credibility of
money supply targets.
Economists say the plan faces even more serious challenges in the medium
term. Congress failed this year to revise the constitution, which places
unreasonable spending demands on the government.
'We have a combination of conditions to lead to stability in the next few
months. To consolidate that over the long term is up to (the future)
government,' said finance minister Mr Rubens Ricupero.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Pressure on Fed to lift rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve faces pressure to raise interest rates next week
following the dollar's continuing weakness against the yen and publication
of data indicating US growth remains well above the rate consistent with low
inflation in the longer term.
On Wednesday, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said the recent rise in
bond yields was not threatening US economic growth - a remark that some
analysts interpreted as a green light to the Fed to raise short-term rates
again. President Bill Clinton may also believe that a US rate increase
before the Naples economic summit would put him in a stronger negotiating
position when seeking concerted action to support the dollar and promote
global growth.
Figures yesterday showed robust growth of US personal incomes and factory
orders in May and a sharp rise in an index of prices compiled by Chicago
purchasing managers. The strong data and evidence of upward pressure on
prices prompted sharp falls in bond and share prices.
'The underlying economic trend still looks very strong,' said Mr Jim
O'Sullivan, economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank. He said growth
probably exceeded 5 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter despite
a sharp slowdown in consumer spending because of large positive
contributions from capital spending and construction.
J P Morgan expects US short-term rates to rise 1 percentage point to 5.25
per cent over the next three months and to reach 5.75 per cent by year end,
creating a large positive differential with Japanese and German rates.
Personal incomes rose 0.6 per cent in both April and May, reflecting rapid
growth of employment. As they outstripped consumer spending, the savings
rate rebounded in May to 4.7 per cent against an average of 3.5 per cent in
the first quarter. The recovery of savings indicates the economy is poised
to grow robustly in the second half when exports should benefit from
improving demand in Europe and Japan.
Orders rose 0.6 per cent in May, the ninth increase in the past 10 months.
The Conference Board's 'help-wanted' index also rose sharply in May, a sign
of tightening labour markets.
Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates next week, either at the
policy meeting of governors and regional presidents on July 5 and 6 or a few
days later after the publication of crucial data for June employment, car
sales and department store sales. Preliminary indications from the weekly
'Johnson Redbook' survey indicate a rebound in consumer spending in June.
Some economists believe the Fed will raise the federal funds rate - the rate
at which banks lend to each other - by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent next
week. Other believe it will send a stronger signal by raising both the
federal funds rate and discount rate half a point. The discount rate - the
notional rate at which the Fed lends to banks - currently stands at 3.5 per
cent.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Fiske S&amp;L probe clears White House staff
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US administration officials committed no crimes when they discussed a
savings and loan investigation involving the president, Mr Robert Fiske, the
Whitewater special prosecutor reported yesterday. He also confirmed police
findings that Mr Vincent Foster, a White House aide, committed suicide.
Mr Fiske was releasing his first findings on Whitewater since he was
appointed by Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, this year. The probe,
which originally centred on Mr and Mrs Clinton's financial dealings in
Arkansas in the late 1970s and 1980s, later broadened to include the White
House's handling of investigations into those dealings and Mr Foster's
death.
The report concludes there is insufficient evidence that meetings between
the then deputy Treasury secretary, Mr Roger Altman, another Treasury
official and White House staff to discuss an investigation into Madison
Guaranty, a failed Arkansas saving and loan, broke the law.
Some of Mr Clinton's opponents have implied that the White House might have
wanted to influence the investigation into Madison Guaranty. Federal
investigators claim that Madison may have improperly diverted depositors'
funds to Mr Clinton's gubernatorial campaign and to the Whitewater property
development in Arkansas, in which the Clintons had a stake.
On Mr Foster, who was found shot dead in July 1993, the report dismissed
allegations that his death might have been other than suicide. It also
concluded that matters relating to Whitewater and to Madison did not play a
part in his death.
In an extensive examination of Mr Foster's state of mind, Mr Fiske points to
a wider pattern of depression. Mr Foster had been exhausted and anxious,
particularly over criticism of his role in the sacking of employees from the
White House travel office.
The findings were seized on with glee by the White House yesterday, even
though they cover only a small proportion of the issues Mr Fiske is
examining. 'We believe no law was violated and the report confirms that,'
said Mr Lloyd Butler, the White House special counsel. He said he hoped the
report would put to rest 'the irresponsible speculations - many of them
politically motivated - that something more sinister occurred'.

The fashion for redesigning jobs to increase the efficiency of work

Christopher Lorenz. But it has also produced less striking improvements than
was hoped in productivity, cost levels and timeliness. Small doses only,

The planned US space station survived a critical vote in the House of
Representatives by a wide margin late on Wednesday, but the Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 19.7bn) project may have to trimmed back when it comes before the
Senate, writes Jeremy Kahn.
After intensive lobbying by the administration, the full House voted 278-155
to defeat an amendment to kill the programme. Many feared killing the
station would be a death blow for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which has been hard hit by congressional budget hawks in
recent years. Opponents say the station is 'too much money for too little
science'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The American bald eagle, symbol of the US, is off the critical list after
nearly reaching extinction three decades ago, writes Ken Warn from
Washington. The US Fish and Wildlife Service yesterday proposed an upgrade
in the bird's status from 'endangered' to merely 'threatened'.
The number of bald eagles outside Alaska sank to a low of 417 pairs in 1963.
However, last year, over 4,000 pairs were counted. Instrumental in the
bird's recovery was the banning in 1973 of the pesticide DDT. The pesticide,
in wide agricultural use in the 1950s and 1960s, built up in the food chain
killing many wild birds.
Environmentalists hailed the recovery as a triumph for the 1973 Endangered
Species Act, now before Congress for re-authorisation. However, opponents of
renewal argue that the act imposes too many restrictions on owners of
property where endangered species live, impeding development.
The change in status, likely to become final in 90 days, means the birds
will continue to be monitored by federal law, but not on an individual
basis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The gurus of grunge music - the Seattle-based modern rock band Pearl Jam -
yesterday accused Ticketmaster, the US ticket distributor, of violating
antitrust laws, to a packed congressional meeting room, writes Jeremy Kahn
from Washington.
The US Department of Justice, at Pearl Jam's behest, launched a formal
investigation in May into Ticketmaster's virtual monopoly on sales in the US
entertainment markets. A House subcommittee that oversees justice department
operations called yesterday's hearing to look into Pearl Jam's allegations.
The dispute centres on the service charges Ticketmaster adds to the price of
the seats it distributes. Pearl Jam, who have pledged to keep their ticket
prices under Dollars 20, claims these charges make it impossible to stage
low-cost concerts.
Band members testified that they were unable to find an alternative ticket
distribution system because Ticketmaster has cornered the market in the US
after the Justice Department gave it permission to acquire its failing
competitor, Ticketron, in 1991.
'It is today virtually impossible for a band to do a tour of large arenas or
other significant venues in major cities and not deal with Ticketmaster,'
guitarist Mr Stone Gossard said.
But Mr Fred Rosen, Ticketmaster's chairman, denied his company was violating
anti-competitiveness laws: 'It is frankly a matter of some concern to us
that a rock band can, by virtue of their celebrity status, cause this kind
of hearing to take place.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Christopher's line on Haiti pleases Senate: Military blamed
for number of refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blaming the upsurge in the number of Haitians fleeing their country on 'the
illegitimate military regime's repression', US secretary of state Warren
Christopher yesterday insisted that diplomatic and economic pressure would
succeed in driving out the military leaders who ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago.
'The longer the tragic situation continues, the harder it will become for
those wealthy people who have propped up the dictatorship. In particular,
the more protracted the crisis, the more tenuous is the future of the
Haitian military,' Mr Christopher told the Senate foreign relations
committee yesterday.
Over 2,500 Haitians have been picked up by the US Coast Guard in the last
four days, fleeing to the US in small and often home-made boats and
threatening to swamp the refugee processing system the administration has
set up in Jamaica.
The Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to allow the US to set up another
processing centre and President Bill Clinton has decided to re-open a
refugee camp at the US Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba - a solution
adopted by former President George Bush before he decided simply to
repatriate all Haitians picked up at sea.
Mr Christopher's insistance that the exodus was caused by the military
regime's repression was designed to head off criticism that the
administration had virtually invited Haitians to flee by conveying the
impression that they stood a better chance of winning asylum at the new
processing centre in Jamaica than in the three centres already operating in
Haiti.
The administration has also tried to ratchet up its sanctions on the regime
of the military leader, Gen Raoul Cedras. Earlier this week, it revoked
almost all visas held by Haitians, to reinforce its existing ban on
commercial flights to and from Haiti.
Mr Christopher's comments came as part of a wide-ranging discussion of US
foreign policy issues before a panel of senators, many of whom were visibly
worried at the prospect that the US might tire of waiting for sanctions to
work, and turn to military force to restore Mr Aristide.
'All we are hearing is invasion, invasion, invasion,' grumbled Senator Jesse
Helms, the extreme right-winger from North Carolina who is the senior
Republican on the foreign relations committee.
Mr Christopher won applause - rare and welcome in recent months, when the
administration's foreign policy team has been under steady attack for
inconsistency and indecisiveness - from both Mr Helms and Senator Claiborne
Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the committee.
'I'd like to commend the president and the secretary for the steady hand
they have exercised at the tiller of the foreign policy ship of state. . .
We have not been goaded into an untimely, unwise use of force, whether in
North Korea or Haiti or Bosnia, that would have jeopardised American lives
for an uncertain outcome,' Mr Pell said.
Mr Christopher said his efforts were focused not just on immediate problems
but on 'what I believe to be the most important contribution that I can make
to American foreign policy': the creation of long-term relationships and
structures to last beyond short-term uncertainties that he likened to those
facing President Harry Truman and secretary of state Dean Acheson at the end
of the second world war.
'They met the challenge of reconstruction after world war II, and we are
meeting the challenge of reconstruction in the post-cold war period now,' Mr
Christopher said.

he was postponing for a month a decision on whether to retaliate against
Japan for discriminating against foreign suppliers in government procurement
of telecommunications and medical equipment.
He said the delay, until no later than July 31, was appropriate because
intensive negotiations were still in progress with Japanese officials and
because of the change in the Japanese government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Steel tube producers led by US Steel Group yesterday filed anti-dumping
charges against competitors from seven countries, claiming that they had
seized a quarter of the US market by offering their products at as little as
half their production cost.
The charges cover seamless steel tube used for drilling oil and gas wells,
and are aimed at imports from Argentina, Austria, Italy, Japan, South Korea,
Mexico and Spain.
Austria and Italy are also accused of illegal subsidies which could lead to
the imposition of countervailing duties.
Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel, said that imports of the oil
drilling tubes had tripled in 1993 and continued to surge this year.
He said the seven countries had now captured 23 per cent of the US market,
pushing down prices and jeopardising his company's new Fairfield seamless
tube mill.
The US Commerce Department must now investigate whether dumping and
subsidisation exist, while the ITC will examine whether the US industry has
been materially injured.

FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan set for Dollars 1.3bn South Africa
package - Aid and trade deal will pave way for reinvestment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he takes his seat at the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial
nations in Naples next week Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist
prime minister, will not come entirely empty-handed to the table.
One particular offering that Japanese officials have been preparing for
their premier to bring - an aid and trade package worth as much as Dollars
1.3bn for South Africa's new democratic government - may assume added
significance as a signal of Japan's desire to be a good world citizen in
spite of the country's internal political upheavals.
This will focus on investment projects linked to the reconstruction and
development programme set out by the all-race Pretoria government in sectors
such as telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. It will pave
the way for Japanese companies to reinvest in South Africa at a time when
their funds will be welcomed as an indicator of confidence.
Last week an official Japanese mission flew to Johannesburg to seek out aid
targets. The Tokyo foreign ministry yesterday declined to confirm the
figures, but if the package is on the lines of that planned by the previous
government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, it could comprise some Dollars 300m in
official development assistance, up to Dollars 500m in Eximbank loans and a
further Dollars 500m in trade and investment insurance cover over the next
two years.
The Japanese corporate sector rapidly reined back when the ministry of
international trade and industry had to confess at the height of the
sanctions era in the late 1980s that Japan had suddenly emerged as white-run
South Africa's leading trading partner - ahead of countries such as Germany
which had previously headed the rankings.
In the same way, private enterprise may now follow the Tokyo government's
lead in rebuilding ties with the country under President Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress-led government of national unity. Part of the new
aid will anyway be tied to trade with Japanese companies.
Japan is currently South Africa's fourth largest trading partner as the high
value of the yen has continued to push Japanese multinationals towards
production abroad, but there have so far been few signs that Japanese
companies are ready to invest heavily in South Africa.
Licensing agreements largely maintained a Japanese presence in South Africa
through the sanctions era and in some cases for many years before. The
question now is whether Japanese companies, which until now have been
content to provide parts and brand names to local manufacturing units in
which they have no equity stake, are willing to contemplate closer
operational or shareholding links. No big rush looks likely.
One prime example is Toyota South Africa, the country's biggest car maker, a
family-controlled company quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in which
Toyota of Japan has no direct holding. It obtained franchise rights to use
the Toyota name as far back as 1961 and has imported components ever since -
currently representing some 35 per cent by value of vehicles produced.
In the same way, Mazda vehicles are produced by Samcor, controlled by
Anglo-American, the country's leading conglomerate. The automotive sector is
overcrowded and Mr Peter Arthur, a partner at Webber Wentzel, a Johannesburg
law firm which has recently acted for several multinationals investing in
the country, says that 'we are not seeing new motor manufacturers coming
in'.
Toyota of Japan said yesterday it had no plans to take a stake in Toyota
South Africa which 'is and will remain a completely independent local
company'. But in Johannesburg recently Mr Brand Pretorius, managing director
of the local operation, said it was 'essential for our company to become
part of the global Toyota network'.
What a South African manufacturing base can offer, as never before, is a
bridgehead into the African market as a whole, and to others beyond. As
Japanese companies seek out lower-cost manufacturing sites to escape the
high yen, they are also able further to refine their markets and target the
developing world, where reliable brands carry a similar cachet but pricing
needs to be keener and the product can be more basic.
South Africa's high tariff regime will be eroded only gradually as a result
of the phased accord the outgoing government struck with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
Partly because of a lack of previous capital investment under sanctions, a
lag in relative productivity also serves as a disincentive to inward
investment.
Japanese investments so far have centred on exploiting the country's mineral
wealth.
In May Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading houses, became
the first Japanese company to invest in South Africa since Mr Mandela's
election when it bought a modest 1 per cent stake in Associate Manganese
Mines. Last year the rival Mitsubishi Corporation advanced a Dollars 28m
loan to Western Platinum for mining development and Nippon Denko, an
offshoot of Nippon Steel, linked with the local NST Ferrochrome to produce
high-carbon alloys for the Japanese market.
Beyond the mining sector, Marubeni Corporation established a joint telecoms
venture with the British-linked Plessey Tellumat. But in all, just 30
Japanese companies have offices in South Africa compared with 130 US groups.
And most show no immediate desire to expand. As a Sumitomo official in Tokyo
puts it, 'South Africa is a very distant, very unfamiliar country, not just
for us but for most Japanese companies. We remain very cautious about major
commitments.'

<TEXT>
The US yesterday said it would take new action against China in protest at
'rampant' piracy of computer software, compact discs and books, in a move
that could lead to the imposition of economic sanctions on Chinese exports
to the US.
Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative, said he was formally designating
China as a 'priority foreign country' under the 'special 301' clause of US
trade law.
This designation launches an investigation that could last six months and
bring retaliatory duties on around Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) a year of
Chinese exports - the amount of damage the US estimates is being done to US
companies by Chinese copyright and trademark breaches.
Even before the announcement China had reacted angrily to the move. The
Foreign Ministry said Beijing had 'done its utmost' to protect intellectual
property rights, and called the US measures 'irrational and unacceptable'.
The rift appears likely to remain confined to the trade area. President Bill
Clinton said in May, when he decided to renew China's most favoured nation
trading privileges, that he was 'delinking' trade from human rights issues.
Nevertheless, the intellectual property dispute could bedevil talks under
way in Geneva on China's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, which includes rules on intellectual property protection. 'We will
staunchly support China's accession when they meet the standard,' Mr Kantor
said.
Mr Kantor said China had greatly improved intellectual property laws and
regulations since it signed a memorandum of understanding with the US 2 1/2
years ago, but enforcement of the rules was 'sporadic at best and virtually
non-existent for copyrighted works'.
'Piracy is rampant in the audio-visual, computer software and publishing
sectors, as well as in trademarks,' he said.
US officials say there are 26 compact and laser disc factories in central
and southern China with a capacity to produce 75m CDs a year. China's
domestic market is only around 5m CDs a year.
During recent negotiations in China, US delegates were told by their Chinese
counterparts that piracy of computer software had been stopped, but
immediately went out and bought in a local store illicit copies of Microsoft
operating software and Wordperfect word-processing software with government
approval stamps.
In a related step Mr Kantor moved India from the list of priority foreign
countries to the less urgent 'priority watch list'. Argentina was also kept
on the priority watch list rather than raised to full priority status,
because it had moved to enact new patent legislation.

Austrian companies appear set to secure contracts with Chinese government
agencies for up to Sch10bn (Pounds 574m) in goods and services, after
several years of efforts to build contacts and trade with the People's
Republic.
Several contracts, including one for a Sch500m steel casting plant - by VA
Technologie, for a slab casting machine at a steel works in Benxi  - and
another for up to Sch1.6bn worth of crude oil - by the Austrian integrated
oil group OMV - were signed yesterday during a visit by Mr Li Peng, the
Chinese prime minister, to Vienna. The most important agreement, worth up to
Sch7bn, was in the railway equipment sector, where Austria has many strong
suppliers.
Under the agreement, Austrian companies will receive some Sch3bn worth of
orders for locomotives, rails, switches (points), rail laying machinery,
telecoms and and tunnel construction.
A further Sch3bn to Sch4bn was achievable under the agreement and Mr Viktor
Klima, the Austrian transport minister, held out the prospect of up to
Sch30bn in railway-related contracts with China in the longer term. Mr Klima
said China was suffering from severe bottlenecks in transporting its raw
materials, and so had given the highest priority to railway construction.

India's donor countries yesterday pledged Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) for the
financial year 1994-95 to meet India's 'continued need of high-quality,
long-term development assistance' for projects in areas such as education,
family planning, nutrition, rural works, and control of endemic diseases.
However, donors and financial institutions meeting in Paris at the annual
two-day India Development Forum, chaired by the World Bank, urged India to
strengthen its fiscal discipline, without which they fear the country would
not be able to reap the full benefits of reform.
The Indian government has not sought a fast-disbursing assistance component
this year because of its improved balance of payments position.
'India has made a conscious decision to restrict commercial borrowing and to
concentrate on project disbursement and improving portfolio management,'
said Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, finance secretary, and head of the Indian
delegation.
The International Development Association will today pledge Dollars 3.5bn
worth of aid for development projects.

Several contracts, including one for a Sch500m steel casting plant and
another for up to Sch1.6bn worth of crude oil, were signed yesterday during
an official visit by Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, to Vienna. The
most important agreement, worth up to Sch7bn, was in the railway equipment
sector, where Austria has many strong suppliers.
Under the agreement, Austrian companies will receive some Sch3bn worth of
orders for locomotives, rails, switches (points), rail laying machinery,
telecoms and and tunnel construction.
A further Sch3bn to Sch4bn was achievable under the agreement and Mr Viktor
Klima, the Austrian transport minister, held out the prospect of up to
Sch30bn in railway-related contracts with China in the longer term. Mr Klima
said China was suffering from severe bottlenecks in transporting its raw
materials, and so had given the highest priority to railway construction.
The crude oil deal was signed with the Austrian integrated oil group OMV. It
calls for the delivery to China of up to 1m tonnes of crude oil at
prevailing market prices over a year beginning in August. OMV produced 2.1m
tonnes of oil last year, about half of it in Austria, the remainder in the
UK and Libya.
Half of the volume was fixed, with the remainder to be determined, OMV said.
The total value of the deliveries was expected to be Sch1.5bn.
For its part, VA Technologie, partly privatised through a public flotation
in May, signed a Sch500m contract for a two-strand steel slab casting
machine at a steel works in Benxi, China. VA's sister company Voest Alpine
Stahl signed a declaration of intent which foresees a joint steel production
venture in Ningbo, China.
The agreements were reached in spite of protests from some influential
Austrians about China's poor human rights record.
Mr Erhard Busek, the vice-chancellor and leader of the conservative Austrian
People's Party, is boycotting the visit and a plan for Mr Li to visit
Vienna's city hall to sign the Golden Book was cancelled because of
scheduling problems.

India

<TEXT>
India's donor countries yesterday pledged Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) for the
financial year 1994-95 to meet India's 'continued need of high-quality,
long-term development assistance' for projects in areas such as education,
family planning, nutrition, rural works, and control of endemic diseases.
However, donors and financial institutions meeting in Paris at the annual
two-day India Development Forum, chaired by the World Bank, urged India to
strengthen its fiscal discipline, without which they fear the country would
not be able to reap the full benefits of reform.
Echoing the concerns of other donors, Mr Joseph Wood, vice-president (Asia)
of the World Bank, who presided over the meeting, warned that the 'sharp
deterioration of India's fiscal performance in 1993-94 threatens the future
stability of the economy, reduces fiscal flexibility, and undermines the
credibility of the overall structural reform programme.'
The aid package is lower than last year's figure of Dollars 7.4bn and
Dollars 7.2bn in 1992-93, though pledges of concessional aid (comprising
grants and interest-free loans) are up to 43 per cent from 28 per cent last
year.
The Indian government has not sought a fast-disbursing assistance component
this year because of its improved balance of payments position. The decision
is in line with India's new strategy of becoming a 'discerning and
discriminating borrower of quality assistance to maximise soft loans,'
according to an official.
'India has made a conscious decision to restrict commercial borrowing and to
concentrate on project disbursement and improving portfolio management,'
said Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, finance secretary, and head of the Indian
delegation.
Japan continues to be India's largest bilateral donor, with a commitment of
Dollars 1.2bn this year, its largest ever to India. Bilateral sources
accounted for Dollars 2.4bn this year, as against last year's Dollars 3.2bn.
The Japanese package covers 12 projects in sectors such as power,
environment, and road building.
The World Bank continues to be the largest source of multilateral pledges,
accounting for Dollars 3.5bn of the total of Dollars 3.6bn.
The International Development Association, the soft-lending arm of the World
Bank, will today pledge Dollars 3.5bn worth of assistance for development
projects.

India and Russia have agreed to launch a Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) joint
venture company to service and manufacture spares for military aircraft of
Russian origin. The deal was signed by Mr Narasimha Rao, India's prime
minister, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, writes Shiraz
Sidhva.
The deal, one of two signed during Mr Rao's four-day visit to Russia,
allayed fears in the Indian defence ministry that the substantial
Russian-made component of the Indian Air Force fleet would be redundant if
Russia refused spares to India.
Russia also agreed that India should have access until September this year
to an Dollars 830m credit negotiated with the former Soviet Union for the
purchase of defence items and spares. A large part of the credit, which has
been frozen since early 1992, is still unused.
The proposed joint venture company will be based in India.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Berlusconi and president clash over RAI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has openly challenged the
six-week-old government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi over a cabinet decision that
forced the resignation yesterday of the senior management of RAI, the state
broadcasting corporation.
On Wednesday, the cabinet renewed a decree giving continued financial
backing to RAI, but inserted a clause making clear that it wanted a rapid
management change.
Mr Scalfaro is refusing to sign the decree, apparently on the formality that
the board was properly appointed by the speakers of the two houses of
parliament and could stay in office until the end of the year.
After a day of political tension, a compromise was being hammered out that
obliged the government to rewrite the decree to enable the president to sign
it. The nature of the compromise was still unclear last night.
The resignation of the five-man board was the latest step in a political
battle in which the opposition has accused Mr Berlusconi, the prime
minister, of trying to impose government control on public broadcasting. Mr
Gianni Locatelli, RAI director-general, announced separately that he had
also resigned.
The battle between the government and the president caused nervousness in
the financial markets. Shares on the Milan bourse fell nearly 2 per cent and
the lira came close to the threshold of L1,000 against the D-Mark.
The controversy touches issues well beyond the fate of debt-ridden RAI. It
involves the new right-wing government's control over the principal media
outlets.
The opposition parties, apparently backed by the president, are concerned
that, with Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest controlling 80 per cent of commercial
television, there is a risk that the new government may enjoy an information
monopoly. Mr Berlusconi has been angered by what he regards as the bias of
the three state-run television networks against his government.
Mr Scalfaro is understood to have been pressed by all the opposition parties
to refuse his signature on the ground that too much media power was being
placed under direct government control.
There are few precedents for a president's declining to sign a cabinet
decree. In March 1993 Mr Scalfaro delayed signing a measure to provide
amnesty for people involved in the corruption scandals. His delayed
signature nearly brought the immediate end of the Amato government and was a
significant factor in its eventual collapse.
Constitutional lawyers argued that it would be difficult for the president
not to sign. With the board handing in its resignation yesterday, that might
mean RAI being taken to a bankruptcy tribunal.
RAI last year lost L522bn (Dollars 326m) but since the new management was
brought in, costs have been cut.
Yesterday, the opposition was not denying the need to reform the RAI. But
they said the government was proceeding in a heavy-handed way and failing to
take account of the role of Fininvest.

<TEXT>
Denmark's seasonally adjusted gross domestic product rose 5.2 per cent in
the first quarter of 1994 from the same period last year, according to the
national statistics office. GDP also rose 0.4 per cent from the last quarter
of 1993. The statistics office said the GDP growth figures for 1992 and 1993
were adjusted upward to 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively. The
revised data, compared with original GDP growth figures of 1.2 per cent for
both 1992 and 1993, was based on new material showing higher private and
public sector consumption and increased exports for the two years. The
statistics office also reported seasonally adjusted unemployment down to
12.4 per cent in May from 12.6 per cent in April, and against 12.2 per cent
in May last year. It was difficult to judge, it said, the net effect on the
May figures of state-subsidised job rotation and other labour schemes
introduced this year. Reuter, Copenhagen.
Finland's GDP rose year-on-year for a sixth consecutive month in April,
Statistics Finland said. According to preliminary data, GDP was 4.8 per cent
higher in April than in the same month last year. The bureau also revised
year-on-year GDP growth in March to 3.4 per cent from a preliminary 2.5 per
cent rise reported a month ago.
Portugal's overall trade deficit rose to Es200.3bn (Pounds 786m) in January
to February 1994 from Es198.9bn in the first two months of 1993, the
national statistics institute said. The country's estimated trade deficit
with its European partners fell to Es113.4bn in January-February from
Es122.8bn in the first two months of 1993.
The Russian central bank cut its refinancing rate to 155 per cent from 170
per cent with immediate effect. The rate has been lowered in stages from 210
per cent in April in line with a fall in market interest rates and monthly
inflation.

Turkey's Milliyet newspaper took a 35 per cent stake in one of its two main

to cut costs. Mr Yasar Eroglu said the sale of half of Hurriyet Holding's 70
per cent share in the daily to Milliyet did not herald a merger, but would
allow the two high-spending papers to share costs. He did not say how much
the Milliyet owner, Mr Aydin Dogan, had paid for the stake in Hurriyet.
Hurriyet's net daily sales are around 508,000 and Milliyet sells about

Germany's parliament voted yesterday to amend the post-war constitution to
take account of unification, but it turned down other proposed amendments
and was set to reject several more radical changes. The deputies, meeting in
Berlin's historic Reichstag building, voted 622 to three with four
abstentions for stronger commitments to the rights of women and the
handicapped and for a pledge to protect the environment for later
generations. But they rejected clauses on respecting ethnic minorities and
on the division of power between the federal government and the 16 states,
whose powers Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) have refused
to extend. The CDU has pledged to block the more radical motions, including
one from the combined opposition parties to recognise common law
relationships, whether heterosexual or homosexual. Since changes require a
two-thirds majority, it was almost certain that only the reforms which had
cross-party consensus would pass.

<TEXT>
A senior US diplomat said yesterday that former Yugoslavia could soon be
engulfed by a renewed war inside Croatia, where a ceasefire between Serbs
and Croats is looking tenuous. The warning was issued by Mr Peter Galbraith,
the US ambassador to Zagreb. He warned that in the event of a renewed war,
the Croatian army could be crushed by better armed and more numerous Serb
fighters who would be backed by Belgrade. 'The danger of a new war remains,'
said Mr Galbraith during a visit to Osijek, north-eastern Croatia.
Complaining about Serb intransigence during peace efforts and the absence of
progress in international mediation, Croat officials are threatening to
seize back nearly one-third of their republic's territory which is under de
facto Serb control. If they fail to gain control over the 'state', which
severs Croatia in half, Croat political and military leaders say they will
not renew the UN mandate. Zagreb says the UN presence has simply frozen Serb
military gains, carved out during the six-month war in 1991, although
diplomats believe the 14,000 strong force has prevented an all-out conflict.

Seven Airbus crew members including the European consortium chief test

wide-bodied jet crashed during tests at Toulouse airport. The twin-engine
350-seat airliner went down shortly after take-off while the crew were
testing the auto-pilot system after a simulated engine failure. The test was
being conducted in extreme conditions with the aircraft on a steep angle of
climb and flying at very low speed. It is the first time an A330 has
crashed. There are six in airline service, with Air Inter, the French
domestic carrier, and Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier. All are powered by
General Electric engines. The crashed airliner had Pratt and Whitney
engines. Airbus said last night the two black box flight recorders had been
found. Two Britons were among the crew members killed yesterday. Three
Frenchmen and two Italians also died. The A330 first went into airline
service last year and Airbus has so far won total orders for 118.

FT  01 JUL 94 / IMF tells Ciller's Turkey to get back to basics: A deal
being worked out puts the central bank out of bounds to politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two queues in Turkey's state-owned Ziraat Bank. On one side savers
are lined up in the hope of participating in the government's latest super
bond issue. On the other civil servants and state pensioners wait patiently
to draw their monthly cheques.
It may look like taking from Peter to pay Paul but under the standby
agreement being negotiated with the International Monetary Fund, Turkey will
have little choice but to resort to large-scale domestic borrowing to
finance itself this year.
For behind the bald numbers contained in the letter of intent with the Fund
lies a direct political challenge to the government of Mrs Tansu Ciller. No
longer will the Treasury be able to go to the central bank to print money to
cover the budget gap, the main factor behind the 50 per cent collapse of the
lira in the first half of 1994. After the borrowing binge last year which
pushed Turkey's external debt to Dollars 67bn, the Fund calls for strict
limits on new credits, although in today's uncertainty, there is little
likelihood of Turkey returning to the markets in the short run.
The main anchor will be a floor on official reserves, which will discipline
the government to adopt a more realistic exchange rate policy while forcing
the central bank to use interest rates rather than interventions to support
the lira.
Economists say that for a country which last year lost control of the reins,
the programme marks a return to orthodoxy. And for all the credit Mrs Ciller
is rightly claiming for biting the bullet, her opponents are quick to point
out that the programme constitutes a reversal of the policies she has
pursued since coming to power last June.
The agreement - with the release of the first tranche of a standby facility
likely in early July - envisages radical cuts in the public deficit,
underpinned by a monetary squeeze, to bring down inflation to 20 per cent by
mid-1995, compared with an annual rate of 117 per cent in May.
By restricting central bank credit, the Fund is tying the hands of the
politicians and at the same strengthening the autonomy of the central bank
to pursue its real priority - maintaining exchange rate stability.
Deputy bank governor Mr Bilsel Alisbah says it has taken a crisis to take
steps to strengthen the central bank, which he hopes will no longer 'be used
as an institution to which the Treasury has free access'.
The programme, based broadly on the austerity package announced by the prime
minister on April 5, envisages a 50 per cent cut in the public sector
borrowing requirement to 9 per cent of gross national product through
increased taxes, spending cuts, speedier privatisation and state enterprise
closures. Growth of GNP is expected to be zero in the current year and 3 per
cent in 1995.
On the monetary side, financial liberalisation has made it difficult to
track monetary aggregates. As a result the Fund has focused on the asset
side of the central bank's balance sheet.
The Fund's performance targets include a limit of TL305,000bn (Pounds 6.2bn)
by the year end for the central bank's net domestic assets - implying zero
growth in its domestic lending. The programme also calls for a rebuilding of
central bank reserves from the level of around Dollars 3.4bn today to
Dollars 4bn by the end of 1994 and up to Dollars 6bn by the end of 1995.
Economists point out that the two are intimately related. In the first
quarter, central bank reserves went down by Dollars 3bn, exactly the same
amount that was extended by the central bank to the Treasury in short-term
advances. With the sort of monetary belt-tightening envisaged, economists
believe the reserve targets should be achievable.
The programme leaves the government little option but to return to domestic
debt markets, in essence what is happening. The high interest rates, with
the super bond selling at a compounded rate of 406 per cent, are expected to
force savers to make a portfolio shift from dollars back to lira. The lira
has already strengthened, now at around TL31,000 compared with a low of
TL41,000 in mid-April. However the central bank is likely to curb any sharp
correction which might undermine exports.
Ankara is already feeling the effects, as bureaucrats swelter in offices
deprived of air conditioning - all part of the austerity drive. Squeezing
the finances of the powerful state industries may prove more difficult. In
the past, state companies have in part financed themselves by not paying tax
to the central government or not contributing to the social security system.
In effect this practice understated the size of the deficit of the public
sector enterprises, which was running at about 8 per cent of GNP in 1993.
Under the programme, the Fund is set to scrutinise the performance of seven
of the biggest public state enterprises.
The political fall-out is harder to predict. But it is clear that in being
aimed at agencies such as the Soils Products Office TMO, which acts as the
grain board and accounts for as much as 40 per cent of the public sector
deficit, the monetary squeeze will have a direct impact on the farm sector,
a key constituency for Mrs Ciller's True Path party DYP.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Another rise in French unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French unemployment recorded its biggest monthly increase of the year in
May, rising by 20,800 to reach 3.35m or 12.7 per cent of the workforce, the
labour ministry said yesterday.
The increase, from a revised 12.6 per cent in April, undermines government
claims that the rise in joblessness had stabilised. Mr Edouard Balladur,
prime minister, accepted that setbacks remained possible in the fight
against unemployment, but said the trend was still showing improvement.
Private economists gave some support for this view. 'The figures are
disappointing,' said Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais
Capital Markets. But she cautioned against reading too much into one month's
data, adding that the rise of 44,300 in the number of unemployed in the year
to May compared with an increase of 152,500 in the comparable period in
1993.
The high level of joblessness does, however, reflect the structural problems
in the French labour market and the failure of emerging recovery to make a
significant impact on unemployment. The Patronat employers' federation has
also expressed concerns about the rate of economic recovery, which it
describes as slow, fragile and patchy.
The Bank of France, which has sought to buttress the economy through a
gradual reduction in interest rates, yesterday trimmed the intervention
rate, the key short term rate, by one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.1 per
cent. The rise in long-term interest rates, however, resulting from the
turmoil in the international bond market, could dampen economic recovery,
according to economists.
Government officials warned that unemployment could worsen over the summer
as school-leavers swell the ranks of job-seekers. They claim, however, that
it should stop rising by the end of the year, and start to decline in 1995.
The unemployment rate for April was revised upwards to take account of the
last week's annual revision of the size of the active population, according
to the labour ministry. The unemployment rate for March was also revised
upwards from 12.2 per cent to 12.4 per cent.
The May increase, which was three times larger than previous months, partly
reflected an inflow of young, first-time job-seekers, government officials
said. Redundancies and the number of people ending short-term contracts also
rose.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Lift in growth fails to lighten Swedish gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, Sweden's economy, profoundly shaken by a three-year
recession, is firmly back on a growth path. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development yesterday forecast a 2.7 per cent rise in gross
national product this year, and almost 3 per cent in 1995.
Yet last week, Svenska Dagbladet, the respected daily newspaper, saw fit to
hoist the headline 'Dance of death' over a leading article on the economic
policy debate dominating the campaign for the September general election.
'The Swedish economy is heading for a crash,' the article warned. 'Perhaps
not through a dramatic fall that overnight reduces Sweden to a third class
nation, but through a hasty negative spiral driven by the catastrophic state
finances.' It added: 'An economic boom is not going to save Sweden.'
This dramatic message has been echoed in recent weeks by senior Swedish
businessmen, by the financial markets, and by foreign analyses of the
economy. All have in common the politically unpalatable conclusion that the
painful upheavals and reforms of the past three years have not sufficiently
come to grips with the structural problems blamed on the famously large
state sector.
The focus of their concern is the long-term threat posed by a budget deficit
which in the current budget year is set to total about 14 per cent of GDP,
and the associated phenomenon of the fastest-growing debt among OECD
countries. Foreign debt has shot up from the equivalent of just under 56 per
cent of GDP in 1989 to a forecast 82 per cent next year.
Despite three years of market reform policies under the right-centre
government of Mr Carl Bildt, state spending still accounts for 70 per cent
of GNP. This figure is bloated by the cost of financing record unemployment
totalling 14 per cent of the workforce through some of Europe's most
generous jobless benefits. The budget deficit is set to decline
significantly - but almost half is structural and will not be cured by
economic growth.
Worries about the public finances have already had their effects in the
markets. Swedish interest rates, although much lower than a year ago, remain
at a significant premium over German rates, reflecting concern both about
the public finances and lingering fears that inflation may rear its head
again. This, in turn, has continued to damp much needed investment.
But the outlook may not necessarily so bleak as Svenska Dagbladet suggested.
Mr Bildt's government, though less inclined to advocate austerity in an
election period, is fully committed to furthering the process of structural
reform if it returns to power. The opposition Social Democrats - who hold a
comfortable lead in opinion polls - are meanwhile making an election issue
out of the dire state of the public finances and promising tough action on
the deficit.
Sweden's competitive position has already improved greatly over the past two
years. Its powerful phalanx of multinational companies are well placed to
take advantage of falling trade barriers and a resurgence of world growth.
However, those raising the warning cry are concerned that the Social
Democratic emphasis on selective tax rises, coupled with the party's
commitment to its huge natural constituency in the public sector, could
stymie progress towards further trimming the welfare state and encouraging
private sector growth.
'Dismantling the public sector is likely to prove very difficult
politically,' cautioned Moody's Investor Service in its latest appraisal of
Sweden. 'Without the flexibility needed to compete in international markets,
however, the economy may not be capable of sustaining current living
standards over the long term.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Go-ahead for more Russian asset sales: Next stage of
privatisation aims to attract large investors into companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian cabinet yesterday approved the second phase of the privatisation
of Russian state property - the massive programme of asset sales which has
already seen the largest part of that property pass out of state hands in
exchange for vouchers issued free to the country's 150m people.
The transition from the first to the second phase is a messy one, dictated
by the need to soak up the estimated 3m-9m vouchers of the 148m issued for
the first phase but still not exchanged for shares.
President Boris Yeltsin has decreed that workers can, in certain conditions,
still exchange vouchers for shares until the end of this month; while Mr
Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, has decreed that Muscovites can exchange
their unused vouchers, estimated to number around 220,000, for certificates
which can collect interest at the Savings Bank.
The next stage, proposed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister,
and approved by his colleagues yesterday, is aimed at attracting large
investors into the companies - both those still to be sold and those already
privatised.
To make the process more attractive, Mr Chubais said yesterday that the
second stage of the programme would include a provision to allow enterprises
to acquire the land on which they were situated and to sell excess land on
the market. This provision is certain to increase their value greatly.
However, the draft government decree now being finalised by officials from
the state property committee and the justice ministry must still be signed
by the president - and will not be discussed by the state duma (lower house)
for some time. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, told the Interfax
news agency he feared the presidential decree would differ from the law
likely to be passed by the duma. Right- and left-wing groups in the duma
have already sponsored a motion on privatisation which would effectively
halt the second stage.
A poll conducted for the 'Mnenie' (Opinion) polling organisation in Moscow
earlier this week showed that the majority polled viewed privatisation as a
process which benefited the rich and powerful, gave foreigners control of
Russian companies, threatened jobs and put up prices.
Mr Chubais' advisers acknowledge the amount of progress still to be made,
but are satisfied that the first round has broken the power of the old
ministries over the bulk of post-Soviet enterprises.
The partial nature of privatisation so far was demonstrated yesterday when a
senior official of United Energy Systems, the enterprise which groups
together the 69 regional energy suppliers in Russia, announced that some 16
per cent of the company had been sold in two series of public auctions in
March and June.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Kinkel signals softer line on BSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, yesterday called for a 'European
solution' in the row over UK beef sales to Germany, signalling a more
conciliatory line.
Speaking in London during a day of talks with the British government, Mr
Kinkel said Bonn's planned move to ban British beef imports would not take
effect for at least six months even if approved.
The measure, caused by German fears about BSE or 'mad cow disease', is due
to be discussed in the Bundesrat on July 8. The Bundesrat's health committee
yesterday recommended a limited ban but used wording which would allow the
government not to implement the order if it saw fit.
Mr Kinkel's statement was interpreted by the British Foreign Office as an
attempt to ease Anglo-German differences over BSE. It was also accompanied
by fresh signs that the two countries are making progress in efforts to
choose the next president of the European Commission by the deadline of July
15 set by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said there was a 'reasonable chance'
of meeting the deadline. Officials said Mr Kinkel discussed a compromise
list of candidates with Mr Hurd and Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Meanwhile, the UK government underlined it is taking seriously possible
dangers from BSE. The list of products which may not be used in human and
animal food because of the danger is to be extended to include certain parts
of young calves.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday the risk was
minuscule, but the government had adopted a policy of extreme caution.
Tests had been conducted on mice with offal from calves fed large amounts of
BSE-infected brain tissue. These had shown it was possible to transmit BSE
from the calves to the mice.
She stressed that the government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman,
continued to advise there was 'no evidence whatsoever' that BSE caused
Creutzfeld Jakob disease, the form of BSE which affects humans.

The Norwegian government yesterday ordered more than 1,500 nurses and other
health workers back to work after a three-day strike that affected 38
hospitals and clinics. The minister for local government, Mr Gunnar Berge,
met representatives for the Norwegian Nurses Association and four other
hospital workers' unions and told them of the government's decision to force
the striking parties to take the conflict to legal arbitration today. The
conflict, centering around the female nurses' demand for equal pay with
their male colleagues, has reportedly led to serious consequences at the 38
hospitals and clinics involved. Several cancer operations and other vital
surgery were cancelled during the strike and many people in need of
hospital-care were turned away without treatment. 'Since we don't see any
willingness from the five unions to return to negotiations, we have to
consider the suffering by the sick and the serious consequences this
conflict is causing, we have decided to force the parties to come to legal
arbitration tomorrow,' Mr Berge said in a statement to reporters.

Serbs have pulled heavy weapons out of United Nations-monitored storage in
Croatia and moved some tanks into neighbouring Bosnia, a UN official said
yesterday. The report fed fears of an escalation in fighting as
international mediators began trying to 'sell' the warring parties in Bosnia
a new peace. Serbs took almost 20 tanks and artillery pieces from storage
over the past several days, said UN spokesman Mr Paul Risley. Some were
moved across the border into the Bihac area of northwestern Bosnia, where a
rebel Moslem leader's troops are fighting government loyalists. 'We are
concerned there by the presence of several tanks and heavy weapons belonging
to the military of the Serb authorities in Knin, which have recently been
deployed across the border,' he said. Knin is the self-styled capital of
regions captured by Serbs and held since a six-month war in 1991. They
refuse to submit to Croatian authority and hope to unite their regions with
Serb-held parts of Bosnia and Serbia proper.

FT  01 JUL 94 / CBS close to merger with TV shopping network
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Barry Diller, the US film industry executive who heads QVC Network, the
cable television shopping group, would become chief executive of CBS, the
television broadcasting network, under a merger plan being discussed by the
two businesses.
The companies said yesterday they were close to an agreement under which the
much smaller QVC would be merged into CBS in a complex deal involving common
and convertible stock, as well as a large cash pay-out to CBS stockholders.
Mr Diller, who is regarded as one of the most talented Hollywood executives,
would become chief executive of the combined group, as well as president and
head of the board's executive committee. Mr Laurence Tisch, at present
chairman and chief executive of CBS, would remain chairman of the group.
The two sides expect their boards will approve an agreement in mid-July, but
observers cautioned that the deal might flush out a hostile bid for CBS from
a third party.
Wall Street expressed its enthusiasm for the merger by sending CBS stock up
Dollars 47 or 17.9 per cent to close at Dollars 310, giving it a market
capitalisation of around Dollars 4.9bn. QVC rose Dollars 5 5/8 or 17.4 per
cent to close at Dollars 38, capitalising it at around Dollars 1.6bn.
Analysts said a link-up would be positive for both companies.
Mr Diller, who built Fox Broadcasting into a fourth US television network
before quitting to take over control of QVC, has been trying to build the
home shopping company into a powerful media conglomerate. Last year he made
an unsuccessful Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) bid for Paramount
Communications, the film and publishing group.
CBS, a troubled company when Mr Tisch took control in the mid-1980s, has
become the most successful of the three big US broad casting networks,
judged by their prime time audience ratings. But critics say it has not
followed the lead of rivals ABC and NBC and diversified into cable
television, which has gradually eroded the networks' share of US viewers.
They also question the strength of its programming.
Fox Broadcasting, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's media empire, recently shocked
the television industry by enticing away eight stations, owned by New World
Communications, which had been previously affiliated to CBS.
CBS, which earned Dollars 326m last year on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, owns
seven television stations and 21 radio stations in addition to its
television network. QVC, which runs two cable television channels selling
consumer goods ranging from jewellery to clothing, made Dollars 59m on
revenues of Dollars 1.2bn in its last financial year.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Royal Mail sale set to go ahead: Heseltine announces plans
to sell off majority stake in postal service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government appears set to go ahead with legislation to privatise the
Royal Mail in next year's parliamentary session after Tory backbenchers gave
a broad welcome yesterday to proposals for the sale.
The proposal to sell off 51 per cent of the state postal service is
contained in a green paper published yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary.
If enacted, the legislation would lead to the largest privatisation since
the sale last year of the government's remaining stake in British
Telecommunications. The sale, which may raise more than Pounds 1bn, would
probably take place in 1996, in the run-up to the next general election.
Mr Heseltine said the sale of a majority stake in the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcel delivery subsidiary, was the
government's 'strongly preferred option'.
He said: 'To survive and prosper, the business needs greater commercial
freedom to seize new opportunities and to meet greater competitive
challenges in the communications market.'
Under Mr Heseltine's scheme - one of three included in the green paper  -
the Post Office's counters division, which oversees its 20,000 post offices,
would remain in public ownership as a separate entity.
There would be statutory guarantees for the continuation of nationwide
deliveries and a single national tariff.
An independent regulator would be responsible for overseeing the privatised
Royal Mail.
In an attempt to reassure the public and Tory backbenchers, Mr Heseltine
carefully pitched partial privatisation between the other two options in the
green paper: continued state control and a 100 per cent sale.
He said the first course offered Post Office managers insufficient
commercial freedom, while the second might not reflect 'the important role
which Royal Mail plays in our national life'.
Mr Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office, said Mr Heseltine's plan was
'a real winner for Britain'.
'This shareholding partnership option is . . . in tune with the public's
desire to see a strong link maintained between government and Royal Mail,'
he said.
The government's endorsement of the 51 per cent share flotation was seen at
Westminster as a victory for Mr Heseltine against cabinet colleagues who had
urged a more cautious approach.
At the same time, the document's proposals appear to have been astutely
designed to appease the few Tory backbenchers who fear that privatisation
might undermine rural postal services.
One minister suggested that the government could now confidently announce a
bill to privatise the Royal Mail and Parcelforce in the Queen's speech in
November. The consultation period outlined in the green paper is due to end
in September, and work on a bill is already well under way. However, some
Tory backbenchers continue to express doubts about the plans.
Ms Anne Winterton, Tory MP for Congleton, was concerned that the
government's stake in the Royal Mail would not be guaranteed in the long
term. She said: 'If it is not Mr Heseltine's intention to sell off the
remainder of the shares, why doesn't he just come out and say so?'
The Labour party and the 160,000-strong Union of Communications Workers
pledged opposition. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman,
said: 'As a private business, the Post Office would focus not on how it
could serve the public but on how it could make money.'

FT  01 JUL 94 / Britain and China in military land deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and China agreed yesterday on a military land deal in one of the
most comprehensive bilateral agreements signed since the 1984 accord under
which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
The agreement was reached just hours after the Legislative Council (LegCo)
approved democratic reforms proposed by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor,
despite intensive lobbying against the proposals by China.
Mr Patten described the accord with China as an honourable agreement. 'It is
a good and fair bargain over what has been a difficult issue for both
sides,' he told the Financial Times.
The lands deal commits the Hong Kong government to spending HKDollars 4bn
(Pounds 335m) on building military facilities, including a new base for the
Chinese navy. In return, Hong Kong will receive former military sites worth
HKDollars 65bn in redevelopment rights.
The agreement commits the People's Liberation Army to surrendering to the
post-1997 Hong Kong administration all land surplus to its requirements. The
PLA has also undertaken to use the land only for military purposes, and to
make its personnel stationed in Hong Kong subject to Hong Kong law.
Coming so close after the LegCo vote, yesterday's agreement was the clearest
sign to date that China is prepared to put its row with Britain to one side
and get on with the practical business of the handover.
In Beijing, Mr Shen Guofang, the foreign ministry spokesman, described the
military bases accord as 'an important achievement'. His remarks were seen
as an indication that China was anxious to separate political issues from
the practical consid-erations of ensuring a smooth transfer of power. The
governor said he was hopeful that with this agreement the two sides could
accelerate co-operation. 'We have no option but to step up the pace of
co-operation,' he said in an interview. 'The transfer of sovereignty is only
three years away.'
Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's senior representative to the Joint Liaison Group,
the body charged with negotiating the details of the transfer, said he
believed that if past differences could be put to one side there was no
reason why the JLG could not enter into a more productive and useful phase.
However, another British official doubted if the work required could be
completed by 1997. He said: 'If everything goes very well, then we could
complete three quarters of it, but not all.'
In general, however, British officials were upbeat about the defence lands
deal. One said: 'The Chinese have come to terms with what has happened on
the political front. It won't be easy for us, but we have a basis for
talking to them.'
Nevertheless, Mr Shen reiterated in Beijing that China would not accept this
week's electoral reforms, approved by Hong Kong's Legislative Council, which
he insisted ran counter to prior agreements on the handover. He said
differences over Hong Kong would continue to bedevil Sino-British relations.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Labour heads off challenge by SNP in Monklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party last night clung on to the Monklands East seat that had
been held by the late John Smith, the party's former leader, narrowly
defeating the Scottish Nationalist party in a parliamentary by-election.
Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate, won the seat with a margin of only
1,640 votes over the SNP, well down from the majority of nearly 16,000
enjoyed by Mr Smith at the last election.
Labour activists were relieved to have avoided a humiliating defeat in the
constituency held by their respected former leader. However, their party's
share of the vote fell by 11.5 percentage points after a bitterly fought
campaign which centred on allegations of corruption by the Labour-run local
council.
The Conservative candidate came fourth behind the Scottish Liberal
Democrats, losing her deposit.
In her victory speech, Mrs Liddell claimed that the SNP had run a 'dirty
campaign', which sought to exploit tensions and divisions in the local
community.
However, SNP activists were delighted to see their share of the vote
increase by nearly 27 percentage points from the 1992 general election.
Their performance follows a stunning European election result, in which the
SNP won a record 32.6 per cent of the vote across Scotland.
Throughout the campaign, the Scottish Nationalists have benefited from
allegations that Labour-controlled Monklands district council has heavily
favoured one section of its community in decisions on capital spending.
Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors have alleged that a clique on
the council - popularly dubbed 'the Monklands mafia' - has favoured the
predominantly Roman Catholic area of Coatbridge over Protestant Airdrie. At
the start of the campaign, Mrs Liddell, who is a former general secretary of
the Scottish Labour party, tried to stay aloof from allegations about the
council's activities.
However, last week, she acknowledged recent spending figures had favoured
Coatbridge.
Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, waged an aggressive nationalist
campaign. She called for an independent SNP government, which would
renationalise Scotland's gas and electricity industries among others.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Cazenove quits as Telegraph group's broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, NORMA COHEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black's Telegraph group suffered a blow to its prestige yesterday
as Cazenove, one of London's most respected stockbrokers, resigned as broker
to the company.
No reason has been given for the resignation, but it is understood that the
move was related to last month's sale of Pounds 73m of Telegraph shares by
Mr Black's private company. Last week the Telegraph slashed its cover price,
causing the shares to fall by more than a third.
It was also announced yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading is to make
inquiries into the newspaper price war being waged between The Daily
Telegraph and The Times, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch. The OFT said it
expected its director-general, Sir Bryan Carsberg, would spend most of July
looking at the issue before deciding whether formal action was required.
Cazenove's decision was taken after detailed discussions with the Telegraph,
after which both sides said they agreed that this was an 'appropriate time'
to part.
A senior Cazenove official said this was the first time in recent memory
that Cazenove had voluntarily resigned as stockbroker to a company. The
Telegraph's shares fell 15p yesterday to 364p.
A Telegraph official expressed regret at Cazenove's decision. 'We are
obviously sad that they felt they had to make that move in response to their
own business pressures,' she said. The Telegraph is to remain with its other
broker, Panmure Gordon, which was not involved in last month's share sale
nor in the Telegraph's initial flotation.
Cazenove became corporate adviser to the Telegraph in 1985, when Mr Black
first acquired his stake, and stockbrokers on its flotation in 1992.
Cazenove declined to comment on its decision.
The Times first cut its price in September last year. The Telegraph annual
report, signed off on March 24, said 'at the end of 1993, it was clear that
brand strength and editorial quality were winning against price
discounting'. The Telegraph's first-quarter report, issued a week before the
share sale, referred to 'a good start to 1994'.
Since announcing the price cut, Mr Black has said it could cost Pounds 40m
in revenues, which would be offset in part by tax and cost savings.
One leading institutional fund manager who had declined the offer of shares
last month said: 'No serious analyst of the media industry could fail to see
there is a newspaper price war going on.'
The fund's main reason for turning down the share offer was that 'we were
uneasy about buying shares in a company which is a subsidiary of the company
through which Conrad Black controls his personal wealth'.
The OFT's announcement was welcomed last night by Labour's consumer affairs
spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths. He described The Daily Telegraph's role in
the price war as 'reactive', and the role played by Mr Murdoch as
'predatory'.
Last October the OFT held back from launching a formal investigation into
The Times's first price cut, on the ground that it reflected a calculated
commercial decision that could not be considered as predatory.
