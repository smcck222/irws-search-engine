FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The muted reaction of Eurotunnel's share price to this week's news that a
full shuttle service for drivers and cars will be phased in from November is
understandable. The tunnel has been dogged by colossal risks ever since the
project was conceived. Now the worry is focused on the risk that the project
will not be able to generate the returns necessary to cover its operating
costs and to service a funding requirement calculated to be Pounds 10.1bn at
its peak. As the maximum commitment Eurotunnel has teased out of its bankers
is Pounds 10.5bn, there is only limited room for manoeuvre.
On the basis of assumptions made in April, when the project was rescued with
a rights issue, Eurotunnel hopes to make a small pre-tax profit in 2002 and
a declare a dividend for the following year. But some of the assumptions on
revenues and interest rates made then already look questionable. For example
the delay in opening the shuttle service has meant that Eurotunnel missed
the peak summer season; details of the resulting shortfall will be disclosed
at the interim stage next month. Eurotunnel may soon breach its banking
covenants, possibly requiring shareholders to stump up fresh equity for the
fourth time since the project was launched.
Completion of the tunnel is undoubtedly a historic achievement which may one
day prove lucrative to its owners. But the debt burden is so great that this
generation of shareholders is unlikely to enjoy a bonanza.

FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Growth accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance yesterday's second quarter UK growth figures suggest
consumers have been literally tightening their belts since April's tax
rises. Spending on food fell a striking 2.6 per cent during the quarter. The
usual worries over seasonal adjustment, however, mean such data must be
taken with a pinch of salt. The data may also again understate the savings
rate, but the broad message is clear. Thanks not least to a robust export
performance, the economy is growing at a vigorous clip and, despite a fall
in real disposable income, individuals seem willing to reduce their net
saving to finance consumption.
The question is whether this increased propensity to borrow reflects a
lasting improvement in confidence. Perhaps tax increases have taken cash out
of consumers' hands before they have had time to adjust their spending
habits. If so, private consumption may soon decelerate markedly, especially
now that base rates have risen. Despite yesterday's strong figures the
authorities have grounds to wait a while before considering another
increase.
Clearly, though, the overall rate of growth will remain decisive. Even if
consumer demand is not overheating, export-led growth still means the output
gap is closing. Capacity use is tightening and manufacturers have a greater
inclination to pass on cost increases. The authorities would almost
certainly prefer growth closer to 3 per cent. Easing it back to that level
without trampling on consumer confidence in the process will be a delicate
task.

FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico shares surge after
roller-coaster session
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican shares closed sharply higher after a roller-coaster session driven
by rumours that the annual anti-inflationary pact was about to be signed,
traders said.
The IPC index rose 29.01, or 1.03 per cent, at 2,857.52, just off the
session high.
'After some profit-taking at midday that cut into the early gains, the index
resumed its advance in late trading on investor expectations that the pact
will be signed this weekend,' a trader said.
Advancing shares led declines 72-22 in brisk trade of 111.4m shares.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed higher as two new opinion polls showed Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso was likely to win Brazil's presidential elections
in the first round. Investors like Cardoso's plans to liberalise the economy
and privatise more government companies. The Bovespa index gained 580, or
1.1 per cent, to 54,532.

FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as Fed meeting is
awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks slid lower for the fourth successive day yesterday as investors
remained nervous about the outcome of next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal
Reserve's policy-making arm, writes Richard Waters in New York. Yesterday's
falls left the Dow Jones Industrials Average 101.60 lower than its level at
the end of the previous week.
Concern that the Fed will raise interest rates for the sixth time this year
have been behind the slide. Friday's losses were more modest than previous
days, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 5.38 to 3,831.75, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.60 at 459.67. The
American Stock Exchange composite was up 0.32 at 455.23, while the Nasdaq
composite receded 2.98 to 757.46.
After driving the Dow industrials down rapidly in the previous three
sessions, investors were still on edge over the outlook for interest rates,
which some market analysts said could be raised by as much as half a
percentage point next week. There was no clear consensus on Wall Street as
to whether the Fed would come down in favour of an immediate tightening of
credit conditions during Tuesday's session.
As a result equity investors seemed content to let share prices drift. Bond
traders were also taking a wait-and-see approach. Trading was quiet and bond
prices across the maturity range moved marginally lower. There was no fresh
economic news to disturb the uneasy tranquility.
At first the lazy mood put stocks on firmer ground as bargain hunters
stepped in after the recent downturn. But as the day wore on, the jitters
intensified once again and the blue chip index slipped back into negative
territory.
Among the components of the Dow industrials, Disney dropped Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 39 1/2 amid continuing reports of management turmoil at the company.
Boeing shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 7/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble receded
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 . Offsetting the declines, Kodak rose Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 and International Paper was up Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 78 1/4 .
The action elsewhere was mixed as well. On the NYSE as a whole, delining
issues held a modest edge over advances during the day.
The Big Three car makers fell out of favour, with General Motors losing
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/2 and Chrysler dropping Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 43 5/8 . A related issue, Goodyear Tire, shed Dollars 1 to close at
Dollars 32 1/8 .
Georgia-Pacific was a bright spot, thanks to a favourable re-rating by
Kidder Peabody. The stock jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 74 5/8 .
In the technology sector, Digital Equipment was marked down Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 25 7/8 on a downgrading by PaineWebber, which said the stock was
overvalued.
On the Nasdaq, most computer stocks suffered setbacks. Intel was down
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 1/4 , Sun Microsystems retreated Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 29 1/4 and Oracle gave back Dollars  5/16 to Dollars 43 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto trading picked up sharply today after yesterday's lacklustre
session, with the TSE composite index closing up slightly.
The TSE-300 index added 4.89 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,367.54 in volume
of 74m shares. Advancing issues beat declines by 389 to 357. The TSE was
down 36 points on the week.
Ten of the 14 indexes were down, led by transportation and industrial
products. Golds, mining, conglomerates and energy all gained on the day. The
New York spot price for gold closed up 40 cents (US) to Dollars 395.95 an
ounce.
In the gold group, Franco-Nevada gained 1 to 87; American Barrick added 7/8
to 36 1/8; Echo Mines was up 5/8 to close at 18 3/8.

FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region pessimistic on
fears of further US rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the fear of a further tightening of US interest rates next week
weighing on investors' worldwide, the Pacific Region took the view ahead of
the weekend that there was little to be optimistic about.
Tokyo was closed yesterday for a public holiday.
The consensus among analysts seems to be that the US Federal Reserve is
likely to move interest rates 50 basis points higher at its Tuesday meeting,
with the consequent knock-on effects throughout the world.
However, there is also a view among analysts that the US does not need to
take further action because the threat of rising inflation in the country
remains small.
Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, for instance, remarks that improvements in
productivity mean that the US economy can grow more quickly without
generating inflation. 'With productivity at world-beating levels, there is
just no evidence that inflation is a potential problem in the US . . . Rates
have already gone up 175 basis points this year which will slow the economy.
When this starts to happen long bond yields will fall towards more sensible
levels, ones which reflect the low inflation outlook for the US economy.'
Credit Lyonnais believes that in this situation the outlook for Asia would
be good, also because high inflationary expectations from weak Bund sales
and excessive monetary growth in Germany should weaken confidence in the
European currencies.
'The upshot will be a rise in US equities and bonds and a movement of funds
out of Europe and into the Asia markets. But to keep funds long term in the
region, Asian governments need to address any threat to their export
competitiveness,' it concludes.
SINGAPORE saw some life return to the market as selective foreign buying
boosted the Straits Times Industrials 15.96 higher at 2,302.05, little
changed on the week.
Brokers said investor sentiment has firmed on the prospect of new foreign
money coming into the market in the form of Asian equity mutual funds.
KUALA LUMPUR closed lower as funds cashed out after a strong run, although
speculative demand was still evident.
The composite index lost 9.56 to 1,170.32, for a 1.3 per cent fall on the
week. Volume was again heavy at 549m shares.
KLI Holdings was in the limelight, gaining MDollars 1.36 or 30 per cent to
MDollars 5.90, driven by rumours of a MDollars 1bn property development deal
in Sabah state.
Acidchem jumped 80 cents to MDollars 8.50 on speculation that the company
was to be taken over by a prominent businessman, while continuing rumours of
a change of ownership pushed Yeo Hiap Seng up another MDollars 1.70 to
MDollars 15.80.
BANGKOK saw selling of blue chips which pushed the SET index off 25.37 at
1,506.06 on turnover of Bt8.9bn, a week's decline of 2.6 per cent.
Siam Cement lost Bt30 to Bt1,288, Telecom Asia lost Bt2 to Bt104 and Bangkok
Bank tumbled Bt6 to Bt208.
HONG KONG finished easier after some late program selling triggered by
weakness in overseas bourses. The Hang Seng index fell 35.67 to 9,632.47,
taking the week's decline to 3.4 per cent. Turnover was HKDollars 3.07bn
against Thursday's HKDollars 4.87bn.
HSBC Holdings fell 50 cents to HKDollars 87.75 and Hang Seng Bank eased 25
to HKDollars 54.50.
Against the trend, Cepa rose 60 cents to HKDollars 18.60 after it signed a
deal to build power plants in India. Its parent, Hopewell, gained 15 cents
to HKDollars 7.25.
SEOUL saw a continuation of the consolidation in primary blue chips which
led the market's record-breaking rally in the early part of the week. The
composite index closed 3.02 lower at 1,030.99, but was still 3.0 per cent
higher over the week. Volume was active with 46.3m shares traded, up from
Thursday's 43.44m.
TAIPEI finished slightly higher, recovering from Thursday's sharp
correction, and brokers commented that the market would continue to
consolidate below the 7,000 level. The weighted index finished up 40.40 at
6,930.28, for a week's loss of 0.7 per cent. Turnover was thin at TDollars
49.4bn.
The plastics sector supported gains, with Union Petrochemical rising
TDollars 4 to TDollars 68.50 and Taiwan Polypropylene up TDollars 5 to
TDollars 83.50.
MANILA maintained its positive tone helped by strong gold prices. The
composite index advanced 25.00 to 2,959.36 on volume of 3.7bn shares worth
1.90bn pesos, after 5.26bn shares worth 4.67bn pesos on Thursday. The week's
rise was 0.6 per cent.
Philex Mining led second-line gains, rising nearly 7 per cent to 3.10 pesos.
BOMBAY trading was abandoned after a fire broke out in a building adjacent
to the bourse.
Trading stopped after midsession when the BSE 30-share index was 44.75
higher at 4,496.53, a 2.6 per cent fall over the week.
SYDNEY was slightly weaker but the decline was moderated by a rise in gold
issues. The All Ordinaries index dropped 0.5 to 2,027.7, down 1.5 per cent
over the week.
The gold index supported sentiment, with the index rising 56.3 to a
six-month high of 2,386.5. Among gold stocks, Placer Pacific added 15 cents
to a seven-year high of ADollars 4.05, and Poseidon Gold rose 22 cents to a
seven-month high of ADollars 4.04. Newcrest Mining rose 17 cents to ADollars
6.85.
The All Industrials index finished 2.0 lower at 2,872.0, while the All
Resources edged 0.7 higher to 1,402.0. Volume was 185.9m shares.
BHP lost 14 cents to ADollars 19.74 following lower than expected first
quarter results.
WELLINGTON made ground although volume was light. The NZSE-40 capital index
added 14.10 to 2,080.53, a loss of 1.4 per cent across the week.

FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent ends the week
cautiously higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a less volatile day's trading in Europe yesterday worries
remained over a possible rise in US interest rates next week.
As a consequence Nomura's strategists have advised further selling of
equities for cash, with or without a further rise in short term rates.
'Equites are an each-way loser,' says Nomura. 'Even higher bond yields and
the equities dive; bond rallies born out of further short rate rises and/or
switching out of equities have exactly the same effect - note that the Dow
fell last Tuesday night after the bond market had rallied.'
Nomura is pessimistic and has recommended reducing a global equity
allocation by 10 per cent to 50 per cent and raising cash to 30 per cent,
while aiming to buy bonds between now and the end of the year.
FRANKFURT moved higher on encouraging state inflation data and strength in
the bond markets. The Dax index finished up 16.09 at 2,089.12, before rising
further to 2,092.75 in the Ibis. Turnover on the day was DM5.7bn and the
market gained 1.4 per cent on the week.
Activity again remained low with corporate news only patchy. There were
reports that Daimler's long term debt ratings had been downgraded by
Standard &amp; Poor's which left the shares off 90 pfennings at DM779 in the
Ibis.
PARIS recovered some of the losses of the previous sessions, ending the
session, also the last day of the account, some 1.5 per cent higher and
unchanged over the week.
The CAC-40 index closed up 27.98 at 1,927.35.
The account ended with a loss of nearly 4 per cent.
Recommending a neutral stance on the French market Kleinwort Benson noted
that foreign investors, who supported the market in 1993 by investing some
FFr75bn, have now gone underweight in favour of Germany.
Credit Lyonnais CIs remained under pressure after the group's postponement
of first-half figures. The CIs, which are thinly held, dipped FFr5.80 to
FFr395.20.
MILAN overcame early disappointment over the failure of the government and
unions to agree on pensions reform at a meeting on Thursday as hopes rose
for a break in the deadlock on Monday.
The Comit index registered a 2.94 fall to 668.19, taking the week's loss to
1.5 per cent. However, the real-time Mibtel index rose 48 on the day to
10,737.
Olivetti was up L40 at L2,053 after announcing better than feared six-month
figures on Thursday. Pirelli was L16 higher at L2,607 ahead of the release
of its first-half results this afternoon.
Generali was down L289 at L39,374 after reporting weaker than expected
first-half results.
ZURICH nudged higher in low volume, supported by firmer bond futures, and
the SMI index rose 6.2 to 2,609.1, little changed over the week.
Insurance issues, which had an active week, closed mixed. Swiss Re, the
subject of speculation that it aims to acquire Elvira, added to the week's
advances with an SFr8 rise to SFr571, although analysts noted that the share
had fallen by 30 per cent since the beginning of the year following various
sell recommendations.
Merkur, the retailer, put on SFr4 to SFr361, ahead of its announcement of
better than expected first-half profits and a forecast of improved full year
figures.
AMSTERDAM was another beneficiary of the better mood across the continent
yesterday. The AEX index improved 3.25 to 403.61m but down almost 1 per cent
on the week.
Heineken was unchanged at Fl 238. Kleinwort Benson has downgraded the stock
from a buy to hold on the basis that the shares are now fully valued. The
brokers commented that since July the shares have appreciated by nearly 16
per cent and have outperformed the Dutch market by 9 per cent.
MADRID saw an end to its five-day losing streak, picking up 1.5 per cent in
response to firmer government bond prices, short-covering, and the opening
gains on Wall Street. The agreement between the minority ruling Socialist
party and the CiU centre-right Catalan nationalist party over the 1995
budget also gave support to bond and equity markets.
The general index closed 4.36 higher at 298.82 in volume of Pta25.9bn. The
market was down 0.8 over the week.
Blue chips led the market higher, with Telefonica up Pta60, or 3.6 per cent,
at Pta1,750. Endesa added Pta160 to Pta5,530 and Repsol gained Pta75 to
Pta3,815.
Bankinter added Pta190 or 1.7 per cent to Pta11,520 after the bank said it
planned to pay a second 1994 gross dividend of Pta116 pesetas, up 9.5 per
cent from 1993.
OSLO fell back on fears that the country might reject EU membership in a
November 28 referendum.
The All-share index lost 2.46 to 596.62 in spite of higher prices for North
Sea oil and lower interest rates. Turnover was NKr529m.
Norsk Hydro shed NKr2 to NKr239.
STOCKHOLM improved helped by strong financial stocks. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 12.0 to 1,428.3, off 1.5 per cent on the week.
Turnover was moderate at SKr2.7bn.
The banking and insurance index rose 2.5 per cent: S-E-Banken A shares
gained SKr1.20 to SKr47, while Skandia put on SKr4 to SKr125.

FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: HK announces companies to replace
Jardine group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trading of index-related stocks is expected to dominate the Hong Kong
exchange on Monday as investors react to the choice of seven companies to
replace five Jardine group companies in the Hang Seng index, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
However, analysts said there were few surprises in the index changes, which
were announced on Friday.
Joining the index on November 30 are Amoy Properties, Guangdong Investment,
Johnson Electric Holdings and Oriental Press Group Ltd.
On February 28, Shangri-La Asia, Sino Land and South China Morning Post
(Holdings) will join the index.
Textile companies Lai Sun Garment International and Winsor Industrial Corp
will be deleted from the index on November 30.
Analysts said that investors might be disappointed by the failure of banking
group Guoco Group, investment company Henderson Investment and First Pacific
to make it into the index. Their shares had recently risen on confidence
they would be included.
Brokers said the new constituents were capitalised at around Dollars 11bn,
compared with around Dollars 23bn worth of stocks departing. However, the
Hang Seng index as a proportion of the market would stay roughly the same
without the Jardine group.
The revised Hang Seng Index will cover about 70 per cent of the market in
value terms. The total number of constituent stocks will remain at 33.
Jardine Strategic and Jardine Matheson will delist in December. Land,
Mandarin and Dairy Farm will delist next March.

Gold shares closed with cautious gains while the stronger financial rand had
a dampening effect on activity. Industrials ended firmer but the undertone,
brokers said, remained nervous.
The overall index added 1 to 5,755, the gold index made 13 to 2,468 and
industrials 18 to 6,358.
De Beers fell R2 to R103, Kloof put on R1.25 to R73 and Freegold fell 50
cents to R73.50. Pick n Pay lost R1.25 to R10 after disappointing annual
results.

FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer trend at the close of a
nervous week - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market ended a difficult week on a slightly steadier note with
the help of an improvement in the stock index futures and bond sectors. But
trading volume remained unimpressive and nerves were taut ahead of next
Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which is expected to
review US interest rates.
In early trade, the FT-SE 100 Index plunged by 22 points to 2,999.2 and
dealers looked distinctly nervous at this loss of the psychologically
important 3,000 mark. Equity chartists see the next support levels in the
FT-SE 2,970 area if the market continues to slide.
However, a good recovery was made and the FT-SE 100 Index closed at 3,028.2
for a net gain of 7 points, having touched 3,035.8 at the day's best.
The Footsie has fallen by just over 1 per cent this week as interest rate
concern has focused on the Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve and also on
trading statements from leading British companies.
Nervousness over the outlook for UK company profits forecasts heightened
yesterday after reports that shares in Hanson had been downgraded by the
company's own stockbroker. There were heavy falls among food retailers after
analysts marked the sector a sell on fears prompted by the latest evidence
that the price war is reviving in markets already faced by severe price
competition and tighter profit margins.
Kleinwort Benson Securities this week became the first UK securities house
to sharply reduce its forecasts for UK corporate profits for this year and
next while BZW warned yesterday that faith in strong earnings growth 'might
be misplaced'.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, with a range extending to second line issues,
steadied yesterday, closing 1.2 firmer at 3,560.9. But traders said there
was little substance behind the equity rally. Seaq volume of 547.7m shares
was little changed from Thursday.
Bond prices, uneasy at first, moved ahead in the wake of regional cost of
living data from Germany indicating that inflation pressures were more
subdued last month. However, UK bonds remained cautious ahead of next week's
auction of British government securities. With US bonds uncertain in early
trading, London gilts finished below the best.
Long-dated gilts closed around  3/16 better on the day but the shorts were
only a touch above overnight quotations. Sentiment was also helped by
comments from the Governor of the Bank of England that it may be some time
before the effects of the latest base rate hike are known; the market took
this as favourable for near-term rate prospects.
Statistics on second quarter gross domestic product and balance of payments
had little lasting impact on either gilts or equities, and there was little
immediate reaction to the latest survey of monthly business trends by
members of the Confederation of British Industries.
The improvement in the stock market was largely a matter of recoveries in
sectors badly hit earlier in the week by interest rate worries. Banks,
stores and construction companies were all better on this account, with the
builders additionally boosted by the strong response to excellent half-time
figures from RMC in the previous session.
But many of the heavyweight blue chips, including the oils and
pharmaceuticals, lacked supporters and the market closed on a cautious note
ahead of the equity final trading week of the third quarter of the year. The
FT-SE Index has fallen by nearly 8 per cent since the end of last month and
traders noted that retail, or genuine investment activity in equities has
remained high throughout the period.

FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures ended the day roughly where they were at Thursday's
close but volume was healthier and the mood among traders far more relaxed.
The FT-SE December contract was mostly content to track the cash market,
hitting a low point of 3,008 early in the morning and peaking at 3,059
around 1pm. At the close the contract stood at 3,043.
There were 12,701 contracts, up from 10,000 in the previous session. Traded
option volume jumped sharply, rising to 42,979 lots, against 31,858 on
Thursday.

FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers hit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retailing stocks remained under pressure as fears of an impending price
war continued to overhang the sector. Sentiment was further weakened when
BZW removed the sector from its buy list to place it on hold.
The fears were sparked by Tesco's comments on trials for lower regional
pricing in parts of northern England.
The sector's main casualty was J Sainsbury whose shares tumbled 19 to 397p,
in trade of 5.7m. Argyll Group gave up 9 to 268p on the same worries while
Tesco finished 6 1/2 lighter at 232 1/2 p. Kwik Save retreated 17 to 572p.
British Gas was in the hunt as one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers as
the shares retreated in the wake of a negative recommendation from one of
the leading international broking houses.
Nomura confirmed it had downgraded Gas from a buy to a hold after the stock
had outperformed the all-share index by 14 per cent over the past three
months.
Mr Steve Turner, analyst at Nomura, said 'the historic yield premium of 50
per cent, against the market, would now seem to fairly reflect Gas's growth
prospects.'
At the close Gas shares were 7 1/2 lower at 299 1/2 p; turnover of 10m
shares was the fourth highest in the FT-SE 100 list.
The utilities sectors of the market were among the most volatile areas of
the market after the utilities team at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker,
advised its clients to switch from the 'recs' that have already embarked on
a share-buy programme into the water stocks.
Hoare's utilities team said: 'With the recs sector, having moved to an
all-time relative high and with the close periods of the recs fast
approaching, it seems appropriate to topslice.'
Hoare recommended a switch from South Wales, down 5 at 803p, Northern, 11
off at 771p, and Manweb, down 5 at 818p into Severn Trent, a penny harder at
537p, Welsh, 3 up at 644p and Thames Water, marginally easier at 498p.
A whiff of takeover speculation circulated in the insurance sectors of the
market although dealers were hard pressed to pinpoint where the potential
bid activity would be focused.
Commercial Union settled 3 firmer at 498p, and General Accident put on 5 to
555p, while Royals edged up 3 to 273p and Sun Alliance 4 to 319p.
Standard Chartered was a notable casualty in an otherwise strong banks
sector, the shares said to have been affected by bearish stances adopted by
Nomura and Hoare Govett. At the close Standard were 8 off at 256p. Lloyds
Bank rose 10 to 540p after the Department of Trade gave the go-ahead for its
merger with the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society.
Inchcape moved up 12 to 410p following the announcement that its insurance
broking business was in co-operation talks with Acordia of the US, number
seven in the world insurance broking league.
With some 2m shares changing hands, the stock shrugged aside persistent
speculation about weak profits - and a possible dividend cut - when the
company reports its interim results on Monday.
Transport shares were active with British Airways hit by fare war worries,
rebounding 7 to 373p and bus operator Go- Ahead moving up 6 to 132p
following strong results and a takeover.
Go-Ahead combined news of widening operating margins with the announcement
that it was paying Pounds 20m - almost half of its stockmarket
capitalisation - for London Central Bus.
Eurotunnel eased 1 to 269p as rumours of renewed financing pressures began
to circulate among analysts.
A positive analysts visit to Rank Organisation's film and video operations
on Thursday boosted the stock yesterday leaving the shares 12 ahead at 413p.
The clutch of broker's recommendations for Granada Group made this week
after discussions with analysts about the state of trading continued to
support the shares. They added another 10 to 501p.
Media shares managed a number of modest rebounds with Carlton Communications
rising 14 in thin volume (1.4m trades) to 817p and Pearson group, heavily
sold in recent days, gaining 12 to 567p.
Reports of a buy recommendation from NatWest Securities helped Guinness
shake off the gloom that followed Thursday's figures which came in at the
bottom of market expectations. The shares advanced 3 to 451p.

FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Steel strong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel, a big stockmarket outperformer in recent weeks, gained 7 to
164 1/2 p on the news that it planned to increase strip steel prices by up
to a tenth from January.
The shares provided London with its second heaviest individual turnover of
the day (13m shares) and extended their outperformance of the stockmarket
over the past month to around an eighth.
Panmure Gordon produced an instant buy recommendation but yesterday there
were very few securities houses were not talking bullishly about the profits
implications of the latest steel price gearing.

FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy volume in Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International conglomerate Hanson attracted attention in the second half of
the session on reports that Hoare Govett, the company's broker, had
downgraded profit expectations. The shares slipped 4 1/2 to 230 1/2 p in
heavy trading that saw volume soar to 18m.
Unconfirmed reports suggested that Hoare Govett had reduced current year
profit expectations at the Anglo-US group by Pounds 25m to Pounds 990m for
the year to September 1994, and the following year's figure by Pounds 85m to
Pounds 1,335m.
The broker was reported to have cited several reasons for this including the
weaker US dollar; the progressive impact of higher interest rates on the
company's borrowing costs; and pricing pressure at Cavenham, Hanson's
forestry products division and at its Peabody coal operations.
The stock was also the most actively traded in options, with the equivalent
of 9.3m shares traded by the close of business.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar lingers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar trickled down to the low end of its narrow trading range against
both the yen and the D-Mark yesterday as the markets were transfixed by
upcoming events, writes Motoko Rich.
Divided market sentiment about whether the US Federal reserve will raise
interest rates next week left dealers largely on the sidelines in a quiet
day of trading.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar closed in London at DM1.5443, down from
DM1.5488. Against the yen, it finished at Y97.7050, down from Y98.0750.
The D-Mark was sluggish on the European crosses. It was moved only slightly
by cost of living figures in two German states which suggested national
statistics may subdue inflation worries.
Sterling was helped by better than expected national accounts. Against the
dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5788 up from Dollars
1.5762. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM2.438, down from
DM2.4411.
The markets hovered as speculation about the possibility of a rate hike at
next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making
arm of the Fed, prevented significant movement on the dollar.
Trade talks between the US and Japan have not yet yielded results and most
analysts are expecting compromise in at least some areas, such as the auto
sector. In the meantime, analysts believe the dollar will only flirt with
its technical resistance level of Y97.50.
The release of September cost of living indices in two German states led
analysts to soften their inflation fears, which they said would help the
D-Mark in the long term. In North Rhine-Westphalia the index rose by 1 per
cent and in Baden-Wuerttemberg, it dropped by 1 per cent.
'The overall picture, if these figures are good indicators of the national
figures, looks slightly better than expected,' said Mr Rob Hayward,
economist at Bank of America. 'There is a chance that inflation could
actually come down in Germany in September.'
The D-Mark fell against the lira as rumours of a possible compromise between
the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Italy's trade union
over a pension reform package circulated in the market. Against the lira,
the D-Mark closed in London at L1009, down from L1011.
Sterling was boosted by a surprisingly good second quarter GDP figure and a
lower than expected current account deficit. Analysts said these contributed
to a continuing bullish outlook for the pound.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said: 'The question
which remains, however, is, will sterling weaken if the interest rate rises
that our currently priced into the futures markets don't occur?'
The December short sterling contract traded 38,000 lots to settle at 93.19,
up from 93.18, and thus discounting a three month interest rate of 6.81 per
cent.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds
900m. It provided assistance totalling Pounds 919m. Overnight rates traded
between 3 1/2 and 5 per cent.

Black pepper prices increased very sharply in the past fortnight, reports
Man Producten. The improving demand for black pepper from consuming markets,
which had been inactive for many months, pushed prices up in all origins.
Suppliers there have almost all withdrawn and apparently prefer to watch
further developments. Black pepper faq traded at about USDollars 2,300 a
tonne on the European spot market and in the US asta was at Dollars 1.20 a

FT  24 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals finish on a high
note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metals markets finished in a buoyant mood this week with the precious sector
resuming its earlier uptrend and copper leading a late surge at the London
Metal Exchange. Gold reached a 13-month high, copper a 25-month high and
aluminium a 3 3/4 -year high.
Bullion dealers said the gold market appeared to be bracing itself for a
fresh assault on the Dollars 400-a-troy ounce barrier as a Dollars 2.20 rise
yesterday took the price to Dollars 396, up Dollars 5.40 on the week. That
followed an overnight jump in response to the strength of the New York
silver market. In London cash silver ended at Dollars 5.70 1/2 an ounce, up
9 cents on the day and 21 cents on the week.
'People were playing the (silver-gold) spread so gold followed suit,' a
dealer told the Reuters news agency.
'A lot of aggressive buying has been done to maximise impact, which argues
for caution,' said Andy Smith, bullion analyst as Union Bank of Switzerland.
. . Maybe they are right (that the gold price will go to Dollars 400), but
they have to take profits sometime.'
'Everybody is bullish and talking about Dollars 400,' said another analyst.
'But all the indicators point to it being overbought.'
'We haven't seen sustained demand like this for years,' commented a dealer.
'It means the rule book goes out the window.'
Platinum followed the trend, a Dollars 2.75 rise to Dollars 421 an ounce
yesterday taking the advance on the week to Dollars 11.75.
For the base metals generally bullish fundamentals were bolstered by bouts
of speculative buying as copper and aluminium led an across-the-board rise
yesterday.
Having consolidated earlier gains, the three months delivery copper price,
fuelled by commission house buying that triggered stop-loss orders, broke
through resistance to close at Dollars 2,570.50 a tonne, up Dollars 63 on
the week and the highest level since August 1992. It moved further ahead in
after hours trading.
The aluminium market was bolstered by news of a 19,700-tonne fall in LME
warehouse stocks, which followed one of 13,675 tonnes announced and took the
week's drawdown to 1.4 per cent. The three months price closed Dollars 8
higher at Dollars 1,631.50 a tonne, taking the gain on the week to Dollars
23, after edging back from a peak of Dollars 1,636 a tonne.
Zinc, with its continuing overproduction, has been the Cinderella contract
at the LME for some time. But it was able to join in the party yesterday
following news that Norzink of Norway planned to cut output by up to 20 per
cent next year at its 140,000-tonnes-a-year Odda smelter. In response the
three months zinc price reversed its Dollars 10 decline over the previous
four days to close at Dollars 1,045.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13 on balance.
Norzink's announcement was welcomed by Union Miniere, which two years ago
closed its 120,000-tonnes-a-year Overpelt smelter. But the Belgian group
cautioned that further producer cuts would be needed to reverse the
continuing build-up in world zinc stocks.
At the London Commodity Exchange meanwhile, coffee futures were moving back
towards the 9-year highs reached earlier in the week. By the close the
November position was trading at Dollars 4,068 a tonne, up Dollars 23 on the
day and Dollars 136 on the week. But that was still Dollars 72 below the
peak to which it had been lifted at one point on Thursday by concern about
the continuing drought in Brazilian growing areas.

The assets of D. Blech, a New York broking firm forced to close on Thursday
due to an inability to meet regulatory capital requirements, were taken over
yesterday by another firm, Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross.
It was not clear whether Josephthal would continue to make markets on Nasdaq
in all the stocks which had been traded by Blech.
The firm had specialised in small biotechnology stocks, having taken a
number of companies in the sector public. The shares of many of these
companies plunged on Nasdaq on Thursday as rumour spread that Blech would
close.
The assets taken over by Josephthal did not include Blech's inventory of
stocks. The firm said it had agreed to take on the firm's brokers, analysts
and traders, along with its accounts.
It is also planning to take over two of Blech's four offices, based in New
York and Boca Raton, Florida.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais warns of further
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, may need to make
additional provisions of up to FFr25bn (Dollars 4.73bn) against its heavy
losses, government sources said yesterday.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was appointed by the government as chairman of the
state-controlled group last year, told officials earlier this week that
total provisions could be in the range of FFr15bn-FFr25bn, the sources
claimed.
The size of the provisions, which would be among the largest reported in
French corporate history, emerged after Credit Lyonnais announced
unexpectedly on Thursday that it would be delaying publication of its
first-half results pending completion of 'certain analyses'.
The bank confirmed yesterday that it was unlikely to issue new shares to
help finance its restructuring before the end of the year - a possibility
that had been floated by Mr Peyrelevade in March when he announced losses of
FFr6.9bn for 1993.
In a unusually public exchange, the French ministry of economy and finance
responded late on Thursday night to Credit Lyonnais's decision with a
statement that it had been alerted to certain 'substantial additional
provisions' relating to risky assets to be accounted for in the results in
the six months to the end of June this year.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister who was in New York when the
story broke, said he had entrusted Mr Peyrelevade with carrying out the
necessary work to research the provisions and present them in line with
regulatory requirements.
He stressed the bank had the state's full support and would do whatever was
necessary. However, one official said yesterday: 'The state's support is
obvious. It's like saying that we are opening an open door.'
Credit Lyonnais would not be drawn on the timing and size of the provisions
and the nature of its dialogue with the government. However, it said: 'We
are delighted to have this public confirmation of the state's complete
support.'
Sources within the bank reiterated yesterday the discussions with the
government triggering the delay in publication of its results related more
to the way in which it would help with a rescue than concern over the
provisions' size.
However, government sources maintained the first they had known about the
additional provisions and the need for state support was on Monday, and had
until then relied on assurances provided by Mr Peyrelevade in early summer
that provisions would total FFr5bn, which could be covered from internal
sources.
Officials are said to have been irritated by the divergence of the
provisions from those agreed in the restructuring in April, and by the vague
and broad range of possible additional amounts that the group says must be
set aside.
Credit Lyonnais said the state of the French equity market and details
emerging about its financial position meant it was very unlikely it would
proceed with a planned issue of FFr4bn-FFr5bn new shares before the end of
the year.
The group's certificats d'investissement, the non-voting shares and the only
ones publicly traded, dropped nearly 6 per cent to close at FFr395 last
night.

executive quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Weitermeyer, chief executive of J. Lauritzen Shipping since 1986,
resigned with immediate effect yesterday. No reason for the resignation was
given.
Lauritzen Shipping made a pre-tax loss of DKr289m (Dollars 45m) in the first
half of this year, following losses of DKr183m in 1992 and DKr465m in 1993.
Lauritzen Holding, which includes a shipyard and several marine-related
manufacturing companies, made a first-half loss of DKr198m and a 1993 loss
of DKr179m.
The shipping company operates one of the world's largest fleets of
refrigerated cargo vessels, where freight rates have been hit by the weak
dollar and the European Union's quota restrictions on banana imports from
South America. Freight rates for the group's fleet of small gas tankers have
been weak.
Mr Claus V. Ipsen, formerly the shipping company's finance manager, takes
over from Mr Weitermeyer.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: GM rental sale breathes life
into buy-out business - The background to Vestar's takeover of the US car
hire group worth an estimated Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of General Motors' National Car Rental subsidiary to Vestar Equity
Partners, announced on Thursday, shows that the US buy-out movement is not
dead after all.
The deal is rumoured to be worth about Dollars 1bn including debt - a figure
described by an adviser yesterday as not far off. If so, it is only the
third US billion-dollar buy-out of the 1990s (the others were the Payless
retail chain and the insurance company American Re).
This is a far cry from the glory days of the 1980s. It is also a long step
for Vestar, a buy-out firm founded in 1988 by Mr Daniel O'Connell, former
co-head of management buy-outs at First Boston. To date, Vestar has done 13
deals with a total purchase price of Dollars 1.6bn. The National Car Rental
deal takes it into rather a different league.
However, Vestar has a useful asset in the form of Mr John Howard, its joint
chief executive.
Until he joined the firm in 1990, Mr Howard was with Wesray, another buy-out
firm founded by Mr William Simon, ex-treasury secretary. One of Wesray's
more spectacular coups, in which Mr Howard was closely involved, was the
1986 buy-out of Avis, National Car Rental's larger rival.
The sums involved in the Avis deal are worth recalling. Wesray bought Avis
in July 1986 for Dollars 265m plus Dollars 1.34bn of assumed debt. It then
raised Dollars 570m through disposals.
In September 1987, it sold Avis to its employees for Dollars 1.75bn. In just
over a year, Wesray had more than tripled its money.
Whether the same can be done with National Car Rental is another matter.
Its recent history is decidedly chequered.
General Motors first took a stake in 1988. In 1992, it took control, and in
the same year took a Dollars 744m charge against profits for losses and
restructuring at its new subsidiary.
For a while, GM thought seriously about winding the business up.
However, at the start of 1993, it brought in Jay Alix, a firm of specialist
consultants, to sort it out. A year later GM announced that the business had
been profitable at the operating level through 1993, and that it was
thinking of selling it.
At about the same time, Ford was moving to take 100 per cent ownership of
its own car rental business, Hertz.
The difference in strategy between close rivals is striking. Ford points out
that besides providing a large sales outlet for its cars, the rental
business allows it to evaluate their performance.
'We've been pretty happy with Hertz,' Ford commented yesterday. 'After all,
it is the car business.'
The GM line is somewhat different.
Rental, it says, is just not profitable enough. It can involve selling cars
on unattractive terms, and often means taking them back second hand.
'In the last couple of years,' GM said yesterday, 'we've been pulling back
the number of cars we've sold to rental agencies. We're trying to redirect
into selling direct to customers, which is better for GM than the subsidised
market of rental fleets.'
Meanwhile, GM will maintain its existing supply agreement with National Car
Rental.
Thereafter it is up to Mr Howard to find value where GM failed. In the
chiller climate of the 1990s, perhaps Vestar is taking a risk after all.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pirelli returns to black in
first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pirelli, the Italian cables and tyre manufacturer, announced a modest return
to profit after more than two years of tough restructuring and losses.
Half-year results released yesterday showed net group profits were L54.6bn
(Dollars 35.08m) against a loss of L62.7bn during the same period in 1993
while the parent company had swung to a L1.8bn profit from a L104.3bn loss.
Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, chief executive, has been predicting the group
would return to profit and analysts said the recent movement in the group's
shares suggested investors felt the worst was behind Pirelli.
He also said that Pirelli would invest L2,200bn over the next three years,
all self-financed, of which L1,000bn would be allocated to research and
development. He forecast that there would be a new cables joint venture in
the Asia Pacific region and said the group was aiming to concentrate on
added value products with some L500bn of revenue coming from telecoms
products by 1996.
The restructuring has seen Pirelli reduce the number of plants from 102 to
80 and the workforce cut by more than 10,000 people to less than 40,000. In
the first half of the year a further 1,019 jobs were pruned.
Divestments over the past two and half years have helped slash the debt to
L1,825bn from L4,000bn, thus reducing financial charges.
The net debt equity ratio has improved, dropping to 0.60 per cent from 0.87
in mid-1993.
The company said the accounts were no longer affected by restructuring
charges.
Reduced financial charges, along with leaner management and tighter control
over costs were a large contributor to new profitability.
Group sales were only marginally up at L4,687bn. Net equity stood at
L,3,030bn in line with the first half of 1993.
The company was cautious on full-year results, pointing to an as yet patchy
recovery in many of its markets.
Pirelli also warned about the unforeseen effects of industrial action at
Pirelli Armstrong in the US.
Mr Cesare Romiti, the chief executive officer of Fiat, leaves the board
while Mr Riccardo Perissich, who has been director general of industry at
the Brussels Commission, joins the board and will take charge of
institutional relations.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: De Klerk confident on SA debt
rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr FW De Klerk, the South African deputy president, yesterday said he was
confident the credit rating reviews being conducted by Moody's and Standard
&amp; Poor's would result in a BBB, or investment grade, rating for the
country's international debt.
He brushed aside news that the London-based credit rating agency IBCA had
only awarded an inferior BB, or sub-investment grade, rating on Thursday.
The IBCA rating was greeted with disappointment in South Africa because many
fund managers are not allowed to buy sub-investment, or junk bonds, but
there was little surprise in the international markets.
The South African government is seeking ratings from the international
rating agencies in order to facilitate its return to tap the international
bond markets, to fund its reconstruction programme.
Speaking in Edinburgh to European securities analysts, Mr De Klerk expressed
regret that South Africa's political transformation had not yet been
adequately recognised by the markets. 'I find it strange that the financial
markets should reflect a scepticism on the government's ability to govern
the country efficiently and prudently. This is unfair to the government of
national unity and has no basis in fact,' he said.
He insisted the government would maintain fiscal discipline and would not
repeat the populist mistakes of other countries in funding the
reconstruction and development programme.
Higher interest rates would increase debt service costs and thus would lead
to a slight expenditure overrun for 1994-95 but steps would be taken to
finance it on a sound basis. Mr De Klerk said the South African authorities
would not spring a surprise on the nervous markets by an early abolition of
the financial rand system. They were keen to change as soon as possible -
but would not be rushed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.11m to IPounds 868,000 (Pounds
857,000) was announced by Norish, the Irish group which provides food
refrigeration and distribution services, for the first half of 1994.
The company said the results had been affected by difficulties in the red
meat sector and particularly hit the Irish stores. Its continued development
into commercial markets had reduced the group's exposure to commodity
products and the opening of a third store in Britain had accelerated that
process.
Turnover slipped to IPounds 4.74m (IPounds 5.18m). The dividend is held at
4.47p, payable from earnings of 8.42p (9.88p) per share.

</HEADLINE>

Breedon, the limestone quarrying and housebuilding group, raised pre-tax
profits 56 per cent from Pounds 960,000 to Pounds 1.5m in the six months to
July 31. Turnover grew 30 per cent from Pounds 5.05m to Pounds 6.59m.
The company said that while first time buyers had fallen away, sales of its
top of the range properties were increasing. Once conditions improved, its
low cost land bank would enable it to 'maximise profit contribution'.
Earnings per share were 3.53p (2.26p) and the interim dividend is unchanged
at 1.75p.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Small companies confident on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small companies remain confident about their growth prospects, in spite of
inflationary pressures and impending tax increases.
A survey of 405 senior executives around the country showed 57 per cent were
more optimistic than just three months ago.
The survey, 'A View from the Boardroom', was sent to more than 1000
executives at companies with market values of less than Pounds 320m. It was
the second six-monthly survey by the investment bank, SG Warburg, and
carried out in August and September.
Although confidence levels were slightly lower than before, Warburgs says
the outlook is still bullish. Small companies were expecting strong growth
in exports and 46 per cent reported order books bet-ween 1 and 10 per cent
ahead of just three months ago.
While demand was still a significant constraint, companies were beginning to
experience a squeeze on capacity. Almost half expected to increase capital
spending in the next year.
Price rises were still difficult, with just 22 per cent planning increases
in the next three months. Pressures from higher raw material costs would
have to be absorbed through greater productivity.
Warburgs remains optimistic about earnings potential for small companies. Mr
Richard Hickinbotham, small companies analyst, said companies were looking
for healthy increases in operating margins, in spite of the pressures. He
forecast earnings growth of 16 per cent this year, excluding companies
expected to move from loss into profit.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure Pounds 30m in loss after
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Leisure yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 30.1m for the 48
weeks to June 19, after withdrawing from its nightclub businesses to refocus
on its ten-pin bowling operations.
The company blamed the deficit, which compared with a Pounds 2.94m profit
for the previous year, on write-downs of Pounds 12.65m, losses on closures
of Pounds 11.51m and restructuring costs of Pounds 4.41m.
A year of board upheavals continued with the appointment of Mr Ken Scobie as
part-time chairman, replacing Mr William Davis. Mr Scobie resigned as chief
executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, in January 1993.
Allied is still seeking a chief executive after Mr Richard Carr resigned in
March.
Yesterday's results were for a shortened 48-week period, in order to
announce the sales and finance arrangements.
The company's half-year writedowns and provisions had breached its banking
covenants, but the banks have now agreed to extend facilities to September
19 next year on the basis that Allied sells three nightclubs and grants
options in respect of 2.25m shares.
The sale to Rank Leisure of the clubs, in the Bournemouth and Poole area,
raised Pounds 4.5m which will be used to cut borrowings of Pounds 13.7m.
Mr Scobie said: 'I think we are in a situation where the company has taken
its medicine. What we now have is a core business of bowling allies.
'I think the only resemblance between Brent Walker and this company is that
they are both listed in the leisure sector,' he added.
Turnover fell from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 22.1m, and operating profit
declined to Pounds 452,000 (Pounds 3.96m).
However, Allied's remaining operations produced pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 2m. Like-for-like bowling sales fell by 10.5 per cent across the
year, but the decline slowed down in the second half.
Net interest payments were cut to Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.64m) and gearing
stood at 67 per cent.
The directors declared no dividend (3p) and losses per share were 45.49p,
compared to earnings of 5.22p.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Franklin defends Body Shop stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US ethical fund that triggered a fierce debate over the activities of
Body Shop International over the last few weeks has concluded that some of
the criticisms against the company were justified.
In a long-awaited article in its Insight magazine, Boston-based Franklin
Research &amp; Development Corporation said there was a gap between Body Shop's
'image and its reality' and called the company's response to criticism
bombastic and offensive.
It also stressed that Body Shop's problems were 'quite correctable' and that
it was 'currently making improvements in almost all areas'.
Franklin added: 'Through clever public relations, the Body Shop has
carefully cultivated an image which is inconsistent with the company's
sometimes less than impressive performance.'
The assessment stands in stark contrast to the conclusions of other
organisations such as Eiris, the London-based ethical investment research
service, which suggested recently that the criticism directed against Body
Shop was unfair.
News that Franklin had recommended clients to sell Body Shop shares, backed
by its disposal of 50,000 shares held on behalf of clients, helped
precipitate dozens of media articles and contributed to a drop in the share
price which has fallen since mid-August from 242p to close yesterday at
206p, up 6p.
Franklin said it had learned from the experience of the last few weeks to be
'more diligent in checking company claims' and expressed frustration that
Body Shop had refused to provide information to those trying to verify its
claims.
It said the company's overall record of environmental auditing and
disclosure was impressive, but called on it to state the source of the
ingredients in its products on their packaging.
It said the language the company used to describe its 'Trade not Aid'
activities 'still requires revision if it is to truly reflect the scale of
the projects it supports'.
Ms Joan Bavaria, president of Franklin, said yesterday that it had not given
the company an overall rating, and that while it was still not recommending
clients to buy the shares, it 'would certainly entertain buying the stock
again in the future'. Responding to the criticism Body Shop said:
'Franklin's major criticism is that we defend ourselves too aggressively. We
strongly, of course, disagree.
'When it comes to protecting our company, our shareholders and our
reputation we will continue to act quickly and forthrightly.'
Body Shop added, 'By devoting a whole issue of their newsletter to us,
they're subjecting us to a level of scrutiny they would not reserve for
their other investments.
'Show us other UK firms that are doing as much as us. At least we're trying.
We're highlighting the issues.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Apta Nursing in reverse takeover of Midland
Assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apta Nursing Services, which operates 13 nursing homes in the West Midlands
and Berkshire, yesterday announced a reverse takeover of Midland Assets, the
nursing home group.
Midland conditionally agreed to acquire 39.7m ordinary shares and is raising
Pounds 2.5m of new working capital by way of a 1 for 3 rights issue of 18.9m
shares at 17p.
The group, to be renamed Apta Healthcare, said it would use the capital to
'develop the business', including further acquisitions.
The takeover increases the Apta's number of beds by 34 per cent to 628,
rising to 898 by April 1996.
Existing shareholders will be offered a bonus issue of warrants on a 4 for 5
basis, exercisable at 15p.
Guinness Mahon has agreed to make a standby cash offer for 75 per cent of
Midland holdings at 19p per share, including the forecast interim dividend,
rights and warrants.
Midland forecasts an interim dividend of 0.4p per share and a final of 0.5p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 are expected to be no less
than Pounds 62,500 (nil).
Apta's pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 are expected to be
no less than Pounds 367,000 (Pounds 256,000).
Midland's listing was suspended yesterday, with dealings expected to restart
on October 18. The company was created in May to acquire four nursing homes
from Northern Leisure for Pounds 1.9m.
The new company's chairman will be Sir David Rowe-Ham, currently at Apta.
Mr Trevor Price, chief executive, said the group's strategy would be to
expand its activities in the sub-acute care sector, which commands high fees
of up to Pounds 1,000 a week.
The impact date is set for September 22, with an extraordinary meeting on
October 14.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pounds 11m marine protein
expansion by IAWS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IAWS Group, the Dublin-based food and agricultural company, yesterday made a
Pounds 11.2m recommended offer for a Scottish fishmeal and fish oil
manufacturing company.
Mr Philip Lynch, chief executive of IAWS, said the acquisition of United
Fish Products would more than double IAWS's marine protein interests making
it the leading producer of oil and marine protein in the UK as well as one
of the four largest producers in the European Union.
UFP has a processing plant in Aberdeen and manages processing companies in
the Shetland Islands and Grimsby.
IAWS is making the offer through a subsidiary, Braemar Fish Products, which
is offering Pounds 26.50 for each share in cash or loan notes.
In the year to September 30 1993 UFP's pre-tax profits rose 47 per cent to
Pounds 737,000. Net assets at completion would total Pounds 8.7m.
IAWS has acquired other fish oil and fishmeal businesses in the UK in recent
years, including the fishmeal business of Nordos, an offshoot of British
Petroleum.
Mr Lynch said the acquisition would bring benefits of scale in technical
sales and marketing as well as research and development in process and
product areas.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Artesian to seek market listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Artesian Estates, a residential landlord specialising in assured tenancies,
yesterday announced plans to float on the stock exchange. It will be the
first property company specialising in this type of flexible tenancy to seek
a listing.
Artesian will have initial assets of Pounds 13.5m, comprising 28 residential
properties in London and the south east of England.
Most of its properties are let under assured tenancies which give the
landlord considerable freedom to increase rents and regain possession.
The biggest quoted residential property company is Bradford Property Trust,
which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 280m. However, Bradford's
business centres on buying properties let under more restrictive regulated
tenancies - usually at a discount to reflect the sitting rights of the
tenant - and selling when the property becomes vacant.
Set up in 1989, Artesian recently came to the end of its five year
qualifying period under the Business Expansion Scheme. In all 10 companies
bearing the Artesian name have been set up under the BES, the last at the
end of 1993, raising Pounds 42m.
Initially only the first three companies will be grouped together under the
listed holding company. The directors said it was possible that other
companies could be reversed into the listed company at a later date. They
added that Artesian would consider buying other BES companies where
investors were looking for an exit.
Falling property prices mean that many similar companies have seen their
asset values tumble over the last five years. Artesian has just clawed its
way back to the asset value of 1989.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hepworth at Pounds 35.6m midway - Lower
interest and finance costs contribute to a 29% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, reported a 29 per cent
rise in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 35.6m,
although the figure was flattered by lower interest and finance costs.
At operating level, profits to 30 June rose marginally to Pounds 37m (Pounds
35.8m). Mr John Carter, chief executive, cautioned that the group's markets
would remain tough for the rest of the year.
Turnover edged up 2 per cent to Pounds 338.6m (Pounds 331.9m), while
earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 10.2p (9.1p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 5.5p.
In the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of the group's sales, operating
profits were 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 18.7m) on turnover 9
per cent higher at Pounds 202.1 (Pounds 184.6m).
Building products sales increased 10 per cent, with the new house market
providing strong support. The home products division saw sales growth of 7
per cent, with a firm performance from the gas boiler business offset
slightly by weakness in garage door sales.
Operating profits in the refractories business fell 43 per cent to Pounds
2.1m (Pounds 3.7m) on turnover down 9 per cent at Pounds 63.9m Pounds
70.3m). Mr Carter said: 'This is our toughest market by far but we are
taking steps to broaden our market base.' He added that North America and
the Far East were being targeted. To this end, the company had recently
signed an Pounds 11m contract in Taiwan to provide stove linings.
The French boiler division, Saunier Duval, experienced mixed trading,
profits improving slightly to Pounds 13m, compared with Pounds 12.5m, on
turnover down marginally at from Pounds 102.4m to Pounds 99.3m. Stable glass
sand sales and firm foundry product sales helped mineral and chemical
division operating profits increase from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 5.2m on
turnover up from Pounds 34m to Pounds 37.5m.
Mr Carter said: 'Our strategy is to infuse each of our operations with new
ideas, products, innovations and investment and we intend to use our strong
balance sheet imaginatively. It's a long-term slog, but eventually the
success of these initiatives will outweigh the difficulties.'
COMMENT
The fear for Hepworth is that one or more of the group's businesses -
refractories the obvious candidate - will continue to act as a drag as the
recovery gathers pace. Management dismisses talk of slimming down and
insists investment is the key. Hepworth's latest contract successes in
refractories would appear to support this view. The shares are currently on
a market rating and analysts' profit forecasts of around Pounds 74m for the
full year would keep them there and slightly ahead of that of the sector.
While the yield - one of the highest in the building materials sector - is
likely to support the shares, the downside would appear limited.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports maiden interim on rise to
Pounds 11.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alpha Airports Group, the airline catering company floated by Forte in
February, is paying a maiden interim dividend of 1.6p a share.
Earnings moved ahead from 4.71p to 5.31p in the six months to the end of
July. Pre-tax profits were 6.6 per cent higher at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds
10.6m) on sales 11.9 per cent ahead at Pounds 232m (Pounds 208m).
The shares, priced at 140p for the flotation, eased 4p yesterday to close at
158p.
Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive, said the dividend reflected group
confidence in the full-year outcome and 'a very sound performance.'
The sales increase was driven by the retail trading division, which operates
shops at airports and now accounts for more than half group turnover. The
division's sales rose from Pounds 102m to Pounds 124m, mainly on the back of
a new contract at Gatwick and good growth at provincial airports.
However, margins were tighter and operating profits were only just ahead at
Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 3.2m).
The in-flight catering division lifted sales from Pounds 105m to Pounds
109m. Overall margins were unchanged at 7.7 per cent, while operating
profits were ahead at Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.1m).
In the UK the charter market accounted for 30 per cent of sales, up from 26
per cent previously. Cost cutting on scheduled short haul and domestic
flights was reflected in a reduction in the catering spend per passenger. UK
operating profits eased from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 6.4m.
Operating profits were ahead in Europe from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.9m,
while in the US they fell from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 100,000, mainly
reflecting a shortfall at a new kitchen in Newark that is not yet covering
its fixed costs.
The results include a contribution of Pounds 200,000 from joint ventures in
Trinidad and Australia.
Capital investment, excluding the joint ventures, was Pounds 10m. It is
expected to reach Pounds 13m for the full year - a figure seen as
exceptional following completion of several facilities.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 600,000. Borrowings
were reduced from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 18.4m, cutting gearing to 49 per
cent from 82 per cent at the time of the float.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Utd Breweries in buy ahead of restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Breweries, the financially troubled USM-quoted company controlled by
Mr Vijay Mallya, is to buy a private company operating 70 public houses. The
deal will more than double the number of public houses operated by the
group.
The shares, which were suspended yesterday at the company's request, were
ahead 1 1/4 p at 6 3/4 p.
Shareholders will next week be asked to approve a plan to restructure the
group's debts of Pounds 9m, held by four banks. It is likely to involve
writing off at least Pounds 2.5m of the debt.
Last April the group breached its banking covenants after a Pounds 7.2m
write-down in the value of its 76 public houses. A restructuring proposal
put together in July fell through.
Yesterday the group said it intended to restructure its debt and inject
substantial capital by issuing shares to a big new investor, accompanied by
a non-underwritten issue of ordinary shares to existing shareholders.
'It is likely that any issue of new ordinary shares will be at a price
substantially below the current market price,' the group warned.

marketing and services concern, is planning a strategic alliance with
Acordia, the Indianapolis-based company which is the world's eighth largest
insurance broker.
The move follows Inchcape's takeover of Hogg Group earlier this year, which
created the world's seventh biggest broker and signalled Inchcape's
ambitions in the sector.
Bain Hogg also said it had entered into talks to sell its brokerage
operation, Bain Hogg Robinson, to Acordia. The alliance would allow the two
groups to offer an improved international services to clients, drawing from
both Bain's strength in Europe and east Asia and Acordia's position in the
US.
Acordia, a network of companies providing insurance broking, managed care
administration and consulting services, had revenues of Dollars 258m (Pounds
163m) in 1993. Health insurance, including managed care services, accounted
for 51 per cent of its gross revenues.
Acordia has grown rapidly in recent years from its strongholds in the
southern and mid-western states. It acquired American Business Insurance in
1993 and Seattle-based Pettit Morry earlier this year.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mining provision hits Europe Energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A provision of Pounds 679,884 against the permanent diminution of its mining
assets left Europe Energy Group with pre-tax losses up from Pounds 132,817
to Pounds 951,968 for the year ended March 31.
New management took control in January. Changes have been made to address
the difficulties of the mining operations and the board is confident the
problems have been contained. The motor dealership acquired earlier this
year was profitable and had a successful August.
Turnover, including the acquisition, rose to Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.12m).
Losses per share came to 2.96p (0.45p).

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Stadi Varios Pounds 250m plan for Wembley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rival consortium, led by Stadi Varios, will apply on Monday for planning
permission to reconstruct one of the world's most famous football venues,
Wembley Stadium.
The move will come in spite of the fact that the heavily indebted existing
owner of the 'venue of legends', the Wembley company, is already holding a
financial beauty parade for a restructuring which would enable it to retain
its principal asset.
The company's hold on Wembley stadium is being challenged by a consortium
formed by a private stadium company Stadi Varios, which claims to have
financing prepared for the Pounds 250m project.
Mr Patrick Nally, who founded Stadi Varios, claims the stadium is 'well past
its sell-by date'. He proposes to retain the twin towers, but put in place a
100,000 seater modern stadium, with a retractable roof to allow greater
usage.
Backed by a consortium including construction companies Tilbury Douglas and
John Laing, it has offered Pounds 75m for the site, or a package
'substantially in excess of Pounds 100m' for the adjoining Arena and
Conference Centre.
However, Sir Brian Wolfson, chief executive of Wembley, said the company and
its advisers had decided the proposals were 'unrealistic, and not in the
best interests of shareholders'.
The company has rebuffed all attempts by the consortium to enter
negotiations.
Sir Brian said the stadium carried a book value of around Pounds 90m, which
would leave shareholders with a substantial book loss.
However, the price is understood to be negotiable.
After discussions with the Football Association, Brent Council, and some of
Wembley's bankers, who are owed Pounds 140m, Mr Nally remains confident that
it is viable.
The consortium would raise funds from the sale of 164 executive boxes, even
though the current stadium has around 80 per cent occupancy on the existing
60 suites.
Mr Nally says construction must commence by early 1995 to have the stadium
ready for the European Championships in 1996. If Wembley does not agree, he
says Stadi Varios will look at a competing site.
Mr Nally is involved in a stadium project in Derby, but similar projects in
Sunderland and Glasgow have collapsed.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Joseph Holt pulls ahead 5% to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joseph Holt, the Manchester-based brewer famed for some of the least
expensive real ale brewed in the UK, lifted pre-tax profits by 5 per cent
from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 3.99m in the six months to June 30. The shares
declined 75p to Pounds 36.75.
Mr Richard Kershaw, joint managing director, said the 'very conservative'
company was 'not over excited' about the outcome - struck on flat turnover
at Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.6m) - but said the Manchester market had been
difficult in the last year.
He suggested the area had entered the recession later and would emerge
later, adding that high unemployment levels would continue to hamper trading
growth.
He said that there had been some improvement in the hotter months of July
and August.
The company sells a pint of bitter for 96p and mild for 90p. Mr Kershaw said
there had been a 1p increase in retail prices though none in wholesale. He
explained that Holt managed to sell beer so inexpensively because it had
large managed houses - 96 of the total 108-strong estate - within a 20-mile
radius of Manchester and that it did no advertising.
It planned to open one or two new pubs a year and had recently built its
first new pub in the centre of the city for 20 years.
Earnings per share grew to 87.8p (84.58p) and the interim dividend is raised
to 12p (11p).

FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tiphook meeting not just preoccupied
with directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a shareholder present at Tiphook's annual general meeting, it was
good to see the FT ('Bankruptcy threat to Tiphook's Montague', September 16)
report it less sensationally than other newspapers. However, you still
emphasised controversial matters like the chief executive's personal
finances and directors' remuneration. These are quite pertinent but not the
whole story.
The board affirmed that trading was improving and that its bankers remained
supportive. That a director of Ian Clubb's calibre has agreed to become
chairman and expressed his full commitment to the company's new future as
Central Transport Rental Group is also encouraging.
But when an AGM becomes a media circus of whipped-up emotions, objectivity
is lost. It became hard to ask basic questions on Tiphook's future. Mounting
hysteria could also adversely influence its customers and creditors.
The press are often shareholders' best allies in the drive to improve
boardroom disclosure and accountability. Such a purpose must try to set
companies on a better path, not create additional problems for those facing
high risks.

FT  24 SEP 94 / The unkindest cut: The future of the UK's pay review bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have Britain's pay review bodies outlived their usefulness?
The five bodies - which recommend annual pay rises for one-third of
Britain's 5m public sector workers - find themselves in an increasingly
uncomfortable position as a result of the government's attempts to hold down
public sector pay.
If the recommendations they are working on for next year's pay rises are too
high, the government is likely to set them aside. If they fall into line
with the pay bill freeze and recommend close to a zero rise their
independent judgement will be questioned - not least by the leaders of the
550,000 nurses who this week lodged a claim for an 8.3 per cent rise.
The five bodies were set up in two waves. In the early 1970s, three were set
up for leading groups of state employees (mainly men) who did not strike or
collectively bargain: top civil servants and judges; doctors and dentists;
and the armed forces. The second wave (mainly covering women) followed
industrial unrest - the nurses review body in 1984 and the teachers in 1991.
The review bodies are in some ways a hangover from a time when much of
public life was arranged by committees of the great and good. The two
largest - the teachers and the nurses - are run by, respectively, Mr John
Gardiner, chairman of the Laird Group, and Mr Mike Bett, a deputy chairman
of BT. These chairmen have a large influence in choosing seven colleagues
who - if they pass government vetting - usually sit on the review body for
two or three years.
They include retired civil servants, such as Dame Anne Mueller, the former
Treasury mandarin, who sits on the nurses review body. There is a sprinkling
of experts such as Mr Philip Halsey of the teachers review body who is
former head of the now-defunct Schools Examination and Assessment Council.
There are also private-sector outsiders, such as Mrs Julia Cuthbertson, news
editor of the Financial Times, who is also on the teachers' review body.
The members of review bodies may be unpaid volunteers, but they take on a
heavy workload. In September, they start hearing evidence from unions,
government and other parties, making their recommendations to the government
in January. Throughout the year they commission studies on aspects of pay
and performance from their secretariat, the Office of Manpower Economics.
Their reports do more than merely recommend a headline annual pay increase
for, say, all nurses or soldiers. They include recommendations on matters
such as hours and grading.
The problems arise when their recommendations are incompatible with the
government's pay policy.
In 1993-94, the government imposed a 1.5 per cent rise throughout the public
sector. The pay review bodies' were asked not to make recommendations, amid
grumbling.
This year was the first in the three-year public sector pay-bill freeze
imposed in the last Budget. The review body's recommendations for the
current year have managed to co-exist with the freeze, although the 2.9 per
cent rise for teachers and 3 per cent for nurses were accepted with
reluctance by the government.
However, it will get harder as the pay-bill freeze continues. Similar rises
early next year or in early 1996 may severely hurt services or lead to a
large number of compulsory redundancies if implemented in full.
The pay review bodies are aware of the restraints they are working under but
at the same time insist that it is their job to come to an independent
judgement about their particular group of employees.
That judgement has been more generous than the government would like. The
privileged public-sector workers covered by the review bodies have seen
their pay rise 156 per cent between 1981 and 1993, in line with the private
sector. The rest of the public sector - mainly civil servants and local
government workers - have lagged behind with rises of 123 per cent over the
same period.
Most review body members are strong believers in setting pay at a rate no
higher than that sufficient to recruit and retain the staff required. But
inevitably, they sometimes sympathise with those whose pay they set.
'If the government decides it does not like our judgement that is fine, but
it should not expect a group of public-spirited people who have given up a
lot of time and energy coming to that judgement to shrug and carry on,' says
one pay review body member.
A full-scale rejection of a recommendation early next year might cause a
walk-out, though slightly reducing a recommendation by phasing it in would
be unlikely to do so.
Most members of the pay review bodies belong to the establishment and
believe that they do an important job. 'We are more subtle and flexible than
the annual pay rise figure makes us seem, and we would want to argue from
the inside,' says one member.
One of the government's options for keeping them on side would be to wean
the review bodies off the nationwide headline increase. As public sector pay
setting is increasingly devolved to local level, particularly in health and
teaching, they could be encouraged to concentrate more on the details of how
pay is determined and distributed.
Mr Michael Portillo, one of the cabinet hawks on public spending, made this
point earlier this year to the Treasury Select Committee. Asked if the pay
review bodies were now pointless, he replied that they were not but needed
to understand the reality of the pay-bill freeze.
He added: 'They do a great deal more than arrive at a global figure; they
also make useful recommendations about distribution.' This is something that
review bodies used to do, but have largely abandoned in recent years.
Another option, aired in this year's nurses review body report, would be to
ask them to review the pay of nursing staff as a whole, but confine any
recommendations to minimum levels only.
The review bodies could, therefore, become a bit like the wages councils
that used to set minimum rates in parts of the private sector before
abolition last year. Such a role would continue to recognise the
peculiarities of the public-sector labour market but remove the review
bodies from confrontation with the government.
The alternatives look less attractive: a return to collective bargaining;
the introduction of more pay formulae as enjoyed by the police and fire
service; or simple imposition of pay increases by managers at local or
national level. And if the government wants to keep open the option of
restricting strikes in essential services, now is not the time to abolish a
pay review system that has proved popular and credible.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Season of risk and fearfulness: Why financial markets are
nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summer is over and so, it seems, is the rally in world equity markets. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was close to its all-time high on
September 15, suffered its biggest one-day fall for six months on Tuesday.
With the arrival of autumn, traditionally the season for equity market
upsets, fears have revived that share prices may be heading for a sharp
decline.
As has often been the case this year, bond markets have led the way. The
yield on the 30-year US Treasury bond rose to 7.79 per cent this week,
compared with 7.49 per cent a month ago and 5.78 per cent at the trough in
October 1993. In the UK, 10-year gilt yields are approaching 9 per cent.
Viewed from the perverse standpoint of financial markets, economic growth is
the prime culprit for recent weakness. The continued recovery in the US and
the UK, the growing signs of a pick-up in continental Europe and the hopes
for an improvement in Japan are good news for the populations of the
countries concerned. But bond markets dislike strong economic growth, as it
usually leads to inflation, which erodes the real value of fixed-income
investments. They thus demand a higher yield to compensate them for the
additional inflation risk.
Thus the recent rise in bond yields (and fall in bond prices) was sparked by
signs of continued US economic vigour. 'It had looked as if third-quarter
GDP in the US would be quite soft, but a number of recent statistics have
shown strength,' says Mr Peter Lyon, chief strategist at London securities
house Smith New Court. US factories operated at 84.7 per cent of capacity in
August, the highest level since April 1989, while August retail sales
recorded a month-on-month gain that was larger than expected at 0.8 per
cent.
Bond markets have fallen faster than equity markets this year. The result is
that, in yield terms, equities look expensive relative to bonds compared
with historical averages.
This could simply reflect the possibility that bond markets are
overestimating future inflation. If so, bond yields ought to fall to reduce
the yield differential. If not, equity yields need to rise substantially -
and share prices to fall - to restore ratios to more reasonable levels.
Meanwhile, the view has been gaining ground that the world interest rate
cycle has turned - reinforced by the increase in UK short-term rates last
week, from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent.
At the start of the year, there was a belief that, while US rates might
rise, there was still scope for short-term rates in other countries,
particularly in Europe, to fall. But as the graph from James Capel shows, a
weighted average of short-term interest rates across the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations has been steadily rising since the start of the
year. A rise in interest rates is often bad news for equities, because it
increases corporate costs and makes holding cash more attractive relative to
owning shares.
But is the recent weakness in bond and equity markets a blip, or part of a
long-term bear market which effectively began when the US Federal Reserve
first raised interest rates in February?
It is possible to construct a bearish argument from two radically different
analyses of the economic outlook. The first, and more conventional, view is
that inflation will return with a vengeance as the world's economies start
to recover. Recent increases in commodity prices, which have caused the
Economist commodity price index to rise by 41.8 per cent over the past year,
are an early warning sign.
The dividend yield offered by the big equity markets is quite low in
historical terms. The Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index yields just 2.41
per cent, compared with an average of 3.6 per cent since 1979; meanwhile the
FT-A All-Share yields 3.96 per cent, against its post-1979 average of 4.7
per cent.
While both might be reasonable in terms of current levels of inflation, any
inflationary rebound would prompt investors to demand higher yields, forcing
share prices down.
The alternative analysis is that the authorities are underestimating the
deflationary forces present in the economy, resulting largely from the heavy
debt incurred by the corporate and personal sectors in the 1980s. According
to this view, the authorities are increasing interest rates too soon, and by
too much, which will cause economic growth to slow and corporate earnings to
disappoint.
According to Mr Robin Aspinall of broker Panmure Gordon, the sharp fall in
interest rates in the early 1990s released a temporary flow of liquidity,
boosting narrow measures of money supply and causing money to flow into
bonds and equities from cash.
'Businesses, forecasters, politicians and markets have been deluded into
believing this wave could last forever,' says Mr Aspinall. 'It is headed for
a wipe out as it eventually crashes against the greater inertia of slow
growth and low inflation dictated by the debt background.'
Mr Michael Hughes, global strategist at BZW, argues: 'There is a great
danger that monetary policy is getting too tight. The authorities aren't
injecting enough liquidity, and markets are the casualty.'
Shares may be trading on price-earnings ratios (the yardstick analysts use
to compare share prices to corporate profits) that do not take account of
the growth slowdown expected by this school. Only this week, London merchant
bank Kleinwort Benson cut its forecast for UK earnings growth in 1995 to 8
per cent. If that kind of forecast is right, a price-earnings ratio of 17.7
on the FT-A All-Share Index makes UK equities look rather expensive.
But most believe any significant downturn in world equity markets would have
to start on Wall Street. Mr Hughes thinks there is a strong risk of a crash
in the US and 'the idea of 3,000 on the Dow Jones (compared with Thursday's
close of 3,837) isn't out of the question'. He cites the high involvement of
US banks in securities lending as a main source of risk.
Others point to the political problems likely to be faced by President Bill
Clinton if, as some expect, the Democrats lose control of the Senate after
the mid-term elections in November. Although financial markets are no lovers
of Mr Clinton, gridlock in Washington would cause uncertainty about the
direction of US economic policy.
Some dismiss these fears, arguing that they simply represent the 'wall of
worry' that all bull markets have to climb. Such optimists see the decline
in financial markets as a panic response to inflationary indicators. Despite
all the talk of inflationary pressures, the annual rate across the European
Union in August was just 3.1 per cent. In the US, the annual rate of
inflation in August was 2.9 per cent. Real bond yields (nominal yields minus
inflation) are thus extremely high in historical terms.
These yields have risen so sharply, according to Mr Keith Skeoch, James
Capel's chief economist, because the peak in short-term interest rates and
inflation in this cycle is not yet visible. This has caused investors to
demand a higher 'risk premium' in return for holding bonds.
'At some point, this premium gets overdone and you get a return to
sensibility,' Mr Skeoch says. Once bond yields have stabilised, he argues,
equities can resume an upward path.
But the bulls may face an early test of their optimism on Tuesday, when the
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets in Washington. Former Fed
governor Mr Wayne Angell says the committee is likely to push up interest
rates by a further half a percentage point. The meeting's outcome will set
the tone for what could be a nervous autumn in the markets.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Democratic heart beats on: Confusion surrounding the US
action in Haiti has not destroyed optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The American embassy in Port-au-Prince does not know the code name for the
deployment of US troops in Haiti. It might be 'Operation Uphold Democracy',
or it might be 'Operation Restore Democracy'. After a week's grilling on the
operation, US officials are in no mood to quibble.
The confusion over the code name is indicative of the military operation's
ill-defined sense of mission.
In sending more than 10,000 soldiers to oversee the return to power of
elected but ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the US seems uncertain
whether bringing democracy to Haiti means working with, or replacing, the
existing authorities.
The entrenched legacy of repression in the conservative establishment would
make either an achievement. However, when the US forces arrived in Haiti,
their operational strategy was still being hammered out.
American soldiers, who on Sunday night had been expecting to invade and
inflict a humiliating defeat on military leader General Raoul Cedras and
'his armed thugs', were on Monday morning required to work with that same
Haitian military to assist in the departure of its leadership.
The leaders of the two armies, General Henry Shelton and Gen Cedras, started
working out the logistics of their unlikely partnership with US servicemen
already on the ground.
But Haiti's law enforcers, described by US President Bill Clinton 10 days
ago as 'deadly police thugs', were quick to embarrass their new comrades in
arms. A group of civilians, some marvelling at US military gizmos and others
celebrating the imminent return of Aristide, was beaten up by Haitian
police. US soldiers were not allowed to intervene.
By Wednesday night, the Clinton administration had reversed its decision to
leave law and order enforcement to the Haitian authorities.
US military officials later acknowledged 'some confusion' as 'policy evolved
in meetings with Gen Cedras', but asserted US forces' constant sense of
purpose. Of the changes in operating guidelines, one officer said: 'There is
no change of mission; there is a change of focus.'
The commitment to working with Gen Cedras remains. Last night, US soldiers
slept under the same roof as their Haitian counterparts, after moving into
the Cap d'Application military base the previous day. In case the
combination of restraint and re-education does not produce an armed force
that respects democracy, the US is planning a buy-back programme of some of
the 20,000 weapons in Haiti.
But many in Port-au-Prince, not least the city's ousted mayor who has been
forced into hiding, question the wisdom of working with Gen Cedras's men.
'President Clinton just said these people were criminals,' said Evans Paul.
'He can't send his troops to collaborate with criminals. The Haitian people
don't trust these people.'
Evidence of the violent crime of the Haitian authorities is distressingly
easy to come by. The last anyone saw of Idil Blanc's son, Eric, an Aristide
sympathiser, was when he was bundled into a police car 10 months ago.
In the wealthy suburb of Petionville, Mr Bobby Burnette, a US missionary,
came home one night to find three people flayed to death by machete at the
end of his drive. 'The police are cold-blooded killers,' he says.
Habits, especially vicious ones, die hard. Haiti's history of political
thuggery dates back to the formation of Francois 'Baby Doc' Duvalier's
Tonton Macoute private army, after his election in 1957. 'This generation of
politicians grew up with the Duvalier philosophy,' says Lionel, one of many
made redundant since the embargo against Haiti crippled the economy. 'If
you're in opposition, then you shouldn't be around.'
He foresees recrimination in his middle-class neighbourhood, after President
Aristide returns: 'You've been living on a block, terrorising the people,
killing the people, and they know you. Now, you've got no power, no guns.
They're definitely going to kill you.'
The speed with which popular demonstrations gathered momentum last week,
turning from a dancing throng into a leaping frenzy in minutes, brought back
unwelcome memories for the city's conservative bourgeoisie.
The Lavalas (flood) alliance of populist movements, which includes Ti Legliz
(the little church), gwoupman (farming co-operatives) and the unions, swept
Aristide to power three years ago. Last week, it was reviving its biblical
rhetoric and gearing itself up to wash away the nation's villains.
But the existence of two diametrically opposed political camps in Haiti did
not dampen the euphoria in Port-au-Prince last week. Haiti's democratic
heart beats on, people said jubilantly: political violence is a thing of the
past. And, anyway, there was the US panacea. 'The change has been perfect,'
said one. 'Violence is Haitian history today. The US soldiers are our
democrats,' said another.
Mr Emanuel Constant, head of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of
Haiti, declared that 1994 would be 'the year of the ballot, not the bullet'.
Speaking outside the front's headquarters in a residential suburb of the
city, his words of reconciliation were punctuated by the paramilitaries
around him: 'Democracy yes] Democracy yes] Violence no]'
Less than a year ago, the same men had stood on the quayside of
Port-au-Prince harbour - and blocked the USS Harlan County from entering
Haiti to assist in the restoration of President Aristide under the last
agreement.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Lisa Wood's recent article ('Inspectors attack
'narrow' work-based qualification', September 14) and while I agree that the
underpinning knowledge required for some national vocational qualifications
needs to be reviewed, in hairdressing (one of the first NVQs) there is ample
knowledge and understanding built in.
I remember it was not so long ago that employers complained that potential
employees had the theoretical knowledge but had not been taught the
practical skills to do the job] Certainly in hairdressing the previous
qualification required far too much theoretical knowledge which was
inappropriate.
I agree with the concluding comments by Dr Melia, the Further Education
Funding Council's chief inspector, that more attention should be paid to
both underpinning knowledge and assessment in the workplace. However, there
is a great danger that the academics will hijack NVQs and take us back to
the bad old days of 'know all the theory but can't do the job'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Offensive to talk of a vegetarian
'menace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY CARRITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The headline on Giles MacDonough's review of vegetarian books in the
Weekend section ('Vegetarian food 'terrorism' ', September 17/18) and the
title, 'The vegetarian menace', on the front page of the FT were
gratuitously offensive.
Calling vegetarianism a 'menace' and a form of 'food terrorism' is perverse
in the extreme, given that it is a lifestyle which rejects violence against
creatures capable of experiencing pain and suffering. 'Food terrorism' is a
term more appropriate to describing the systematic abuse of animals inherent
in today's factory farm systems of meat production.
As for Hitler, there is a rotten apple in every pile. But demonising all
vegetarians because of him is as absurd as making all omnivores guilty of
Stalin's crimes.
Plenty of vegetarians have made outstanding contributions to their age:
Gandhi, George Bernard Shaw and Paul McCartney among them.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK must define view of EU democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, European democracy needs to be put on an open and clear footing and, as
your editorial 'Agenda for Euro-reform' (September 20) argued, the 1996
inter-governmental conference will provide the occasion for this.
The framework of the EU's institutional relationships needs to be defined so
that every European citizen can understand them without the 'guidance' of
the executive of the respective nation states. The current maze of powers,
treaties, directives, institutions and interests serves only to confuse. In
effect, the current EU is the pooling of executive sovereignty by the
governments of the nation states and this, or better still the structure of
a more democratic form, needs to be clarified by being written down.
At the 1996 IGC a written European constitution will be formulated. Work on
this is already going on across Europe. It will not be enough for the UK to
wait on the sidelines for a European Parliament or a Commission version of a
European constitution and then merely to criticise it. We must define our
own principles for Europe and its institutions based on the concepts of
subsidiarity, democracy and accountability, so that the European Union can
develop as a set of more open and democratic organisations.
In reflecting the views and wishes of all the peoples of Europe it will not
only enhance its own relevance but also take its place as part of the
pluralist democratic settlement in the UK itself.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complicated pensions solvency
requirements a waste of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr H R WYNNE-GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report, 'Workers at Swan Hunter face cut in pensions' (September
20), that the Swan Hunter pension scheme is technically solvent, yet can
cover only 60 per cent of its members' pensions.
Under the government's current proposals, this would have meant Swan Hunter
being required to put many millions of pounds into the scheme within a
three-month period - probably impossible for a company in such dire straits.
No amount of legislation is going to make a financially unsound employer put
money into a pension scheme, and the sooner the government recognises this
the better. Then it can get on with the real job of drafting clear and
simple requirements for employers to tell employees when their pension
scheme is going awry.
The government should stop wasting taxpayers' money in trying to design
complicated solvency requirements that will at best be useless and at worst
be damaging in terms of increased pension costs, following what will
effectively be government-dictated investment policy as clearly explained by
Barry Riley ('New benchmark worries UK pension funds', September 21).

FT  24 SEP 94 / Leading Article: An economic evolution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a species has taken more than 5m years to evolve, it is foolish to
expect much to change in a few years. Thus John Major's grand predictions
for the UK economy differ little from those of his immediate
prime-ministerial ancestor. His promise of a long steady recovery would
prove more reliable, however, if the UK economy had since evolved further.
In his speech in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Mr Major declared that the UK 'was
at the threshold of an economic recovery unlike any we've seen since the
second world war'. Margaret Thatcher greeted a similar dawn in March 1983,
declaring that the UK was 'better placed to recover and make good profits
and give new jobs than it has been for a very long time. The economy is
sustainable.'
Uncovering relics of a bygone era makes one sceptical about the scope for
rapid human development. Both leaders stood low in the polls, having
received little credit for more than two years' slow recovery. If anything,
today's embattled prime minister is more cautious: Mrs Thatcher was speaking
in the eighth quarter of the early 1980s recovery, while the rebound in UK
output growth is now into its 10th quarter.
On the face of it, Mr Major's optimism also has a more solid basis in the
economic statistics. Data released yesterday confirm that the UK grew by 3.8
per cent in real terms in the year to July, significantly above its
long-term trend of about 2 1/4 per cent.
There has been little sign so far that capacity constraints will turn higher
growth into price and wage pressures. Retail prices (excluding mortgages)
picked up very slightly last month, but the July index was only 2.3 per cent
higher than a year earlier.
Wage-price spiral
Similar records were being broken at the time of Mrs Thatcher's
pronouncements. Retail price growth briefly fell to an annual rate of 3.8
per cent rate in March 1983, the lowest in 15 years. Low inflation had come
at a high price, especially in manufacturing employment, but the shedding of
labour and technical improvements were to provide rapid growth in
productivity until the middle of the decade. By then, however, the
ingredients of a traditional UK wage-price spiral were already in place.
Will the current recovery meet the same fate? Perhaps not. Although the many
similarities between this recovery and the last one are too often forgotten,
there are clearly encouraging contrasts as well. None guarantees that the
'boom and bust' cycle will fail to recur, but this time it might take longer
to appear.
The two most important differences are the trend in the balance of payments
and the continued slow pace of wage growth. UK exports picked up more
quickly after sterling's devaluation in September 1992 than many expected.
A broad range of trade data portray a UK tradeable sector reacting to
sterling's fall as the most optimistic textbooks would predict. In the
passenger car industry, for example, the volume of vehicles produced for
export was up by nearly a fifth on last year's in the three months to July.
That compares with a mere 3 per cent rise in the volume produced for buyers
at home. The UK consumer of the 1990s is a more calculating beast than his
credit-hungry cousin of the 1980s. Although the main component of the
recovery to date, consumption growth has been cautious throughout. Recent
data suggest even that momentum may be beginning to run out.
Lower savings
True, yesterday's national accounts data confirm that households have been
slowly cutting back on precautionary saving as the recovery continues. But
those lower savings merely allowed households to maintain their existing
spending, despite the fall in disposable income produced by April's tax
rises.
In short, it is difficult to see the seeds of another damaging boom in the
developments of the past two and a half years. For the good news to
continue, the extra competitiveness won by sterling's exit from the ERM must
continue to be combined with stable domestic inflation. In the 1980s, most
of the hard-won gains in competitiveness were distributed as real wage
increases, not profits. But if the long-term unemployed are ever to see a
real change in the UK economy, this must not happen again.
So far, both employment growth and investment have lagged behind the rest of
the economy. The chances that either or both will pick up in the future
depend heavily on the stability of the government's macro-economic policy.
The commitment to stable and sustainable growth has certainly been
vociferously presented. The chancellor, for one, seems determined to tread a
slightly different path from that followed by predecessors in similar
situations.
Yet an economy enjoying stability is rather less exciting than one driven by
over-expanding credit. Wage growth is low and the employed are less sure
that their jobs will last. The main risk must be that the politician's
desire to win votes will triumph over hopes that a new species of chancellor
has been born.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Man in the news: Minister in a morality tale - Gerard
Longuet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far from being a source of relaxation, Gerard Longuet's Riviera villa is
proving his biggest ever political headache. It could even spell the end of
a bright career that some observers were projecting could make him prime
minister next year.
Mr Longuet, minister for trade, industry, posts and telecommunications, is
the most powerful politician to be hit so far by a growing wave of
allegations concerning official and corporate corruption in France.
He is not the only one. In July such allegations led to the resignation of
the communications minister. This week there were reports that the sports
and youth minister is under investigation for having received money
indirectly from pharmaceutical companies when she sat on the health
ministry's drug approval committee.
Mr Longuet is suspected by a judge, Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, of allowing the
building of his holiday house in St Tropez to be subsidised, to the tune of
more than FFr1m, by a contractor from Lorraine. The latter has carried out
big public contracts in Lorraine, where the minister also happens to be
president of the regional council.
In a report to the justice ministry leaked this week, the judge suggested
that the contractor may be guilty of 'misuse of corporate funds' and Mr
Longuet of 'receipt' of such funds.
Mr Longuet acknowledges that there may have been a cost over-run, but says
the judge has exaggerated it. In any case, he contends that because the
allegations do not concern his public responsibilities - in 1989-90 he was
neither minister nor president of the Lorraine region  - he has no intention
of resigning, even if formally charged. The contractor, for his part, says
he miscalculated on a FFr2.5m fixed price contract, and therefore he had to
pay the difference.
Now, friendly contractors are said to have long had a habit of providing
favours for corporate or political notables. But it is a sign of the French
public's growing sensitivity to the appearance - not necessarily the fact -
of corruption that the Longuet affair has caused such a stir.
The more moralistic mood started as a reaction to repeated scandals that
helped the Socialists lose power last year. It has been fuelled since by a
rash of corporate corruption allegations, some of them involving members of
a conservative administration pledged to restoring ethics in government.
The Van Ruymbeke report puts Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, on
the spot. Under the French system it falls to him to decide whether to have
a judge investigate his cabinet colleague.
His dilemma is shared even more acutely by the prime minister. Before taking
office, Mr Edouard Balladur claimed the advent of a 'liberal' government
would help root out corruption by privatising state companies and lessening
the links between the state and business. He also said any minister facing
formal charges should resign - and this month he set up a commission to
report on the ethics of links between politics and business.
On the other hand, Mr Longuet is crucial to the RPR Gaullist prime
minister's election strategy for the Elysee next spring. To offset the hold
that his presidential rival, RPR leader Jacques Chirac, has on the Gaullist
machine, Mr Balladur is counting on his coalition partner, the UDF, to back
him in preference to its nominal leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
So far the strategy is working well - but mainly thanks to Mr Longuet, whose
Republicans, with 109 seats in parliament, are the largest component of the
UDF federation. He might be rewarded with the prime ministership next year,
if Mr Balladur were to win the presidency. But there might be no Balladur
victory if Republican sentiment were to change as a result of Mr Longuet
leaving government.
Certain new factors dispose today's France towards corruption. One is the
trend over the past decade to decentralise more power to the regions,
placing more power to award public contracts in the hands of more people.
That more corruption cases are hitting the headlines these days may be
because a long-servile magistrature is at last doing its job. That, at
least, is the contention of Mr Mehaignerie, who yesterday welcomed the fact
that businessmen were at last beginning to fear the law. 'Such fear is the
beginning of wisdom,' he said.
French business's initial reaction to investigations was indignant. Many
captains of industry, and Mr Longuet himself, leapt to the defence of Mr
Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head of Schneider, when he was briefly detained
in a Brussels prison, without even knowing what the charges against him
were.
However, two-thirds of the businessmen interviewed in a recent poll said
many companies were indulging in illegal practices and favoured an
Italian-style 'clean hands' crack-down on corruption.
The Patronat employers federation has now followed Mr Balladur's example in
setting up its own study of corporate ethics, the legal responsibilities of
senior executives and non-executive directors, business links with politics
and desirable changes in the French penal procedure. In a somewhat utopian
vein, Mr Mehaignerie yesterday voiced the hope of getting corporate money
out of French politics altogether.
Recent years have seen more regulation and transparency in the funding of
French political parties. Before 1988 - just as in the US before the 1972-73
Watergate scandals - corporate donations to political parties were illegal,
but widespread. A 1990 law placed limits on what companies could give and on
what candidates could spend.
This has been enforced. For exceeding the limit in 1993, Mr Jack Lang, the
former socialist education and culture minister, lost his parliamentary
seat. As a result, 'we have drained some of the money out of politics', says
Mr Guy Carcassonne, a Paris law professor who helped the Rocard government
design the 1990 law.
Long term, therefore, France may be slowly cleaning up its act. But at least
in the coming presidential campaign, corruption is likely to be a big theme.

FT  24 SEP 94 / The high-wire act continues: Boris Yeltsin will need all the
balance and ballast he can muster if Russia is to exploit the first signs of
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drums roll, the curtains (no longer made of iron) part and . . . out of
Russia comes President Boris Yeltsin, walking on a tightrope. Russia is a
great country for high-wire artists, real and metaphorical. Mr Yeltsin, in
Britain this weekend and the US next week, is in that tradition.
He will feel at home with John Major and Bill Clinton: he is as unpopular as
they are, probably more so. Mr Yeltsin leads a sullen country, many of whose
people feel abused playthings of corrupt or ineffective politicians,
rapacious bureaucrats and criminals.
Yet at the same time he presides over signs of revival in parts of the
economy: Russia is finally showing that it might realise the promise it has
long held out.
Mr Yeltsin's unpopularity is, of course, a price any politician in his job
would have to pay, though he may have increased it through erratic behaviour
and increasing remoteness.
And the atmosphere in Russia does seem to have changed in the year since the
countdown began to the violent confrontation at Moscow's parliamentary White
House. On Tuesday, Mr Yeltsin returned from a five-week holiday at his Black
Sea dacha - punctuated only by a trip to Germany to observe the withdrawal
of Russian troops - to find an altogether cooler political climate.
It is too soon, however, to stop worrying about the course of events in
Russia. The hot autumn promised by the opposition may yet arrive. Almost
every opinion poll shows a turning away from democrats and growing or
sustained approval of nationalist and communist themes, if not parties and
individuals.
Polling of the electorate in the Moscow suburban constituency of Khimki for
a by-election next month shows an electorate whose main complaints are the
number of immigrants in their area, the ubiquity of the conspicuously rich
and the ineffectiveness of the government.
The opposition has promised to bring down the government in parliament -
which re-opens next week - and may use the debate on the budget to do so.
Leaders of harder-line opposition parties have been in conclave. While they
evidently cannot agree a common presidential candidate against Mr Yeltsin,
they nevertheless have in former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi a passably
charismatic figure round whom they could cluster.
Mr Rutskoi and his comrades have little more to offer on the economy than
statist controls, a war on crime and credits for all. But their policies do
not have to be coherent to prove popular, if they mount a strong campaign.
As if recognising this, Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, sounded
a caution earlier this week. He said the Pentagon's nuclear posture review
had concluded there was a 'small but real danger that reform in Russia might
fail and a new government might arise hostile to the United States, still
armed with 25,000 nuclear weapons'.
Mr Perry seems to mean what he says: the danger is real but it is seen as
small - and official Washington will stress to Mr Yeltsin how pleased it is
with US-Russian military co-operation, with joint approaches to Bosnia and
the Middle East, and with the progress of economic reform and the evident
stability in Moscow.
Nevertheless, Mr Perry's speech shows how much he thinks there is still to
be done - and this will be much of the content of the talks between Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Clinton.
The US thinks Russia is lagging in reducing its nuclear weaponry, and that
it is lax in guarding it. It will propose that Russia stops making
plutonium, builds a new storage facility for the fissile material taken from
dismantled weapons, and makes a better count of the weapons it has. Mr
Clinton will promise to work on Congress to maintain the 'Nunn-Lugar' funds
 -around Dollars 200m put up to aid nuclear arms reduction - as long as the
Russians show willingness to use them.
Russia, however, is resentful of western suspicions. It is also itself
suspicious of a Nato, which lacks the constraining presence of the Warsaw
Pact at the end of its gun sights, and is giving a broader welcome than
Russia would like to its former central European allies.
Mr Yeltsin is likely to use his UN General Assembly speech on Monday to call
for a reduction in arsenals other than the superpowers' - which means those
of the UK and France. He will raise, with both Mr Major and Mr Clinton, the
view that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a better
vehicle for security than Nato.
But Russian suspicions run deep. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, head of the Federal
Intelligence Service (the former first directory of the KGB), argues the
military, political and economic re-unification of the former Soviet states
(except the Baltics) is now inevitable - and is the only way to safeguard
the independence and democratic character of their new regimes.
If, says Mr Primakov, the west acts as if this is a neo-imperialist thrust,
the danger is both sides will retreat into laagers like those of the cold
war. This danger is the greater, says the country's top spy, because the
west sees it as in its interests to have a weak and divided space where once
the Soviet Union existed - not understanding that a new, non-coercive union
is the only guarantee of its security.
Russian politicians are conscious of their diminished world role and thus
are more insistent in demanding that their 'sphere of influence' be
respected. They are glad the US is trying to set Haiti to rights because
they argue that their own backyard - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Tajikistan - needs the similar robust policing.
The trouble for the west lies in learning to distinguish between robust
policing and undermining.
Ukraine, the other major state of the former Soviet Union, hovers between
two possible courses. It could choose a reformist course which would
strengthen its real independence. Or it could try to throw itself on the
mercy of a Russia which keeps it supplied with cheap energy and provides
markets for its low-quality goods.
Russian politicians are increasingl their efforts to conclude comprehensive
treaties with Ukraine on a range of issues - including the disputed Black
Sea Fleet - while the smaller country stalls, knowing it will deal from a
weak hand.
Similarly, Russia responded to the signing this week of an Dollars 8bn
contract between Azerbaijan and a group of major western oil companies by
challenging Azerbaijan's right to dispose of the contents of its continental
shelf. Its challenge may or may not be pushed to the extent of scuppering
the deal. Mr Major will want to raise the issue, since BP is the lead
contractor - as will Mr Clinton.
Underlying everything, as always, is the economy. Russia's economy looks in
better shape than it has since independence. Inflation was down to a monthly
rate of 4 per cent in August and the government is holding the budget
deficit within the 10 per cent of GDP set by the International Monetary
Fund.
Better, investment really is coming into Russia - in two forms.
First, the sheer rock-bottom prices which Russian assets commanded when they
were pulled out of state control are proving increasingly attractive to
portfolio investors. Even if many of the shares are worthless, investors
have concluded that others, especially in the energy sector, utilities and
telecoms, are among the world's best bargains. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the
deputy finance minister, estimates that at least Dollars 200m a month is now
coming in.
Second, increasing numbers of large, mainly US companies are setting up
production bases, including:
Caterpillar, which is undertaking two joint ventures with Russia's biggest
engineering companies, Zil and Uralmash;
Polaroid, which has seen sales soar as the instant picture craze catches on;
and Bayer, which has just started making Aspirin in Moscow. Increasingly,
the conventional wisdom is that the reforms are irreversible and that, even
if the road is rocky, fortunes can still be made with nerve and patience.
For the government the next stage of reforms - if the IMF and the World Bank
put up the Dollars 10bn the Russians want - is to balance budget expenditure
and move to stabilise the currency early next year. The gleam in its eye is
of genuinely low inflation in 1995, with the beginnings of a strong,
broadly-based recovery by the end of the year and rapid growth by 1996, when
elections are due.
By that time privatisation of state assets will be all but complete, and it
is not wholly utopian to believe that Russia could end the millennium as one
of the world's faster growing economies. The delivery of western support to
make this vision reality will form part of Mr Yeltsin's discussions in
Washington next week, and will be discussed at the annual meeting of the IMF
and World Bank.
So the conventional wisdom may be right, and becomes more likely to be so
with every day that the situation remains stable. But it is not certain.
Secretary Perry's 'small but real' risk reflects the increasingly resentful
section of the populace which feels left aside.
The government has stayed within the limits agreed with the IMF by slashing
expenditure on everything, including on commitments like wages. Huge areas
of Russian public life - health, social security, law and order, education -
are starved of funds, and the bodies responsible for these areas reduced to
patching things together, taking bribes or just giving up.
Great Soviet institutions have become ruined hulks. Moscow State
University's classrooms crumble; many of its curricula are unchanged since
Communist times; its teachers are materially poor - but its students, or
some of them, desperately strive for an education.
The Bolshoi Theatre opened its new season on Thursday night with
Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades. The production was antiquated; the costumes
less than gorgeous; a huge row raged backstage about money - and the singing
was miraculous.
Will Russia make it? Probably, in its own rickety, brilliant, arrogant
fashion. Mr Yeltsin must seek to explain that way to his bemused friends,
and hope they stick with him on the rocky road yet awhile.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Gaelic to be encouraged in Scottish primary schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All primary schoolchildren in Scotland would be encouraged to learn Gaelic
under plans drawn up by the SNP. The conference agreed to a range of
measures to encourage the language, which is spoken by only 70,000 people -
about 2 per cent of Scots.
Delegates agreed Gaelic should have equality with English in law and be
recognised and promoted as a national language. Bilingual workplace signs,
Gaelic road signs and a Gaelic radio station were among ideas for promoting
the language.
Mr Peter Scott-Wilson from Aberdeen said: 'Unless the language is supported
by a very firm policy it will not be encouraged, it will not grow - and we
desperately want Gaelic to grow in Scotland.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Nurses stand firm on pay bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of nurses and midwives said yesterday that they remained
resolutely opposed to the government's calls to end national pay bargaining
 -and vowed to continue fighting for an 8.3 per cent increase.
Organisations representing more than 600,000 staff warned that dropping a
national award and seeking locally negotiated deals involving National
Health Service trusts would lead to widespread turmoil.
Ms Maggie Dunn, who chairs the Nursing and Midwifery Staff Negotiating
Council, said staff would 'vote with their feet', leaving the NHS in droves,
while others might take industrial action.
Earlier this week details were leaked of the Department of Health's evidence
to the independent review body which recommends pay for nurses and midwives.
The department urged the review body not to recommend across-the-board rises
but instead to leave employers with 'maximum scope' for local action.
The Royal College of Nursing claims local pay bargaining would require the
420 trusts - which cover ambulance, community and hospital services - to
recruit thousands of new administrators.
Mr Philip Gray, director of labour relations at the RCN, said: 'National pay
bargaining machinery is extremely efficient.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Coal faces renewed dash for gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat to coal from other fuel sources was underlined yesterday when
Midlands Electricity and three overseas companies said they had reached
agreement on financing a 750MW gas-fired power station on Humberside.
Construction of Humber Power will start immediately.
As with several other proposed gas stations, plans for Humber Power were put
on hold after an agreement in February between the electricity regulator and
the two largest UK generators to peg prices in the wholesale power pool.
Yesterday's announcement dashed coal industry hopes that the pricing
agreement would end the so-called 'dash for gas'. Further gas-fired power
stations are being considered.
British Gas is thought to be considering whether to participate in a 1,200MW
station at Seabank, near Bristol, while Eastern Electricity is negotiating
on a 350MW station at King's Lynn, Norfolk.
The Humber Power station alone could displace 2m tonnes of coal a year from
the market when it is completed in April 1997. This would rise to more than
3.5m if the project's partners build a second phase of the station, taking
the full capacity to 1,200MW.
Midlands Electricity has taken a 25 per cent stake, investing about Pounds
11m on completion in 1997. It forecasts the investment will provide a real
post-tax return of more than 15 per cent. The company will also buy 174MW of
the station's output.
Midlands' partners are IVO of Finland (30 per cent), ABB, the international
engineer (20 per cent), and Tomen, the Japanese trading company (25 per
cent). IVO will operate the station and ABB will be the turnkey contractor.
Like Midlands, IVO and Tomen have entered 15-year hedging contracts for
output from the station. This is the first time that companies other than
regional electricity concerns have entered long-term contracts of this
nature.
IVO and Tomen said yesterday that they expected to be trading in the power
contract market 'in due course'.
Mr Kari Huopalahti, IVO group director, said the contractual structure which
made the project possible represented a step forward for power generation in
the UK.
Gas will be supplied by Total Oil Marine and Elf Exploration. Project credit
facilities of Pounds 520m were arranged by NatWest Markets and Union Bank of
Switzerland.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Witness tells of Walker quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The integrity of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, would have
suffered if the company had been forced to announce that profits had been
wrongly declared, a former non-executive director said at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Mr John Lewis, a board member for most of the 1980s, was giving evidence in
the trial of Mr George Walker, the company's former chief executive, and Mr
Wilfred Aquilina, a former finance director.
The two men, accused of fraudulently boosting the company's profits by
Pounds 17m between 1984 and 1987, deny charges of theft, false accounting
and conspiring to falsify accounts.
Mr Lewis said that in the 1980s boom, unlike today, property companies were
judged less by their profits record and more by their total asset value.
He agreed, however, with Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, that the bulk of
Brent Walker's property acquisitions were in the late 1980s. Had the company
announced in 1988 that earlier profits had been overstated then the markets'
reaction would have been adverse, Mr Lewis said.
Earlier, Mr Lewis told the court how Brent Walker's banks always put
pressure on Mr Walker to use his personal wealth to back the company's
expansion. This occurred in cases such as the development of Brighton
Marina.
Mr Lewis said he had always opposed this policy, arguing it was wrong for a
public company to operate in this way.
He said: 'Whenever I learnt about it I objected to Mr Walker both on the
basis of the company's interest and his own.
'I did not think it was right for a public company with outside shareholders
to need to call on one shareholder's resources to support a business
proposition.
'It could either stand up or it could not.'
Mr Walker ignored his objections. Mr Lewis said: 'I thought he was being
silly. I told him that many times. His attitude was that the banks required
it and that we could not do the deal without him putting up money - to which
my retort was perhaps we should not be doing the deal.'
Mr Lewis was the last of 71 witnesses to give evidence in the trial.
The jury was told that Mr Aquilina had decided not to go into the witness
box to give evidence.
The trial continues on Monday with the prosecution's closing speech. The
jury is set to retire to consider its verdicts on October 17.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Ulster-style deal for Scots urged by SNP: Salmond tells
government to 'let the people choose'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was urged by the Scottish National party yesterday to offer
Scotland the same degree of self-determination over its future as it has
promised the people of Northern Ireland.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said in his keynote speech to the party
conference in Inverness that if popular sovereignty was right in the north
of Ireland, 'how can it be wrong in the nation of Scotland where the process
of change has always been peaceful and always will be peaceful'.
He added: 'If the London government is not prepared to openly declare that
it has 'no selfish or strategic interest in Northern Ireland', then let them
declare the same for Scotland and make provision now for the people to
choose.'
The SNP, which had its 60th anniversary this year, has been in celebratory
mood at its conference following unprecedented success in this spring's
regional and European elections. It won control of two of Scotland's nine
regional councils and took a second seat in the European elections with a
record 33 per cent of the Scottish vote.
Mr Salmond said success had been characterised by total unity in the party
that had not always been obvious in the past. 'That's the way it's going to
be in the next two years (up to the general election) and woe betide anyone
who attempts to put personal vanity before the unity of his party,' he
warned.
Mr Salmond told the party it had to represent both the Protestant and the
Roman Catholic traditions in Scottish society. 'These traditions have
jointly helped forge our national identity,' he said.
This was a veiled reference to the party's role in the Monklands East
by-election in June where it became identified with the Protestants in a
campaign that was polarised on sectarian lines.
Mr Salmond compared Mr Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour party - the
SNP's main rival in Scotland - with the 18th century South Sea Bubble, when
companies were floated on the stock exchange before their purpose was
determined.
Mr Blair was 'the new southern bubble, floating along on hot air, sound
bites and photo-opportunities, the party whose purpose will hereafter be
determined'.
He said Mr Blair had 'taken that extra mile into Tory territory - there is
nothing to choose between Toryism and Tonyism '. If Labour's commitment to
devolution ever became embarrassing in Slough it would soon 'join the other
junked pledges in the dustbin of Labour policy'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Court backs Nadir plea to block Polly Peck sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lawyer representing Mr Asil Nadir said yesterday that an interim court
order had been made in Istanbul preventing administrators from selling any
assets of Polly Peck International in Turkey.
Mr Nadir fled to Cyprus in May last year while facing 13 charges of theft
and false accounting involving Pounds 34m.
The administrators in London yesterday said that they had not seen full
details of the order and therefore could not comment on its potential effect
on the administration.
However, they added that they thought the move was 'the latest in a series
of spoiling tactics adopted by Asil Nadir to delay the progress of the
administration'. They stressed that the action would not 'deter them from
their responsibilities to PPI creditors'.
Mr Zeki Inanli, representing Mr Nadir, said the interim order had been given
by the court at Kucukcekmece, a suburb of Istanbul, on September 16. He said
the order was based on the legal opinion that Turkish and British insolvency
laws were contradictory and that the PPI administrators therefore had no
legal status.
Mr Inanli said that the action, brought by Mr Nadir, aimed to annul all
transactions made so far by the administrators in Turkey. He said the case
would continue after the interim order. He added that the fugitive
businessman had brought the case because the administrators' actions would
have a negative effect on the Turkish economy.
Mr Nadir has run a campaign in Turkey to win public support against the
administrators and prevent them from disposing of the remaining PPI
companies in Turkey and northern Cyprus.
Among the assets of the now bankrupt fruits-to-electronics conglomerate is
Meyna, the Turkish fruit and packaging business which contributed most of
PPI's reported profits in the near and Middle East. Last year the privately
owned Ozgorkey Group of Izmir, Turkey, was in talks with the administrators
to buy the company.
The administrators for PPI - who were appointed in 1990 - are Mr Michael
Jordan and Mr Richard Stone from Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Mr Chris-topher
Morris of Touche Ross.

FT  24 SEP 94 / PM probed on NHS chief's Bupa job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday faced demands to explain whether the prime
minister's approval had been given for Sir Duncan Nichol, former National
Health Service chief executive, to join the private health sector.
Sir Duncan - who left the NHS in March - is to become a board member at
Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare organisation, which is involved
in partnerships with public-sector hospitals.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, wrote to the government asking
whether the approval of Mr John Major had been sought and given for 'one of
the architects of the NHS market-led changes' to join the Bupa board. He
said the move appeared to be a 'blatant breach of civil service guidelines'
on the employment of former senior officials.
The strength and range of reactions to Sir Duncan's appointment showed the
continuing power of health to explode as a political issue.
Opposition MPs and health union leaders accused him of jumping ship,
blurring the distinction between public and private provision, and exposing
government ambitions to privatise the NHS. But the Independent Healthcare
Association, which represents the private sector, congratulated Sir Duncan
on taking a 'grand step towards a mixed market in healthcare'.
Sir Duncan stressed that he believed the private sector could complement the
NHS. The central issue, he said, was that if private hospitals attracted
more work they would do so under public contracts.
'If those who spend the money choose to contract part of the money out to a
service in the private sector, they retain control of it,' he said on BBC
Radio. This did not in any sense undermine the NHS.
Bupa already has some partnerships in place with the NHS, and is involved in
discussions with up to 30 hospitals and health authorities about further
possibilities.
An agreement was signed in the summer with Bradford Hospitals Trust for
Bupa's first big capital project in the NHS - a proposed Pounds 2m
private-patient unit in the grounds of a public hospital, with the NHS
receiving rent based on the unit's revenue and profit. Last month a
partnership was agreed between Papworth NHS Trust and Bupa's Cambridge Lea
Hospital to pioneer laser heart surgery.
Mr Peter Jacobs, Bupa chief executive, said yesterday: 'There are no losers
in co-operation between the public and private health sectors. It is not
about privatisation.'
He hoped Sir Duncan's arrival at Bupa would help demonstrate the value of
the two sectors working together. 'But there is a need for a culture change
in parts of the NHS - some people do not like the idea of NHS money being
spent outside the public system.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Strategy to ease concerns of business sector outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party is to concentrate on convincing Scots that
transition to independence, the party's goal, would be simple and painless.
It also aims to lay to rest widely held misgivings about the reality of an
independent Scotland.
It will particularly focus on persuading people in the business community
that independence would be advantageous.
The party yesterday unveiled a strategy for the two years before the next
general election which entails building on the successes gained this year in
the regional and European elections. It is currently second to Labour in the
Scottish opinion polls with 24 per cent of the vote compared with Labour's
55 per cent.
Its next electoral target will be winning as many councils as possible in
next April's elections to Scotland's new unitary local authorities, which
are to replace the two-tier system of councils in 1996.
The party is to establish a committee under Mr Allan Macartney, who became
MEP for north-east Scotland in June, to devise a detailed exposition of the
transition to independence.
The SNP's opponents have argued that if Scotland seceded from the UK it
could not become a separate member of the European Union with-out difficult
negotiations and several years' delay.
A second group will devise arguments and initiatives to reassure sections of
Scottish society about both the transition and the reality of independence.
Few senior figures in the Scottish business community publicly support the
SNP although the party has support among people in smaller businesses.
Mr John Swinney, the party's publicity director, said: 'We want to create
confidence in the business community that the SNP has a message for them
that can be delivered. We may also be able to tailor our policies to their
needs on the basis of what they tell us.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Andersen link with Binder is agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the UK's third-biggest accountancy firm, is to join forces
with Binder Hamlyn, formerly the eighth biggest, after an agreement signed
yesterday. A formal announcement is to be made on Monday.
Andersen entered talks with Binder earlier this year after developing plans
in secret since last October. It is understood that the group will have
annual fee income of about Pounds 500m.
The agreement, which marks one of the biggest consolidations in the
profession for several years, will prompt a string of new international
partnerships across the UK sector.
Binder Hamlyn, which is expected to retain its name in the new group, will
join Arthur Andersen's international grouping and leave BDO International.
Stoy Hayward will take its place, leaving a vacancy at Horwath
International, which will be filled by Clark Whitehill.
Not all the semi-autonomous offices of Binder Hamlyn will be involved in the
new group. Stoy Hayward and Grant Thornton have already linked with regional
offices of Binder Hamlyn which did not wish to join the new group.
Binder Hamlyn's offices in the London region, Leeds, Manchester and
Newcastle are expected to join the new group. Half the total fee income for
Binder Hamlyn comes from the Leeds and London offices.
The move will give Andersen access to about 100 quoted companies audited by
Binder. It is understood that the new group will come into operation next
month. Former Binder Hamlyn offices which have not joined the group will
stop using the Binder name.
Regional doubts about the link emerged soon after the initial approach. A
managing partner at a regional office said difficulties would occur in terms
of the size and culture of the organisations.

FT  24 SEP 94 / No. 10 rallies to Howard after jail Semtex find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday made it clear that he would continue to back Mr
Michael Howard as home secretary following the discovery of Semtex explosive
in Whitemoor jail.
Downing Street acknowledged that the incident was a matter of concern for
the government but stressed that the home secretary continued to enjoy Mr
John Major's 'full support'.
However, one minister and several backbenchers privately predicted that Mr
Howard may be forced to resign. A senior member of the Conservatives' 1922
backbench committee said: 'Unfortunately for Michael (Howard) this is one
slip too many. He looks incompetent and may have to go.'
Mr John Bartell, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, called on Mr
Howard to resign. 'If you worked in one of Britain's prisons today and you
had to face the unchecked criminality, the daily violence and the daily
breakdown in control, I think you would share our sentiments,' he said.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, urged the prime
minister to take control of the situation by replacing Mr Howard as home
secretary. The Labour party, however, while critical of Mr Howard's
performance, stopped short of calling for his dismissal.
Mr Howard said he had no intention of resigning. 'I have a job to do and I'm
determined to see it through,' he said.
His officials made it clear that he would get to the root of the problem at
Whitemoor, the Cambridgeshire prison that was the scene of a failed escape
by five IRA terrorists and a convicted armed robber this month.
Mr Howard told journalists at Reading University in Berkshire, where he was
giving a speech on race relations: 'The Whitemoor incidents are being looked
at, a fuller inquiry is taking place and I shall be determined to learn
every lesson possible to be learned from it.'
The home secretary has faced a series of embarrassing defeats in the Commons
this year which have given ammunition to his opponents.
Mr Howard was forced to back down on a proposed shake-up of the criminal
justice system involving a big increase in the home secretary's influence
over police authorities and the introduction of contracts for justices'
clerks, who advise magistrates.
Conservative peers went on to inflict five significant changes to the
criminal justice bill.
In the Commons Mr Howard was forced to promise action against violent videos
to head off a widely supported amendment by Mr David Alton, the Liberal
Democrat MP.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Company surpluses break records as profits surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial surplus in the corporate sector reached record levels in the
second quarter of this year, as profits rose to a new high while investment
and dividend payments remained relatively flat.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the level of
undistributed income in the corporate sector was Pounds 17.1bn in the second
quarter, 5.6 per cent higher than in the first quarter and 52.3 per cent
higher than in the same period last year.
The key reason for the rise was a surge in corporate profitability. Company
gross trading profits rose to Pounds 21.63bn in the second quarter, 6.2 per
cent higher than in the first quarter and 22.7 per cent higher than in the
same period a year ago.
Much of the growth was due to the oil and gas sector, where profits were
Pounds 2.95bn in the second quarter, 38.5 per cent higher than in the first
quarter. The main reasons for the growth, the CSO said, were that new North
Sea fields had come on stream and oil prices had risen.
Profitability, however, also rose in the non-North Sea sector, with
second-quarter total gross trading profits 1.6 per cent higher than in the
first quarter and 17.3 per cent higher than the corresponding period last
year.
In spite of this rising profitability, total investment dipped fractionally
in the second quarter, partly because of a reduction in public investment
projects.
Meanwhile, dividend payments remained below 1993 levels. Although total
dividend payments were 6.9 per cent higher in the second quarter compared
with the first quarter, they were 18.9 per cent below 1993's second quarter.
Company borrowing, however, fell back in the second quarter, indicating that
many companies were using their cash to pay back previous debts.
The level of corporate borrowing from banks fell to Pounds 2.25bn in the
second quarter, 23 per cent lower than in the first three months.
Meanwhile, borrowing from other financial institutions fell to Pounds
5.67bn, more than 40 per cent lower than in the first quarter.

High compensation payments in sex discrimination cases against the Ministry
of Defence and extended maternity leave rights have done more harm than good
to women's job prospects, the Institute of Directors said yesterday, Richard
Donkin writes.
Two-thirds of women directors surveyed by the institute believed that the
awards to servicewomen who were sacked after becoming pregnant had damaged
women's employment prospects.
More than half thought women's job prospects had been hindered by extended
maternity rights and pay.
Almost two-thirds of the businesswomen said they did not believe equal
opportunities for women existed, although the proportion who believed this
was less than in 1991 when the IoD last carried out a similar survey. Three
years ago three-quarters of those questioned thought there was inequality in
the workplace.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, is due to arrive in Boston today for
his second visit this year to the US.
American officials confirmed that the administration had waived restrictions
that would normally have prevented Mr Adams receiving a visa because of his
associations with terrorism in Northern Ireland.
His stay is limited to two weeks, with fund-raising banned. However, Mr
Adams's visa allows him to visit nine cities - on his last visit, in
February, he was restricted to New York.
Mr Adams will not be received by Mr Bill Clinton, the president, or by Mr Al
Gore, the vice-president - unlike Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate
Social Democratic and Labour party, who visited Washington this week. Mr
Adams will, however, meet senior administration officials and members of
Congress - starting with Senator Edward Kennedy at Boston Airport today.
Mr Ken Maginnis, one of the three Ulster Unionist MPs who also visited
Washington this week, said his party was not opposed to Mr Adams receiving a
visa, 'in so far as there is a ceasefire'.
But Mr Jeffrey Donaldson, UUP secretary, said: 'We don't think it's a good
idea because there is a danger that Gerry Adams's role is going to be hyped
out of all proportion.'
Ulster Unionists said they wanted to sound 'a constant note of caution' in
Washington because 'in our view there is a measure of euphoria which is not
justified'.
Sinn Fein said last night it would try to open more than 200 cross-border
roads between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in a protest action
over the weekend. This follows London's reopening of six minor crossings on
Thursday and 10 others a week ago.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Review of building societies' structure starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A far-reaching government review of the way building societies operate,
including how they are accountable to the millions of customers who own
them, was launched yesterday.
The consultation paper published by the Treasury has already re-ignited the
debate on how to enable societies to compete effectively in retail financial
services without giving them an unfair advantage over other organisations.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
welcomed the paper. He said: 'Everything is up for grabs except building
societies.'
As mutual institutions, societies are owned by members rather than being
responsible to shareholders. Their critics - including Abbey National, the
banking group which used to be a society - say this means boards of
directors are not accountable to members in the way boards of public limited
companies are.
The Treasury raises the prospect of making societies more accountable
through setting up consultative committees of members or requiring societies
to reserve some board places for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'.
Among the subsidiary questions is whether societies should be able to vary
the existing voting system which gives members one vote each - for example
to take account of the amount of their business.
In terms of streamlining societies' powers, the suggestions in the Treasury
paper include:
Changing from a prescriptive regime to one where societies can undertake any
business, subject to a principal purpose and certain limits on their asset
structure.
Adopting a two-track approach in which some, probably small, societies
continue under a restrictive system, but others could seek agreement to
operate within a more relaxed framework.
Giving societies access to the banking sector by letting them own banking
subsidiaries, or by allowing them to convert into mutual banks.
The paper makes it clear the government does not intend to look again at the
statutory controls that make a hostile takeover of a society impossible, but
it does consider some liberalisation of the rules for mergers between
societies.
Building societies generally welcomed the discussion paper, although
Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said the relatively slow pace of
progress on questions of giving the sector greater powers was
'disappointing'.
Societies rejected the idea that there might be a shortfall in their
answerability to their owners, and they expressed misgivings about the two
specific proposals for enhancing their accountability. Halifax described
these proposals as 'a solution in search of a problem', and other societies
criticised the idea of a consultative committee as unworkable and
bureaucratic.
However Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, the third largest
society, acknowledged there was a need for an 'attitudinal change' among
societies which should be readier to help ordinary members who showed
interest in standing for election as directors.
Mr Peter Birch, Abbey National chief executive, dismissed the paper's
accountability proposals. Among his suggestions was that customers should
get an annual statement making it clear whether they were members and
telling them the value of their membership.
The Treasury intends to complete the review by the end of the year, and has
asked for comments by November 9.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Balance of payments eases City fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that economic recovery might create a serious balance of payments
problem were eased further yesterday by figures showing a significant
improvement.
The Central Statistical Office said the UK current account deficit was
Pounds 0.7bn in the second quarter of this year, down from the previous
quarter's figure of Pounds 1.3bn.
The deficit was considerably smaller than the City had expected, and
economists welcomed it as evidence that the UK recovery was proceeding at an
increasingly healthy pace.
Mr Paul Turnbull, UK economist at brokers Smith New Court, said: 'A year ago
a lot of people were forecasting that the balance of payments would spiral
out of control. In fact the opposite has happened.'
One reason for the improvement was that exports grew steadily in the second
quarter while imports fell slightly. Most analysts expect this trend to
continue, not least because of the rapid recovery in continental Europe and
other big export markets.
The other reason for the improvement was that the surplus on 'invisibles'
remained at the same high level in the second quarter. Invisibles cover
services, investment incomes and financial transfers.
Although the invisibles account is considered to be notoriously volatile,
most City analysts had expected it to fall back in the second quarter after
surging suddenly in the first three months.
The surplus on invisibles was Pounds 1.7bn in the second quarter, unchanged
on the first quarter and sharply up from the same period a year ago when the
surplus was Pounds 0.2bn.
This flat overall figure, however, concealed a significant shift in the
different sectors. The surplus on services fell to Pounds 0.8bn, down from
Pounds 1.2bn in the first quarter, mainly because of a fall in the surplus
on financial services. This drop reflected a lower surplus in the insurance
sector and some weakening in activity by security markets, the CSO said.
The surplus on investment income, by contrast, rose to Pounds 2.4bn in the
second quarter, up from Pounds 1.9bn in the first quarter and sharply higher
than the same period a year ago when the surplus was Pounds 0.4bn. The main
reason for the increase, the CSO said, was a large inflow of investment into
the UK in the second quarter after a large flow of investment abroad in the
first three months.
Mr David Hellier, UK economist with NatWest Markets, said: 'This reflects
instability in the financial markets. A lot of people have been repatriating
funds and that has dominated the flows.'
Meanwhile, the deficit of lending and borrowing by UK residents other than
banks and the government fell considerably to Pounds 1bn in the second
quarter, down from the high level of Pounds 1.7bn in the first quarter.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Tourism body claims 12.3% stake in GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tourism industry is far bigger than previous estimates have suggested
and produces a balance of trade surplus rather than the deficit reported in
government statistics, the World Travel and Tourism Council said yesterday.
The council, which was set up in 1990 by a group of travel industry chief
executives, said that tourism would account for 12.3 per cent of gross
domestic product next year. The travel industry would employ 3.2m people
directly or indirectly - 12.4 per cent of the workforce.
The council's figures are far higher than those in the statistics produced
by government departments and tourist industry bodies. A study of tourism
published by the Confederation of British Industry in May said government
figures indicated that the industry accounted for 5.6 per cent of GDP and
employed 1.4m people, or 6 per cent of the workforce.
Mr Geoffrey Lipman, the council's president, said previous figures took
account of spending on hotels and other tourist services but did not include
travel-related investment, such as building hotels and aircraft.
Mr Lipman said that, taking these industries into account, tourism had
consistently produced a big balance of payments surplus, aided by
British-based aircraft manufacture and hotel construction abroad by UK
companies.
The council said that, when the travel-related investment was included, then
the tourism balance of payments surplus was Pounds 4.9bn in 1992. This
compares with government statistics which recorded a Pounds 3.4bn deficit in
1992. The council shows a surplus for every year from 1987 to 1992 - when
official statistics recorded deficits.
Mr Lipman said the council - which has Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of
British Airways, and Sir John Egan, chief executive of airports group BAA,
as members of its executive committee - had presented its study to Lord
Astor, the tourism minister.
He said the council's figures showed that tourism was an industry which
should enjoy a far higher profile in government policy and decision-making
than it did.
Mr Lipman criticised the decision, announced in last year's Budget, to
introduce a departure tax of Pounds 5 for flights in the European Union and
Pounds 10 for flights elsewhere. He said that tourism, as a successful
export industry, should receive tax incentives rather than additional
burdens.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Major plays for success all round the political park:
Cricket cheers in South Africa may find an echo on the prime minister's home
wicket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arms stretched high, fingers stabbing the sky, Mr John Major glowed with
pride as cheers rolled around the crowd watching him bowl at South Africa's
Alexandra township cricket ground.
It was a spontaneous gesture that revealed, for a fleeting moment, the human
being inside the grey suit. What a pity, Mr Major must be reflecting, that
the cheers were only for his cricket skills.
The prime minister describes himself as a 'sports nut'. Yet he would give up
sport for good in exchange for that kind of enthusiastic support for his
government, dogged by the fall-out from recession, internal squabbling and
ridicule of the ill-fated back-to-basics campaign.
Mr Major is unlikely to be offered a better opportunity to rise above
domestic troubles and play the role of world statesman than the six-day
official trip to Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and South Africa that ended with
his return to London yesterday.
The Gulf visits were largely about maintaining close relationships with
political and business allies, spiced by the promise of defence orders and
privatisation consultation fees from the Saudis.
But the South African visit was the first by a British premier since Harold
Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in 1960, which signalled the start of
the white government's 34-year international isolation.
Mr Major's speech, worthy but dull, is unlikely to be remembered 34 years
on. But it was well received by most shades of political opinion, and the
visit was regarded on both sides as a modest success. In particular, British
officials were pleased by clear indications that Mr Major's down-to-earth
focus on concrete assistance impressed more than the high-flown but
insubstantial rhetoric of President Mitterrand of France, the first western
leader to visit after free elections ended white rule.
The most striking aspect of the trip was the absence of the domestic
fireworks that have followed Mr Major abroad on previous occasions. His trip
to Japan and Malaysia a year ago, for example, was dominated by the question
of his survival as prime minister amid acrimonious bickering between the
party's pro and anti-Europeans.
Aides say the prime minister has been buoyed by the success of the UK-Irish
peace process and the improved economic outlook, which he believes will
deliver two more years of solid growth before the next general election. Mr
Major made the economic point strongly in Saudi Arabia, telling British
businessmen that prospects were better than at any time since 1945.
Talking to journalists in the garden of the high commissioner's residence in
Pretoria, shortly before leaving for home, the prime minister avoided the
temptation to confirm that he believed his premiership was at a turning
point. 'No wise politician ever says that,' Mr Major explained cautiously.
But the upbeat tone of the rest of his remarks told a different story, in
tune with his relaxed and confident appearance.
'Politics is a series of mantraps,' he said. 'But there are a series of
things we have been doing together for the last four years which are now
beginning to come together. People are beginning to see the fruits.'
Mr Major's advisers believe the first political rewards emerged in last
week's ICM opinion poll for the Guardian, which put the Conservatives only
12 points behind Labour after adjusting for the factors that ICM believes
caused inaccurate polling before the 1992 general election.
Significantly, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, also believes the
Conservatives trail the opposition by far less than the 20 points to 30
points reported by many polling organisations during the past year.
Mr Major thinks he will gain further support from a successful party
conference in Bournemouth next month. There will be criticism - notably over
the government's law and order record - but the prime minister's hold on
power will not be seriously questioned for the first time in three years.
Advisers say Mr Major knows there are still many problems ahead. The
Northern Ireland peace process could break down, sparking renewed violence;
the European issue could return to haunt the government when a bill to
increase payments to the European Union is tabled later this year; the truce
with the Tory rightwing could dissolve, as a brief spat with Baroness
Thatcher over South African economic prospects demonstrated; and the July
reshuffle has failed to end the impression of a tired and inept cabinet.
But Mr Major's position is demonstrably stronger than a year ago. He looked
confident in South Africa, especially with his jacket and tie off on the
cricket field. Perhaps he should let his hair down more often.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Rebuilding work helps Lebanese economy to 8% growth rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lebanon's economy has recovered from this year's faltering start and is on
course to reach government targets of 8 per cent a year growth, according to
Banque de Liban, Lebanon's central bank.
However, real wages remain depressed, prompting protests from labour and
other groups, while economists say sustained high interest rates continue to
tempt repatriated funds into Lebanese town treasury bills rather than
productive direct investment.
Economists at Banque Audi, the commercial bank which is among the first to
publish detailed economic data, said that, after reaching 7 per cent in
1993, growth in the Lebanese economy slipped back in the first quarter,
recovering only in the second to raise real growth rates during the first
half of 1994 to 7.9 per cent.
The bank forecasts real growth of 8-10 per cent for 1994 as a whole. Mr Riad
Salame, the central bank governor, said: 'From our data, the economy went
through a slowdown from August 1993 to April 1994, but has been recovering
since May. July and August have been particularly good months.'
However, both Mr Salame and other economists warned that there were few
reliable figures on the economy since the end of Lebanon's civil war three
years ago. Lebanon's reconstituted central statistical department only
recently published its first economic data since 1974.
Growth estimates are therefore based on a mix of monetary aggregates,
indices such as cement sales, the award of construction permits, port and
airport traffic and some industrial and agricultural data.
Construction, in particular, has remained strong, with the latest central
bank monthly bulletin showing cement deliveries and construction permits in
July up 35 and 20 per cent respectively over the same month last year.
However, the bulletin also said: 'Excess supply on the real estate market
has resulted in large inventories of unsold dwellings.'
The bulletin said foreign trade remained sluggish, with imports and exports
down 19 and 14 per cent respectively in July from a year earlier. But it
said the trade deficit fell by 20 per cent in July after widening by 10 per
cent in the first half.
The balance of payments recorded an overall deficit of Dollars 27m due
largely to an exceptional Dollars 135m transfer overseas by Solidere, the
property company established by Arab investors this year.
But the bulletin also said strong capital inflows and revived tourism had
produced an underlying surplus of Dollars 107m. The bank said balance of
payments surpluses had averaged Dollars 80m a month since February.
Mr Salame said about Dollars 10bn had flowed into Lebanon since the end of
the war in 1990, the bulk of it repatriated Lebanese capital and Gulf Arab
funds. Of this, he said, about Dollars 6bn went into Lebanese bank deposits
and most of the rest into Lebanese pound treasury bills. He said Dollars 3bn
had flowed in during the past year, half into T-bills.
With T-bill rates hovering at around 19 per cent, economists said these
would continue to attract significant inflows of cash and interest rates
look set to remain high in real terms - with domestic inflation at 10 per
cent a year - while the government endeavoured to keep the Lebanese pound
stable at about Pounds L1660-1680 to the dollar in an effort to
'de-dollarise' one of the Middle East's most dollarised economies.
'We obviously need to have more money flow into productive investment,' Mr
Salame said. 'But we don't yet have the proper infrastructure in place to
attract capital into these sectors.' He said substantially greater flows of
productive investment were unlikely until the completion of some of the
multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects under way and the revival of
Lebanon's capital markets as an effective investment intermediary.
So far this market comprises only domestic T-bills and a secondary market in
Solidere shares, which have soared from their issue price of Dollars 100 to
Dollars 170 in recent weeks. A stock market committee has been reappointed
and is discussing regulatory changes necessary for the revival of a fully
fledged Beirut stock market. Mr Salame said he believed the market could
begin operations within months, with as many as 10 previously listed
companies being traded.
However, the fruits of Lebanon's economic growth are proving slow to trickle
down to the bulk of middle- and lower-class workers in the country, whose
cause has recently been taken up by labour unions and political leaders in a
string of attacks on government economic policies and their reconstruction
priorities.
The General Confederation of Lebanese Workers this week said it was seeking
a retroactive pay rise of 88 per cent to compensate for recent price rises
and the decline in real wages. But Mr Salame said that, while the government
realised real wages had fallen, it would resist such pay rises unless they
were matched by increased productivity. He said the government was concerned
above all to contain the inflationary effects of the recent spurt in
economic activity, much of it spurred by the recent award of a host of large
infrastructure contracts.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Thousands flee India's killer plague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 200,000 people have fled from the western Indian city of Surat, where
plague has killed at least 44 people and left scores more sick in hospitals.
The government put health authorities in Delhi and Bombay and other cities
in northern and western India on alert amid mounting fears that the exodus
from plague-infested Surat might spread the deadly disease. Mr Madhusudan
Dayal, the health secretary, said the government was 'seriously concerned'
about the threat.
Mr Dayal, who put the death toll at 44, said the situation was under control
and there was no cause for alarm.
However, reports from Surat, a city of 2m people about 160 miles north of
Bombay, put the number of dead at over 100, with hundreds more desperately
ill. Buses and trains were crammed with people fleeing their homes, ignoring
instructions from the authorities not to leave the city. Police were trying
to seal off the slums worst hit by the plague, where the first deaths were
reported on Tuesday. Many residents stayed indoors, while people in the
streets moved about with cloths covered in white DDT powder wrapped around
their faces and municipal workers sprayed roads with chemicals.
Doctors in Surat said that at least 24 people had died of pneumonic plague -
a particularly dangerous variant of bubonic plague, the Black Death of the
Middle Ages. Unlike bubonic plague, which is spread by the bite of an
infected rat or of a flea which has previously been infected by a rat,
pneumonic plague is air-borne and highly infectious. The Health Ministry in
Delhi is trying to determine the exact nature of the disease and had called
upon technical help from the US and Russia.
The authorities in Surat are distributing tetracycline, an antibiotic which
acts as a prophylactic against plague and is also used in treating the
disease. Supplies are also being made at available at railway stations in
Bombay and other cities to which Surat residents are fleeing. The government
has rushed 10m capsules of tetracycline to the region.
The outbreak in Surat follows another last month in central Maharashtra,
where 81 people have contracted bubonic plague in villages hit by an
earthquake last year.
Officials have as yet not established any link between the two outbreaks,
the first in India in about 30 years. Surat, a wealthy centre for diamond
polishing and textiles, attracts many migrant workers. During the monsoon
this summer, the city suffered floods which may have helped the disease
spread.

FT  24 SEP 94 / South Africa holds its breath over Zulu split: As Shaka's
descendants square up, Mark Suzman looks at the bigger issues around the
power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaka, the 19th-century founder of the Zulu kingdom, was an African Napoleon
who, like his European contemporary, used his military genius to forge a new
empire. In the process he caused tremendous political and economic upheaval
throughout the southern African region.
As South Africa's 9m Zulus decide whether to observe today's Shaka Day, an
annual commemoration of the murder of Shaka by his brothers in 1828,
millions of other South Africans will be hoping the occasion does not mark
the start of renewed violence in the KwaZulu/Natal province, and, by
extension, cause serious damage to the spirit of consensus and
reconciliation that has characterised the country's politics since its
elections in April.
Although the event has been held since 1954, this year is the first time
Shaka Day does not have the blessing of the Zulu monarchy. Earlier this
week, King Goodwill Zwelithini announced he was cancelling the ceremonies
and called instead for a period of peace and prayer to be observed by Zulus
countrywide.
The decision was apparently precipitated after Inkatha supporters stormed
the royal palace in Nongoma on Monday night after a meeting between the
king, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, home affairs minister and leader of the
Inkatha Freedom party which has political control of KwaZulu/Natal, and
President Nelson Mandela.
The discussion had been called to resolve a controversy over the king's
apparent invitation to Mr Mandela to attend the Shaka Day celebration - a
move which Chief Buthelezi objected to, ostensibly on the grounds that
protocol had not been followed.
After making his announcement, however, the king set the stage for open
confrontation between his supporters and those loyal to Inkatha. Dismissing
the king's call, Chief Buthelezi said the monarch had no authority to cancel
the occasion, which belonged to 'the Zulu nation as a whole'.
As a result there is now serious concern that today's celebrations will lead
to outbreaks of violence between Zulus honouring the king's cancellation
request and those who have chosen to support Chief Buthelezi's stand. In a
province where thousands of people have been killed over the past decade in
internecine clashes between Zulus loyal to Inkatha and Zulus loyal to the
African National Congress, such fears may well be justified.
Prior to the elections, the king had been associated with Inkatha, an
explicitly Zulu nationalist organisation that has been dominated by Chief
Buthelezi since its formation in 1975. Since April, however, the two rulers
have been steadily drifting apart and King Goodwill's attitude to the ANC
has thawed notably.
After his Shaka Day declaration, moreover, King Goodwill declared his desire
to stay above politics, and dismissed Chief Buthelezi from his honorary role
as traditional 'prime minister' to the monarchy, apparently replacing him
with a former regent, Prince Mcwayizeni Zulu, who is a member of the ANC.
This move strikes at the heart of Chief Buthelezi's power base. For decades
he has played on, and largely created, Zulu nationalist ideology to
consolidate his own power base. In the elections he ruthlessly exploited
tribal fears to drum up support.
Central to this message is the association with Shaka, from whom both Chief
Buthelezi, who is the king's uncle, and King Goodwill himself, claim direct
descent. Over the years, Shaka Day has evolved into the central focus of
Zulu nationalist ideology, and Chief Buthelezi and the king have
traditionally presided jointly over the formal ceremonies at the Shaka
monument in the town of Stanger.
Dressed in traditional leopard-skin robes, and presiding over hundreds of
assegai-wielding impi regiments and thousands of ululating women, Chief
Buthelezi has traditionally used the event to extol Shaka's greatness, and,
by extension, his own as the modern-day successor to the warrior monarch.
By withdrawing from the celebration, the king, as the living embodiment of
the monarchy established by Shaka, severely damages the event's credibility.
However in doing so, he has played his strongest card, while Chief Buthelezi
remains able to use both the regional government and Inkatha's powerful
organisational and patronage network to consolidate his support.
As a result, while some prominent ANC-supporting Zulus (not in the past
known for their royalist sympathies) have declared themselves in favour of
the king's stand, it appears that the chief has so far managed to retain the
allegiance of most of the conservative tribal chiefs who comprise Inkatha's
core constituency.
Nevertheless, the situation remains fluid and to try and calm tensions, both
President Mandela and Mr Frank Mdlalose, KwaZulu/Natal regional premier,
have made a public call for all Zulus, whether observing the ceremonies or
not, to mark the day as one of 'unity and reconciliation'.
Meanwhile, the army has been called out to monitor the situation and the
king has been evacuated from his palace by national troops and taken to an
undisclosed location for the weekend.

FT  24 SEP 94 / There's a whole lotta coffee in . . . Ethiopia: There's some
good news at last in a country that has had more than its share of
suffering, both natural and man-made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country usually associated with drought, famine and war, Ethiopia has
for once something to celebrate. Plentiful rains have raised hopes of a good
harvest after 18 months of drought. And coffee prices are soaring because of
frost and drought in Brazil, with Ethiopia among those reaping the benefits.
In addition, the discovery of the world's oldest human fossils, solving the
missing link between man and apes, is a source of pride to a much
beleaguered people.
Ethiopia earlier hit the international headlines 10 years ago, when millions
starved because of persistent drought. The country was back in the news this
May, when government and aid organisations were warning of a potentially
worse disaster this year; early-season rains had failed and thousands were
dying of hunger. An Ethiopian government delegation organised a world tour
to drum up food donations.
A disaster may well be averted. Rains in much of the country have been
heavy, and continue to fall. 'The main season's crop harvest is very very
promising. If - and it's a very big if - moisture continues for another few
weeks then there will be a good harvest. At the present time there is no
indication of an emergency situation in our areas in the coming months
ahead,' says Dr Getachew Diriba, of CARE International, one of 160
non-governmental organisations operating in Ethiopia. Aid organisations
working in other parts of the country echo his remarks, but stress emergency
food will still be necessary until the harvest.
Coffee farmers are also getting a big break. World coffee prices have almost
trebled this year because of Brazil's misfortune. Ethiopia's farmers are
therefore taking better care of their plants and sending more to the export
markets. The country expects coffee exports worth Dollars 250m (Pounds
158.2m) this year, compared with Dollars 100m in 1993. Coffee - which
originated in Ethiopia and grows wild - accounts for more than half of the
country's export earnings.
Such good news stands out in a country struggling for the past three years
with the transition to democracy after three decades of conflict which ended
with the collapse of the Mengistu regime and independence for Eritrea.
Ethiopia has 55m people - second only to Nigeria in Africa in population -
and has one of the world's highest population growth rates. And while 85 per
cent of the population is rural, eking a living from the land, the country
is unable to feed itself.
Even with a good harvest, the country needs an extra 500,000 tonnes of
cereals to feed its people each year. Add to that drought, pest infestation
of crops, and the needs of people fleeing from ethnic conflicts, the return
of exiled Ethiopians, refugees from Eritrea, and disabled servicemen, and
the figure more than doubles. Food aid is a necessity for the foreseeable
future.
There are other huge demands on the transitional government. The country's
infrastructure is severely under-developed. Roads, electricity and
telecommunications all need huge investment - not only to make life bearable
for Ethiopians but to attract foreign investors. People need such basics as
schools, hospitals and jobs; in the capital, Addis Ababa, about 60 per cent
are unemployed, according to one study. Many of the jobless set up
home-grown businesses selling necessities like injera - a pancake like bread
 -or they polish shoes, or guard cars, or beg. Many small businesses are
being formed - from restaurants and travel agencies to fruit and vegetable
stalls.
But the government is moving in the right direction, against all odds,
according to the World Bank. A structural adjustment programme is in place,
involving a devaluation of the national currency, the birr, the introduction
of market pricing and privatisation plans.
Defence spending has been reduced by about two thirds while the education
and health budget has doubled.
'I will be hard put to find another African country in which such a clear
change is evident in just three years,' says Abhay Deshpande, the resident
representative for the World Bank in Ethiopia.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Congress near agreement on lobbyist curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress moved closer yesterday to passing legislation severely
limiting the favours its members may receive from lobbyists.
But with only two weeks remaining before recess, Republicans threatened to
block action on other substantive legislation, including a watered-down
healthcare reform bill, proposals to change the financing of election
campaigns and a measure protecting Californian desert lands from
development.
The lobbying breakthrough came with the agreement of a joint House-Senate
conference committee on a unified bill to be presented to the Senate early
next week and the House shortly after. Both passed different bills earlier
in the year.
The bill would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from accepting
meals, entertainment, travel, legal defence fund contributions and all but
the most inexpensive gifts from lobbyists. Campaign contributions would not
be covered.
The estimated 13,000 paid lobbyists in Washington would be obliged to
register with the government (only about 4,000 now do). They would also be
required to disclose their financing and expenditures, whom they lobby and
on what issues.
The issue has populist appeal in advance of the November mid-term elections
in which the anti-Washington mood of the nation is already evident. The
defeat on Tuesday of Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma in a Democratic
primary and the re-election problems of Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House
(19 points down in his Washington state district, according to a poll out
yesterday), were tart reminders of this political reality.
But the Republicans showed themselves disinclined to hand the Democratic
leadership and President Bill Clinton anything that could be portrayed as
victories during the November polls.
A mainstream group of senators, including some moderate Republicans,
continued to press for modest healthcare reform improving coverage for
pregnant women, children and the aged. Most on Capitol Hill now consider the
cause of healthcare lost for this session, though Senator George Mitchell,
majority leader, refuses to concede defeat.
Senate Republicans also threatened to use an obscure parliamentary device -
known as the post-cloture filibuster - to prevent action on campaign finance
reform, an issue high on President Clinton's agenda. This bill would place
financial ceilings on the amount that could be spent in any race and would
provide for partial government financing.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Jamaica sees change in its fiscal fortune: The causes of
upturn are being contested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The custodians of Jamaica's finances are celebrating what they see as a
significant change in the fortunes of their economy.
Since the beginning of the year, there has been a marked increase in the
volume of foreign currency in the commercial banking system, and the
country's foreign reserves have grown twenty-fold. This, they say, has
contributed to several months of currency stability in Jamaica.
The underlying cause of these developments, however, has been questioned. It
has been suggested this financial turn for the better has nothing to do with
the performance of the economy, and that it could be temporary.
Officials say it is government action which has brought stability.
The deregulation of Jamaica's foreign exchange market three years ago was
followed by an 83 per cent depreciation in the value of the Jamaican dollar,
following a fall of 67 per cent during the 1980s. Since January, however,
flows of foreign currency into the banking system have moved from about
USDollars 2m a day to about Dollars 5m a day. The country's net
international reserves have moved from Dollars 12.5m in December to about
Dollars 240m in June - equal to the import bill for about six weeks. The
exchange rate has been stable for nine months.
'This is the result of a successful policy,' said Mr Jacques Bussieres,
governor of the central bank. 'The tight monetary policy of the last year
has helped to stabilise the exchange rate, restoring some confidence in the
Jamaica dollar. This has encouraged people to hold Jamaican dollar assets,
leading to significant reflows of capital into Jamaica.'
Mr Edward Seaga, the opposition leader and a former finance minister, is far
from convinced. During the period of increased foreign inflows and currency
stability, there has been a decline in earnings by the leading sectors of
the economy. 'There is no underlying growth in the economy to support the
inflow of foreign exchange claimed by the government,' he contended.
Jamaica's merchandise deficit in the first five months of this year widened
to Dollars 374.5m, Dollars 50.4m more than a year earlier, and follows a
trade gap of Dollars 1.1bn last year. Marginally higher earnings from
tourism will not close the gap. 'Jamaica is in great danger by proceeding on
the false premise of having a safe reserve position,' Mr Seaga said.
The increased foreign currency inflows followed the expansion of the network
of licensed foreign exchange facilities, said Mr Rex James, president of the
Banker's Association. 'Black market trading in foreign currency seems to
have disappeared. Some money is also coming in because of higher interest
rates here than might be available in the US.' Jamaican banks' interest
rates on foreign currency deposits are about 50 per cent higher than those
prevailing in the US.
This increase in currency inflows and the improvement in international
reserves, however, masks some continuing and chronic problems for the
economy. Economic growth this year is not expected to be much higher than
last year's 1.2 per cent - less than half the government's target. The
bauxite mining and refining industry and export agriculture (mainly sugar
and bananas) are likely to record no more than the marginal growth expected
by tourism. Despite the exchange rate stability of the past eight months,
figures up to July indicate an annualised inflation rate of 32.7 per cent,
following last year's 30.1 per cent. The fiscal programme, attempting to
achieve a surplus, has adversely affected social services.
Industrial unrest threatens as the government, ironically, becomes the
victim of what its claims is a policy success. Reports of the improvement in
the foreign reserves have coincided with a spate of hefty wage claims from
public sector unions.
Despite repeated suggestions that illegal activities have contributed to the
increased inflows, Mr James maintains 'there is no evidence that money is
being laundered in Jamaica'. Mr Bussieres concurs: 'While there is always
the chance of some element of money laundering being attempted, the central
bank has taken all steps to ensure that this is not happening.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Haitians may get US jobs training
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haitian refugees being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
will start coming home on Monday. US officials could not confirm the number
of people who have asked to return, but have taken their requests to do so
as a sign that Haitians see the US military presence as a guarantee of
security.
Although no details were given, it is understood the US intends to train as
many as 1,500 of the people returning for civilian and policing jobs in
Haiti. There are currently more than 15,000 refugees at Guantanamo.
US embassy spokesmen said refugees would be repatriated on a voluntary basis
only.
US commanders in Haiti yesterday continued to develop operating regulations
for their troops in co-ordination with Haiti's military command. General
Henry Shelton, US commander of the joint task force in Haiti, yesterday held
his fourth meeting of the week with General Raoul Cedras, the military
leader, who is required to step down by October 15.
In downtown Port-au-Prince, Colonel Mike Sullivan, head of the US military
police units, met Colonel Michel Francois, the chief of police, who was
instrumental in the 1991 coup which ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
News of a meeting with the reclusive but influential Col Francois, whose
whereabouts had been unclear even to US officials earlier in the week, will
relieve many who have feared he was not party to the agreement to restore Mr
Aristide.
More US troops came out to patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince in
conjunction with Haitian police.
In addition, embassy officials announced that three Special Forces operating
detachments were yesterday due to be sent out to the Haitian countryside to
take up positions at Gonaves, Jacmel and Cap Haitien.
Twelve UN observers arrived yesterday to monitor the military operation,
which, although only involving US personnel on the ground as yet, is a
multinational intervention sanctioned by UN Resolution 940 in July earlier
this year.
US defence secretary William Perry and General John Shalikashvili, chairman
of the military joint chiefs of staff, will visit Haiti today to meet US
forces, defence officials said, Reuter adds. They will return to Washington
this evening.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Perez de Cuellar joins race for Peruvian presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary general, has announced
that he will run for the presidency of Peru for the period 1995-2000.
The decision will pit the 74-year-old diplomat against both serving
President Alberto Fujimori - expected to confirm in coming days that he will
seek re-election - and Mr Fujimori's wife, Ms Susana Higuchi. Ms Higuchi has
formed her own opposition political movement and will run for the presidency
if she can ensure a law impeding her candidacy is quashed.
In a brief and low-key announcement made before a small gathering of press
and key supporters, Mr Perez de Cuellar gave only general outlines of future
policy.
Like most of Mr Fujimori's opponents, Mr Perez de Cuellar was obliged to
recognise the advances made in Peru in the past four years. Unlike others,
he was able to remind his listeners that he himself had assisted Mr Fujimori
in designing 'the indispensable corrections in economic policy' made in
1990.
In what appeared to be an attempt to calm the nerves of local and foreign
businessmen, who fear he could represent a return to more a socialist line,
Mr Perez de Cuellar promised: 'What has already been achieved will be
perfected. . . (but with) democracy, genuine stability, development and
jobs.'
With the first round more than six months away, it is too soon for reliable
opinion polls. A nationwide poll by the Apoyo organisation last weekend
showed Mr Fujimori currently enjoys 44 per cent support and Mr Perez de
Cuellar 24 per cent. Ms Higuchi is trailing with only 6 per cent.
According to the same poll, the qualities most admired in the current
president are his capacity for hard work, his decisiveness, his
preoccupation with the poor, his knowledge of Peruvian reality and his
honesty (although conversely, among his failings, 17 per cent of those
polled dubbed him a liar).
Meanwhile, Mr Perez de Cuellar's strengths in Peruvian eyes centre on his
international prestige, his experience and his commitment to democracy. It
is easy to make the charge - and Mr Fujimori has already done so - that the
former diplomat, who has lived most of his life outside Peru, is unfamiliar
with national problems. Mr Perez de Cuellar's retort is, 'I've spent 40
years serving my country, Mr Fujimori four'.
Many observers question whether Mr Perez de Cuellar has the will, or indeed
the physical stamina, for what promises to be a bruising six-month campaign.
Certainly, he seems to have stood up well so far to five weeks' intensive
travelling in the hinterland where, he says, he has found 'vast areas of
poverty. . . (and) a systematic ill-treatment of institutions'.
Although presidential candidates and new movements are now proliferating in
advance of the October 9 deadline for registration, Mr Fujimori remains in
the driving seat. Largely ignoring both his wife and other potential
opponents, he devotes most of his working week to travelling in the
provinces, inaugurating schools and newly-resurfaced roads.
Mr Fujimori acts like a man whose mission to change the face of Peru is
unfulfilled. With undeniable, and concrete, achievements to point to, he
will prove a formidable opponent. Nevertheless, Mr Perez de Cuellar could
prove a welcome alternative for those Peruvians who distrust Mr Fujimori's
authoritarian leanings and disapprove of his 1992 overturning of democracy.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Yeltsin expected to press for Caspian gas rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is expected to argue strongly that Russia
has a strong and legitimate national interest in the exploitation of oil and
gas in the Caspian sea region, during weekend talks with Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, at Chequers, the premier's country retreat, writes
Anthony Robinson. BP and British Gas are among large British companies
negotiating deals in Azerbaijan and elsewhere in oil- and gas-rich former
Soviet central Asia.
Mr Yeltsin is also expected to outline the contents of a policy speech
setting out Russia's attitude towards arms control and security issues,
which he will deliver at the United Nations in New York next week. Mr
Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will hold separate talks on Bosnia
and other international issues with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian
counterpart. Russia's new ambassador to London, Mr Anatoly Adamishin, a
former deputy foreign minister and veteran career diplomat, will take part
in the talks.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Warsaw hotel financing debacle dismays Poles: A row eroding
confidence in foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FFr340m (Pounds 40.8m) hotel financing package put together by Banque
Nationale de Paris four years ago, in the days just after communism had
collapsed in Poland, is coming under attack as it becomes clear the loans
can never be repaid.
Mr Jan Parys, new head of Holding Wars, the Warsaw city council-controlled
company which owns the Mercure hotel in Warsaw, has said the construction
costs of the hotel - built by Compagnie Generale de Batiment Construction
(CBC) of France - were too high and the eight-year loan carrying a fixed 11
per cent interest rate condemned the project to permanent losses.
The three-star, 250-room Mercure is one of the handful of hotels built in
Warsaw over the past four years to cater for businessmen and tourists. This
year it has had an average 70 per cent occupancy rate and expects to earn
FFr45m at an operating cost of FFr22.5m.
However, the terms of the loan, which was guaranteed by Coface, the French
state export credit agency, require the hotel to pay FFr65m a year in
capital and interest payments.
Holding Wars is trying to renegotiate the terms of the loan. Three Polish
banks, including the Bank Handlowy, which ultimately guaranteed the credits,
are negotiating to take over the unpaid portion, worth FFr369m, from BNP.
In the talks with the Polish banks BNP has agreed to waive its FFr29m fee
for early repayment of the loan while Coface will not be asking for its
insurance premium over the eight-year life of the loan to be paid, which
saves another FFr27m. The talks are expected to be completed by the end of
this month.
CBC, which originally held 50 per cent of the equity in the Warsaw Mercure,
withdrew in February. The hotel retains the Pullman franchise but the French
hotel group has also withdrawn from the project. Day-to-day management of
the hotel is now in the hands of Medan, a small French com-pany.
CBC and Pullman were responsible for the original business plan in 1990
which was approved by Coface and the BNP. The French government also
actively promoted the scheme.
Foreign property consultants agree that the project was too expensive and
suggest that the construction costs of a 250-room hotel like the Mercure in
Warsaw should not have been higher than FFr130m for the scheme to be
profitable. 'They didn't know what they were doing when they signed the
deal,' says one.
The debacle threatens Polish confidence in foreign investors.
'Who in 1990 would have questioned a business plan accepted by such renowned
foreign companies?' Mr Parys says ruefully of his predecessors' decision to
go ahead with the project.
The centre is being built by Skanska, the Swedish building company, with the
cost of the first phase set at Dollars 35.5m.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Brussels may act on money transfer charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union banks may face more pressure to limit double charging and
hidden costs on internal cross-border payments and speed the rate at which
they are carried out.
Such pressure, from the European Commission, might take the form of an EU
directive, aimed at easing the costs on consumers and small businesses that
rely on banks to make transfer payments within the EU, and removing an
obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single market.
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single
market, told ministers at a meeting in eastern Germany that the pressure on
banks to stop double charging - imposing fees at the sending and receiving
end of a transfer - had to be stepped up.
However, he sought to allay bank fears by emphasising that any legislation
would not be 'heavy or intrusive' but the minimum necessary.
The need for action follows a survey, ordered by the Commission, which found
that many banks were not complying with EU targets, set at the end of last
year, on double charging, transparency and the time to complete a transfer.
An initial report last year said charges were duplicated in 43 per cent of
transactions. It found that on average a Ecu100 cross-border transaction
cost Ecu20.
Banks were also required to complete the transaction on the first working
day after receiving the request.
Mr Vanni D'Archirafi's inclination to take legislative action is likely to
lead to a row in the Commission. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner
responsible for consumer affairs, believes a voluntary code of conduct for
banks would be more appropriate.
The banking lobby has also mounted an effective campaign against
legislation, arguing that regulation might result in banks withdrawing their
services altogether. They argue that tough requirements on speed might cause
banks to refuse to execute payments to EU countries with less efficient
payment systems.
However, not all banks oppose legislation. Some believe present arrangements
discriminate against banks that stick to the guidelines. They would like
legislation to make standards conform.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Croats reject UN mandate: US Secretary of State Christopher
hesitant over lifting sanctions on Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BELGRADE AND Agencies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Croatian parliament yesterday voted against renewing the mandate of the
UN peacekeepers in Croatia unless the UN forces are given some muscle to
return Serb-held lands to government control.
Separatist Serbs have exploited a stalemate wrought by a UN-policed
ceasefire to cement the breakaway Republic of Serb Krajina, spanning a third
of Croatia's territory, which was seized in a 1991 uprising against
secession from Yugoslavia.
UN troops in Croatia have failed to fulfil their mission to repatriate
refugees to the Serb-held Krajina, disarm its rebels and restore Croatian
sovereignty because they are prohibited from using military force.
Meanwhile the US administration, which is due to receive a visit from
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic today, is backing away from easing
sanctions against Serbia, in a move that could threaten the unity of the
five nations which are working for a peace settlement in Bosnia.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the US did not think the
United Nations Security Council should vote late yesterday on easing
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. 'We think it probably should not be
voted on today,' he said.
But at the United Nations, diplomats from countries belonging to the contact
group on Yugoslavia said US Ambassador Madeleine Albright had agreed for the
vote to go ahead last night as scheduled.
The draft resolution will lift, for a trial period of 100 days the UN bans
on direct flights to Belgrade and on sporting and cultural exchanges.
Diplomats said the US administration remained vulnerable to the pro-Bosnian
lobby in Congress, despite the tightening of military pressure against
Bosnian Serbs that was signalled by Thursday's Nato air strike in the
Sarajevo area.
The air raid was the first time the UN has accepted the idea that attacks on
its own troops should be punished by air raids on targets that had no
involvement in those attacks.
The air raid followed strong pressure from Nato headquarters, and some
intensive private lobbying by senior US politicians and military officers,
for tougher action.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Call to reform French political funding rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the French justice minister, yesterday recommended a
reform of the country's laws concerning political funding, arguing that
businesses should no longer be allowed to finance politicians' electoral
campaigns.
'I think that a new step has to be taken,' he told Le Monde newspaper. 'In
particular, it seems desirable that politicians should be totally
independent of companies for the financing of their campaigns.'
Mr Mehaignerie also raised the need to examine company law. Several
corruption investigations under way relate to the responsibility of chairmen
for the actions of subsidiaries, prompting the minister to question whether
the law was well adapted to the operations of large businesses. He said the
issue would be examined by a three-member commission appointed by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister.
The comments by Mr Mehaignerie come amid a series of corruption
investigations.
The chairmen of some of France's largest business groups, including Saint
Gobain and Schneider, have been placed under investigation for alleged
fraud.
Mr Alain Carignon resigned as communications minister in July after he was
placed under investigation in a case involving allegations of illicit
payments for public works contracts in Grenoble, where he is mayor. This
week an investigating magistrate recommended that Mr Gerard Longuet,
industry minister, should be prosecuted for alleged fraud relating to
payments for the construction of his holiday villa.
Mr Mehaignerie said he had no concrete plans at the moment to introduce a
reform of the party funding laws. 'There is no urgency at the moment. But
the question merits reflection and a large debate.'
He indicated two alternatives to the present system which allows, but
strictly limits, the funds which can be paid by business to political
parties. One would be the establishment of national foundations within
political parties which would act as intermediaries between politicians and
businesses. Another would be the creation of a public political financing
body.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Russian state revenue to fall short by half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The desperately strained condition of the Russian budget was revealed
yesterday by Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, who said
government revenue this year would amount to only Rbs64,000bn. This is a
little over half the planned figure of Rbs124,500bn and a third of planned
expenditure of Rbs194,500bn.
Mr Alexashenko, who with Mr Sergei Dubynin, the acting finance minister,
occupies the hottest seat in the Russian government, said the number of
'dissatisfied' people would be large but that 'the government and within it
the Ministry of Finance intend to adhere strictly to our chosen line - of
restricting inflation and achieving macroeconomic stability'.
He appealed to the parliament to pass the budget for 1995 - which has not
yet been presented to the parliamentary leadership - and said it should not
waste time attempting to revise the 1994 budget, in spite of cuts the
government has made in its spending.
Some opposition leaders have threatened to try to overthrow the government
by blocking next year's budget, which aims for a monthly inflation rate of 3
per cent, while some ministers in the cabinet have argued for extra
expenditure.
Forecasts produced by the Finance Ministry show that industrial output is
expected to be 20 per cent down by the end of this year on 1993 levels - one
of the main reasons for the inability of the state to gather taxes. The
other key reason is the more rapid fall in inflation, to 4 per cent last
month, although Mr Alexashenko expected it to rise to 6-7 per cent this
month.
In a speech in the town of Krasnogorsk yesterday, Mr Oleg Soskovets, first
deputy prime minister, said the government expected the production slump to
slow; he blamed its steepness on deep cuts in military expenditure.
He said expenditure in the defence sector had been reduced by 70 per cent in
the past two and a half years, while general investment in the economy had
been reduced by 65 per cent in the same period.
One of the casualties of the budget cuts this year has been the military,
whose allocation of Rbs40,600bn was reduced to Rbs32,000bn. The daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper reported yesterday that General Pavel Grachev,
defence minister, is to appeal for more funds, basing his case on the
incident earlier this week in which Moscow's main early warning nuclear
facility suffered a cut in electricity because it had not paid its bills.
The arrears in back pay in many sectors would, said Mr Alexander Smirnov,
head of the Finance Ministry's treasury department, be addressed by the
allocation of Rbs1,000bn to a wages fund before the end of the year.

FT  24 SEP 94 / SPD's troika starting to totter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The authority of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) party
leader, was challenged yesterday by his rival-turned-partner, Mr Gerhard
Schroder.
Old rivalries between the two men re-emerged as Mr Schroder demanded an
equal say in negotiations with potential coalition members and the process
of sharing out departmental responsibilities in the event of an SPD victory
in the forthcoming federal elections.
Less than a month before the poll and just three weeks since Mr Scharping
recruited Mr Schroder and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Saarland premier, into a
'troika' to lead the party's campaign, Mr Schroder said it was not
acceptable that 'some have to walk while others ride on horseback'. The
party leader was only 'the first among equals', he said.
Opinion poll results had stabilised since Mr Schroder joined the campaign.
Although the SPD was still trailing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats and their Christian Social Union allies, and SPD supporters should
not raise their hopes too high, this showed the troika was already a
success, Mr Schroder said. It had 'stopped the free-fall' in public opinion
towards the party, he told the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung.
Mr Schroder, who was beaten by Mr Scharping in last year's vote for the
party leadership, had joined the ad hoc leadership team after standing aloof
insisting he would fight on his home ground, Lower Saxony. He said yesterday
the right to an equal say in forming a government was an implicit condition
of his agreeing to join.
He once again staked his claim to a 'super ministry' for economics,
transport and energy. It was 'very likely' he would be granted this range of
responsibilities in any SPD-led coalition, he said.
The attempt to pep up Mr Scharping's conservative style with Mr Schroder's
populist aggression and Mr Lafontaine's charisma was widely interpreted at
the time as a sign the party had accepted its leader stood little chance
alone against Mr Kohl.
Now the risks involved in putting three men with such contrasting styles on
the hustings together appear to be emerging. Mr Schroder was recently seen
on television telling supporters that he and Mr Lafontaine had discussed
which jokes they would tell during the campaign and had decided Mr Scharping
should not be allowed to tell any.
While the trio is due to appear together on several occasions before voting
on October 16 - with one open-air outing booked for next Tuesday in
Frankfurt - media attention is still closely focused on Mr Scharping.
Consistent rather than rousing, he is presenting himself as the man of the
middle ground, mimicking the nothing-disturbs-me style of Mr Kohl, in an
apparent attempt to lure the CDU vote. However, his speeches so far have
shown little variation in tone, content or temper.
Bidding to unseat Mr Kohl who is campaigning for his fourth four-year term
after unseating the SPD's Mr Helmut Schmidt, Mr Scharping refers constantly
to the SPD's hey-day leaders, Mr Willy Brandt and Mr Schmidt, as his role
models.
Mr Schroder, meanwhile, has adopted a characteristically more direct and
aggressive style with direct attacks on the chancellor: 'Kohl and Co are
done for. They have got to go.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Sinn Fein talks may open by Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government might be engaged in preliminary talks with Sinn Fein leaders
by Christmas, Mr John Major, the prime minister, acknowledged yesterday.
His comments came as it emerged at Westminster that the government is
unlikely to insist that all IRA weapons are surrendered in exchange for
allowing Sinn Fein to join political talks on Northern Ireland's future.
Hopes of further progress on the UK-Irish peace initiative were reinforced
by the upbeat tone adopted by the British and Irish governments after the
first meeting under the terms of the Anglo-Irish conference since last
month's IRA ceasefire.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said after his talks with Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, in London that the two
governments were coming closer in their attitude to the ceasefire. He hoped
the two sides would have completed their work on the framework document
designed to inject momentum into political talks involving the province's
main political parties 'long before' Christmas.
Questioned on the prospects for talks between the government and Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, Mr Major noted that republican leaders had still
not provided sufficient assurances that the IRA had renounced violence for
good.
But if the assurances demanded by the government were given without delay,
'clearly we could be talking at or around Christmas-time', he said.
Yesterday's developments came on the eve of the arrival in Boston of Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president.
London has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to
the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA
violence. The ground covered would include what to do about the IRA's
extensive armoury.
Anything short of a full surrender of IRA weapons would probably disappoint
unionists, many of whom remain profoundly suspicious of the IRA's
intentions.
According to Whitehall officials, London is unlikely to regard a refusal by
republican leaders to guarantee that all IRA weapons have been handed in as
a potential deal-breaker.
There is widespread acceptance, however, that London is likely to take a
much tougher line over caches of explosives and military equipment such as
semi-automatic rifles and rocket launchers.
That is the minimum that would be demanded by the moderate unionists whom it
is vital for London to keep on board.
According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, there is
'no way in which the UUP could recognise Sinn Fein as a normal democratic
political party . . . until those guns are accounted for'.
Questioned on the issue yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew said nobody who had
given up violence had 'any possible need for these things'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Ukraine and IMF agree initial deal over economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine reached preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund
yesterday on a programme of radical economic reforms that may release an
initial Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) in aid next month.
The deal with the IMF, the first since Ukraine declared independence just
over three years ago, may be a watershed in the country's economic
development.
Under former president Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine became one of the most
economically depressed republics of the former Soviet Union. The new
president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, has promised comprehensive economic reforms,
and yesterday's agreement suggests that his government is prepared to live
up to his word.
According to Mr Viktor Yushchenko, the reformist chairman of the Ukrainian
central bank, who took part in the negotiations, Ukraine has agreed to keep
its budget deficit to 10 per cent of GDP.
IMF officials said the accord called for a tight fiscal policy, price
liberalisation, liberalisation of Ukraine's foreign trade, rapid structural
reform, such as privatisation, and the creation of a safety net to shield
the poor.
If the preliminary agreement is ratified next week by the board of the IMF
and the Ukrainian leadership, it may pave the way for substantial western
assistance. IMF officials said they could begin negotiating a standby
agreement with Ukraine, which might release as much as Dollars 1.24bn, early
next year. This summer the Group of Seven leading industrial nations
promised Ukraine Dollars 4bn in aid if the country began serious reforms.
'This is a ground-breaking agreement,' said Mr Lawrence DeMilnar, resident
representative for the IMF in Ukraine.
Mr Yushchenko said: 'This is the beginning of real steps toward economic
reform', adding that the president was '100 per cent' behind the IMF deal
and the reform process. He also predicted that initial opponents of market
reforms in Ukraine in the cabinet of ministers and the communist-dominated
parliament would support the deal, which, he said, had created 'an
unprecedented political consensus on the need for reforms in Ukraine'.
Mr Yushchenko said that Mr Vitalii Masol, the Ukrainian prime minister, was
likely to sign the agreement with the IMF.
The agreement with the IMF, and the brightened prospect for reforms in
Ukraine, suggest that the country's provincial and often instinctively
conservative political elites have realised that without an improvement in
Ukraine's collapsing economy the nation is unlikely to survive as an
independent state.
Professor Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who has been advising the
government, said that 'there is now the best chance yet for a commitment to
reform. There is now the clear will to move forward'.
He said that because of greater social stability and less crime the
prospects for reform 'are in some ways better than in Russia'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Inflation fears spark surge in commodity prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity prices surged again yesterday as investors continued to buy
precious and base metals as a hedge against the risk of inflation.
Gold closed in London at a 13- month high of Dollars 396 an ounce, with
traders reporting buying interest from US institutions.
Mr Andrew Smith, metals analyst at UBS, said the substantial increase in
speculative interest in gold was similar to the buying spree when hedge fund
investor Mr George Soros announced his gold purchases in 1993.
Silver closed at Dollars 5.71 an ounce, up 6 per cent on the week and close
to its high for the year. Base metal prices also rose, with copper and
aluminium recording their highest closing prices since 1992 and 1991
respectively.
The Economist commodity price index is up 41.8 per cent over the year, in
dollar terms. Higher commodity prices increase industry's costs, although
competitive pressures mean they cannot necessarily be passed on to consumers
in the form of higher retail prices.
Fears that inflation is on the rise have increased this year in the face of
strong economic growth in the US and recovery in Europe. Bond yields have
risen to reflect the perceived inflationary risks and several countries have
raised interest rates in pre-emptive strikes against inflation.
Equity prices have also been affected by inflationary fears. Earlier this
week, the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its biggest one-day fall, in
response to poor trade figures and market fears about US inflation.
Stock markets were generally quiet yesterday. The FT-SE 100 index closed up
7 at 3,028.2 while the Dow Jones industrial average ended 5.38 lower at
3,831.75.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK growth hits six-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy grew at its fastest rate for six years in the second quarter
of this year, while the balance-of-payments deficit fell to its lowest level
since 1987. The figures provide further evidence for the increasingly
healthy nature of the recovery.
Household budgets suffered, though, as the recent tax rises contributed to
the sharpest quarterly fall in the level of personal disposable incomes for
15 years.
The squeeze on consumers may explain why economic growth has not yet
translated into a widespread 'feelgood' factor. However, statistics from the
Central Statistical Office yesterday also suggested that economic recovery
was now being 're-balanced', away from consumer-led growth and towards a
more healthy export and industry-driven recovery.
Gross domestic product was 1.1 per cent higher in the second quarter of the
year, compared with the first quarter, and 3.8 per cent higher than in the
same period a year ago.
The figure was higher than the government's previous estimates of
year-on-year growth of 3.7 per cent, and faster than most previous City
estimates. Although many economists believe growth will moderate this year,
the unexpected strength of the recovery provides further support for the
government's controversial decision to raise bank base rates to 5.75 per
cent to reduce any inflation pressures created by this rapid expansion.
In another fillip for the government, the UK current-account deficit
narrowed in the second quarter of the year to Pounds 700m as exports rose,
imports fell slightly, and overseas investment flowed into Britain. The drop
was welcomed by the City, where many economists had feared that the deficit
would worsen dramatically this year as growing demand sucked in imports.
The Treasury dubbed the figures 'very encouraging'. The rapid surge in
exports, officials noted, suggested that UK manufacturers were becoming
increasingly competitive and may be reaping the benefits of sterling's
devaluation after the UK's exit from the European Exchange Rate mechanism in
1992.
One beneficiary was the corporate sector, which reported record levels of
profit and financial surplus in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, real personal disposable income, measured in current prices, fell
1.8 per cent between the first and second quarters - the fastest quarterly
drop since 1981. Compared with the same period a year ago, disposable
incomes were 1.2 per cent lower. The CSO said the fall reflected tax rises
and a small overall drop in employment incomes.
The population responded by reducing spending and saving, and increasing
borrowing. The personal-sector savings ratio fell to 9.3 per cent in the
second quarter of the year, from 11 per cent in the first quarter - the
largest quarterly drop for eight years. Total consumer spending growth
slowed to 0.2 per cent between the first and second quarters, down from the
government's previous estimate of 0.4 per cent growth.
The squeeze on household incomes may add to political pressure on Mr Kenneth
Clarke to hold back from further tax measures in the November budget, amid
Conservative party concerns that the recent economic growth has not
translated into greater political support for the government.
Nevertheless, City economists argued that although consumer spending was
likely to fall further this year, the growth in exports would more than
offset that, creating a healthier and more sustainable recovery.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (14): Confidence
in UK regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The venture capital sector in Britain's regions has a self-confidence bred
by its close connections with the areas in which it operates.
There is no substitute, argue those with offices in the country's leading
provincial cities, for being part of the business community in which they
are seeking investment opportunities.
Unsurprisingly, this view is not supported by firms like Charterhouse
Development Capital, which has opted to target Yorkshire, the Midlands and
south-west England by setting up dedicated teams based in London, but
commuting constantly to the regions - 'we're only two hours from London to
Leeds by train,' says the firm.
In contrast, Barclays Development Capital which in 1987 had only a London
office has since opened in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Reading; 70 per
cent of its new investments are made by these regional offices.
'In our view, key intermediaries such as accountants have built up
significant corporate finance expertise in the regions and by being in the
same centres as they are we feel we offer a faster, more responsive
service,' says Mrs Catherine Wall, the Leeds-based regional director for
eastern England from Lincolnshire to the Tweed, plus Cumbria.
In illustration of how regional expertise has developed, she cites last
year's MBO of Leyland Trucks, the Pounds 150m annual turnover Lancashire
truck assembly plant. The deal was advised and funded from Leeds.
'A few years ago, a deal of this size and complexity would have been handled
in London,' says Mrs Wall.
Some regionally-based venture capitalists feel their forte remains deals
under Pounds 10m, but Mr Charles Richardson, corporate affairs manager of
3i, which has 17 offices outside London, says there has been a continuing
trend towards medium sized and larger deals gravitating to regional offices
 -'over the last five years we've moved a lot of technical expertise into
regional offices; the net has widened.'
Stoy Hayward Manchester now publishes an annual Guide to Venture and Buy-out
Capital in the north west; the 1994 edition is due out imminently.
Mr Ian Templeton, Manchester-based senior partner in charge of corporate
finance, has noticed an increase in the number of accountancy firms claiming
expertise in venture and development capital 'possibly because there is very
little growth in the core activities of audit and tax which is forcing them
to look elsewhere for business.'
Mr Mike Davis, corporate finance partner for Ernst &amp; Young in Manchester,
says clients are very interested in what kind of relationship they will have
with venture capital investors. This does not necessarily mean choosing a
firm with a regional office but it has made London firms anxious to rebut
any suggestion they might not be as responsive.
The competition between London and the regions 'has hotted up a lot,' says
Mr Davis, who adds that accountants are helping venture capitalists by
providing better researched and presented proposals for consideration. But
he adds: 'We know there's a degree of flexibility, we know they are keen to
do deals, we make sure our clients get the best deal.'
This wider dissemination of skills in venture capital has contributed to the
rather more competitive climate, says Mr Peter Folkman, managing director of
North of England Ventures, the Manchester and Middlesbrough based fund which
is associated with Schroder Ventures. The industry, he points out, is now
maturing.
'It's a whole lot less cosy, it's more like a proper business,' he says. 'To
earn our living we are going to have to be a little bit sharper.'
The past year has seen funds winning good returns on earlier investments;
NEV, for example, is collecting about Pounds 9m from the Pounds 850,000
equity stake it made in 1990 in Cumbrian miniature model-maker Lilliput
Lane. But, says Mr Folkman, venture capitalists have done fewer new deals
than they would have liked. In this more competitive market, he sees a
developing trend, in which he is participating, of venture capitalists going
out much more pro-actively to bid as principals for companies.
Competition is likely to be stiffened by the sharp increase recorded by the
BVCA in new money raised this year for venture capital investment.
The BVCA says the UK regions accounted in 1993 for 64 per cent of the number
of companies receiving venture capital funding. So far this year it has
recorded an upturn in England and Wales, whilst the Scottish market is
reported to be 'relatively flat,' although with some signs of improvement.
Some venture capitalists say the number of deals regionally so far this year
has been relatively stable, or even increasing. Mr Alistair Conn, managing
director of Newcastle-based Northern Venture Managers, says 1994 has been
busier than 1993, although mid-1994 dipped a little. In northern England and
Scotland, he says, the peaks and the troughs are flatter than in London and
the south east.
Mrs Wall at Barclays Development Capital says its investments are running at
around double last year's level, and 3i notes its local offices are much
busier than they were - 'my impression is that the regions have picked up
faster than London and the south-east,' says Mr Richardson.
Despite this bullish tone, there is some surprise that the presumed uplift
from recession has not brought a stronger demand for capital for investment
in organic growth rather than acquisitions. Confidence, it seems, is still
fragile.
'A lot of companies are contemplating deals, far more are contemplating
rather than doing them because people are still being cautious,' says Mr
Davis of Ernst &amp; Young.
For one new regional venture capital initiative, the Midland Enterprise
Funds, 1994 is a milestone; by the year end, all its 11 funds in England and
Wales will have begun operating.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (13): Rich angels
to the rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British business angels have long been assumed to be poor cousins of the
richer, more entrepreneurial and better-served American variety, but a new
report challenges this assumption.
Patrick Coveney, a PhD student at Oxford collected data from about 500
angels or would-be angels, in a survey conducted with the help of Venture
Capital Report, a business angel agency which publishes a monthly report on
projects seeking finance. Angels in the sample were all users of or people
who had expressed interest in using introduction agencies.
The researchers concluded that British angels were richer, invested more and
were more like their American counterparts than previously depicted.
The survey found that while in some ways the angels did fit the
long-standing stereotype - they were overwhelmingly male, middle-aged,
university educated and had run their own businesses - their characteristics
and investment behaviour differed quite considerably from the image given by
earlier research on the subject.
More than half had a net worth of more than Pounds 500,000, and 30 per cent
were worth more than Pounds 1m - but two earlier surveys had found that only
a third or fewer had assets of more than Pounds 500,000.
Three-quarters of the participants in the new survey had a income of more
than Pounds 100,000 a year. The average angel had made 2.34 investments
totalling Pounds 266,000 in the past three years, with an average single
investment of Pounds 140,000, and a median of Pounds 40,000. This compares
with the average investment of Pounds 10,000 given by an earlier survey.
Previous surveys strongly indicated that location was one of the most
important factors in angels' choice of investment - very few were thought
willing to invest in companies more than 100 miles away. Coveney's survey,
in contrast, found that only 5 per cent of angels cited location as the most
vital criterion, while 58 per cent did not think it was very important.
Almost half would invest in businesses more than 200 miles away.
The most important factor in angels' decision on whether or not to invest
was their impression of the founder or management: 59 per cent said this was
the principal criterion. Next most important was their own understanding of
the sector, with such areas as the content and presentation of business
plans and projected profitability ranking much lower.
Respondents' main motivation for choosing angel-style investment was to get
a better return on their money than they could from the stock market - they
expected a return of at least 21 per cent a year. About a third were
interested in generating a job or an income for themselves, and a third were
also motivated by the fun and satisfaction of being an angel.
Investors said that the main barrier to greater activity was a lack of
suitable business proposals, rather than a lack of money to invest: 70 per
cent of them would have liked to make more investments if they had found
suitable opportunities. A high proportion said they had more than Pounds
100,000 of funds still available to invest, and 76 per cent expected to
increase their investments over the next five years.
So there may be hundreds of potential angels waiting for the right
opportunity to come up, but are there as many businesses interested in
dealing with angels? The Enterprise Support Group commissioned a Mori survey
of of small and medium businesses earlier this year, to coincide with the
launch of VentureList, its national computer database of investors and
business propositions.
The survey found that only 8 per cent of small and medium sized businesses
had seriously considered using angels as a source of finance, even though
many were worried about the level of debt in their businesses. However, 40
per cent would consider raising finance from an individual investor if there
was an easy way of finding an angel willing to invest on agreed terms.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (7): Key
structural changes ahead - France, the second biggest venture capital base
in Europe, after the UK / The French venture capital industry is emerging in
relatively buoyant shape from one of the country's most acute recessions
since the Second World War

The total value of venture capital raised last year amounted to FFr5.54bn, a
drop of just six per cent on 1992. Venture capital investments slipped by 10
per cent to FFr6bn, while exits - or divestments of venture capital
investments - rose sharply, from FFr2.26bn to FFr3.63bn.
For Mr Denis Mortier, chairman of the French venture capital association,
this was a solid performance - 'on the whole, and given the broader economic
environment, I think the industry did better than expected,' he says.
Despite the resilience of 1993, however, the French venture capital industry
has been experiencing significant changes and is confronted by important
structural challenges.
Developments over the next few years, notably in mechanisms for exits and
the evolution of fund raising, will determine whether France can consolidate
its position as the second biggest venture capital base in Europe, after the
UK.
The principal shifts in the industry relate partly to the broader economic
picture. Start-up investments, notably in high-technology activities, were
affected by the economic environment - 'seed investments accounted for only
one-tenth of one per cent and start-up investments for less than two per
cent of the total amount invested,' say the accountants KPMG, in a report on
the industry.
Many of the larger players, in particular banks and insurance companies,
have also curbed their venture capital activities as they seek to redress
their financial positions.
'Insurance companies have suffered from losses in their damage businesses
and have shifted the emphasis of their investments to liquid long-term
assets such as bonds,' says one sector analyst in Paris. Many of the leading
banks - seeking to offset losses from the property sector and from other bad
loans - have reduced their involvement in private equity investment, he
adds.
The shift in strategy is most clearly indicated by Credit Lyonnais, the
state-owned bank which suffered losses of more than FFr6bn last year. The
bank, traditionally a big player in the venture capital industry, has
reduced its investments in industry to raise capital and to concentrate on
its core activities.
According to a report by KPMG, the accountancy group, and the European
Venture Capital Association, the decline in venture capital funds raised
last year was mainly due to the reduced contribution of the banks.
'The total amount raised from banks fell by almost FFr500nm in 1993,' says
the report, 'although with 31 per cent of the total venture capital raised,
they remain the most important source of funds for the French industry.'
At the same time, many industrial groups are shedding non-core businesses
and venture capital investments as they focus on their principal activities.
The most recent example is July's decision by Elf Aquitaine, the oil group,
to sell FFr1.1bn worth of industrial investments, principally venture
capital, to Banque Nationale de Paris.
For some players in the venture capital industry, in particular the smaller,
independent funds, these various changes have a positive effect. 'There has
been less competition from the captive structures,' says Mr Mortier,
referring to banks and insurance companies. 'At the same time, the pattern
of divestments means that they have become providers of investments.'
Competition is, however, unlikely to remain diminished. International
venture capital funds, notably from the UK, are eyeing the French market
with a view to increasing their presence - 'they are all raising funds for
continental Europe,' says Mr Mortier. 'France is the second biggest market
and the natural target to start with.'
The domestic industry will be more eagerly awaiting the imposition of
structural reforms which could improve the exit mechanisms in the French
industry and increase the amount of investment finance available.
On the first count, many in the French industry have pushed for the creation
of a 'European Nasdaq' - a computerised off-market trading system. They
argue that this would resolve the weaknesses of Europe's secondary stock
markets, raise liquidity and tempt international investors, particularly
from the US.
Mr Mortier believes that the creation of such an exchange is just a question
of time: 'We have created the awareness of a need and have won support for
the idea from the European Commission. We have put together a study group to
examine the conditions necessary, and hope to have a blueprint ready by
November,' he says. 'By 1996, we hope to that the market can be launched.'
By then, many in the French venture capital industry also hope that private,
capitalised, pension funds will be in existence. According to most players
in the domestic industry, the relative paucity of venture capital resources
in France, compared with the UK, is partly a reflection of the lack of
powerful pension funds.
That lack seems unlikely to endure. The French government is moving, albeit
cautiously, to the creation of private pension funds to ease the demographic
pressures on its creaking pay-as-you-go state retirement scheme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, is expected to introduce a bill
to the national assembly this autumn, and a law, providing tax incentives
for private pension contributions, could take effect after next spring's
presidential elections.
It is still unclear what the legal restrictions on such pension funds would
be, and what proportion could be invested in equities or venture capital.
But the impact would be significant. Mr Mortier forecasts that pension funds
could provide one-quarter to one-third of external venture capital funds
within ten years, compared with the 45 per cent ratio which now exists in
the UK.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (12): Mittelstand
need persuading - Germany, opportunity knocks but not every company is
answering the call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you ask Mr Holger Frommann why the German venture capital market is so
small, he winces audibly.
Mr Frommann runs the German Venture Capital Association (BVK) and he says
there are countless reasons why the volume of business done in Germany is
minimal compared, first, to the size of the German economy and, second, to
activity in neighbouring France and the UK.
Venture capital risk is still something many German businessmen shy from.
The medium-sized companies that would be ideal candidates for buy-outs or
buy-ins are often run by the people who founded them and who are wary of
financial buyers. Stock markets function differently and banks are much more
prominent - 'ultimately, the entire economic development of Germany is
different,' Mr Frommann says.
The recession has not helped either. A report by the European Venture
Capital Association (EVCA) concludes that in 1993 the market ground to a
halt because of falling company prices and a declining economy: DM1.21bn was
invested in 1993 - 5 per cent less than a year earlier - representing about
40 per cent of what was invested in the UK.
However, a series of big deals this year - including the recent sale of
Kassbohrer's Pisten Bully to a group of investors advised by Schroders &amp;
Partner Beteiligungsberatung - suggest that while the market may not
mushroom there is evidence of relatively strong growth.
The Kassbohrer sale is the sort of deal which venture capitalists promised
in in spades when the German market first found its feet around 1989: to
help old, family-owned companies suffocating under a mountain of debt and in
need of outside capital.
The BVK says there are perhaps 5,000 companies of this sort and a percentage
of them would be ripe for venture capital. But financial buyers are still
regarded as wheeler-dealers, whose philosophy is largely anathema to the
long-term corporate strategy practised in Germany where emphasis has always
been more on organic growth than on acquisitions.
'Owners often still want to know what happens to their business even if
they've sold it,' says one industry source in Frankfurt, illustrating
barriers the venture capital business has to overcome.
Another phenomenon cited to justify the rosy prospects for venture capital
in Germany is the question of succession at many Mittelstand, or
medium-sized companies, started in the 1950s or '60s by people now looking
to hand them on.
However, in some instances it is not just a question of finding a new chief
executive and outside capital, but more a need to find an entirely new
management team.
'In a situation like that the pure financial buyer is challenged,' says Mr
Martin Stringfellow who works for Kleinwort Benson in Frankfurt. 'Whether he
comes in depends on how able he is to provide a management team for the
company and often that is a problem.'
Industry observers say there are interesting prospects in eastern Germany as
restructuring continues and it becomes clear which elements of the DDR's
former command economy have survived the shock therapy administered over the
past four years.
But Mr Frommann and others admit that business in the five eastern Lander
remains largely prospective for a number of reasons.
Risks in the eastern Lander are greater because there are no balance sheets
from which to extract reliable figures, while the business environment
remains precarious - in part because many companies are only just finding
new markets following the collapse of the former Soviet-run Comecom trading
bloc. And while the BVK estimates that venture capital companies in western
Germany spend on average seven years shepherding their investments, they
will have to commit themselves for longer periods in former eastern Germany.
An under-developed stock exchange is another factor which has stunted the
growth of the market.
Many US and UK companies which have been helped to find their feet with
venture capital, progress naturally to a stock exchange listing, an exit
which is still unusual in Germany where stock exchanges deal in heavy-weight
shares.
Deutsche Beteiligungsgesellschaft, the venture capital arm of Deutsche Bank
and an example of several similar companies which are linked to the
country's big banks, recently floated the MHM Mode Holding. But such an
outcome is the exception rather than the rule. The vast majority of
investments end in trade sale, buy-back or secondary purchase, according to
the EVCA report.
Despite the idiosyncrasies of the German market, venture capital is becoming
more respectable in deals involving DM30m or more, a threshold beneath which
most international financial buyers do not operate.
Even so, money for start-ups and smaller deals is still hard to come by,
especially for smaller businesses which only have access to the regional
financial centres in Germany.
To combat this, the economics ministry in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg,
often at the leading edge of innovation in German business practices, is
developing a new venture capital fund in conjunction with private industry
designed to finance start-ups with up to DM2m. For years the state has been
running a successful subsidies programme, similar to those available in
Germany's other Lander, but the state-run funds have not been able to cater
for all the applicants. 'It suggests very clearly to us that people are not
prepared to take enough risks,' says an official at the Baden-Wurttemberg
economics ministry.
Several of the larger international venture capital companies have been
encouraged by the volume of business so far this year. The Kassbohrer deal,
the Tarkett buy-out and the restructuring at LVW, the former food
co-operative group, all augur well for the future, they argue.
However, few will commit themselves to predictions about the possible future
size of the market, and most suggest that it will continue to be small
relative to others - 'I don't think we will ever have a development in
Germany as we have seen in the US or the UK,' says Mr Thomas Krenz from
Schroders &amp; Partner Beteiligungsberatung in Frankfurt.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (10): A language
all its own - Buzzwords in Brief / The venture capital industry, like any
other has its own jargon, some of it unprintable. Here, however, is Richard
Gourlay's selection of expressions to help companies seeking capital through
the linguistic maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bimbo: Buy-in management buy-out. A hybrid between buy-in and buy-out where
the venture capitalist will inject their own management team alongside
existing managers.
Burn rate: the rate at which a business uses up the funds it raises. Many
bio-technology companies burn cash particularly fast.
Business angel: private investor who finances small companies and sometimes
gives them the benefit of his or her expertise. The best angels are those
who have been in business and have advice worth hearing.
Business plan: the document put together by managers to justify their
application to financiers for backing.
A good plan should contain summaries of past and projected profit and loss
accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. Also details of products and
services, markets, future strategy and profiles of the managers. A simple
rule: rarely will life turn out as forecast in the business plan.
Captive funds: venture capital organisations which form part of larger
financial services groups. Usually they do not raise their own discrete
funds but draw on the resources of their parents.
Carried interest: the share in the proceeds of sale of an investee company
that is kept by the venture capitalist.
Corporate venturing: the practice of a large company taking an equity stake
or establishing a joint venture with a smaller business to benefit from the
smaller firm's specialist expertise. The large firm can provide finance,
management back-up and distribution outlets which would not be available to
the smaller partner.
Deal flow: the number of investment propositions which come to the venture
capitalist. What matters is quality not quantity.
Development capital: later stage venture capital invested when the business
has become established and needs extra funds for expansion.
Enterprise investment scheme: the replacement for the government's
discredited Business Expansion Scheme, the EIS gives front-end tax relief of
20 per cent for certain investments in certain companies as well as
exemption from any capital gains. Unlike under the BES, investors can take
an active part in EIS companies.
Exit: the way a venture capitalist realises all or part of an investment by
either arranging a flotation of the company or selling it to another company
or trade buyer. A growing range of exits is becoming available and the list
also includes a refinancing of the company by another group of venture
capitalists or the purchase of all the shares by the company's own
management.
Hands on/hands off: some venture capitalists take a very close interest in
their investee companies and will provide management expertise. Others, like
3i, monitor, but let the management get own with it.
Hurdle rates: institutional investors have grown restive at the fees venture
capitalists earn and have started to insist that funds achieve a basic
return before managers can claim their carried interest. They often set
hurdles based on a return on gilts or one of the leading stock market
indexes and are beginning to look at more demanding hurdle measures like the
FT-SE All share performance.
Independent funds: these do not form part of larger financial groups. They
raise their money from institutional and other investors.
Internal rate of return (IRR): different people calculate this in different
ways but it basically means the compound annual rate of return to the
investor. It includes dividend distributions and profits from disposals or
the profits shown on a fair valuation of an investee company. Inevitably,
venture capitalists differ over when investments should be written down, up
or off, so the figures are rarely strictly comparable.
Lemons and plums: bad investments invariably go wrong before the good ones
produce profits. The lemons usually ripen before the plums.
Living dead: a portfolio company which is just about trading profitably but
which shows little sign of ever meeting the venture capitalist's early high
expectations.
Management buy-in: the purchase of a business by an outside manager or team
of managers with the help of a group of financial backers.
Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its existing management
with the help of a group of financial backers. Most of the equity comes from
the venture capitalist or other financial backer. The management puts up a
small amount of finance for a disproportionately large percentage of the
equity.
Recovery or turnaround financing: supplied to companies in difficulties
where the venture capitalist sees an opportunity to beef up or change the
management and return the company to profits. Some venture capitalists have
employed insolvency specialists to identify such investments.
Refinancing: can be a sign of either failure or success. If a company
performs poorly it may need an extra injection of funds. Equally, if it does
very well, the management may be able to refinance the business on terms
more favourable to themselves with their original venture capital backers.
Replacement capital: funds provided to allow an existing shareholder to sell
some or all of his shares.
Second-round financing: venture capitalists rarely expect the first
injection of funds to meet a business's needs. A second or even a third
round of funding will almost certainly be needed later as the business grows
or unforeseen problems arise. At this stage the original venture capital
investor may reduce his holding and bring in others to spread the risk.
Seed capital: usually quite small amounts of capital provided to turn a good
idea into a marketable product or service. This can be the riskiest form of
venture capital since the concept, the technology, the entrepreneur and the
market are all unproven.
Spin-out: a new company set up by a larger established group to exploit new
developments or fresh market opportunities and in which the management team
and a venture capital backer also take equity stakes.
Star: a company which is so successful that it pays for all the failures and
humdrum performers in the venture capitalist's portfolio.
Sweet equity: the extra percentage of a company's equity which is allocated
to the managers over and above the shareholding which their own relatively
modest financial investment would qualify them for. The extra shares are
seen as an additional motivation and reflect the fact that it is the
managers' hard work which will ultimately make the venture succeed.
(Sometimes also referred to as sweat equity to reflect the hard work the
managers put in).
Trade sale: the sale of a company to a corporate buyer. This is the most
common exit route for venture capital backed companies.
Venture capital: equity finance provided usually to young, unquoted
businesses to enable them to start or expand. Equity funds provide a basis
for the company to raise further bank finance and provide a cheap source of
funds in the early stages of the business because dividends can be delayed
until the company starts making profits.
Virgin angel: a business angel who has not invested in private companies
before.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (9): Plans face
heavy criticism - Apprehension over the UK's new-style venture capital
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the the UK's chancellor announced a new type of venture capital trust
with tax-free returns for investors in his last Budget, the venture capital
and investment industry was delighted.
The new trusts seemed to be offering a solution to the long-standing problem
of the 'equity gap', first identified more than half a century ago - the
gulf between the small amounts of short-term loan finance offered to small
businesses by banks, and the substantial amounts of long-term capital
available to larger, more established companies.
But since details of the proposed trusts' likely structure were published in
a consultative document this spring, the chancellor's plans have come in for
heavy criticism.
The industry's clamour for changes in the draft rules has centred on two
issues: the tax incentives offered to investors, and the restrictions on the
size of target companies and the maximum investment allowed in each company.
The Inland Revenue discussion document proposes that dividends and capital
gains from venture capital trusts should be tax-free, but there should be no
up-front relief, and losses should not be allowable against tax. This would
put VCTs on a level with personal equity plans, except that the maximum
investment by each individual would probably be about Pounds 100,000 a year,
rather than the Pounds 9,000 annual Pep limit.
So far, the venture capital section of the investment trust industry has not
benefited from the massive popularity of using personal equity plans to
invest in collective funds. Venture capital trusts are usually excluded from
Pep investment by rules stipulating that at least half the fund must be
invested in ordinary shares in listed companies. Venture capital funds by
their very nature invest largely in unquoted companies, and often provide
debt rather than equity finance.
As Peps are aimed mainly at small-scale investors, this has not been too big
a problem - anyone investing in venture capital should have a broad enough
portfolio that they can use up their annual Pep allowance in other ways.
However, VCTs want to attract a larger, wealthier type of investor, and the
industry believes that more sweeteners are needed to make investors stomach
the extra risk.
One favoured solution would be for venture capital trusts to be classified
as unquoted companies for the purpose of qualifying for reinvestment relief
from capital gains tax - the last Budget introduced a scheme whereby
individuals disposing of other investments, from shares to second homes, can
postpone the capital gains tax bill by reinvesting the proceeds in unquoted
trading companies.
Another popular option would be to give VCTs the same tax breaks as the
enterprise investment scheme, which offers 20 per cent up-front tax relief,
and allows losses to be offset against income or capital gains tax.
The industry is united in its demand for better tax breaks, but there is
less agreement on whether the limits on size of investment and size of
company should be changed. The Inland Revenue's consultative document
suggests that there should be a limit on investment in any one company of
Pounds 1m a year, and target companies should have assets of less than
Pounds 10m to qualify - 'the scheme's aims would not be served if funds were
diverted into very large unlisted companies,' the document says.
But venture capitalists and investment trust managers have been bombarding
the Inland Revenue with submissions on how the limits on the size of
investment will mean it will not be worth fund managers' while to run such
trusts, because researching small companies thoroughly for the sake of an
investment of less than Pounds 1m would cost far too much.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies, for example, has submitted a
demand that the limit for each investment should be raised from Pounds 1m to
Pounds 3m (with a requirement that at least 20 per cent should be of less
than Pounds 1m), and the size of potential target companies should be
increased to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
'The lower limits proposed in the consultative document would generate
uncommercial administrative and management costs,' the AITC said.
The opposite view is put by Mr Ian Tulloch, a director of Glasgow-based fund
managers Murray Johnstone. He believes that allowing larger investments
would make managers concentrate on the more cost-effective upper end of the
scale, and would work against the principal objective of the trusts, which
is to help bridge the equity gap - 'VCTs should be used to support small and
medium-sized companies, not medium sized companies only,' he says, as small
companies seeking injections of more than Pounds 1m are already well-served
by current sources of venture capital.
Mr Gilbert Chalk, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association's
taxation committee, proposes that as an alternative to giving investors 20
per cent tax relief, the trusts themselves could be given a 20 per cent
incentive on investments of less than Pounds 500,000, to encourage trusts to
focus on companies at the smaller end of the scale.
The research involved in making small investments in very small companies
might be too expensive for London firms with high overheads, says Mr
Tulloch, but he believes that regional venture capital managers with lower
costs and better links to local businesses would have no problem with
operating venture capital trusts using the lower limits.
'Provided that the tax incentives are such that we believe we can attract
money, we would be very interested in running a venture capital trust.' He
also suggests the development of partnerships and co-investment arrangements
between venture capitalists and business angels, which would help spread the
burden of costs.
Responses to the consultative document are now under consideration by
ministers. The final form for the new trusts will not be announced until
later this autumn, possibly in the next Budget.
There is a strong belief within the industry that the Inland Revenue will
make some concessions in line with submissions - the most likely is thought
to be allowing the trusts to qualify for roll-over capital gains tax relief
 -but there is still apprehension in some quarters over whether the
concessions will go far enough.
The extent of the revenue's generosity will determine whether VCTs develop
into a sturdy bridge across the equity gap, or just another lifeline to a
lucky few businesses.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (8): Fresh US
capital in fewer, larger funds - A record-breaking year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US venture capital industry, which was becalmed for lack of funds in the
early 1990s, is once again racing away on a following wind.
In the first half of 1994, US venture capital funds raised Dollars 1.88bn, a
45 per cent increase over the same period last year, according to Venture
Economics, the New Jersey-based information service. This is more than was
raised in the record-breaking 1994 fund-raising round and only Dollars 660m
short of the total raised in 1993.
What is more, this year's fund raising was achieved by 35 venture
capitalists, nearly half the number who raised the capital in 1984,
confirming the industry's move towards raising larger funds.
With more funds available, the question facing venture capitalists is where
the capital will be invested and how quickly. Implicit in this question is
whether the US venture capital industry has matured since the 1980s and will
better manage the new funds.
Looming over the industry is the fact that the market for initial public
offerings is not as encouraging as even six months ago. During the first
half of 1994, 79 venture backed companies went public with a value of
Dollars 2.12bn, up on the same period last year, according to VentureOne, a
San Francisco-based research organisation. But venture capitalists say the
figures are deceptive and that the market is sagging.
According to VentureOne, it is also becoming for expensive for venture
backed companies to raise capital through an IPO. While in 1992, companies
needed to sell on average 1.6 per cent of their equity for every million
dollars raised, that figure has jumped to 2 per cent in the first half of
1994. This effectively means the cost of raising capital through an IPO has
risen by 25 per cent, making it less attractive to float at the moment.
What is more, the recently floated venture-backed companies are not
performing as well as they have done in the past year in the after-market,
barely posting gains over their issue price on average, compared with an 18
per cent increase last year. Venture capitalists are therefore accepting
they will need to build more companies rather than seek a more immediate
IPO.
The concentration of fresh capital in fewer, larger funds, threatens to
increase competition in the larger deals. Some observers say more cash will
be chasing a similar number of deals, with the effect that rates of return
will fall and more debt will begin to creep back into deal structures.
The fear is that venture capitalists will feel they have to put money to
work, irrespective of the prices they pay and the quality of the deals they
are currently seeing.
Alan Patricof, chairman of Patricof and Company, the US member of Apax
Partners, thinks these fears are over done. 'There is a much more mature
attitude to pricing, more disciplined pricing,' he says. 'I see very little
sign of extreme valuations.'
He believes the industry has matured since the 1980s - 'there is no question
that there is a maturing in the industry,' he says.
'There are a lot more experienced people who have been around since the
early '80s, there are bigger firms that are better staffed.'
The competition means there will be more need for venture capitalists to
differentiate their product. More funds will be backing turnarounds and
distressed private and public companies, says Bob Johnston, president of
Beacon Hill Financial, a Boston-based agency that specialises in raising
funds.
But while specialists and well-known individuals will always be able to
raise early stage seed funds, there is a move towards investing in later
stage companies, says Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture Economics.
Whereas in the early 1980s many funds became interested in early stage
investments and start-ups, they are doing more later stage growth capital
for companies already making profits.
This could become a problem for early stage funds even though the large
state pension funds, which are increasingly allocating funds to the asset
class, frequently say they want to support early stage development capital.
'They say they are firmly committed to early stage development capital - but
there are not a lot of Dollars 100m early stage seed funds around,' says
Reyes.
To get around the problem, Reyes says he is hearing that some states,
including Texas and Oklahoma, are considering starting seed funds.
As far as the areas that have received venture backing and have provided
their investors with an exit, there has been a large swing in the first half
of the year.
No fewer than 18 communications and networking companies raised Dollars 636m
in the first half of the year, up from 10 flotations raising Dollars 504bn
the previous year.
As concern about President Clinton's healthcare reform eased, so the number
of flotations more than doubled to five and the amount raised rose by a
factor of four to Dollars 217m.
Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals companies raised only Dollars 152m from 11
IPO's, down from Dollars 278m in the first half of 1993.
Venture Economics says its most recent figures on overall returns explain
why more institutions like state pension funds are allocating more funds to
private equity investment.
In 1993, the overall internal rate of return - the annual compound rate of
return to the investor - rose to 18.3 per cent up from 13.5 per cent in 1992
according to the study of over 460 funds.
This improvement will have something to do with the state of the US economy.
But there are also fundamental changes in the way growth companies are being
financed.
'Venture capitalists have moved much more towards growth capital for
companies growing fast but already into revenues and profits,' says
Patricof. 'The banks still are not providers of capital to younger companies
 -they are asset not cash flow lenders. If you are looking for capital -
venture capital is the only place to go.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (7): A dilemma for
new biotech companies - Fall in share prices has worried investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery may be whetting the appetite of risk capital investors in
many industrial sectors, but not yet in biotechnology.
'What we have now is a protracted and difficult bear market with a shortage
of capital and low prices for companies,' says Mr Brook Byers, a partner at
California specialist biotechnology venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.
The bear run began in 1992 when the whole healthcare sector, including some
large capitalisation drug company stocks that had been stars in the 1980s,
was threatened by the prospect of healthcare reform imposed by the Clinton
Administration in Washington.
Biotechnology was especially vulnerable since the proposed reform was
designed, among other things, to control prices that could be charged for
drugs. Biotech companies rely on the prospect of being able to charge high
prices for new treatments to pay off their substantial investments.
At the same time, confidence in the sector was undermined by the failure of
some of the most promising quoted companies. These included Centocor, Xoma
and Synergen, whose multibillion dollar market capitalisations all but
vanished when their drugs failed in clinical trials. As a result, share
prices of quoted companies fell rapidly almost across the board. With no
prospect of a profitable exit, venture capitalists sought other investment
vehicles. This was a reversal of fortune for the sector. As one biotech
company chief executive says: 'Early 1992 was a waterfall of money. You held
out your cup and it was full.'
Now investors are asking themselves whether they have created too many
companies.
'People are beginning to realise that 1,300 to 1,400 biotech companies means
that the demand for capital to keep them going is too high. Biotech is
rapidly running out of money,' says Mr Alan Carr of San Francisco investment
bankers Hambrecht and Quist.
The sector's appetite for capital can be measured by comparing cash reserves
with the rate at which they are being consumed. 'In aggregate, there is less
than two years' money left,' says Mr Carr.
US stock broker Lehman Brothers follows 100 biotech companies, of which 45
have less than two years cash left and 17 a year or less.
The prospect of a heavy round of rights issues or secondary public offerings
has not only depressed the values of quoted companies but also those
awaiting their initial public offerings. Risk capital investors have had to
switch part of their funds from seeds and early-stage ventures to the
mezzanine to keep their earlier investment vehicles alive, according to Mr
Stephen Burrill of San Francisco finance house Burrill and Craves.
Mr Jeremy Curnock-Cook, director responsible for bioscience investment at
Rothschild Asset Management, echoes this, saying that early stage venture
investors 'are beginning to ask themselves whether to limit investment. Are
we not better off making the ones we have already more successful?'
Amid the gloom, investors are looking beyond the US, the original home of
both venture capital and biotechnology, to Europe. There are several
incentives to cross to the Old World for both US and European investors:
Europe has yet to see the failure of any of its larger biotech companies.
Rather the reverse: the rapid progress being made by British Biotech, now
the world's 12th largest biotech company by market capitalisation, has
maintained confidence in the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe
while the US languishes, says Curnock-Cook.
European scientists are increasingly prepared to consider becoming
entrepreneurs. Research this year by Mr Daniel Schoch of the Hautes Ecole
Commercial University of Lausanne suggests that while 28 per cent of Swiss
scientists had considered starting a company, only four per cent had. None
had been started with local venture capital because there is virtually no
Swiss venture capital industry.
It is easier to conduct research and development in Europe - 'it is only a
slight exaggeration to say that the Food and Drug Administration is driving
some companies to Europe,' says Mr Carr. 'Approval for a clinical trial in
Europe can take one month, in US it can can take 13-14 months.' The gap is
likely to grow with the establishment in 1995 of the pan-European Medicines
Evaluation Agency.
There is a 'reverse brain drain', according to Mr Burrill, of experienced
biotechnology entrepreneurs from the US to Europe. Examples includes Mr
Nowell Stebbing, formerly of Amgen and Genentech, the two highest
capitalisation US biotech stocks, who is now chairman of the UK's
Chiroscience.
Changes in stock market regulations to ease the initial public offerings of
companies with no profits record. The London Stock Exchange implemented one
round of reforms last year and is close to enacting another.
Privately, some of venture capitalists fear that the new-found European
confidence in biotechnology will be short-lived. They suggest that European
investors and entrepreneurs are unsophisticated and may become victims of
the sector's appetite for 'a new generation of suckers'.
Others argue strongly against this view. Several say that European biotech
companies are better businesses than those in the US, which before the
current difficulties found it too easy to raise capital.
Some believe that the biotech sector generally will recover, partly because
it 'always does' and partly because of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in
the wider healthcare industry.
They also note that the share price falls so far - an average of 25 per cent
this year alone in Lehman's 100-stocks - has created bargains. In the
absence of commercial funds, many large healthcare companies are scouring
the sector for the good buys. A number of deals have already been struck.
Venture capitalists welcome the arrival of the pharmaceutical companies
which hold out the promise of higher prices for quoted companies and hence
an easier exit eventually from unquoted investments.
At least as important, they should bring a higher profile to the sector and
encourage the view that the principle of biotechnology, rather than the
performance of individual companies, is valid.
'The jigsaw must be put together. It's time to see the forest not the
trees,' says Mr Curnock-Cook.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (6): Gloom among
UK's high tech entrepreneurs - Disillusion grows among Britain's new
technology companies / In contrast to the US, early-stage funding for
younger, high technology companies in the UK is in relative decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the British Venture Capital Association's 1993 Report on
Investment Activity is the best possible riposte to critics who accuse the
industry of ignoring high technology in favour of safer fields such as
services, retailing and low-tech manufacturing.
Investment in technology and life sciences businesses - comprising the
computer, electronics, medical and biotechnology sectors - leaped from
Pounds 91m in 1992 to Pounds 268m last year. That represented an increase
from 7.4 per cent to 21.4 per cent of all venture capital investment in the
UK.
And the inflow of funds is indeed welcomed by established high-tech
companies wanting to expand as the recession ends.
But most or all of the new money is going into later-stage expansion and
management buy-ins and buy-outs. There is no sign of improvement in the area
where funds are most desperately needed: investment in innovative new
companies. The BVCA figures show that total start-up and early-stage
investment fell from Pounds 82m in 1992 to Pounds 69m in 1993.
'Early-stage funding is in relative decline, as VC companies insist on
larger deals to help cover their costs,' says Charles DesForges, UK-based
president of TII, the European technology transfer network. 'If you look on
this as a river, everyone is going down to the estuary to look for the fish
that are already fat, and opportunities further upstream are being ignored.'
The merger of Trinity Capital with Advent International, announced this
month, has further reduced the ranks of those specialising in young
high-tech companies. John Walker, co-founder of Trinity and now managing
director of Advent International's European operations, says returns on his
early-stage funds have been 'on the borderline' - 'our experience was
telling us we needed larger deals.'
It is easy to find high-tech entrepreneurs who are bitterly disillusioned
with UK venture capitalists. One is Mike Fowler, a biology professor at
Sheffield University, who wasted 18 months slogging round the UK-based
venture capital funds, on behalf of his small university-based biotechnology
company, Plant Sciences Ltd.
'In the UK, so much management time is spent trying to raise money that the
business itself can disappear,' he says. 'The people we dealt with showed a
total lack of vision and no understanding of risk, as applied to a start-up
venture. They took so long to make up their minds that the company could
have died in the process.'
Fortunately, Plant Sciences survived the ordeal and is now flourishing -
with US venture capital funding and a new name, Phytera. Fowler says that,
after he got fed up with the search for British backers, it took him just
three months to raise Dollars 13m through Commonwealth BioVentures of
Massachusetts.
'The American attitude couldn't have been more different,' he says. 'We were
dealing with people who had actually been through the process of starting
companies themselves and who understood what we were trying to do.'
So Fowler is still in Sheffield, running a research programme to develop
plant-based pharmaceuticals. But he is now vice-president of scientific
affairs for a fast-growing US-owned company - 'I'm very happy with the
outcome from my personal point of view and that of my staff. The university
came out of it well, too,' he says. 'I'm very unhappy from the point of view
of UK Ltd that all our technology, the patents and know-how, are now
American owned.'
Carolyn Hayman, joint managing director of Korda &amp; Co, one of the handful of
UK companies specialising in technology-based start-ups, sees little
prospect of much more money flowing into early-stage venture funds. 'We're
finding it incredibly difficult to raise money for our new fund (the Pounds
20m Korda European Technology Fund) - and if we're finding it hard, it must
be well-nigh impossible for new entrants,' she says.
A fundamental problem in the UK, she says, is that 'the playing field is so
uneven. The tax regime is so favourable to pension funds - and you cannot
expect pension funds, by their very nature, to invest in start-ups.'
Faced with a shortage of institutional support, Hayman and others are paying
more attention to wealthy individuals as a potential source of high-tech
venture capital.
'In the US, a significant proportion of venture capital comes from
individual investors - in complete contrast to Europe,' DesForges says.
'These 'business angels' are a relatively untapped source of capital here.'
The trouble, according to DesForges, is that there is no mechanism for
channelling investments from individuals to high-tech entrepreneurs, while
providing the investors with an expert assessment of the would-be companies
and the entrepreneurs with the managerial advice they need to run a
business.
DesForges has a solution in mind for the latter problem. 'The real issue is
that the early-stage company needs management skills that it does not
usually possess. We're thinking of a fund that would put interim managers
into the business, to train and guide the owner during the early stages of
growth. It would be a short-term mission and they would move on when the
business was established.'
That would not solve the funding problem, however. Perhaps the way to draw
more individual investors into early-stage ventures would be to level the
tax playing-field between pension funds and everyone else. The government
could allow people to set up tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts, on the
US model, which they could use to invest in start-up companies; at the same
time, it might even help to make the initials IRA respectable.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (4): A big trek to
the US - Fund raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, tells
an amusing story about fund raising in the US. Arriving at Madison, the
capital of Wisconsin State, Smith and colleagues are searching in their bags
for the address of the fund managers they are due to see that day, when the
taxi driver interjects: 'I know where you are heading. This is Madison,
Wisconsin.
'The only thing in town is the pension fund. If you are in there for less
than an hour, you've had it, more than an hour and you are in with a
chance.'
Over the last 18 months, UK venture capital fund managers have been tripping
over each other in some of the furthest flung corners of the US.
From Wisconsin's pension fund in the north to the giant California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers), corridors have echoed to the honeyed
tones of salesmen trying to convince investors their track record is better
than the next fund manager who will walk in through the door.
Mostly, their efforts have been successful. In spite of clocking up many
more air miles than they had wanted, Charterhouse Capital Partners,
Candover, Schroder, Legal &amp; General and Morgan Grenfell have successfully
raised more than Pounds 1bn of new capital this year, much of it from US
investors.
As Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover says, raising capital has taken a lot
longer than for previous funds. Some smaller outlets may also have also been
pleasantly surprised that, notwithstanding the additional effort, they have
raised new funds.
Eighteen months ago few in the industry would have bet on some of these
funds raising much fresh capital. Their life raft has been the strong burst
of flotations in the UK that began last year and transformed the performance
of some funds that would otherwise have looked decidedly worse for wear.
Unfortunately for venture capitalists who had hoped to spend less time
travelling to raise funds, UK institutions' appetite has been dulled by the
roller-coaster performance over the last five years.
'The underlying appetite is still there,' says one active UK investor in
private equity funds. 'But there is a greater degree of cynicism about the
claims of fund managers. I think that the proliferation of professional
venture capital managers which we saw until four years ago won't recur for
some time.'
But the pilgrimage to the US is not driven only by the scarcity of capital
elsewhere. Bob Johnston, president of Beacon Hill Financial, a Boston-based
agency that specialises in raising funds, says there has been a steady
growth in the number of investors interested in what used to be known as
'alternative investments.'
These institutions - some of them big hitters such as Calpers with Dollars
80bn under management - are allocating fixed percentages of an increasing
asset base to unquoted investments.
'What is attracting the US investors is the good news coming from the UK
economy,' says Johnston. 'But there is a surprising amount being raised for
MBOs.'
The real newcomers are the state pension funds and increased activity by
institutions like Harvard, Yale and the Andrew Mellon Foundation. Corporate
pension funds first moved into overseas quoted investments in the mid-1980s,
followed five years ago by the state pension funds.
'Now public pension funds are following corporate funds again,' says
Johnston. 'That is why there is an increase in the amount of dollars
available for unquoted investment.'
This has led to another development. Many of these investors will only put
large sums in venture capital funds. Investing in small amounts makes little
sense for a group such as Calpers. As a result, more funds are being raised
by fewer fund managers.
The same phenomenon is apparent in the US market. Some observers say this
concentration could increase competition for larger buy-out and late stage
development capital deals, forcing down targeted returns, pushing up the
amount of debt in each deal or both.
Howard Cox, general partner at Greylock, the long established Boston-based
venture capital firm, disagrees: 'If there is more money available, it can
encourage opportunities, he says. 'The question is the quality of the deal
flow.'
Another dissenter is Alan Patricof, chairman of Patricof and Co, the US
member of Apax Partners. He says there is no shortage of quality deals.
'The level of disbursements of venture capital funds has consistently run
under or close to the amount of money raised,' Patricof says.
For the fund raiser, however, one thing is certain. Fund managers will
increasingly have to prove their track record or they will not get past the
gatekeepers, the intermediaries who screen and rank the funds and their
mangers for investing institutions.
'You really have to have a track record and it really has to check out,'
says Robert Smith.
'Five years ago we were selling dreams and there was absolutely no track
record. Now these gatekeepers really do know who we are and have comparative
industry statistics for closed end funds.'
Inevitably, the arrival of gatekeepers has increased the length of time  -
and therefore the cost - of raising a fund. Johnston says it now takes up to
a year, double what it took five years ago.
'They investigated investee companies, they looked at our performance
numbers, our reference checks with banks and accountants,' says Stephen
Curran, chief executive of Candover.
For those funds who can show their quality, the US is likely to remain an
attractive source of capital, as long as deal structures remain
conservative.
As the industry matures, however, managers with poorer performances will no
longer be able to rely on a silver tongue and a winning smile.
More visitors to Madison, Wisconsin, might consider keeping the taxi meter
running - they could be out in 20 minutes and able to catch the same
aeroplane out.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (5): The spotlight
falls on 3i - Corporate Moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most significant corporate move of the year was the flotation of 3i,
valuing Europe's largest investor in private companies at about Pounds
1.6bn. The big question the flotation raises is whether 3i will change the
way it does business.
It already dominates smaller deals through a national network of profitable
offices near the source of deals. And there are few signs it will move
quickly back into the more competitive larger deals, following its unhappy
investment in the Isosceles buy-in of Gateway supermarkets which led to a
Pounds 72m write-off in 1992.
But there is some question as to whether key deal makers in regional offices
might be tempted away now that they can cash in share options.
Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive, is adamant that nothing has changed -
'the flotation is not affecting the way we do business,' he says. 'We took
the steps we thought were necessary to make it a manageable investment trust
two to three years ago.'
For other venture capitalists, 3i's move into the limelight on the fringes
of the FT-SE 10 index will raise the profile of the industry to a level it
has rarely enjoyed before.
The flotation did not go altogether smoothly. On the day before the issue
was priced in June, the FT-SE 100 index fell 40 points. While institutions
over-subscribed, the public only wanted 1.1 times the shares they were
offered.
But from the first day, trading in the shares has been buoyant. Stockmarket
analysts say there is steady institutional demand for what is still a
relatively illiquid stock that is likely to join the FT-SE 100 index and
that many of who bought in the float have tucked their allocation away for
the long term.
The 13 per cent discount at which 3i was launched has steadily narrowed. Now
the debate is whether the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to a
net asset value which was last assessed in March. For some institutions, 3i
will be their first investment in venture capital. Unquoted investments are
interesting at the moment because smaller companies tend to recover fastest
during the early stages of a economic recovery.
Institutional investors who want an exposure to private equity investment
have had to choose between relatively illiquid investment in venture capital
funds or the quoted venture capital trusts.
3i, on other hand, offers both liquidity from publicly quoted shares and a
portfolio which spreads risk across 3500 companies. What is more, when 3i's
last asset valuation was struck in March, the group was using the published
audited earnings figures up to June 1993 for more than half its investments.
This leaves a full year of company recovery for many companies which has
been less than fully reflected in 3i's net asset values, analysts say. A 3i
investment may not yield as much as the best performing venture funds over
time. But it represents a punt on the recovery of the UK's Mittelstand
companies, without the illiquidity of investing in large funds.
This could be good news, not just for 3i's founding shareholders. The high
street banks and the Bank of England are likely to contemplate placing some
of their remaining 55 per cent stake in 3i after June next year.
Other venture capitalists could also benefit. If institutions become more
accustomed to private equity investment, they might consider making venture
capital a recognised asset class as it is in the US. Institutions might then
formally allocate a percentage of funds to the class, securing a more
certain flow of capital to the industry.
The 3i flotation could also bring greater transparency to the valuation of
unquoted companies, for long something of mysterious art rather than a
science. There have been cases where venture capitalists which were
co-investing have reported different values for the same investment, each
describing their approach as 'conservative'.
Such anomalies are unlikely to engender confidence in wider institutional
interest in the asset class. But with 3i giving a detailed description of
its valuation policy in its offer document, and other quoted venture capital
trusts becoming more forthright about their basis of valuation, potential
investors are hopeful a standard approach will evolve.
What about the way 3i does business? Some competitors question whether the
group will change its approach to customers under pressure from new
shareholders. In particular, they question whether 3i will break with its
tradition of not interfering with management's prerogative to decide if and
when they should sell their company, thus providing 3i with an exit.
3i vigorously denies there will be a change. The company says it gains a
competitive advantage from the approach that leaves management in control of
the timing of any sale. In any case, the portfolio turns over at its own
pace, it argues, providing the necessary realisation of capital gains.
Quite apart from the damage that such a shift would do to a unique selling
point, 3i argues it is under much less pressure to realise capital gains
than a venture capitalist that raises fixed life funds. In other respects,
3i was already changing ahead of the flotation, casting off a fusty,
avuncular image that had developed since its formation as the Industrial and
Commercial Finance Corporation after the war.
It has pulled out of markets where it has no particular advantage - the US,
property investment and consultancy. In doing so, it has cut staff from 940
to 570, with a much smaller reduction in the number of people focused on its
core business - 'it didn't make sense to have a large management consultancy
nor large dealing profits from property or to try to have a business in the
US,' Macpherson says.
But there are signs 3i is leveraging up its market position more
aggressively. For the first time, 3i this year raised two funds from
external investors, breaking with a tradition of only investing off the
strength of its own balance sheet.
The first is a Ecu 300m fund for co-investment in continental European
management buy-outs and buy-ins. This was designed to allow 3i to expand
faster internationally through its remaining foreign offices without putting
pressure on its balance sheet.
The second - a fund for co-investment in UK buy-outs larger than Pounds 10m
 -will potentially have a greater impact on 3i's competition. In the past 3i
has tended to syndicate chunks of its larger deals - Pounds 250m worth over
the last 10 years - because it does not take majority positions on boards.
The new fund will allow 3i to retain a greater amount of deals for its own
benefit. The group was aiming to raise Pounds 100m from up to five
institutions but, with the flotation looming, it closed the fund after
raising only Pounds 75m from the Norwich Union and Australian Mutual
Provident.
But these two funds are only a toe in the water. Given a favourable
investment performance, 3i is likely to raise more funds, reducing the
supply of deals it syndicates to the market and increasing competition for
new funds.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (3): Bush
telegraph is busy - Personalities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Many service companies claim they are only as good as their people. It is no
different in the venture capital industry. The success of fund raising, in
particular, but also of investing is often dependent on the personalities
involved.
The bush telegraph consequently hummed in February when Jon Moulton, founder
and managing partner of Schroder Ventures, left the group after a row with
parent Schroders over strategy.
Moulton is one of the most respected deal-makers in UK venture capital,
known for dominating boards and investing in large management buy-outs but
also doing tricky deals requiring real industrial knowledge. His
interpersonal skills are also legendary. Frequently described as aggressive
and abrasive, he admits 'my vigour of action outweighs my subtlety of
approach.'
So there was general surprise when it was announced in April that Moulton
would join Apax Partners. How would two large personalities like Moulton and
Ronald Cohen, Apax chairman, co-exist in one organisation?
'The two personalities are thinking the same, too,' jokes Moulton from his
private office where he was whiling away his 'gardening leave' with a bit of
freelance corporate finance work.
Cohen, who tried to hire Moulton in the early 1980s, knows exactly where his
new partner fits - 'Jon has joined at the same level as my most senior
partners to do the large leveraged buy-outs for which he is well known,'
Cohen says. 'Prior to Jon's arrival I had headhunters out looking for
someone in the buy-out area. It is good strategy to cover the whole spectrum
of deals.'
And does it mean, as rumours would have it, that Cohen means to step back to
focus on his business interests in Israel? Cohen emphatically denies this.
Apax is raising a Pounds 75m fund in a joint venture with Bank Leumi, to be
in vested in the country's high-technology companies.
'It will be another Apax fund, I am certainly not pulling back,' Cohen says.
Moulton's departure caused a hiccup in Schroder Venture's Pounds 140m
fund-raising. Some investors pulled out on news of his departure but others
took their place.
For all Moulton's presence, Schroder Ventures is far from a one-man team. It
has more ex-industrialists and former chief executives as partners than most
other venture capital funds and a greater ability than many to consider
investing in complicated situations like loss-making companies that need to
be turned around.
'We put a third of our money into loss making businesses which is something
you cannot do if you have not got the expertise in the industry,' says Carl
Parker, principal at Schroder Ventures.
Another big move of the year was Charles Gonszor, who helped build Phildrew
Ventures into a powerful force but left after another bust up between
partners. Neither side will talk about the underlying reasons but again
there appear to have been differences in opinion about the types of
investments Phildrew was making.
Gonszor, whom Moulton hired at Citicorp Venture Capital in the early 1980s
before he left for Phildrew, has been sharing an office with his former boss
and is understood to be trying to raise a fund. Phildrew says Gonszor's
departure will not affect the remaining parters' ability to do deals.
Robert Drummond, former chairman of Grosvenor Venture Partners, an earlier
departure as a result of a falling out, has yet to resurface. In February
Grosvenor, where Drummond had a 49 per cent stake, was bought by Mercury
Asset Management for Pounds 4.5m, after the company failed to raise a new
fund.
It was the first outright purchase of one venture capital fund manager by
another, giving MAM an opening into smaller deals and greater deal flow out
of London, MAM says.
Earlier this month Trinity Capital, founded 10 years ago to focus on
technology company investments, also lost its independence when it was taken
over by Advent International. John Walker, the co-founder who becomes
Advent's European managing director, had not tried to raise a new fund at
Trinity. But he realised Trinity would not be able to raise the size of fund
he would need to invest in later stage investments, the logical next move
for the group.
Linking with Advent, which has just raised Dollars 315m for European
investment, brought together large fund muscle and specialist investing
abilities. Walker also said that those smaller fund mangers that sorted
their future out sooner rather than later would have better options as the
industry consolidated.
That consolidation among institution has been going on slowly all year and
is likely to continue. First, Postel, the investment manager of the BT and
Post Office pension schemes, formed a joint venture with Granville Private
Equity, the private investment banking group in which it already had an 18
per cent stake.
The new venture, Granville Private Equity Managers, will manage Postel's
Pounds 195m private equity fund as well as Granville Development Capital's
funds plus Pounds 50m of new money which Postel will invest over three
years.
'An increasing number of institutional investors are recognising the
benefits of specialist management of unquoted portfolios,' says Granville's
chief executive, Michael Peacock.
And then there is Cinven, the venture capital fund that focuses on larger
buy-outs and has as investors the pension finds of British Coal, British
Rail and Barclays Bank. In March, CINVen announced it is taking over the
private equity portfolio of Royal Insurance Asset Management.
But CINVen's future is uncertain because of the privatisation of British
Coal. CIN Management, which owns CINVen, is one of British Coal's non-mining
assets included in a programme of sales that will probably be concluded by
next March.
The company might be interesting for institutional investors but equally its
own management might consider buying out the management company. All things
are being considered including the possible management buy-out - 'it is up
to British Coal and Samuel Montagu, (its advisers) to decide,' says Charles
Nicholson, a CINVen director.
If there were a management buy-out, venture capital companies would be
queueing around the block - at least to look at CINVen's books.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (2): Winning smile
reflects Denplan's success - Venturer of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Stephen Noar, a 38-year-old dentist, decided to set up a new company in
1986, the prognosis was not entirely promising. Market research found no
perceived need for the business. At its marketing launch in the Guildhall,
Winchester, only 29 people turned up.
But Noar's dogged belief in his idea paid off. From a standing start, he
built up Denplan, the dental healthcare company sold for Pounds 42m last
November.
This achievement, together with qualities such as 'clear vision',
'determination' and 'insight', has just earned Noar the accolade of Venturer
of the Year, an award sponsored by the Financial Times, Cartier the
jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association.
Much of Denplan's success can be attributed to Noar's prescience about the
impending crisis within his profession. This dates back to his work in the
mid-1980s at the Medical Defence Union, a provider of professional
indemnity, where he saw countless examples of the way in which the National
Health Service was failing dentists and their patients.
The problems, he reasoned, were exacerbated by the way dentists were paid.
As dentists were paid purely for each item of treatment, they had no
incentive to do preventative work. The piece-work basis of their pay,
together with the pressures of seeing 30 to 50 patients a day, affected the
quality of their work. At the same time, dentists' commitment to the health
service was eroding as their incomes fell behind those of their peers.
With a colleague, Marilyn Orcharton, he saw an opportunity to form a company
offering a private dental health care programme. Patients would pay a
monthly fee to cover any work they might need, a system which would avoid
the problems associated with piece-work pay. Dentists would set their own
charges while delegating their administration to Denplan, which would take a
fee for every registered patient.
Backers' reward
By last November, when the business was sold to Private Patients Plan for a
total of Pounds 42m, the company had registered 20 per cent of UK dentists
and 400,000 patients. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April 1993 were
Pounds 1m.
The company's success was shared by its backers. Advent, the venture
capitalists, invested Pounds 850,000 in Denplan in early 1988 and achieved
an internal rate of return of 52.7 per cent over five and a half years. F&amp;C
Ventures, the venture capitalists which bought out Orcharton's stake for
Pounds 1m in 1991, made an internal rate of return of 132.1 per cent over 30
months. Both companies hope to benefit from further earn-out considerations.
Noar enjoyed a good relationship with his backers, although he reserves his
warmest gratitude for the Midland bank manager who supported the business in
its early days. However, he notes that the relationship between an
entrepreneur and venture capitalists is 'fraught with potential problems.'
'If you are taking on board venture capitalists, you have to do it as an
adult,' he says. 'You have to realise it will not be your company.' This
process is good for the business, he believes. 'Owner-managers are too
possessive. They think they have all the answers.'
Noar was not always prepared to admit he did not have the answers, however.
One of Advent's nominees left the board after a few months because of a
disagreement about whether Denplan should offer dental insurance schemes.
Stephen Noar feels strongly that dental insurance schemes are not in the
best interests of patients - or their insurance companies - because they are
open to abuse and lead to unnecessary treatment.
It is clear that Noar believes strongly in the ethics of his business. He
rejects charges of opportunism associated with making money by exploiting
the failings of the health service. He recognises, nonetheless, the mixed
feelings and torn loyalties experienced by both dentists and patients
leaving the health service.
Noar believes that the exodus from the health service would be likely to
continue under a Labour government - 'there is now a general perception
across political parties that the whole of the population's primary care
aspirations cannot be met out of taxation,' he says.
The logical corollary of this argument is that, at some stage, the
principles behind Denplan could be extended into general practice medicine.
The idea appears to intrigue Noar - 'there is a debate now about the health
service which is less emotive,' he says. 'It is not sacrilege, heresy or
treason to talk about priorities.'
It is not clear what Noar will do when his two-year contract with PPP comes
to an end. One ambition is to become involved in backing small companies
himself. However, it is evident that his interest in developing Denplan's
potential did not evaporate when he sold the company.
'I have no financial reason to work but I have a lot of unfinished business
with this company,' he says. 'Everything we have done to date is to put us
in a position to do really important things.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (1): Competition
for new deals is intensifying - Entrepreneurs who are trying to launch
businesses face increasing difficulties in finding early finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
On the face of it, the UK venture capital industry is having a rip-roaring
year. Contrary to the expectations of many in the industry this time last
year, more than Pounds 1.5bn has been raised from sources in the UK, the US
and elsewhere for new funds during 1994, according to estimates by the
British Venture Capital Association.
This fund raising has been encouraged by a burst of private equity-backed
flotations in the last 18 months which have transformed the returns of some
otherwise poor fund performances.
This promising replenishment of funds masks, however, a continuing decline
in availability of true venture capital. Less than 10 per cent of the new
funds raised will be directed towards early stage investments or towards
companies pioneering new products in new markets. And there are few signs
that this long-term decline will be reversed.
'It's a real issue, no question about it,' says Doug Brown, chairman of
Advent International Europe, an investor in growing technology-based
companies. 'Entrepreneurs who are trying to get businesses started will find
it difficult to find early finance and will have to seek alternative sources
 -individuals, family, strategic interests.'
Among the small number of funds which have raised capital for early stage
investments is Schroder Ventures, which raised a Dollars 100m life science
fund. This fund-raising followed a rush to the London stock exchange by
bio-technology companies in 1993, and will be invested internationally.
Otherwise, the funds have been raised by venture capital groups which focus
on late stage development capital, providing acquisition finance for private
companies ahead of flotation or management buy-outs.
This emphasis on late stage capital is perhaps not surprising. As the
private equity investment industry matures in the UK, better comparative
performance records have become available.
Early stage companies take longer to provide their backers with the
opportunity to realise their investment. Moreover, funds focused on this
area have simply not performed as well as those which have backed more
established businesses. As a result, fewer development capital companies are
laying out their stall as providers of capital to early stage companies. To
criticise them for ignoring start-ups is like criticising butchers for not
selling fish.
In fact, the UK may be returning to a more normal level of investment in
early stage companies after an aberrant surge. In the early 1980s, many
relative newcomers to venture capital piled into early stage companies and
start-ups, tempted by US successes, such as Apple and Compaq. The UK has
proved very different to the US, however.
In the first place, there are not enough viable deals to justify the hiring
of in-house expertise by more than a small number of venture capital funds.
There are exceptions, such as the managers of the Schroder life science
fund. But it is not surprising venture capitalists lacking that expertise
are wary.
Furthermore, the UK is a much smaller market. As if developing a new product
or service was not risky enough, smaller companies in the UK need to attack
international markets much earlier in their lives than their US
counterparts.
There are also more interesting questions than whether the UK venture
capital industry is somehow failing early stage businesses. Why, for
example, are more early stage companies not seeking corporate partners to
help them develop products and bring them to market? And equally, why are
large corporations not considering backing more start-ups in their field?
Irrespective of the amount which early stage venture capitalists have raised
in this latest fund raising round, they have more than a passing interest in
the health of later stage development capital and the buy-out funds. A
repeat of the poor investments of the late 1980s would hurt the cause of
private equity investors generally.
An even more crucial question is whether the UK industry has matured enough
to resist going out and spending the wall of new money too quickly. One
prominent venture capitalist says there will inevitably be a return of bad
deals - such as Isosceles' purchase of Gateway and the Magnet management
buy-out - on which many people burned fingers.
'There will be significant competition for some time forward,' he says. 'It
will follow the same cycle. Funds are going to try to compete by going
multinational, or by being user-friendly and cheap, doing turnarounds and
focusing on specific sectors.'
Prices might already be creeping up - 'there is evidence that financial
buyers are outbidding trade buyers in businesses where there are trade
synergies to be had,' says David Shaw, managing director of NatWest
Ventures.
Underpinning these optimistic valuations is a faith that the economy is
strong, that interest rates are going to remain relatively low and that the
stock market will continue to look healthy long enough for there to be a
profitable exit.
Some others including Candover, which recently raised a fund, disagree:
'There has been a tendency to try to get an auction going among financial
buyers,' says Candover's chief executive, Stephen Curran. 'But the
competition has not increased. The amount of money has not changed over last
few years - it replaces existing funds.'
If prices are rising, there will be a tendency for the amount of debt in
deals to rise in order to maintain targetted real rates of return. What has
also changed in the last six months is that the banks have returned in
force. As Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development
Capital says: 'The banks' marketing departments have locked the credit
department in the cupboard.'
In recent years, most deals have been structured with as much debt as
equity, but most venture capitalists say the ratio of debt to equity has now
risen to two to one. As the banks, notably Midland Bank, have poured back
into the market, fees and interest spreads on debt have both come down from
more than two per cent to under two per cent.
What is more, there are signs that the mezzanine finance suppliers, such as
Intermediate Capital Group, which floated this year, are trying to provide
more expansion capital and acquisition finance for private companies. Few
observers believe debt to equity ratios of 10:1 will quickly return but
there is concern - 'the crossover point into lunacy is when people have to
deal their way out of debt, through asset sales, rather than trade their way
out of debt,' says Shaw. On a more positive note, there is little doubt that
a larger proportion of funds raised is now concentrated in more experienced
hands as institutional backers become more selective.
Undoubtedly, competition will get tougher for deals. Vendors of companies
are more demanding and venture capital houses which wait to be introduced to
deals, rather than rooting them out themselves, will only get the more
thumbed-over transactions.
There is also no doubt that the industry could do with an increase in deal
flow. What venture fund managers would dearly like to see is a resumption of
large corporate acquisition activity which has always led to disposals in
the past.
'The real question is whether we're right in believing there's going to be
an increased flow of opportunities resulting from the unwinding of
acquisitions and deals that were made in the late 1980s,' says Candover's
chairman, Roger Brooke. 'The ability of ourselves and everyone else in the
industry to invest will depend on whether we are right.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (1): Call of the
wide open spaces - Despite the abundance of empty offices, rents are rising
and developers are dusting off some long deferred projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tower cranes and concrete lorries, symbols of a virile commercial property
market, could soon be starting to re-emerge in London's West End where rents
for top quality new buildings are rising for the first time in five years.
Development plans are being tentatively dusted off as land owners and
development groups consider whether the time is now right to begin
construction again.
At first glance, prospects for London motorists finding their passage
blocked by fleets of building material lorries and contractors plant would
seem unlikely.
According to City University Business School, there remains a 'chronic
oversupply of sub-standard second hand office space in the West End' leaving
too many landlords chasing too few prospective tenants. The university has
drawn its conclusions after studying the findings of 10 of the largest
commercial agents in the capital.
Jones Lang Wootton and St Quintin, two of the agents, estimate that there
are still about 8m sq ft of empty office space in the area compared with the
3.25m sq ft estimated by Jones Lang Wootton to have been been occupied last
year by West End tenants. On the basis of last year's take-up the area would
appear to have at least two years supply of ready built accommodation.
However, says City University, new development is still needed because the
general oversupply of offices is masking a shortage of new large buildings -
particularly in the core area of Mayfair and St James, one of Britain's
richest property markets and favoured for prestige corporate headquarters.
Prof Piers Venmore-Rowland, of the university's business school, says: 'The
situation has become acute. There remains significantly less than one year's
supply of new accommodation available and, for large occupiers seeking in
excess of 100,000 sq ft, there are no new buildings currently available.
'They (the figures) should make alarming reading for those businesses
seeking large new offices in the West End. Many people have become used to
the idea that there is far more office space available in central London
than there are tenants to fill it.
'In general terms they are right but  .. for those high profile,
internationally orientated businesses looking for top quality space there is
very little to choose from.'
Rents, according to Jones Lang Wooton, have started to rise for quality
buildings in prestige locations. More important, landlords have been able to
reduce some of the rent free periods and other sales incentives they have
been offering tenants.
A recent landmark letting was achieved at the 95.000 sq ft Almack House in
King Street which is to be occupied by international bankers JP Morgan at an
initial rent thought to be Pounds 42.50 a sq ft.
This is well short of the Pounds 60 plus achieved in Mayfair and St James at
the end of the 1980s but nonetheless represents an important breakthrough,
breaching the psychological Pounds 40 a sq ft barrier.
Jones Lang Wootton expects headline rents will reach Pounds 50 a sq ft next
year. It says average rents of Pounds 65 a sq ft in 1989 in Mayfair/St James
had fallen to a low of Pounds 35.50 in the second quarter of last year but
have since risen to about Pounds 37. Rent free periods of 2 1/2 years
offered as a sales incentive to reluctant tenants at the height of the
recession have fallen to about 18 months, says the agency.
Other important West End lettings this year, according St Quintin, include:
Saudi International Bank which took 46,000 sq ft at No 1, Knightsbridge;
Allied Dunbar Insurance, 31,000 sq ft at 120 New Cavendish Street; Cable
London, 30,000 sq ft at Central Cross, 2 Stephen Street; and Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank Corporation 24,000 sq ft at 29/31 Hill Street.
The agents say the supply of available offices in the postal districts of
W1, SW1, WC1 and WC2 peaked at 11m sq ft during 1992 as tenants' needs
reduced due to business rationalisations and a sharp rise in company
liquidations.
At the same time, the number of new buildings coming on to the West End
market rose sharply reflecting the fruits of the late 1980s building boom.
By the third quarter of 1992 empty buildings represented 13 1/2 per cent of
the areas stock of offices. St Quintin says the vacancy has dipped below 10
per cent although still well in excess of the 3 to 4 per cent required for a
healthy market. 'It is worth remembering,' it says, 'that in the late 1980s,
when the market tightened considerably, the vacancy rate dropped to 1 to 2
per cent, which was equally unhealthy.'
Jones Lang Wootton says that the availability of new properties has almost
gone from feast to famine with vacancy rates for new buildings now just
under 2 per cent compared with a vacancy rate of 8 per cent for all West End
properties.
Rents also have begun to recover for better quality space in one or two
other West End districts beyond Mayfair and St James. Top rents in Soho and
Covent Garden, says the agency, are averaging Pounds 22.50 a sq ft to Pounds
25 compared with Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 two years ago and a peak of about
Pounds 40 to Pounds 45 in the late 1980s.
The recent improvement reflects increased demand from media and advertising
companies, benefiting from the growth in cable and satellite television,
which provide the backbone of tenant demand in the area. It has also
benefited from a spill-over of interest from companies unwilling to pay
higher rents or unable to find the right kind of quality space in Mayfair
and St James.
Some agents, however, report that more recently there has been a slight
slowdown in the rate of improvement in West End lettings. Similarly,
property investment purchases which rose sharply in 1993, partly triggered
by demand from overseas investors, have slipped back as bond yields have
become more competitive.
Institutions are likely to want to see further evidence that tenant demand
will prompt further rent rises before they embark on high risk new
developments which will only proceed if substantial pre-lets can be
achieved.
Many companies which might have been considering a move within the West End
remained trapped by high rent leases, negotiated many years ago and which
they are unable to reassign - the commercial property equivalent of negative
equity.
New tenants are reluctant to commit themselves to traditional long leases
with upward only rent reviews. 'It is quite difficult to secure a tenant for
longer than 15 years,' according to St Quintin which says 'break clauses' at
the 10th or even the fifth year 'are not unknown'.
New investment also is unlikely to take place while substantial rent free
periods are still available. Older, poor quality buildings will remain very
difficult to let while tenant demand in the absence of new construction is
likely to be concentrated on refurbished second hand buildings of high
quality.
This points to the development of a two tier market with rents rising
modestly for quality space as shortages emerge. Poorer quality buildings
where there is still a large over-supply will remain very difficult to let,
rents will remain static and sales incentives will be slow to disappear.
Tenants have become more cost conscious during the recession and the general
oversupply of accommodation will continue to act as a brake on the market
preventing a rapid escalation in rents even for the best quality offices.

FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distiller Guinness tumbled 13 to 448p, in trade of 7.2m after the group
reported figures at the bottom end of market expectations.
Interim profits improved by Pounds 15m to Pounds 320m against market
expectations of between Pounds 320m and Pounds 330m. Several brokers moved
to downgrade full year profit expectations. They included Smith New Court, a
bear of the stock over the last six months. The broker reduced its year end
forecast by Pounds 24m to Pounds 894m and cut the following year's
prediction by Pounds 30m to Pounds 960m. Mr John Beaumont at Smith believes
the 'current rating of the shares is too high.'
Reports predicting UK interest rates would be around the 10 per cent mark by
the end of next year hit banking stocks. National Westminster fell 6 to
470p, while Barclays tumbled 13 1/2 to 554p, in busy trading of 6.5m. Lloyds
gave up 9 to 530p.
Industrial conglomerate BTR hardened 2 to 306p, on volume of 4.6m after BZW
came out with a strong buy recommendation on the stock.
Housebuilder Barratt Development gained a further 3 to 181p as analysts
digested Wednesday's strong interim results. William Sindall put on 5 to 93p
on rumours of acquisition news in the offing.
Glaxo took a turn for the better, improving 15 to 574p with 5.8m shares
traded. SmithKline Beecham too enjoyed positive territory and added 6 to
428p.
Against a weak electricity sector Scottish Power mustered a rise of 6 to
392p with 2m shares traded.
The increase came as Panmure Gordon launched a push on the stock, urging
investors to buy before the regulatory reviews - which are due in a few
weeks.
Panmure utilities analyst Mr Angelos Anastasiou said that the Scots power
company faces its supply and distribution review in a relatively strong
position as it, along with Scots Hydro Electric, was floated with already
tight regulation.
Scots Hydro also improved yesterday, a rise of 3 to 383p.
With the exception of Northern Ireland Electricity, which moved ahead 14 to
385p after a period of lagging the sector, most electricity stocks lost
ground. Among them were Eastern which fell 10 to 777p; Midlands which gave
up 18 to 799p and London which lost 9 to 717p.
Confirmation by South West Water that it was challenging the Ofwat price
limit saw the shares slip 5 1/2 to 527p although volume was thin.
Shares in Granada Group advanced 7 to 491p, after several brokers
recommended the stock.
Kleinwort Benson favours the stock as does BZW which said: 'This is a well
managed group with good prospects whose shares were recently left behind.'
Airports group BAA stood out in a mostly lacklustre transport sector, rising
6 to 475p.
Reports suggesting that Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of media group News
International is on the verge of setting up his own wholesale distribution
network continued to exact a toll on several stocks. WH Smith gave up
another 10 to 450p, while John Menzies fell 18 to 564p.
Talk of a share buy-back plan at GUS following Northern Electricity's move
on Wednesday saw the retailers shares appreciate 18 to 555p. Northern closed
31 down at 782 on profit taking.
British Aerospace was a clear feature for the second day running, bouncing
back strongly to recoup almost the whole of the previous day's results-hit
losses. NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett both put out positive reports on
the company and the upswing in sentiment was enough to push the shares 18
higher to 463p in 3.1m trades.
Rolls-Royce, up 2 to 178p, came in for modest buying while controls and
compressed air specialist Siebe jumped 12 to 549p on talk of an imminent
upgrading of profits forecast by a top securities house.
Following interim results the previous day, shares in Laporte slipped back 9
to 740p. Most brokers maintained their forecasts although NatWest upgraded
its estimate for this year from Pounds 122m to Pounds 125m.
Shares in United Newspapers firmed 2 to 500p after touching a day's high of
513p on company results that were a little above analysts' expectations.
A cross by Goldman Sachs of 3.9m shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at 195p, from
one fund client to another, was behind the large volume of 7.1m in the
stock, or 1.8 per cent of the company.

FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC sparkle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Having underperformed the market as a whole by some three percentage points
this month, building materials sprang to life yesterday following good
interim results from RMC Group which pushed the shares up 19 to 927p.
The shares are a notoriously tight market and only 243,000 changed hands but
the stock was heavily in demand, backed by an upgrading of profit
projections from a broad range of securities houses.
BZW is now pitching for Pounds 252m pre-tax for this year, up from Pounds
220m previously. But the stockmarket consensus is probably closer to Pounds
240m.
The excitement in RMC washed over on to Redland which gained 18 to 508p and
Tarmac, 6 1/2 higher at 146p. Both companies unveil interim statements next
week.

FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of a renewed price war among food retailers sparked a slide in some of
the leading shares in the sector.
The retreat came early in the session when a rumour went round the market
that J Sainsbury was about to embark on a round of price promotions, a move
dealers would interpret as the trigger for another round in the price war
between leading food retailers. The fall was particularly surprising to
market watchers given that north of England supermarket chain William
Morrison had just posted a sparkling set of interim figures.
However, analysts put the slide down to 'some confusion about Tesco's recent
comments on lower regional pricing in parts of the north of England.' This
appeared to steady some nerves but was not enough to bring about a recovery
in the shares. Sainsbury closed 9 lower at 416p, after trade of 4.4m and
Tesco surrendered 4 to 239p, in hefty trade of 7.9m.
Argyll Group fell 10 to 277p, with volume reaching 5.1m. Late profit-taking
in Morrison, which revealed a Pounds 9.2m profits increase to Pounds 47.4m,
saw the shares retreat from the day's peak to finish a penny off at 138p.

FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close firmer after an
uncertain session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A choppy and uneasy session on the UK stock market yesterday saw shares
close firmly in subdued trading volume. With global markets uncertain in
their response to comments from the president of the Bundesbank and from the
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the UK market turned its attention to
domestic market factors.
Rumours originated in the foreign exchange markets that overseas clients of
one of the premier London discount houses had taken substantial positions at
FT-SE 3,000 in stock index futures. These were said to be covered by
stop-loss orders which would trigger instant selling of the December future
if the Index touched that level.
At mid-afternoon, a sudden dip in the German bond market sent the Footsie
down to 3,008.6 and, with the December contract on the Footsie just below
this level, nerves were stretched to the uttermost. But the market turned
higher as Wall Street came in with a Dow gain of 6 points, and the moment of
danger passed.
But the market remained very nervous. not least because one of the big
London names was said to have turned bearish on domestic interest rates and
was predicting base rates of 10 per cent by end 1995.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Share Index stood at 3,021.2 for a net gain of
6.4. There was little sign of any change of view although a good performance
in late trading in the stock index futures market raised spirits ahead of
the opening of the markets this morning.
Earlier, the stock market moved erratically, gaining more than 12 points on
the Footsie as bond markets steadied behind favourable comments on German
inflation prospects from Mr Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank.
Trading volumes were unimpressive, however, and firmness in UK government
bonds bore out suggestions from some analysts that investment funds,
especially those from continental Europe, are switching from UK equities to
gilts.
The market remained prey to company results and a generally more cautious
reading of boardroom trading statements underlined belief that City analysts
are beginning to moderate their highly positive views on the outlook for
corporate earnings. This could threaten the outlook for UK quities in the
final quarter of this year.
Higher first half profits and a higher dividend payout from Guinness did not
save the shares from analysts' concern over references to price competition,
which has become the touchstone for the food and consumer sector.
However, British Aerospace rallied well from the setback of the previous day
as some analysts took a more favourable view of the half time trading
report, counter-balancing downgrades by two leading UK securities houses on
the previous day. And there was a strong response to a highly successful
first-half performance from RMC, which drew attention to the strength of
recovery in the UK and in Germany.
Much of the afternoon was passed waiting for reports from the appearance
before the US Senate Banking Committee of Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve. But the firm opening on the New York stock market left
London to wait for news overnight.
The second line issues were somewhat neglected and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
drifted off by a further 8 points to close at 3,562.1 as the smaller
investors stayed away, waiting for the clouds over the blue chip market to
clear. Seaq volume of 546.3m shares compared with 594.8m in the previous
session. On Wednesday, retail or genuine customer business in UK equities,
remained satisfactorily high, from the viewpoint of the London securities
industry, and returned a value total of Pounds 1.36bn.

FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures passed another volatile day with the market moving
skittishly in thin and nervous trading conditions.
Volume was the lowest for some weeks at 10,030 - down from 13,799 on
Wednesday - leaving traders with time on their hands and at the mercy of the
rumour mill.
The major buzz was the existence of a stock-loss trade on the FT-SE December
contract. It was said to be set by a big US house and to be triggered at
3,000.
At one stage the contract moved down to 3,007 only to be reversed by modest
support.
It reached a 3,042 best of the day around 3:30pm before closing at 3,031.
At this level the premium to the cash market is around 10 points with the
fair value premium running to some 15 points.
Traders described business levels as 'very bitty', reflecting the 'almost
complete absence' of views on the direction of equities at present. Many
took the sensible course and went home early.
Activity in traded options also fell, easing back to 31,858 lots from 37,003
the previous day. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for just over half
of the total.
The most actively traded individual stock options were British Airways at
2,228 lots and Sainsbury (1,450 lots).

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lurches downward with
program selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks lurched downward yesterday afternoon after limping through
an uneventful morning, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.47 lower at 3,837.13, after
program selling sent the index reeling in the final half-hour. But the
broader range of stocks held steadier, however. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended with a slender 0.19 loss at 461.27.
Volume on the Big Board was a fairly heave 302m shares. In the secondary
markets, the American SE composite was up 0.14 at 454.91 while the Nasdaq
composite was off 0.27 to 760.44.
Investors spent the morning licking their wounds after the battering
inflicted on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow industrial index, which had
plummeted 86 points over the two days, crawled within a few points of its
starting level for most of the session.
The focus remained on monetary policy, with investors still trying to guess
whether the Federal Reserve would lift interest rates next week or wait
until after the November elections.
News of a modest decline in initial claims for unemployment benefit was not
very helpful in this regard, nor was congressional testimony by Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chair man. The central banker shed no further light on
the policy outlook.
Bonds were not much help either, though the benchmark 30-year issue managed
to appreciate a little. Left to their own devices, most stocks meandered
without direction until a computer-driven wave of selling left the blue chip
index with a third big loss in a row.
Among individual issues, NovaCare topped the NYSE's most active list,
plunging Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 11 1/4 in heavy volume of 4.3m shares. JP
Morgan downgraded the issue as the company, a provider of rehabilitative
medical and social services, issued a profits warning.
Borden added a scant Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 as its board considered
an offer to buy up to 90 per cent of the company's shares for Dollars 16 to
Dollars 18 each. The plan was presented by Mr Paul Kazarian, a former
Sunbeam-Oster chairman, as an alternative to a takeover proposal from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
On the Nasdaq, shares in Lotus Development were trading briskly a day after
concerns emerged over the software developer's European sales. The issue
skidded a further Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto stocks were mixed in direction-less trading, as investors crowded
the sidelines ahead of next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve.
The TSE 300 composite index added 4.03 points, or 0.09 per cent, to
4,362.65, but declining issues outnumbered advances issues 380 to 340.
Volume was 56.81m shares down from Wednesday's 62.22m and trading value fell
to CDollars 736.3m compared with CDollars 976.8m.
Gold stocks continue to be bid higher, with the index closing 1.8 per cent
higher today. Brazil
Sao Paulo prices ended up 0.97 per cent in an extremely volatile session
dominated by rumours about Brazil's presidential election polls. The Bovespa
index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 516 at 53,952 points.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris edges up but fails to
regain 1,900
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity on the continent was generally patchy yesterday.
PARIS failed to regain the 1,900 level, lost on Wednesday, with the CAC-40
index finishing at 1,899.37, up 2.19, and a gain on the session low of
1,891. Turnover was FFr3.8bn.
In spite of the modest recovery brokers remained unsettled and did not rule
out a decline today, with chart analysts suggesting that the index could
strike 1,850.
Pinault-Printemps, down FFr33 at FFr906, was left trailing on news that it
intended to sell a 6 per cent share stake to part-finance its purchase of a
stake in FNAC, the book and record group. The price will be set on September
26, with the sale taking place between September 27 and September 29.
Credit Lyonnais CI's, which are thinly traded, dipped FFr24 to FFr401 as the
state controlled bank postponed the publication of first half results. Some
reports suggested that the postponment was due to a disagreement with the
government over details.
Air Liquide went in the other direction with a gain of FFr6 to FFr718 as
investors took positions ahead of the release of first half results which
came after the close and showed a gain in profits of 8 per cent.
FRANKFURT was generally quieter with turnover also falling back. In the
official session the Dax index slipped 6.47 to 2,073.03. In Ibis afternoon
trade the index settled at 2,072.81. Turnover was DM6bn.
Merrill Lynch, in a technical analysis of the market, reported that the
index now had 'more than a normal risk of a downside correction'. A
preliminary decline to retest support at 1,960 was possible, it added, with
implications for a further fall to the 1,750 level.
MILAN was unnerved by the failure of the government and trades unions to
reach an accord of pension reform at their first meeting yesterday, and the
Comit index fell 7.21 or 1.1 per cent to 671.13.
Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan said that the market had been
expecting an agreement from the meeting. However, the government's failure
to secure one raised worries that any subsequent accommodation would not
lead to the necessary structural reform of public finances.
Fiat fell L51 to L6,643 and Olivetti was L14 lower at L2,013 ahead of
first-half results after the market closed.
Generali fell L221 to L39,663 and Toro was L499 lower at L27,021, ahead of
six month figures late in the day. SAI was down L165 at L21,425 following
news of improved interim figures.
Mediobanca was L225 lower at L13,759, while BCI, which is expected to report
lower first half figures next week, fell L51 to L3,969.
Benetton dropped L999 or 4.5 per cent to L21,414 after the chairman was
quoted as saying that while sales volumes had grown over 1993, turnover was
little changed by value.
ZURICH edged higher, supported by firmer bond futures and gains in selected
blue chips. The SMI index rose 8.9 to 2,602.9, but was unable to hold up at
the day's peak of 2,614.1.
Gains in Roche's certificates, up SFr45 to SFr6,045, and UBS, SFr7 ahead at
SFr1,197, helped to pull the market higher. Nestle gained SFr4 to SFr1,200.
Swiss Re registered shares, strong gainers earlier this week, fell SFr3 to
SFr563 on profit-taking as some investors switched into Winterthur, SFr11
higher at SFr645.
AMSTERDAM held the 400 support level in a quiet session. The AEX index
closed the day down 0.73 at 400.36.
Unilever, off 20 cents at Fl 193.80, announced that it was to expand its
operations in China.
COPENHAGEN was in a holding pattern as investors took stock of the outcome
of the general election.
The KFX index was off 0.19 at 96.26.
Turnover was concentrated in banks, which slid back from early highs to
close mixed. Danske Bank put on DKr1 to DKr325.
MADRID finished mixed with losses seen in high volume shares and the general
index eased 0.33 to 294.46 in turnover of Pta23.6bn.
Repsol lost 2.4 per cent to Pta3,740 with the losses attributed to
speculation about the next public share offering in the state-owned oil
company.
ISTANBUL rose another 2.5 per cent after some late buying, triggered by
portfolio switching towards companies with good nine month profit
expectations. The composite index rose 853.69 to 25,196.20, for a three day
rise of 10.6 per cent.

Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking ahead of the three-day weekend
depressed prices, and the Nikkei erased the gains of the past two days,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index lost 51.71 to 19,833.67 after a high of 19,907.58 and a
low of 19,760.05.
Volume was 355m shares against Wednesday's 394m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks fell 1.74 to 1,584.22 while the Nikkei 300 edged up
0.01 to 289.85. Losers led gainers by 575 to 425, with 189 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.93 to 1,297.61.
Analysts said brokers, looking to boost profits ahead of the September book
closing, were unwinding their positions. On Thursday, the country's leading
securities companies announced downward revisions for interim and annual
earnings projections due to the lower-than-expected trading volumes during
the first half.
Daiwa Securities fell Y20 to Y1,430 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y1,090.
Sanyo Securities, which announced on Wednesday that its capital ratio had
dropped below the 200 per cent 'safety' line, lost Y4 to Y556.
Profit-taking depressed high-technology stocks. Oki Electric, which had
gained on Wednesday on expectations of higher earnings because of firm
semiconductor demand, lost Y8 to Y780 while Toshiba declined Y4 to Y751.
Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y10 to Y955 on rising gold prices.
Meanwhile, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily which publishes the
Nikkei 300, yesterday said that four component stocks are to be replaced.
Japan Airlines, Maruha, Daito Trust Construction, and Sumitomo Warehouse
will replace Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Hanwa, Nagasakiya, and Fujita Kanko.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical will be delisted next month due to its merger with
Mitsubishi Kasei, while the other three stocks are to be replaced due to
lower trading volumes and market capitalisation.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 16.23 to 22,073.35 in volume of 268.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y90 to Y5,880 on profit-taking.
Roundup
The region was mixed yesterday.
SEOUL finished at an all time higher after a third straight trading day of
advances as investors sought large-capitalised blue chips and bank stocks.
The composite index closed 10.40 or 1.0 per cent higher at 1,034.01, taking
the cumulative three day rise to 4.6 per cent.
Brokers said the strong advance prompted steady selling in anticipation of a
consolidation, although it was more than offset by strong demand, especially
of medium-priced blue chips like Goldstar and Daewoo Heavy Industries. Both
went daily limit-up to record closes of Won31,800 and Won17,100
respectively.
HONG KONG tumbled 1.6 per cent on worries about the outlook for US interest
rates as investors returned after Wednesday's holiday, but prices closed off
lows on light bargain hunting by retail investors.
The Hang Seng index lost 156.61 to 9,668.14, having been down 240 points at
one stage.
Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.64bn from HKDollars 3.22bn.
HSBC Holdings eased HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 88.25. Hongkong Land
recovered from a low of HKDollars 18.65, finishing at HKDollars 19, down 50
cents.
Shipping companies' shares continued to advance as funds bought in
anticipation of a recovery in the global shipping industry. Wah Kwong
Shipping Holdings rose HKDollars 2.10 or 14.8 per cent to HKDollars 16.30,
after a 10.8 per cent advance on Tuesday, and IMC Holdings rose 42.5 cents
or 9.2 per cent at HKDollars 5.025.
The H share index lost 43.16 or 3.0 per cent to 1,399.14 in a delayed
reaction to China's higher inflation rate.
TAIPEI saw late selling send prices lower and the weighted index closed down
1.6 per cent amid profit-taking on financials. The index fell 109.56 to
6,889.88 in turnover of TDollars 54.2bn.
Among financials Cathay Life fell TDollars 7 to TDollars 215 and Chang Hwa
Bank TDollars 6 to TDollars 199. Elite Group rose by the daily 7 per cent
limit to TDollars 54.50 for the second consecutive session since its debut
on Wednesday.
SYDNEY rose modestly boosted in light turnover by a stronger gold price. The
All Ordinaries index rose 1.6 to 2,028.2.
Turnover was ADollars 586.9m.
Gold shares were actively bought on the firmer gold price, with Newcrest
rising 13 cents to ADollars 6.68.
SINGAPORE edged lower as attention focused on Malaysian OTC stocks. The
Straits Times Industrials index lost 3.60 to 2,286.09, while the UOB-OTC
index, which tracks mainly Malaysian stocks, dropped 15.01 to 1,281.57 on
heavy profit-taking in the afternoon.
KUALA LUMPUR gave way to heavy afternoon profit-taking by retail and
institutional investors and the composite index lost 11.26 to 1,179.88.
Some Singapore and Japanese funds were said to be booking profits after the
recent run-up while investors were also unnerved by rumours, subsequently
denied, that Bank Negara had issued tighter guidelines on financing of share
purchases.
BOMBAY fell sharply on the last day of the account. The BSE 30 share index
lost 55.33 to 4,451.78, although the broader 100-share national index gained
14.08 to 2,116.49 reflecting some scattered buying.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a setback in the performance of the world's emerging markets
earlier this year there has been a pick-up during the last three months,
which has left the IFC composite price index up some 5 per cent from the
start of the year in dollar terms, writes John Pitt. Latin America has been
the star region, by far outperforming Asia which has fallen into negative
territory.
Kuala Lumpur set a new eight-month high on Wednesday and it looks set to
continue to pull ahead. Kleinwort Benson in London has recently picked the
market as one to watch, suggesting that a gain of some 20 per cent by the
end of the year cannot be ruled out. Kleinwort's favours Malaysia as one of
its 'most favoured markets', although currently it is 4 per cent down in
dollar terms from the start of the year.
Sri Lanka is picked by Lehman Brothers, following the parliamentary
elections there last month and ahead of November's presidential election.
Lehman's forecasts economic growth of 6.3 per cent this year, reinforced
mainly by a 20 per cent gain in total investment, and funded by 'sustained
expansion in national savings and capital flows'. In spite of the likelihood
of short-term instability post-elections, Lehman's expects the economic
fundamentals to attract investors 'and compel the new government to hew
fairly closely to the reform path, in spite of its polulist electioneering'.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Markets wait for news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Wait and see' was the operative theme of the foreign exchange markets
yesterday as a dearth of economic data or news left the dollar, D-Mark and
pound treading water, writes Motoko Rich.
The dollar was relatively undisturbed as continuing trade talks between the
US and Japan circumscribed any significant movement.
In London, the dollar closed against the D-Mark at DM1.5488 from DM1.5449.
Against the yen, it finished slightly higher at 98.0750 from 97.7000.
Anticipation of German inflation figures, due this week, prevented the
D-Mark from leaping out of its trading ranges against most European
currencies, although it was slightly firmer than it has been recently. It
pushed up against the lira as the markets frowned at the squabble over
pension reform between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government and
Italy's trade unions. Against the lira, the D-Mark finished in London at
L1011 from L1007.
Sterling turned in a steady performance, consolidating recent gains. Against
the dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5762 from Dollars
1.5781. Against the D-Mark, if closed at DM2.4411 from DM2.438.
As President Bill Clinton and Japanese foreign minister Mr Yohei Kono opened
talks on the status of trade negotiations between the two countries and Mr
Clinton renewed the threat of sanctions, the markets left the dollar
languishingly in narrow trading ranges.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said he believed the
markets were being unrealistic about the 'scope for meaningful compromise'
between the two nations. 'I feel the markets are making too much of these
talks,' he said. 'They are almost bound to be disappointed.'
Remarks made by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, before
the US Senate Banking Committee about the condition of the country's banking
and thrift industry were shrugged off by investors.
The markets are clearly waiting for the upcoming meeting of the Federal Open
Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, on September 27.
Analysts are now largely expecting officials to raise interest rates at that
meeting or shortly after it. 'If there is a rate hike that will keep a check
on the dollar because rate rises tend to pull the bond markets down and the
dollar has been linked to bonds lately,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, currency
strategist at JP Morgan.
While the dollar's performance is generally thought to track the US bond
markets, last week's collapse in US Treasuries on the back of fears of
incipient inflation did not prompt an equivalent drop in the dollar against
the D-Mark.
Mr Hannah said he believed this was because the markets are also uncertain
about inflation prospects in Germany, and were therefore reluctant to
replace the dollar with D-Marks.
The markets were unfazed by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
president, in which he said inflation was expected to ease in the next few
months, but was not yet at a satisfactory level. Mr Hannah said that if
inflation figures rise above the 3.0 per cent level, other European
currencies will make modest advances against the D-Mark.
Against the French franc, the D-Mark closed in London at FFr3.419 from
FFr3.418. Against the Swiss franc, it finished at 0.830 from 0.828.
The D-Mark was also helped against the lira by unresolved problems with
Italy's pension reform programme. Two Italian trade unions have rejected Mr
Berlusconi's draft plan, fuelling market uncertainty about the passage of a
budget.
Analysts downplayed the scale of the lira's movement, however. Ms Phyllis
Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, said: 'The pension reform is a key
issue in the 1995 budget and the unions' reaction to it has caused some
sensitivity in the market. But before we see any significant movement we
need to see the budget get through the parliament and see if it represents a
tangible tightening of fiscal policy.'
The South African financial rand, which is freely traded on the markets, was
jolted when the UK credit rating agency IBCA announced it had given the
country a 'BB' rating on its senior, unsecured, long-term foreign currency
debt. Against the dollar, the financial rand fell as low as R4.44 from an
opening of R4.37.
The rating, which is equivalent to that given to countries like Argentina,
Mexico and Hungary disappointed the government as it had hoped for a higher
grade to attract foreign investors. South African ratings from larger firms
like Mooody's and Standard and Poor's are expected shortly.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds
1.1bn and provided liquidity of Pounds 469m. It provided late assistance of
Pounds 520m.
The December short sterling contract traded 43,000 lots to close at 93.18
from 93.07, discounting a three-month interest rate of 6.82.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Controversy continues to dog EU
banana regime - A problem highlighted by storm damage to the Windward
Islands' crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The storms that devastated banana crops in the Windward Islands earlier this
month have focused fresh attention on the controversy surrounding the
European Union's new banana import regime.
The tropical storm is estimated to have cut output from the eastern
Caribbean islands by about 40 per cent. They normally produce about 290,000
tonnes of bananas a year, which go mainly to the UK.
Geest, the main importer from the islands, wants the European Commission to
allow it to import supplies from Latin America to make up the shortfall,
treating them as if they were Windward Islands' produce and entitled to
duty-free entry to the EU.
So-called dollar bananas from Latin America, where production costs are much
lower, are subject to strict quotas and tariffs under the import regime
introduced by the EU in July last year.
Ms Clare Wenner, Geest external affairs director, says the apparent
inability to make such transfers between production areas in the event of a
natural disaster is a 'major deficiency' in the new regime.
Geest, which imports half its bananas from the islands and half from Latin
America, is concerned that the Windwards may lose market share permanently,
she says. 'We want them to be allowed to have some mechanism whereby
replacement bananas can be sourced as if they were Windward Islands
bananas.'
The US group is hoping for backing from the French, because the storms
caused serious damage in Martinique, one of their main Caribbean suppliers.
Output there is expected to be down by at least 40 per cent, and possibly
much more.
However, the European Commission is believed to be reluctant to consider
changes because this could be used by Germany, a fierce opponent of the
regime, as an opportunity to renegotiate the whole basis of the regime.
'The Commission is terrified of bringing forward amendments,' said one
national official close to the negotiations.
Germany, which argues that the regime discriminates against its traditional
suppliers in Latin America, is taking a second case to the European Court
challenging the quotas. Final judgment in its first case is due on October
6, but the court's advocate general has recommended its rejection.
The Commission has increased the quota for Latin American banana imports by
118,000 tonnes this year to 2.118m tonnes, but this is to take account of an
increase in consumption. The situation in the Windward Isles is still under
consideration and is expected to be discussed by the commission's banana
committee on October 5.
'We have to assess the damage and see what would be the best way to help
them economically,' an official said.
Meanwhile, the new regime faces another threat from the US, where banana
exporters have filed for Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, to
launch a formal investigation. The exporters, Chiquita Brands International
and the Hawaii Banana Industry Association, claim it is damaging their
interests by discriminating against US companies in favour of European ones
in its allocation of eligibility for import licences.
They are also unhappy about an agreement between the EU and four key Latin
American producers - Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela - which
is due to be implemented on October 1. It grants these countries specific
quotas based on their past share of the market, within an overall ceiling of
2.1m tonnes of bananas from Latin America this year - up from 2m tonnes.
The US exporters say it gives the four signatories preferential access to
the EU market.
However, the regime is specifically designed to ensure that bananas from
former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) continue to
find a market in the EU as part of member states' obligations under the Lome
trade and aid convention.
It allocates 30 per cent of import licences to traders on the basis of past
trade in ACP bananas, 60 per cent on the basis of past trade in Latin
American bananas, and 10 per cent to newcomers and traders in EU bananas.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lobbyists bring Australian
uranium debate back to the surface - The issue could be raised from the
floor at the ruling Labor Party's conference in Hobart next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could Australia be about to relax its constraint on uranium mining, which
limits production to three mine sites?
The question has arisen with the approach of the ruling Australian Labor
Party's impending national conference in Hobart, Tasmania, next week.
Uranium policy is not on the formal agenda but there is a real possibility
that uranium supporters will raise the issue from the floor, to urge
modifications.
Over recent weeks, intense background lobbying has been under way. On the
mining side, the Uranium Producers Group has commissioned Access Economics,
a forecasting and consultancy organisation, to assess the implications of
expanding the industry. Environmentalists, by contrast, have taken to the
streets, demonstrating outside state ALP headquarters and warning of voter
defections to minor parties if the rules do shift. Aboriginal
representatives have also been voicing their case, both in the Northern
Territory and in Canberra.
Australia's current uranium policy dates back to the early 1980s, when the
ALP moved away from its stated aim of banning uranium mining altogether and
endorsed a new mine at Roxby Downs, in South Australia, where uranium was to
be produced alongside copper and other metals. The party came to power the
following year.
After some internal battles, the 'three mines policy' evolved. Essentially,
this limits uranium production to the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory,
operated by Energy Resources of Australia (which, in turn, is controlled by
North Broken Hill Peko); Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam, which is now wholly-owned
by Western Mining Corporation; and at Nabarlek, in Queensland.
However, Nabarlek has been worked out, and finished the processing and
exporting of stockpiled ore in 1990. This, advocates of a more permissive
approach argue, means that the 'three mines' policy has become a nonsense.
Australia, they point out, has about 30 per cent of the western world's
low-cost uranium reserves, yet produces only about 10 per cent of western
output. This contrasts sharply with Canada's share of 40 per cent, derived
from only about 18 per cent of reserves.
In its study, Access Economics estimates that output from known deposits
could almost double the country's production during the next 10 years if the
'three mines policy' were abandoned. Australia, it predicts, could come to
account for 30 per cent of western output by 2004.
Such expansion would have two favourable consequences. Firstly, export
earnings would rise significantly, from ADollars 120.2m (56m) - excluding
government stockpile sales - in 1994, to ADollars 752.6m - in 1994 price
terms - in a decade's time. Secondly, the economic benefits would accrue
mainly to Western Australia and the Northern Territory. (The deposits most
likely to be assessed in the event of a change in ALP policy are North
Ranger/Jabiluka in the NT; WMC's Yeelirrie in WA; Kintyre, also in WA and
owned by CRA; and Koongarra in the NT.)
'The value of NT uranium exports in 1994 prices would be over ADollars 450m
in 2004, or equal to more than 10 per cent of the current total output of
the NT,' the Access report suggests.
Anti-nuclear campaigners see things very differently. Greenpeace, the
environmental group, has countered with its own report, which argues that
Australia's bilateral trade agreements give 'advance generic consent' for
plutonium to be separated from Australian-sourced uranium and used or
stockpiled in pre-approved facilities, and that government assurances that
Australian-sourced uranium and plutonium will be used for peaceful purposes
cannot be guaranteed. Accident risks, it adds, may not be so far away.
The report raises the possibility that Australian uranium may eventually be
sold to Indonesia, which despite its considerable coal reserves, seems
anxious to build a number of nuclear power reactors.
Expanding trade and diplomatic relations with Indonesia is a key element in
the Keating government's effort to forge a meaningful role in the
Asia-Pacific region. But Greenpeace argues: 'The site of the first of these
proposed reactors is in an area of high seismic activity, increasing the
risk of an accident that could spread radioactive contamination over much of
South-east Asia, including Australia.'
Meanwhile, Australia's indigenous community appears to be divided on the
issue. Any development of large Koongarra deposit in the Northern Territory
 -jointly owned by Canada's Denison and Cogema, the French nuclear fuels
agency - would allow the 'traditional owners' of the mine site to earn a
significant economic interest in the project.
Accordingly, some members of the Northern Land Council, which represents
aboriginal interests in the region, have urged a relaxation of the current
three mines policy. But it is unclear whether this stance is representative
of opinion within the broader indigenous community: 'The majority of people
have not been given the opportunity or the information to make an informed
opinion on whether we do or do not want uranium mining,' Mr John
Christopherson, an executive member of the NLC from West Arnham Land, said
in Canberra this week.
In the midst of the ideological debate, the commercial considerations are
sometimes overlooked. There is currently an oversupply situation in the
uranium market, and spot prices, which stood at more than USDollars 40 a
pound in the late 1970s, have fallen to a quarter of that level. The Access
report suggests that excess commercial inventories will disappear by the end
of this decade, although it admits that estimates of when this might happen
differ, and that western governments will be loathe to become too dependant
on non-western supplies.
Other analysts tend to agree - although they also warn that the timing is
hard to predict. 'If you're asking will it be economic to expand production,
the answer is probably yes,' comments one analyst at Sydney-based AME
Mineral Economics, for example. 'If the three-mines policy was removed, it
wouldn't be 'open-go', but there are two or three ore bodies which would be
reviewed, with companies looking to long-term contracts.'
Finally, there is the question of whether the issue will be raised at all.
Any debate would come towards the end of next week's conference, and in the
factional wheeling and dealing that goes on, uranium policy could yet fall
by the wayside. Public opinion polls suggest that Australians tend to
support the retention of a 'three mines' policy - although not by a vast
margin - so the domestic political advantage in unleashing the issue may not
be high.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rally halted - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London COFFEE futures ended a see-saw session in the minus column yesterday.
Having reached a near 9-year high of Dollars 4,140 a tonne in the morning,
the November position closed at Dollars 4,055, down Dollars 36 on balance.
One dealer explained that early expectations that prices would move higher,
continuing the rally of recent weeks, had given way to a 'sense of
disappointment' and light liquidation.
At the London Metal Exchange a slight retracement in both COPPER and
ALUMINIUM took most of the other base metals off the boil by the close of
business.
Dealers said copper was now looking to overcome its recent high of Dollars
2,550 a tonne, for three months delivery, to spark further gains and confirm
its perceived upside potential.
Three months aluminium edged up to a fresh 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 1,626
a tonne on bouts of speculative buying and short-covering before slipping
under light producer selling and profit-taking to close at Dollars 1,623.50,
down 50 cents on balance.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat stocks set for 14-year
low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World wheat stocks are set to fall to their lowest level for 14 years after
a drop in international output this year together with a continued rise in
consumption, according to the latest report by the International Wheat
Council.
The IWC has cut its estimate of world stocks at the end of the 1994-1995
season from 114m tonnes to 107m tonnes - the smallest carry-over since 1980.
This compares with a carry-over of 129m tonnes from 1993-1994.
'The international supply position for wheat continues to tighten,' the
report says. The wheat council's latest estimate for world production in
1994-1995 is 2m tonnes lower than a month ago at 534m tonnes, which compares
with 558m tonnes in 1993-1994.
Falling production and stock levels have pushed world wheat prices higher in
the past few months by at least Dollars 20 to Dollars 130-Dollars 135 a
tonne. This was against a background of improved prospects for trade,
especially with China, and a further trimming of estimated supplies in
drought-affected Australia, as well as in Canada, where stocks are also low.
But the IWC says that the fall in stock levels will not necessarily mean
serious wheat shortages in future. The northern hemisphere is now making
planting decisions on the basis of current high wheat prices.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices at the Australian wool sales have declined for the first time this
season. At Sydney and Adelaide earlier this week it became clear that the
market had at last turned. The Eastern market indicator actually fell by 11
cents on Wednesday, marking a change of direction which is generally
welcomed after the long rise in merino prices. A breathing-space would
certainly be appreciated, although it is recognised that the strength in the
international wool markets is still firmly based, and could reveal itself in
higher prices again before long. One important factor in such a development
would be a renewal of Chinese buying in volume when a lower price-level is
established.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Heavy futures trade magnifies erratic
price movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's government bond markets saw another day of erratic price action,
with price swings magnified by heavy trading in the futures pits and low
turnover in the cash market.
After a directionless morning, most markets closed higher on the day, lifted
by stronger US Treasuries and rumours of much lower-than-expected
preliminary inflation numbers in Germany's four largest states.
German government bonds rose sharply in the afternoon after the December
bund futures breached important chart-technical resistance at 88.50,
triggering a flurry of short-covering. In late trading, the contract was up
0.70 point at 88.82.
Rumours that the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia would release
favourable inflation numbers today also lifted bunds. While general market
expectations have been for a year-on-year western German inflation rate of
around 3.0 per cent for the month to mid-September, some traders yesterday
were talking of a rate as low as 2.3 per cent.
Bunds derived some relief from the publication of the Bundesbank's bond
issuance calendar for the remainder of the year, which indicated the
government plans to issue only two more long-dated bonds in the final
quarter.
'There isn't that much long-dated supply left in the pipeline - the funding
situation looks better than a lot of people have feared,' said a London bund
dealer.
UK gilt prices staged a late rally, rising nearly a point as the market
digested a rumour that today's CBI monthly trends survey, not due to be
published until after midnight, contained good news on inflation.
Gilts' increase was helped by a rise in bunds and on Liffe, the December
long gilt future reached 99 1/16 in late trading, a rise of 15/16 points on
the day. The yield spread over bunds was around 146 in late trading.
Mr John Shepperd of Yamaichi said traders believed the CBI survey, which is
one of the factors taken into account by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England at their monthly
monetary meetings, would show that the proportion of companies reporting
higher prices had fallen.
After outperforming most of Europe this week, Italy's bond market lagged
gains elsewhere amid growing worries that the budget package under
discussion may not be finalised before its end-September deadline.
All eyes are on meetings between government and trade union leaders over the
government's pension reform plans, and traders said the market would remain
nervous until some hard facts emerge.
The Italian December bond future on Liffe fell 0.08 point to 98.32.
US Treasury bond traders took a measure of encouragement yesterday from
comments by a former Federal Reserve policy-maker.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 better
at 96, with the yield slipping to 7.78 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.456 per cent.
In the absence of any attention-grabbing economic data, the morning brought
some subdued buying at the bedraggled long end of the maturity range. There
was no fundamental shift in sentiment, which remained decidedly negative in
view of recent evidence of accelerating inflation.
With yields on the 30-year issue now at their highest level in two years,
the market simply made a slight correction in long-term rates.
Speculation over the timing of the next increase in short-term interest
rates continued to dominate activity.
A day earlier, comments by Mr Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor who now
serves as chief economist for Bear Stearns, had helped push bond prices
lower. Mr Angell predicted the central bank would decide to lift short-term
rates by an aggressive 50 basis points at next week's meeting of its
policy-making arm.
Yesterday, however, comments by Mr David Mullins, a former Fed
vice-chairman, served to ease tensions over the rate outlook. The Washington
Post quoted Mr Mullins as saying the economy would achieve equilibrium with
a rate increase of just a quarter point.
All the chatter over policy kept up the pressure on the short end, which
would feel the direct impact of any rate adjustment. Still, the two-year
issue managed to improve slightly in the late afternoon.
Congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan proved to be a non-event for
bonds. With traders listening intently for any hints about policy, the Fed
chairman confined his remarks to banking issues.
The market ignored news that initial claims for unemployment benefit had
fallen by 7,000 last week - anecdotal evidence that wage pressures were
building in the labour market.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Kuwaiti public offering draws
strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first public offering of shares listed in Kuwait for over a decade was
heavily oversubscribed yesterday. It provided a strong lift to the local
capital market and the government's privatisation programme.
Investors from Kuwait and other Gulf Co-operation Council countries put in
bids estimated to total Pounds 150m to buy 30m shares in Commercial
Facilities Company, a consumer finance company which specialises in car
loans.
Commercial Facilities shares were priced at KD0.70, an 11.4 per cent
discount on their last closing price of KD0.79 on August 28 when the stock
was suspended from trading on the Kuwait Stock Exchange in preparation for
the sale.
Kuwait Investment Authority - a division of the ministry of finance - will
reduce its stake to less than 37 per cent from 54 per cent, as a result of
the deal which was managed by the National Bank of Kuwait.
After the Gulf war in 1991 Kuwait announced a programme to sell some of its
stakes in about 60 domestic firms.
Sales of state electricity, water and communications sectors have been
mooted. Commercial Facilities has assets of more than Dollars 420m,
supported by shareholders' equity of Dollars 115m.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National delays launch of first
global eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatile bond market conditions have forced the Abbey National Building
Society to delay the proposed launch of its first global eurobond offering.
It had planned to launch a Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn global offering of bonds
with a five to 10-year maturity in the last two weeks of October but it will
wait until conditions improve, officials said yesterday.
'These are not the right conditions to launch an issue of this size,
especially when it is your first global offering,' said Mr Gareth Jones, the
Abbey National's treasurer. 'We are going to wait for a substantial
improvement in market tone before we revive the offering.'
However, he said this did not represent a threat to the building society's
funding programme. Abbey National has raised a total of Dollars 8bn this
year.
Mr Jones said: 'Our borrowing is in pretty good shape and we do not need
extra money. We have no plans to raise significantly more this year.'
Abbey National is still seeking SEC registration to enable it to sell bonds
into the US.
The volatile state of government bond markets last week forced the World
Bank to delay its Dollars 1.5bn global offering of five-year bonds, which
finally came to the market earlier this week.
Lebanon is likely to launch its long-awaited offering of three-year fixed
rate eurobonds late next week, lead manager Merrill Lynch said yesterday.
Interest in the country's first eurobond offering, which will be at least
Dollars 150m, has been significant, Merrill Lynch said. Demand has been seen
from a broad range of investors, including emerging market funds, Swiss
banks and Japanese investors, officials said.
In the Ecu sector, the European Investment Bank launched a Ecu300m offering
of five-year bonds priced to yield two basis points above French government
bonds.
At least half of the bonds were sold to institutional investors, with a
strong UK bias, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said.
The pricing spread widened to six basis points when the bonds were freed to
trade. However, the relative scarcity of such an issue and the attraction of
the current coupon of 8 1/4 per cent means that the bonds will soon trade
below French government bonds, the lead manager said.
The offering marks the EIB's return to the Ecu sector for the first time
since March 1993, and the first time it has tapped the five-year area since
1989.

long-term credit bank, to A1 from Aa3.
The agency said the bank faced continued weak profitability due to
larger-than-expected asset quality problems and the bank's weak retail base.
Moody's said it expected the bank's profit margins to remain low,
constraining its ability to solve its bad loan problems.
IBJ is regarded as one of Japan's leading wholesale banks, and retains a
strong influence on companies. Moody's decision is likely to hurt an already
weakening investor confidence toward Japanese banks, which have been
severely hit by mounting bad loans.
Moody's said although the bank held large unrealised gains on securities
holdings, which could be used to offset the low profit margins, the volatile
Japanese stock and bond markets could hamper attempts to realise profits on
its portfolio.
However, the agency added that IBJ still held a wide range of clientele, and
would benefit from deregulation in the financial sector, which would allow
banks to move further into the securities business.

General Motors and Vestar Equity Partners have signed a letter of intent for
GM to sell the assets of National Car Rental System to an investment group
led by Vestar, Reuter reports from Detroit.
The proposed agreement includes provisions for National to continue to
employ its 6,400 employees, and to maintain its long-term fleet agreement
with GM to purchase vehicles.
In June, National's president Lawrence Ramaekers told Reuters the rental
firm was expected to fetch more than Dollars 1bn.
GM declined to comment on the sale price, saying the deal was contingent on
the signing of a definitive agreement and the approval of GM's directors.
The US carmaker said the sale reflected its strategy to divest non-core
assets. GM acquired 45 per cent of National in September 1988 and, since
then, has acquired full ownership of the company.
Last year, GM retained Jay Alix &amp; Associates, turnround specialists to
improve National's operating performance.
'National Car Rental is an established franchise that we believe has real
potential,' John Howard, co-chief executive of Vestar Equity Partners, said
in a statement. 'We have been quite impressed with the efforts of GM and Jay
Alix &amp; Associates to improve National's operating performance. We will work
closely with the management team to build on this progress.'
National services more than 5,000 locations in 132 countries worldwide.
New York-based Vestar has organised 13 management buy-outs during the last
six years. The firm manages a Dollars 260m equity fund dedicated to
management buy-outs.
GM's move marks the second time this month one of Detroit's Big Three car
companies has sold its stake in rental car firms.
Earlier this month, Chrysler sold its stake in Snappy Rent-A-car to a group
of investors led by Jackson Partners LP in New York. Chrysler still owns a
stake in Thrifty and Dollar Rent-A-Car. In April, Ford Motor increased its
stake in Hertz to 100 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: CP Rail offers CDollars 1.4bn

<TEXT>
CP Rail System, the railway subsidiary of Montreal-based conglomerate
Canadian Pacific, has offered to pay CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.04bn) for
the eastern Canadian operations of government-owned Canadian National,
Canada's other main railway.
The bid follows a recent pattern of mergers and acquisitions throughout the
North American rail industry as operators seek to expand their networks and
improve competitiveness by combining resources.
CP Rail and CN earlier this year discussed merging their eastern Canadian
operations, which cover their entire network east of Chicago and Winnipeg.
However, the two sides failed to agree on the value of their respective
assets.
Mr Barry Scott, CP Rail's chief executive, yesterday described the bid as 'a
singular opportunity for both the Canadian government and Canadian
taxpayers'. He noted that CP's offer would enable the government to
privatise half of Canada's biggest public corporation and would
substantially lower CN's debt.
Canadian Pacific said that the purchase would be financ-ed from existing
resources.
CP's offer will be an important test of the economic policies of the Liberal
government, which took office last October and has so far been lukewarm
towards privatisations following a wave of disposals by the former
Progressive Conservative government.
While business interests favour privatisation, the CP bid is likely to be
opposed by many other groups, ranging from trade unions to communities which
may be in danger of losing their rail service. CP said yesterday that it
would shut one of two lines serving the east coast port of Halifax, Nova
Scotia.
CP Rail said its offer would be open for 90 days. It urged the government to
speed up the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals for
constructing rail connections and the eventual abandonment of surplus
assets, as well as determining appropriate bargaining units for labour
agreements.
The takeover would come into effect on January 1 1996. CP said it would aim
to cut the combined workforce of 16,500 people by about 2,500 over the first
four years.

<TEXT>
Australia and New Zealand Banking group, one of the four big Australian
banks, yesterday announced plans to offer a buy-back facility for the new
ordinary shares which will result from the conversion of its ADollars 600m
(USDollars 441m) convertible preference share (CPS) issue in July next year.
The move, which will require shareholder approval, will provide a
'convenient facility for CPS holders', the bank said. Mr John Gough,
chairman, said it would have 'a positive impact on earnings per share and
improve the return on equity for ordinary shareholders'.
The 6m CPS were issued in 1991 at ADollars 100 each. Each will convert at a
10 per cent discount to the weighted average sale price of ANZ ordinary
shares during the preceding five trading days. The buy-back price will be
that used in the conversion calculation, guaranteeing holders the conversion
discount and giving them ADollars 111 for each CPS.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal pays more as profits
rise 13%

<TEXT>
South Africa's Anglovaal group, the mining and industrial conglomerate, has
announced a 13 per cent rise in operating profit to R813.9m (Dollars 229.9m)
for the year to June from R719.5m last time.
Turnover rose 17 per cent to R9.97bn from R8.51bn, while attributable
earnings rose 17 per cent to R342.2m from R293.1m a year ago. The dividend
was also raised 17 per cent to 123 cents from 105 cents.
Once again Anglovaal's industrial interests provided the greatest part of
the group's earnings. At R241.2m, up from R203.1m last year, they
contributed 71 per cent to the total.
The improved results were due largely to higher relative earnings from
cement group Anglo-Alpha and electronics and construction arm Grinaker
Holdings, as well as a satisfactory performance from food processor Irvin
and Johnson.
Income from the group's direct mining interests in gold, copper and
manganese benefited from the weaker rand and rose to R45.8m from R37.9m,
with their share of total earnings static at 13 per cent.
The increase in mining earnings was also helped by higher royalties accruing
to subsidiary group subsidiary Saturn Mining, Prospecting and Development
from the Venetia diamond mine.
However, earnings from indirect mining holdings, held through Middle
Witwatersrand, rose only slightly to R35.8m from R34.2m, and their overall
contribution to group earnings dipped from 13 per cent to 12 per cent.
The group expressed optimism about the South African outlook for the coming
year, citing the continuing international recovery and rising domestic fixed
investment. It expected to increase earnings further over the current year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation's invest-ments in television will be a major source of
growth for the global media group, Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive and
chairman, said in the company's annual report, Reuter reports from Sydney.
'The investments we have made demonstrate our continued belief in the growth
potential of television around the world,' Mr Murdoch said. 'We believe that
the television industry, whether it be free to air, satellite or pay, will
be a major area of growth for this company for the rest of the decade.'
Mr Murdoch said News Corp was confident that its Asian satellite
broadcaster, Star TV, would achieve greater market penetration in the next
18 months, reaching 90m homes from 42m at present. News Corp has a 64 per
cent stake in Star TV.
News Corp also expects higher household penetration for its 50 per
cent-owned UK satellite broadcasting company, BSkyB - in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - aided in part by the continued
growth in cable television.
News Corp said more than 700,000 cable households in the UK saw Sky, as did
2.5m homes with satellite dishes.
'With dish subscribers growing around 700,000 annually versus 250,000 for
cable households, we believe that satellite will be the primary form of
distribution in the medium term,' Mr Murdoch said.
He said News Corp continued to invest in its base businesses in 1993-94 to
keep them competitive. 'While we have made significant investments
throughout the corporation over the past 12 months, we have also
simultaneously continued to strengthen our financial condition.' Debt was
reduced by ADollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.32bn).
'We have continued to access the long-term public markets, providing us with
long-term financing which more appropriately matches the long-term nature of
our investments,' he said.
Earlier this month News Corp announced record net profits of ADollars 1.34bn
for 1993-94.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Daewoo buys stake in Indian
truckmaker
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate and the country's third-largest
carmaker, is to buy a majority stake in DCM-Toyota, an Indian truckmaker,
Reuter reports from New Delhi. It is planning to transform the ailing
company into a profitable car manufacturer.
Mr Shiv Awasthi, managing director of DCM-Toyota, said that a shareholders'
meeting next Thursday was expected to approve a capital restructuring and a
change in the company's name to DCM-Daewoo Motors.
'There was a need for a strategy to broaden the product range for (sales)
volume and sustainable growth,' he said.
Several leading carmakers are gaining a foothold in the Indian auto industry
in competition with Suzuki, the most established producer in India. They
include General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen.
DCM-Toyota incurred sustained losses as the market for its lightweight
trucks was hit by a rising yen that increased manufacturing costs, and by
competition in India from rival Japanese vehicle makers Mazda, Nissan and
Mitsubishi.
Daewoo is planning to start with an investment of Dollars 15m to Dollars 18m
but will inject Dollars 200m by 1997 and Dollars 600m to Dollars 1bn by
2000, initially to make the latest of its Racer range of 1500cc cars for the
Indian market, said Mr Awasthi.
'Korea is now enjoying the price competitiveness which Japan enjoyed 15
years ago,' he said.
Daewoo plans to start production by September 1995, and its first car is
expected to roll off the assembly by the following December. 'We are
planning 25,000 cars in the first year and possibly 100,000 by the year
2000,' said Mr Awasthi.
Toyota has brokered a revival package under which Daewoo will buy 51 per
cent of the company, while Toyota's holding will be reduced to half of its
current 17 per cent. India's DCM, whose current holding is 56 per cent, will
hold at least 28 per cent, he said.
The equity base of the new company will be increased from Rs450m to more
than Rs910m (Dollars 29m).
DCM and Daewoo are both optimistic about the prospects for India's car
market, which they expect to grow from 220,000 to 230,000 cars per year at
present to 600,000 by 2000.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nokia rides the worldwide
airwaves boom - The Finnish company is taking on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In August 1992, shortly after being appointed Nokia chief executive, Mr
Jorma Ollila returned home from a management brainstorming session and wrote
down the four phrases which he saw as the key to the company's future. They
were 'telecom-oriented', 'global', 'focus', and 'value-added'.
Two years on, nobody can accuse Mr Ollila of not sticking to his own brief.
The 44-year-old former Citibank executive has focused the group very firmly
on telecommunications, and Nokia has developed an increasingly global
profile.
It is also difficult to argue with the results. As sales have soared, the
group has surged back to profit. Even more spectacularly, the group's share
price has risen more than 12-fold and, with a market capitalisation of more
than FM40bn (Dollars 8.15bn), it accounts for almost 23 per cent of the
value of the Helsinki stock exchange.
Its star position in the Finnish corporate landscape is highlighted by the
cluster of mature slow-growth forestry and engineering industries
surrounding it.
Is the success down to luck or judgment? Like a surf-rider catching a
rolling wave, Nokia happens to have caught the mobile telecommunications
boom at just the right time. As the world's second-biggest supplier of
mobile phones after Motorola of the US, it has benefited from a surge in
global handset sales from 3m in 1982 to 14m last year and to an estimated
25m in 1994. It is also the world's second-largest supplier of digital
cellular equipment after Sweden's Ericsson.
When explaining the group's rebound, Mr Ollila says external market
conditions and the group's focus on certain market segments have been as
important as technical innovation.
'The two things which have helped us most have been the entry of new
operators into the cellular market and the shift from analogue to digital,'
he says.
One measure of the group's success is that it has a near-20 per cent share
of the world mobile phones market. This means it will supply around 5m
phones in 1994, double last year's figure.
Another indication of its confidence is its early move into the Japanese
market, where it is aiming to capture a 25 per cent share of the digital
phone business by 1996.
Nokia became the first European manufacturer to enter the Japanese market
earlier this year, and it claims to be offering the smallest and lightest
handset on the market as well as the only one that carries both English and
Japanese characters.
Indeed, Nokia's increase in world market share has been to a large extent at
the expense of Japanese rather than western rivals. The group's 20 per cent
share of the mobile phone market is now not far short of the 26 per cent
held by all of Japan's mobile phone manufacturers together.
Telecommunications today accounts for more than 60 per cent of group sales,
compared with as little as 14 per cent 10 years ago. This dominance is
increasing all the time because the group's core telecom businesses are
growing at 50 per cent a year, while growth in its other activities -
consumer electronics, cable and machinery, tyres and power - is virtually
flat.
The consumer electronics operations, in particular, have brought Nokia
considerable pain in the last two years, culminating in a divisional loss of
FM747m last year. Considerable restructuring, including the closure of the
group's picture tubes operations, has helped to turn the business round and
it is on course to return to the black in the final four months of the year.
Despite the prospect of low growth, it is likely that the consumer
electronics operations will be retained, assisting the group's ambitions to
build a presence in multi-media.
But even here, Mr Ollila does not over-stress the synergies between the
telecom and consumer electronics side of the business, noting that it is an
'interesting link but not a crucial one'. As for the rest of the group's
non-telecom activities, Mr Ollila says bluntly that he is prepared to devote
no more than an hour of his attention a month to them. He emphasises that
Nokia has no intention of investing heavily in any of its businesses which
do not have a clear telecom link. They will either be sold or retained and
run on a cash-flow basis.
Can the group's out-performance continue? Mr Ollila is optimistic about the
short term, saying 'our order book, our market position and our products
vis-a-vis our competitors give us a tremendous confidence about the next 18
months'.
He is comfortable with analysts' predictions suggesting earnings per share
of FM30 this year against FM12.3 in 1993.
Further ahead, the worry is not just about competitors' technological
innovation. The company fears that a spurt of undisciplined growth could
make it more bureaucratic and less able to respond with speed and
flexibility to market demands. 'We must be able to manage our growth,' says
Mr Ollila.
He predicts that 'the 1990s and early 21st century will be the era of the
medium-sized company. It is the big companies which will be slower to move'.
If this proves correct, one of his main tasks will be to ensure that Nokia
itself does not become a sluggish juggernaut in the slow lane.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A securities firm which made markets in the shares of 68 different
biotechnology companies was forced to close its doors yesterday, throwing
into question the ability of investors in the companies to sell their
shares.
The firm, D Blech, which had been rumoured before to be facing liquidity
problems, yesterday confirmed that it did not meet the minimum regulatory
capital requirements laid down by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Securities firms are not allowed to trade without sufficient capital.
The firm's problems follow a difficult time for the biotech industry.
According to a study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young, released earlier this
week, the market value of publicly-trade biotech companies slid last year to
Dollars 36bn, from Dollars 39bn the year before, even though sales grew by a
sixth to Dollars 7bn.
The failure in recent months of a number of biotech products to win
regulatory approval has also dented confidence in the sector.
Blech had won a name for its aggressive promotion of small biotech companies
which could not win the support of other investment firms. Companies it had
backed included Ecogen, Genemedicine, Guildford Pharmaceuticals and La Jolla
Pharmaceutical.
The shares in each of these companies fell be at least a quarter after
yesterday's news.

<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa's search for a new chief executive ended yesterday when the
Swedish insurer said it had appointed Mr Lars Thunell, president of the
asset management group Securum.
The appointment, which will take effect on November 1, came a month after Mr
Bjorn Sprangare resigned from the post after strong criticism of his
performance.
Trygg-Hansa has been through a difficult phase due to heavy losses from its
investment in Home, the US insurance group, its failure to gain a banking
licence, and the collapse of its alliance with the mutual pension group,
SPP. Its problems were highlighted this week when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency, downgraded the company's senior debt and claims-paying
ability.
Mr Thunell, 46, is widely admired in the Swedish financial community for his
stewardship of Securum, which was formed in early 1993 as a home for the
failed loans within state-owned Nordbanken.
Mr Thunell said yesterday that Trygg's domestic insurance business was
'sound,' but he was reticent on his plans for the group.
One of his main priorities will be to find a strategic co-operation partner,
allowing Trygg to reduce its 64.5 per cent stake in Home.

Iri, the state holding company, did not specify why the offers were
unacceptable. But in a statement issued late on Wednesday night after a
board meeting, the company said any of the original potential buyers -
including those which did not lodge a formal offer - could renew their
interest by Monday.
Iri said it hoped to conclude negotiations for the purchase of the GS
supermarkets and Autogrill catering business by October 20.
Both consortia interested in the sale had already suffered setbacks. Pam,
the privately-owned Italian retailer, decided to pull out of its agreement
with Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding company, and Movenpick,
the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, at the last moment.
Pam, which could now put in an offer for part of GS-Autogrill, was replaced
in the consortium by Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of the
banking group San Paolo di Torino.
The other consortium consisted of La Rinascente, the quoted Italian
retailer, Ferrero, the Italian confectionery group, and FinComit, the
merchant banking operation of Banca Commerciale Italiana. In an earlier form
it also included Centromarca, an alliance of Italian consumer brands.
Financial advisers have already criticised the Italian authorities for the
structure of the GS-Autogrill sale, the final part of the tortuous break-up
and privatisation of SME.
Last year, Iri had to abandon a first attempt to sell GS-Autogrill - valued
at more than L2,000bn - because it received inadequate offers.
Iri has successfully used the tactic of private negotiations before in
selling off specialised parts of the state-owned steel industry.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: LVMH posts 36% rise in net
income
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LVMH, one of the world's largest luxury goods companies, yesterday confirmed
a sharp increase in first-half profits, recording a 36 per cent rise in net
income to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 240m).
Including an exceptional gain from January's acquisition by Guinness of the
UK of a 34 per cent stake in Moet Hennessy, net income was FFr4.75bn. Sales
rose from FFr10.04bn to FFr12bn.
The French company, which forecast the rise in profits earlier this month,
said the result reflected improved sales and profits across its divisions.
The Champagne and wines division increased income from FFr86m to FFr118m and
the cognac and spirits division raised earnings from FFr781m to FFr912m.
Income from luggage and leather goods rose from FFr968m to FFr1.39bn, while
perfumes and beauty products increased earnings from FFr326m to FFr352m.
LVMH said the latter increase reflected the success of recent product
launches. The rise in champagne and wine earnings was attributable to the
impact of lower grape prices and production costs and stronger demand, while
a rebound in Japanese sales was cited as the principal reason for
improvement in the cognac and spirits operations.

<TEXT>
Kendall Square Research, a struggling US supercomputer manufacturer, has
closed its computer business and said that it may be forced to seek
protection from its creditors under US bankruptcy laws.
It is the second US supercomputer company to face a financial crisis. Last
month Thinking Machines, a pioneer of massively parallel supercomputer
technology, filed for bankruptcy protection.
Kendall Square said that its chief executive had resigned and the company
yesterday laid off most of its workers, leaving a staff of 50.
The company said that the decision to cease manufacturing and sales
operations was reached 'in light of the failure to receive expected orders
and the inability of the company to raise additional capital'.
The supercomputer maker, once seen as a promising company in the emerging
MPP supercomputer market, became embroiled in an accounting debacle last
year when it disclosed that prior sales had been overstated.
Kendall said that it would continue to service and support its customers and
that it would continue efforts to license its core technologies to other
computer and networking companies.

MacMillan Bloedel, the western Canadian forest products group, has agreed to
sell its remaining 51 per cent stake in Harmac Pacific, the Vancouver-based
pulp producer, for CDollars 192m (USDollars 143.2m).
Macblo and Harmac will together sell 76,500 warrants to a syndicate of
Canadian securities dealers.
Each warrant is exercisable into a unit consisting of 100 Harmac common
shares and a CDollars 1,000 convertible debenture.
Macblo will sell its Harmac shares for CDollars 15.125 per share, payable in
three instalments.
Each Dollars 1,000 principal amount of the debentures is convertible at any
time after the exercise of the special warrants into 60.061 shares. Of the
total proceeds, Macblo will receive CDollars 115.7m, and Harmac CDollars
76.5m.
Harmac was formed earlier this year as a vehicle for Macblo to spin off the
bulk of its pulp operations. Macblo sold 49 per cent of Harmac to the public
last May.
Mr Bob Findlay, Macblo's president, said the divestiture of the pulp
operations would enable the company to concentrate on its building
materials, packaging and groundwood paper businesses.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sogeti trims losses at halfway
stage

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), the French-based computing services company,
yesterday announced an improvement in first-half results, cutting net losses
to FFr115m (Dollars 21.78m) compared with a deficit of FFr197m in the first
six months of 1993.
Mr Geoff Unwin, chief operating officer, said that the company had gained
momentum towards recovery after losses of FFr430m last year. He said that
the group, in which Daimler-Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, should
return to profit in 1995.
The first-half improvement reflected a radical reorganisation of the group's
operations. Revenues were also helped by an improved economic environment in
some of its principal markets.
Total revenues slipped to FFr5.05bn in the first six months of 1994 from
FFr5.53bn in the first half of 1993. Operating income climbed to FFr194m
from FFr121m.
According to Mr Unwin, the decline in revenues was reversed in the second
quarter of the year and that improvement continued through July and August.
He cited several positive factors, including the successful introduction of
new service offerings such as information systems management.
Profitability was improved through the merger of its loss-making German
subsidiary, Cap Debis, with Debis Systemhaus, the software arm of
Daimler-Benz. As a result, the 49 per cent stake of CGS in Cap Debis was
reduced to 19.6 per cent in the merged company.
Mr Unwin said the group's Genesis restructuring programme, launched in
mid-1992, was beginning to yield results. The programme, which involved the
creation of geographical business centres and the absorption of ambitious
acquisitions made at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, has allowed the
company to transfer expertise more rapidly to its various markets.
CGS said its order book had strengthened significantly since the beginning
of the year and that its financial position had been reinforced following a
FFr1.5bn capital increase in May. But price competition remained fierce,
partly reflecting the entry of computer hardware manufacturers into the
sector.

<TEXT>
Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steelmaker, took advantage of the steady
economic recovery in Europe with a profits turnround in the first half of
this year.
The company announced yesterday a BFr277m (Dollars 8.68m) net profit for the
first half of 1994 after registering a loss of BFr3bn in the same period in
1993. Consolidated turnover rose by 13 per cent, to BFr84.7bn from
BFr74.9bn.
The turnround underlines an upturn in the automotive sector and a gradual
improvement in steel prices in Europe. The company said its cash flow had
risen to BFr5.8m in the first half of 1994 compared with BFr1.7m over the
same period in 1993.
Cockerill said it had carried out its planned BFr22bn investment programme.
Group debts rose to BFr9.6bn, compared with BFr8.1bn to the end of December
1993. Shareholders' funds stood at BFr62.8bn.
This week, Cockerill put in a bid for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's
loss-making steel mill. The bid price was not disclosed, nor is it clear if
the Belgian steelmaker is the only party interested in acquiring Eko Stahl.
Cockerill's parent company also increased turnover to BFr34.4bn in the first
half compared with BFr28.8bn. It posted a net profit of BFr8m compared with
a loss of BFrr2.7m.

a SFr228.6m (Dollars 178.50m) loss for the period ended August 31.
The loss arose entirely from unrealised losses on the market value of its

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden sceptical over Kazarian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Kazarian, the US investor trying to launch a last-minute bid for
Borden, the troubled food group, has told the company he is prepared to
offer between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 for each Borden share.
The offer is considerably more than the Dollars 14.25 a share bid launched
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist,
last week.
Presenting himself as a potential white knight, Mr Kazarian said that he and
his Rhode Island investment firm, Japonica Partners, wanted to take a stake
of between 20 and 90 per cent.
Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster
consumer products group, said he had a plan for rebuilding Borden that
should increase the value of its equity to between Dollars 22 and Dollars 25
a share in 1995.
Borden's management, however, remains sceptical. It says that Mr Kazarian
has yet to make any firm proposal, and that he has given no indications of
how an offer would be financed.
The company's meeting with Mr Kazarian comes at a time when some of Borden's
shareholders have become increasingly vocal in their complaints against the
terms of KKR's offer.
Some institutional investors have given notice that they will refuse to
tender their shares to KKR when the offer formally opens.
Borden's board was due to meet late yesterday evening to approve a definite
merger agreement with KKR ahead of today's deadline.
The company's shares were ahead Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 in early
trading.

jobs

<TEXT>
Northrop Grumman, the US defence group formed earlier this year through the
Dollars 2.2bn merger of the Northrop and Grumman defence companies,
yesterday announced that it would reduce its workforce of 47,500 employees
by 9,000 over the next 15 months.
Mr Kent Kresa, chairman and chief executive, called the move a 'painful but
necessary step' in the increasingly competitive defence contracting
environment.
Last month Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the three biggest US defence
contractors, announced plans for a Dollars 10bn merger.
Northrop Grumman said about 1,000 of its planned job cuts resulted directly
from the merger of Northrop and Grumman, mainly through the closure of
Grumman's corporate office and the dissolution of the former Grumman
aerospace and electronics group announced earlier in the year.
Jobs at Grumman's Long Island operations in New York will be cut by 3,500,
of which 2,500 will go by the end of this year. Northrop Grumman said about
two-thirds of the cuts resulted from a restructuring announced by Grumman
before the merger with Northrop.
In California, job cuts are expected to total about 4,500, of which 700 will
take place before the year end. The figure includes the previously reported
reduction of 2,400 employees assigned to the B-2 stealth bomber programme,
1,600 job cuts in the military aircraft division in Hawthorn, and 500 job
cuts in the Hawthorn electronics unit.
Northrop Grumman also announced that changes to its early retirement plan
and the offer of early retirement to 5,000 employees would result in a
one-time charge of Dollars 300m in its fourth quarter if 60 per cent of
employees accepted the offer. The precise amount would not be known until
after the acceptance deadline of November 15.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hoechst plans to lift margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Hoechst group plans to increase profitability in its healthcare
division by reducing research spending and squeezing more synergies from its
domestic businesses and its French subsidiary, Roussel Uclaf.
Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, head of the pharmaceuticals division, said he planned
to increase gross operating margins, currently around 10 per cent of sales,
to 14 per cent within three years.
The research and development budget would be trimmed by up to 4 per cent
this year. Rises on the scale of last year's 16 per cent, taking the total
to DM1.6bn (Dollars 1bn), were no longer affordable in the current business
environment, he told a press conference. He aimed to reduce the annual total
to about DM1.3bn.
Research would be more sharply focused on a specific, limited range of
projects to avoid overlaps and duplication, he added. The French group would
in future process all work on anti-infective preparations while Hoechst
would be responsible for cardiovascular agents.
Discussions were not yet complete on which companies would take charge of
immunology, inflammation, osteoporosis and rheumatology work.
Mr Godard claimed European plant running costs could be reduced by up to 20
per cent by better co-ordination of production between Hoechst, and its
Behring and Roussel Uclaf subsidiaries.
The Hoechst and Roussel drugs operations are already being merged into joint
ventures in the UK and Italy. Starting next year, the Belgian, Greek, Dutch,
Portuguese and Spanish businesses would be merged under a single management
team.
Including a reduction of 800 in the workforce, the rationalisation measures
were expected to save the group DM200m a year, Mr Godard said.
On future strategy, he said the group had to improve its position in the US,
where it generated only 6 per cent of sales and had a 1 per cent market
share.
Mr Karl-Gerhard Seifert, the Hoechst main board director responsible for
drugs, said that in spite of moves by German competitors, the group had no
plans to establish a generic drugs business in the domestic market. It was
first and foremost a producer of innovative pharmaceuticals, he said.
However, a new stake in Copley of the US and Britain's Arthur Cox company
meant the group was strtegically well-placed in the world market for
out-of-patent drugs, Mr Seifert claimed.

Kredietbank, Belgium's third largest bank, boosted consolidated net profits
by 8.7 per cent to BFr5.4bn (Dollars 170m) for the first half of 1994,
writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
The earnings growth was largely due to a strong performance in customer
services, as well as tight control of costs and a cut in write-downs and
provisions. Second-half profit is expected to match the first.
The bank's performance was held back by disappointing results on 'certain
financial operations for own account,' with current gross income falling 0.6
per cent. Kredietbank blamed uncertainty in the financial markets and the
rise in long-term interest rates.
Customer deposits rose 6.9 per cent to BFr1,365bn.

<TEXT>
Investment losses and restructuring costs drove Olivetti, the Italian
computer group, into a loss of L280.7bn (Dollars 180m) before tax in the
first half of 1994, more than L100bn higher than in the equivalent period
last year.
However, the group, headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, yesterday tried to
rally jaded investors by confirming its earlier forecasts that it was on
target to break even at operating level for the full year, after three years
of losses. In the first half, Olivetti recorded an operating loss of only
L6.2bn in the six months to June 30, against a loss of L119.4bn in the first
half of last year.
Olivetti shares have come under intense pressure recently because of
concerns about investment losses and global personal computer price wars.
As expected, Olivetti had to take a L103bn extraordinary loss in the first
half on its investment portfolio, which the group maintains in reserve for
unexpected restructuring and acquisitions. Olivetti will also have to record
a L30bn extraordinary loss in the second half to cover hedging operations
carried out to prevent further investment losses. 'We have been unfortunate,
like 95 per cent of the money managers in the world,' the group said
yesterday.
Total extraordinary charges amounted to L231bn against only L5bn in the
first half of 1993, when the group's pre-tax loss was L168.1bn.
Restructuring at Olivetti, which has cut its workforce from 59,000 to 35,000
in the last five years, cost a further L100bn or so in the first half of
1994, and is likely to continue into the first half of next year. But sales,
general and administrative costs are now equivalent to only 20.6 per cent of
first-half turnover, against 28 per cent in 1992. Olivetti expects costs to
come down to as little as 18 per cent of sales by the middle of 1995.
Olivetti's consolidated turnover in the first half rose to L4,146bn, up 7.8
per cent on the equivalent period if adjusted for divestments. The group
said yesterday that it had anticipated about 90 per cent of the recent price
cuts in the international personal computer market, and pointed out that its
products division had lifted turnover by 9.7 per cent, helped by a 34.5 per
cent rise in personal computer sales.
Sales of the systems and services divisions - which account for about 60 per
cent of annual turnover - grew by 6.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent
respectively.
The shares closed yesterday at L2,008, before the results were known, down
L30 on the day.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Accor talks stumble over Suez
bid for more control

<TEXT>
The relationship between Accor, the French hotels group, and Suez, its
biggest shareholder, has been called into question following an apparent
breakdown in negotiations concerning an increase in the stake held by Suez
in its long-term partner.
The two companies had been discussing an increase in Suez's participation
aimed at providing a solid core shareholder for Accor.
But the negotiations ran into trouble concerning the extent to which Suez
would play a management role, and Accor said that it had become clear to
both parties that they could not move ahead. 'They wanted powers of decision
which we could not accept,' Accor said.
Suez declined to comment on the state of the talks, but said it would make
an announcement on Monday concerning the future of its 12.4 per cent stake
in Suez, held through Societe Generale de Belgique, its Belgian subsidiary.
Industry observers in Paris said that the rupture of negotiations could
prompt Suez to reduce its stake in Accor. 'If they haven't reached
agreement, then a sale of some of its stake seems likely, although it may
not be immediate,' said Mr Jean-Jaques Vironda, leisure analyst at Societe
Generale in Paris.
According to Mr Vironda, the disagreement between the two companies revealed
the fragility of Accor's shareholding structure.
The Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state financial institution
which is Accor's second biggest shareholder, is widely thought to want to
sell its stake.
Suez was regarded as a stable core shareholder, but Mr Gerard Worms,
chairman, demanded a significant management role in Accor and a strong
influence in designating the eventual successor to Mr Paul Dubrule and
Gerard Pelisson, the co-chairmen who have built the company into one of
France's leading hotel chains.

<TEXT>
Oesterreichische Elek-trizitatswirtschafts (Verbund), the Austrian electric
power generation and transmission group, has reported a near doubling of
first-half net profit to Sch626m (Dollars 57m) from Sch346m on revenues down
1.6 per cent to Sch9.3bn.
However, it warned that its performance in the second half would be
considerably worse because dry weather forced a 25 per cent to 30 per cent
cut in domestic hydraulic production in July, August and the first half of
September.
The main reason for the strong profit improvement in the first half was the
abolition of the national trade and asset tax at the beginning of the year.
This knocked Sch288m off the group's tax bill.
Verbund is 51 per cent state owned.

Credit Commercial de France, the French banking group, yesterday reported
net profits up 8.6 per cent to FFr585.6m (Dollars 110.9m) for the first half
of 1994 compared to the same period last year.
Mr Charles de Croisset, who took over as chairman last year, said the bank
had followed a prudent policy and the profits and quality of its loan risks
were good. 'Difficult is not the word,' he said.
He said the results marked the return to the 'more classic' performance of
the bank after an 'exceptional' period last year in the markets and from
sharply higher provisions related to regional banking.
Net banking income was unchanged at FFr4.6bn, but operating costs rose 4.2
per cent to FFr3.12bn, which reduced operating profits after depreciation by
7.8 per cent to FFr148bn for the six months to the end of June 1994.
Net new provisions declined by 37 per cent to FFr484m, compared with FFr769m
in the first half last year and from FFr662.8m in the first half of 1992.
Balance sheet assets were up to FFr337bn from FFr318.7bn. Deposits during
the first half rose 15.1 per cent to FFr74.2bn compared with FFr64.5bn last
time. Credits in the same period rose 2.6 per cent to FFr90.5bn.
Mr de Croisset also said that he believed the prospects for the French
economy were healthy, with all the indicators suggesting a recovery.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Generali profits climb to L422bn
at halfway
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Parent company profits at Generali, the Italian insurer which is the
country's biggest quoted company, rose to L422.3bn (Dollars 271m) before tax
in the first half of 1994, compared with L410.2bn in the equivalent period
last year.
The company said ordinary operations had performed well, but like all
financial companies, Generali's investment portfolio has been punished by
difficult markets and rising interest rates.
On June 30, the end of the first half, the group's unrealised gains on its
share portfolio stood at L7,050bn, but since then some L350bn has been wiped
off the value of its holdings. By mid-September, the company said its
unrealised gains stood at L6,700bn.
At the halfway stage, Generali does not give full consolidated group
figures, but it said aggregate group premiums had increased by 15.3 per cent
to L15,696bn in the first half, of which L11,183bn came from outside Italy.
Gross parent company premiums in the first half increased to L4,891bn, a
rise of 4.2 per cent if exchange rate differences are evened out. Life
premiums rose to L2,028bn and non-life to L2,863bn.
Generali's investments in the first half increased by 5 per cent to
L32,123bn, but the increase in income was comparatively sluggish. Net of
financial charges, the income rose 3 per cent to L1,251bn.
'Activities in Italy have shown a satisfactory development in the life
operations,' the company said in a statement yesterday. 'However, the
progress of the non-life operations has been modest, although a recovery is
expected in the second half.'
Insurance companies are expected to be among the main beneficiaries of the
Italian government's efforts to reform the Italian pensions sector, which
should lead to more private pension schemes.
Generali's shares closed before the release of the half-year results at
L39,519, against an opening price of L39,976.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: MDIS misses target with Pounds 5m -
Disappointed market knocks 49% off share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based
computing services group, halved in value yesterday after interim results
which were substantially below market expectations.
The shares fell by 49 per cent from 216p to 112p.
On Wednesday, Aerostructures Hamble, the former British Aerospace aircraft
components subsidiary, floated in May, suffered a 50p drop in its share
price to 73p, after it warned of difficulties with several contracts.
Pre-tax profits at MDIS for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 5.1m - 33
per cent down on the Pounds 7.53m achieved in the comparable period, and up
to Pounds 4m short of analysts' forecasts.
Mr Jerry Causley, chairman, pointed to delays in decision making in the
public sector, which had pushed a number of orders into the second half of
the year, and a failure to sell more copies of its flagship banking software
package. There would be some improvement in the second half, but full-year
results would inevitably be below those of 1993.
MDIS is the latest in a series of computing services companies which have
produced disappointing and unexpected results after floating.
Turnover fell to Pounds 68.6m (Pounds 70.4m). Earnings were 28 per cent down
at 3.38p (4.86p). An interim dividend of 2.3p will be paid.
MDIS came to the market in March at 260p a share through a placing and
public offering which valued the group at Pounds 260m.
The placing and offer was the biggest in the information technology sector
this year. The company had previously been the subject of a management
buy-out from McDonnell Douglas of the US.
Mr Causley said the underlying performance had been strong, with trading
margins maintained in the public sector, commercial and industrial business
areas.
Some of its current difficulties are expected to be resolved in the second
half, when a number of public sector orders, including four large police
contracts, are expected to come through. Research and development, on which
an extra Pounds 750,000 was spent in the first half, is expected to return
to budget.
Mr Causley warned, however: 'Local government business has been impacted by
increasing uncertainty following the Banham Commissions's recommendations
and the health business, following a good first half is also seeing slippage
in order confirmations.'
The performance of the banking package PRO-IV is critical. MDIS made its
first sale to the Austrian Kontrol Bank last year, but has failed to find
other buyers.
The complete package costs up to Pounds 5m, so a small number of orders
could make a significant difference to the year's outcome.
MDIS's broker, NatWest Markets, has cut its estimate of pre-tax profit for
the year to Pounds 17m - 11.4p of earnings - from Pounds 25.7m, and
anticipates only Pounds 19m in 1995.
It predicts a dividend of 7p a share for both years.

A turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 198,000 to profits of Pounds
207,000 was announced by Hampden Group for the 24 weeks to June 18.

Earnings per share amounted to 0.93p compared with 0.89p losses while an
interim dividend of 0.2p (nil) is declared.
Hampden's shares, which trade on the USM, closed 2p higher at 30p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dagenham Motors Group has continued its recovery with pre-tax profits up 39
per cent from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.81m for the six months to June 30.
Turnover rose 20 per cent from Pounds 84.9m to Pounds 101.7m.
Sales of both new and used cars were up 17 per cent, with August figures
substantially ahead of last year, said Mr David Philip, chairman. The order
book indicated that sales in the second half would be 'at least as strong'.
Finance and insurance income from vehicle sales saw a 36 per cent increase,
partly due to 'more realistic underwriting policies'.
Following the rights issue in March, Dagenham acquired the Ford franchise
for Woking and Weybridge, fulfilling its aim to encircle London with a ring
of Ford and Iveco dealerships on the M25.
The interim dividend rises to 2p (1.75p) and earnings per share were 5.7p
(5p).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US demand lifts Ricardo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand from US car producers helped to lift turnover and pre-tax
profits at Ricardo, the consulting engineer, for the year to June 30.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.46m, up from Pounds 2.68m
last year, which included losses on discontinued operations and property
provisions. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits last year stood at
Pounds 4.11m.
Turnover was Pounds 62.9m against Pounds 65.6m including Pounds 5.59m from
discontinued operations. Sales were 82 per cent ahead in North America and
48 per cent in the Pacific Basin.
However, a good performance by the group's consulting engineers was offset
by a 26 per cent drop in turnover from its aerospace division, which now
aims to refocus on the industrial gas turbine market.
Sir Philip Foreman, chairman, said: 'We are pleased with these results which
have been achieved despite difficult trading conditions, but reflect the
strong organic growth potential of the business.'
In June the company announced a rights issue of 10.5m shares to help fund
the Pounds 13.6m acquisition of FF Developments, the transmission and
chassis engineer. Receipts from the issue helped to reduce gearing from 15
per cent to nil.
FF Developments is now charged with marketing the Ricardo Differential,
which was hailed last year as a 'revolutionary' limited slip differential
gear for family cars.
In March, Ricardo spent Dollars 2.26m (Pounds 1.43m) acquiring Airflow
Sciences Corporation. The Detroit-based company, which looks at fluid flow
and heat transfer problems, is expecting strong demand from power stations
which need to reduce emissions.
Earnings per share amounted to 8.4p (4p). The proposed final dividend is 4p
(3.8p) giving a total of 6p (5.7p).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Geest warns of second half loss - Shares
fall as damage to banana production takes toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aftermath of the tropical storm that severely damaged banana production
in the Windward Islands will push Geest, the fresh and chilled food group,
into the red in the second half.
Shares fell 30p to 190p yesterday following the warning from Mr David
Sugden, chief executive, who presented a strong set of interim results.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 17.9m for the six months to
July 2 on turnover ahead at Pounds 353.8m (Pounds 332.7m).
'The business has been performing well, but is overshadowed by considerable
uncertainty,' said Mr Sugden, referring to the European Commission's laxity
in responding to the company's plea for permission to purchase replacement
bananas in Latin America.
The EC banana management committee failed to agree on Wednesday on measures
that would allow Geest to purchase alternative bananas from Latin America
under the EC quota system. The committee does not meet again until October
5.
Tropical Storm Debbie hit the Windward Islands earlier this month, causing
extensive flooding around St Lucia and damage to roads and bridges. Geest,
which is under contract to ship all the islands' bananas, estimates that
output will be 40 per cent down.
Last week the first ship to arrive since the storm was half full. The
company is expecting to load only 2,400 tonnes a week, compared with a
normal load of 4,000 tonnes.
The first half, however, showed the company recovering from the
uncertainties surrounding the EC banana regime, introduced last July, as
well as an attack of disease on its Costa Rican plantations, which left it
Pounds 5.4m in the red at the end of last year. Operating profits in the
fresh produce division improved from Pounds 2m to Pounds 15m on sales of
Pounds 285.6m (Pounds 276.5m).
The food preparation division, which supplies chilled salads and other
products, lifted operating profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.2m on sales
of Pounds 66.6m (Pounds 54.4m).
The result this time included an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.5m from a
disposal. Net interest payable rose from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 3.2m.
Earnings per share were 18.9p (2.7p). The interim dividend is unchanged at
3.7p.
COMMENT
While the problems of disease in Costa Rica appear to have gone away,
Geest's troubles with the European Commission and the banana regime are not
over yet, thanks to Tropical Storm Debbie. In spite of its successful
efforts to boost its food preparation division, the group remains vulnerable
to the banana industry, which is highly political and subject to natural
disaster. It has also only two main areas of supply, leaving it looking
inflexible beside companies that source more widely. Adding to its problems
is gearing of more than 100 per cent. Best guesses at this year's final
outcome seem to be around Pounds 9m of profits - better than last year but a
far cry from 1991's Pounds 26.2m.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Alumasc rises 18% and makes Pounds 7m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alumasc Group, the Kettering-based company, capped a year of 18 per cent
profits growth with the acquisition of Pendock Profiles for a maximum of
Pounds 7m.
Pre-tax profits for this company with interests in building products, beer
kegs and precision components were Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 7.55m) for the year
to June 30. Turnover rose 21 per cent to Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 44.9m) with MR
Holdings, acquired in September 1993, contributing Pounds 6.1m.
A final dividend of 4.45p is proposed making a total of 6.5p (5.875p) paid
from earnings per share of 19p (16.9p).
Alumasc is paying an initial Pounds 4m in cash for Pendock, a casing and
trunking systems maker. There is a further profit-related payment to a
maximum of Pounds 3m in loan notes.
During the year to last December, Pendock, a privately owned company formed
in 1986, made operating profits of Pounds 600,000 on sales of Pounds 3.4m.
Net assets at December 31 were Pounds 230,000. Based in Telford, Shropshire,
it employs 34 people.
Alumasc's operating profits rose to Pounds 8.66m (Pounds 7.28m) including
Pounds 1.17m from MR. The sharpest rise came from the building products side
to Pounds 4.6m from Pounds 3.1m, on the back of increased activity in the
construction industry. Alumasc managed to hold its margins firm helped by
bringing on stream new products.
Precision components profits were held back by investment in new plant and
equipment, the benefits of which should be seen this year. Profits from the
traditional beer keg business rose 3 per cent.
At the end of the financial year, net cash balances of Pounds 7.6m and
shareholders' funds of Pounds 23.3m, a rise of 8.4 per cent over the year.
Mr John McCall, chairman, said: 'Alumasc will now benefit from any growth in
the UK economy' but warned of 'the challenge of handling rising raw material
costs'.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved AB Electron behind TT's 58% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at TT Group jumped by 58 per cent from Pounds 9.42m to Pounds 14.9m
in the six months to July 2, reflecting the continued turnround at AB
Electronics, acquired for Pounds 38.6m, including debt, in January 1993.
Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 10.2p (7.8p) and the dividend is
up 23 per cent at 3.2p (2.6p).
The main improvement came from the electronics and industrial division,
which includes AB and Magnetic Materials, acquired in August 1992. Profits
jumped from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 10.8m. On increased sales of Pounds 169m
(Pounds 149m) margins improved from 4.8 per cent to 6.3 per cent.
Mr John Newman, joint chief executive, said he expected further improvements
in margins, though AB has some long-term contracts at low margins and a
large board assembly business.
AB's automotive business was back in profit and had won climate control
contracts with Saab and Opel.
Mr Newman said there were significant opportunities for AB in export
markets. A new sales office was opened in Singapore at the beginning of the
year to boost sales in east Asia.
The resistor business, which joined the group with Crystalate, the
electronic components company acquired in 1990, is doing very well in North
America, but France remains weak.
The division was expanded last month via the Pounds 16m acquisition of Dale
Electric.
TT said the improvement in its companies reflected the benefits of capital
expenditure against a background of 'some hesitancy in the improvement of
world economies.'
Profits from packaging and building services edged ahead to Pounds 4.22m
(Pounds 4.2m) and Pounds 406,000 (Pounds 381,000) respectively.
Group operating profit rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 11.8m), while the
interest bill dropped to Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 2.33m) following last year's
Pounds 51.4m rights issue.
TT still has net cash of nearly Pounds 4m after the Dale deal and Mr Newman
said there were a large number of acquisition opportunities with prices
'much better' than earlier in the year. 'But we will get Dale bedded down
before we do our next major acquisition.'
The shares rose 5p to 377p.
A one for two capitalisation issue is proposed.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong sales help Spandex score Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spandex, the distributor of computerised sign-making equipment, increased
pre-tax profits by a third to Pounds 3.3m in the first half on the back of
strong sales in most of its main markets.
Turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 33.9m, with an underlying rise of 11 per
cent boosted by the acquisition in March of what is now Spandex France.
Earnings per share increased by 37 per cent to 6.3p (4.6p) and the interim
dividend edged up to 0.75p (0.7p).
Mr Charles Dobson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Performance in all
territories continues to advance and as the economic climate improves
Spandex will benefit further.'
In the UK sales overall were up by 21 per cent. Sign-making computers surged
by 58 per cent, which the company attributed partly to the release of
pent-up demand previously stifled by economic uncertainty.
The increase also reflected the introduction of the Gerber Edge product.
Sales in Germany rose by 6 per cent in local currency terms and Spandex is
to spend Pounds 2.1m on a warehouse which should be completed in the first
quarter of next year.
The net interest bill fell from Pounds 293,000 to Pounds 67,000.
Increased capital expenditure will push up gearing in the short term, but
the company stressed that:'The expected rise in net debt is foreseen as
being well within historic highs.'
The shares, which have trebled in the last two years, added 5p to an
all-time high of 280p.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Jeyes falls Pounds 1.3m into red and chief
executive replaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Jeyes Group plunged to their lowest levels in almost six years, as
the cleaning products company fell into the red for the first half and
announced the resignation of the chief executive who led the Pounds 5m
buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes in 1986.
Mr Jimmy Moir, the Scottish entrepreneur credited with turning round Jeyes
after the buy-out, is to be replaced by Mr David Callear, former deputy
chief executive and finance director. Mr Moir will remain deputy chairman.
Mr Callear was brought in to Jeyes after the May profits warning which took
11 per cent of the group's share price.
Yesterday, the market knocked a further 25 per cent off the shares which
closed at xxx. This is the lowest since January 1989, and compares with a
high over the last 18 months of 471p.
Mr Callear said the first half results had been disappointing. Jeyes
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.27m, against profits of Pounds 374,000,
after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.7m for marketing expenses and stock.
Sales were 2 per cent higher at Pounds 59m for the 28 weeks to July 16.
He warned that the long-awaited recovery was still some way away. 'Trading
remains difficult,' he said. 'We are still under pressure.'
Jeyes has suffered from intense competition from supermarkets and
discounters selling cheaper own label and generic products. The group
undertook a restructuring 18 months ago, which was now largely complete.
In the first half, the group had realised savings of about Pounds 1.75m, Mr
Callear said. However, increasing costs of operations such as logistics
meant savings for the full year might not be much greater.
Mr Callear said Jeyes was confident that in spite of the tough trading
environment it would be able to make progress. 'We are able to see the light
at the end of the tunnel,' he said. 'There might have been a time when it
was difficult to locate the tun-nel.'
Margins, which fell by about 2.5 percentage points in the first half, had
begun to stabilise, but at lower levels.
The interim dividend was held at 3.3p. Losses per share were 4.3p against
earnings of 1.2p last time.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Multipart turns in Pounds 1.5m in maiden
results since rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multipart, the UK vehicle parts distribution company rescued from the
collapse last year of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, achieved a
net profit of Pounds 1.5m on a turnover of Pounds 48m in its first trading
period, the five months to the end of December, 1993.
It has long-term supply contracts with the three manufacturing businesses
salvaged from the former Daf group, namely LDV, the Birmingham-based van
producer, Leyland Trucks, the Lancashire truck assembler, and Daf Trucks,
the Dutch heavy truck maker.
Multipart said that it was seeking to expand by winning additional logistics
contracts both inside and outside the motor industry. The company is
investing Pounds 5m in computer systems.
Multipart was rescued by a management buy-in team led by Mr Alan Simpson,
former managing director of Land Rover Parts, with the backing of Pounds
17.3m in equity capital provided by Phildrew Ventures, the UK venture
capital arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, and a Pounds 20m long-term loan
from National Westminster.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law advances to Pounds 2.82m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towry Law, the independent financial advice chain which floated last
November, reported pre-tax profits up 16 per cent from Pounds 2.43m to
Pounds 2.82m, after listing costs of Pounds 237,000.
Mr Cecil Law, chairman, said: 'this has not been an easy year. Both our UK
financial planning and general insurance broking divisions are operating in
what are currently difficult markets, created by such factors as an
unsettled investment climate and rate softening in general insurance.'
The company has plans for a 'major cost management programme', which will
hit profitability in the first half of the year, and could involve some job
losses. It also plans to invest more in information technology, training and
compliance.
However, Mr Law said encouraging signs for the company included a 13 per
cent increase in new business, a 16 per cent rise to Pounds 6.2m for renewal
income and fees, and 34 per cent growth in income from international
financial planning.
Mr Alan Wesley, chief executive, said that although Towry Law did not expect
to have to pay any compensation as a result of the SIB enquiry into pension
transfers, it had made a 'substantial provision' for the extra cost of
temporary staff who might be needed to re-examine old files to comply with
SIB rulings.
Trading profits rose 26 per cent to Pounds 3.06m. Earnings per share grew 14
per cent to 11.6p (10.2p). A final dividend of 3p (1.8p) makes a total of
4.5p (3.6p) - a 25 per cent gain.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: EW Fact shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in EW Fact fell 31p to 103p yesterday after the professional tuition
company reported lower than anticipated interim results and warned that the
second half would also be below expectations.
The company said that student enrolments had been disappointing as a result
of changes in an accountancy syllabus and the recession causing low
recruitment of trainees and restricted training budgets.
The first half had also included full provision for litigation relating to
Vatax Advisory Services, a dormant subsidiary.
Turnover for the first half of 1994 advanced to Pounds 5.04m (Pounds 2.44m)
including Pounds 2.66m from acquisitions. The figures included almost a full
contribution from Accountancy Tutors, acquired in January.
Pre-tax profits doubled to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 602,000) but the placing and
open offer to fund the purchase left earnings per share lower at 4.37p
against 5.36p.
However, the group remains confident of prospects and the interim dividend
is raised to 1.94p (1.76p).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine at Pounds 3.1m for eight
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred McAlpine, the housebuilding and construction group, yesterday
reported a rise in pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m for the eight months to
June 30. The company has changed its year-end to December and for the six
months to April 30 1994 there were pre-tax profits of Pounds 894,000 against
losses of Pounds 2.74m.
Turnover for the eight months was Pounds 449.7m, against Pounds 316.6m for
the six months to April 1994. The dividend is held at 3p, payable from
earnings per share of 3.1p.
The company raised Pounds 25m from shareholders in June in order to fund its
land purchasing programme.
Net debt at June 30 stood at Pounds 49.5m, representing gearing of 27 per
cent.
Sir John Milne, the chairman said that the contracting and construction
division continued to endure tough trading conditions, resulting in
operating losses for the eight months of Pounds 1.95m on turnover of Pounds
291.6m.
For the corresponding six months of the previous year there were operating
losses of Pounds 121,000 on turnover of Pounds 148.3m.
Mr Ken Lever, finance director, said it would be some time before the
division returned to the black. 'There are a lot of contracts being
undertaken on low margins. It may be 1996 before we see any return to
profitability.'
He added that the company was keeping under review all areas of its
contracting business and those unable to show a potential to return to
profits faced possible closure. He refused to elaborate on which areas of
the business were most susceptible.
The strong recovery in the housing market in the early part of the year had
weakened during June and July, Mr Milne said, but higher sales reservations
in August boded well for the traditionally stronger market in the autumn.
Operating profits in the housing division were Pounds 7.82m on turnover of
Pounds 82.7m. For the first six months last year, the figures were Pounds
2.04m and Pounds 43.04m respectively. Mr Lever said the division would
remain the engine of growth for the group while the rest of the business
stabilised.
In the US, an operating loss of Pounds 545,000 was reported on turnover of
Pounds 50.2m.
Mr Lever said improvements in the contracting business would enable the US
business to return to profitability in the second half, although it would
not improve on 1993's contribution. Then pre-tax profits came in at Pounds
1.68m and operating profits were Pounds 1.33m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Norcor Holdings, the corrugated board manufacturer, more
than doubled for the half year ended June 30, from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds
4.01m.
The rise was due to an exceptional gain of Pounds 3.1m, representing
interest waived by venture capital loan note holders at the time of the
company's flotation in May. The gain itself was partly offset by an
exceptional interest charge of Pounds 500,000.
Operating profits were down 41 per cent, from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 1.51m,
on reduced turnover of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 20.3m).
Earnings per share were 24.3p (10.6p). The maiden dividend will be
recommended with the final results.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Heritage setback in second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A setback to trading in the second half resulted in a loss for the period at
Heritage, the USM-quoted housewares distributor.
On sales up from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.7m, the company reported a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 105,000 for the year to April 30. This compared
with Pounds 115,000 at the midway stage, which was also the same sum as for
the whole of the previous year.
The company said trading had been affected by a kiln explosion at its main
ceramic supplier and poor sales and lower margins at the discount end of the
market.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.85p, compared with 2.14p.

A return to more normal trading enabled Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels, the
USM-quoted maker of enamel boxes, to turnround from a Pounds 186,000 loss to
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 33,000 for the first half of 1994.
Turnover grew 40 per cent to Pounds 2.49m and earnings per share came to
0.1p (2.7p losses).
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, pointed out that because of the importance of
pre-Christmas trading, the company's profits were primarily obtained in the
second half. 'Sales and orders in the third quarter indicate that the full
year should end satisfactorily,' he added.

Midland Assets, which was created in May to acquire four nursing homes from

bigger healthcare company in the Midlands.
The deal is likely to leave Midland, whose shares closed last night
unchanged at 19p, with approaching 20 healthcare premises.
Midland initially raised Pounds 2.4m via an intermediaries offer of ordinary

Shares in Eadie Holdings fell by 20 per cent or 5p to 20p yesterday after
the general engineering group reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds
850,000 to Pounds 262,000 for the first half of 1994.
Mr Peter Bromwich, chairman, attributed the setback to the downturn suffered
on the roll cages and wheelchairs business, and interest charges up from
Pounds 129,000 to Pounds 167,000.
However, he was confident that actions taken in improving product and
manufacturing facilities, coupled with an increased order book in most of
the group, would lead to a second half improvement.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 13.45m (Pounds 13.55m). Earnings per
share declined to 0.32p (1.09p) but an unchanged interim dividend of 0.3p
has been declared.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Industrial Control rises 16% - Growth in
controls offset increased losses in specialist engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in the controls division enabled Industrial Control Services,
the safety systems, controls and specialist engineering company, to report a
16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.23m to Pounds 7.22m in
the year to May 31. The share price slipped 4p to close at 141p.
Mr Peter Hall, chairman and chief executive, said the rises in both profits
and group turnover - which expanded to Pounds 85.5m (Pounds 72.9m) - were
achieved on the back of strong growth in the controls division, which offset
increased losses in specialist engineering and a small decline in safety
systems profits.
However, he stressed that although the controls and safety systems markets
had not, in general, shown growth, the group had adopted a 'one-stop' policy
towards its products and markets. For example, an offshore oil or gas rig
could use the Bailey ICS joint venture to supply the process control, ICS
for the safety system, Brisco for the wellhead and subsea control, and
Transmitton for the 'intelligent' computers to oversee all this plant.
Most of the growth, Mr Hall said, came from retrofitting and upgrading
rather than new projects. Again, the Shell Supply contract for the updating
of platforms in the North Sea had performed strongly.
Although the Middle and Far East were showing the most growth in the world
and contributed about 40 per cent of group sales, the North Sea still
chipped in a similar percentage.
Profits in controls increased to Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 2.6m), which included
a full-year contribution of Pounds 316,000 from Brisco, acquired at the
beginning of 1993. Divisional turnover was up at Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 23m).
Safety systems made Pounds 5.44m (Pounds 5.55m) on turnover of Pounds 38m
(Pounds 39.5m), while specialist engineering incurred losses of Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 60,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.3m).
These losses, Mr Hall said, were mostly the result of heavy R&amp;D expenses at
Sava, which makes security devices for computer installations and which is
now seeing Dollars 250,000 of trading per month.
Earnings per share rose to 10.64p (9.76p) and a final dividend of 3.5p
(3.07p) makes a total of 5p (4.4p).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Higher margins lift PizzaExpress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An improvement in margins in all divisions of the PizzaExpress restaurant
chain helped lift pre-tax profits at the year end by 75 per cent and
turnover by 41 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 5.56m, including a Pounds
858,000 contribution from discontinued operations. Turnover rose from Pounds
15.7m to Pounds 26.8m with sales at company restaurants, which numbered 36
at the year end, rising by 14.5 per cent.
PizzaExpress came to the market in February last year in a reverse takeover
by Star Computer Group. In February this year Star Computer was sold for
Pounds 2.22m.
Mr David Page, managing director, said the Covent Garden and Salisbury
restaurants had got off to a 'spectacular' start. Margins in all operating
divisions had improved in the last year, although the company was mindful of
the 'value versus profit' equation, he said.
Mr Glen Tomlinson, finance director, said restaurant margins had improved
from 12 per cent to 20 per cent and from 16 per cent to 19 per cent in the
wholesale division. The improvement in restaurant margins was mainly due to
increased sales combined with cuts in labour costs, he said.
Eight new restaurants were opened and five were acquired from franchises.
Capital expenditure stood at Pounds 4.5m and the average build cost of new
restaurants stood at Pounds 278,000.
Franchise fee income from the 37 franchised restaurants was 10.5 per cent
higher than last year. A further two franchises opened in Leicester and
Southampton in July.
Spend per customer rose from Pounds 8.40 to Pounds 8.53.
Mr Page said a target of 86 restaurants had been set for 1995, more than
half of which would be company owned. New sites had been identified in six
cities for company restaurants.
He said the company was aware that restaurants within greater London showed
a 'more immediate profit' than those outside. But PizzaExpress was commited
to 'spreading the gospel of good pizza throughout Great Britain'.
Earnings per share rose from 3.6p to 6.5p. A final dividend of 1p (nil) was
proposed.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nobo expands into Europe with Pounds 6m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobo Group, the office and business products supplier, is expanding into
continental Europe with the acquisition of the De Visu Companies, four
private companies based in France under common control, for an aggregate
Pounds 6m.
An initial consideration of Pounds 5.2m will be satisfied as to Pounds 3.9m
in cash and Pounds 1.3m by the issue of 544,746 new ordinary shares to the
vendors. The balance is profit-related.
Nobo also announced an open offer of 4.89m new ordinary shares on a 2-for-5
basis to raise about Pounds 10.2m net. The proceeds will finance the cash
element of the acquisition and a deferred Pounds 1m consideration for the
Elite Optics purchase, completed on September 13. The balance will be used
to reduce the enlarged group's debt.
The placing and open offer are fully underwritten by Granville Davies.
The De Visu Companies comprise De Visu, Lara Audiovisuel, Comevi and Artois.
They make visual display and training products and drawing office equipment.
For 1993 losses amounted to about Pounds 2m on turnover of about Pounds 18m.
Sales are principally to trade distributors within France, with about 10 per
cent relating to exports.
Nobo is also proposing that, following the acquisition, its share premium
account be reduced by Pounds 16m to Pounds 500,000 to be transferred to a
special capital reserve against which any goodwill may be written off.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: CRH makes Pounds 14m US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the Dublin-based construction and building materials group, has bought
Rotondo for Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 14.2m) in cash including assumed debt.
Rotondo is the leading supplier of precast concrete enclosures to telephone
and utility companies in the north east of the US. It is also a major
national supplier of precast concrete prison cells.
In the US, CRH's operations are organised under its holding company
Oldcastle, into four core business groups: architectural products,
materials, glass and precast. The Precast Group is a major supplier of
precast telecommunication, utility and environmental products in the Western
and south-eastern US.
Mr Myles Lee, general manager-finance, said the acquisition would extend the
geographical coverage of CRH's precast operations in the US. CRH already had
substantial precast activities in the west and south of the US, but wants to
increase its presence in the north, he said.
Mr Jim Schack, president of the CRH's precast group, said that the synergies
of bringing Rotondo and the Precast Group together involved not only
products and territories, but also the sharing of Rotondo's engineering and
production know-how with the group's other facilities in the US and
internationally.
CRH's shares closed up 3p at 361p.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson hemmed in to Pounds 18.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading conditions in the London insurance market hemmed in profit
growth at Lloyd Thompson Group last year, pre-tax profits rising 5 per cent
to Pounds 18.2m for the 12 months ended 30 June, 1994.
The result was in line with market expectations following a profits warning
in June and the shares slipped 1p to 169p.
The company also announced it is to purchase the remaining 80 per cent it
does not own in MIU, an associated company, for about Pounds 12.8m, which
will be satisfied by the issue of some 7.6m shares or 9.75 per cent of the
issued share capital. Lloyd Thompson has had 80 per cent management control
of MIU, which handles the insurance group's non-marine and non-US business,
since 1989.
Group turnover edged up 3 per cent to Pounds 42.41m (Pounds 41.14m) in the
year, while investment income declined 29 per cent to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds
5.96m).
Earnings per share fell from 14.8p to 14.36p, but the dividend was increased
by 16 per cent to 7.8p (6.7p), with a 5.4p final.
Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said that while trading conditions remained
tough, the group had achieved operating profits growth of 22 per cent to
Pounds 14m (Pounds 11.5m).
He added that the company would be attempting to widen its geographic
spread, looking to win more business in Latin America, Australia and South
Africa.
'We have reduced expenditure as much as we can and have got to expand
through our brokerage business,' he said.
Turnover from the marine insurance business increased 5 per cent to Pounds
18.27m (Pounds 17.35m), while the marine side grew 7 per cent to Pounds
12.56m (Pounds 11.75m). However, reinsurance turnover slipped 4 per cent to
Pounds 11.57m (Pounds 12.04m).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall 35% ahead at Pounds 2.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More O'Ferrall, the UK's biggest poster advertising group, increased profits
from its UK and Irish operations by 78 per cent, but interim profits were
held back by the impact of the recession in Europe.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose 35 per cent to Pounds
2.81m (Pounds 2.08m), on an increase of only 7 per cent in group turnover to
Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 31.6m).
The UK division was the driving force. The Advertising Association forecasts
a 7 per cent increase in the poster market this year, the highest since
1988, but More O'Ferrall lifted its UK and Irish revenues by 15 per cent,
and profits rose to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 958,000).
Mr Russel Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the group had succeeded in pushing
through meaningful price increases for poster space. It also benefited from
a programme of converting bus shelter sites to the higher value added Adshel
Superlite format.
The group is broadening its coverage of Ireland, having previously focused
on Dublin.
The Belgian market, its most profitable a year earlier, achieved flat
revenues and a marginal increase in operating profit, in Belgian franc
terms. Devaluation of the franc left its contribution virtually unchanged at
Pounds 1.13m.
France was worse affected, with operating profit well down at Pounds 256,000
(Pounds 603,000). Mr Gore-Andrews said cost-cuting measures had been put in
place that would reduce overheads by Pounds 500,000 per annum, and this
should benefit the performance in the second half of the year.
Taiwan continued to perform strongly, with operating profit rising from
Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 177,000, and More O'Ferrall is currently looking to
expand further into South East Asia.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 744,000 to Pounds 464,000, reflecting lower
interest rates and debt reduction. However, capital investment is on the
increase, with about Pounds 10m of expenditure expected this year. It spent
Pounds 3.44m in the first half.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.2p, while earnings per share rose to
5.7p (4.4p).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley plans restructuring -
Unquantified charges dash investors' hopes of increased dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer, yesterday dashed hopes
of an increased dividend with its second profits warning in a year.
The group said unquantified restructuring charges expected in the second
half would hit full-year profits. This meant it would be unlikely to pay
anything more than a nominal dividend this year, similar to the payment of
0.1p in 1993.
The scale of charges would be determined by an extensive costs review,
expected to be completed in January.
The warning accompanied the announcement of interim pre-tax profits up from
Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 5.1m, after net gains of Pounds 2.2m covering
disposals and exceptional charges.
Gross profit rose 3 per cent to Pounds 80.1m (Pounds 77.4m), on sales also
of Pounds 148m (Pounds 144m).
Shareholders, who have remained loyal through several years of
restructuring, are likely to be sharply disappointed with the company's
comments. Earlier this year, hopes were raised of at least a marginal
increase in the payout after the final results.
'Investors have been holding out for a while now in the hope that these
results would show they had managed to turn round the US and get to grips
with stock problems,' said one analyst. 'None of these things has occurred.'
The company also announced that it would not look for a chief executive
until the cost review had been completed. A new management team had been put
in place following the departure of Mr Jim Maxmin, as chief executive, and
Mr Andy Higginson, as finance director.
Mr Geoff Haslehurst, commercial director, has become finance director and Mr
Graham Searle, former managing director of Dunhill, is to continue as
managing director for the time being.
Mr Haslehurst admitted that the prospects of further restructuring had been
disappointing to the group and shareholders alike. However, costs were too
high.
Laura Ashley would also have to tackle further stock problems, although
these were not expected to have a substantial adverse impact.
The retail business returned flat sales in the first half on a like for like
basis, hit by difficulties in the garment business. These had been addressed
and current sales were up by 5 per cent on a like for like basis in the UK,
13 per cent in North America and were flat in Europe.
There is no interim dividend. Earnings were 1.21p (0.22p).
COMMENT
Just when shareholders thought they had truly earned a respite from the bad
news at Laura Ashley, the group comes up with this. Based on its own
calculations of what returns should be, the second-half charges could be as
much as Pounds 20m-plus. Even more worrying is the thought that it will not
look for a chief executive in the short-term. If anything, Laura Ashley
needs a strong figure to balance what appears to be resurgent family
interests. However, it tried that once without success. Excluding the
uncertain charges, forecasts have been pulled back from Pounds 10m to Pounds
7.5m. this is not one for the faint-hearted.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Express not joining national price wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Stevens, chairman of United Newspapers yesterday undertook to keep the
Daily Express out of the national newspaper price wars.
As he announced a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 69.9m for
the six months to June, against Pounds 51.3m, Lord Stevens said: 'Our policy
is to maintain cover prices and enhance the value of our titles to readers.'
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, is also extremely
reluctant to cut prices. This means that it is likely the national
newspapers middle market will continue to avoid the uncertainty now facing
both national broadsheets and the popular tabloids.
United's profits benefited by about Pounds 6m from acquisitions such as Hong
Kong International Trade Fair and Harmon Homes, the US real estate
magazines. There was also a saving of almost Pounds 6.5m in reduced interest
charges of Pounds 2.95m following last year's rights issue.
Operating profit increased by 17 per cent from Pounds 61.7m to Pounds 72.1m
with growth in all business areas apart from national newspapers. Overall
operating margins rose from 13.8 per cent to 14.2 per cent. On a
like-for-like basis, excluding the effect of acquisitions, operating profit
increased by 6.5 per cent.
Lord Stevens warned yesterday that the recovery was still uneven and that
the first quarter's rapid growth in revenues had steadied to a more measured
pace. 'Consumer purchasing remains uncertain and we still await a sustained
increase in advertising volume.'
Turnover rose from Pounds 447.6m to Pounds 508.1m. The pre-tax figure
included exceptional profits of Pounds 390,000, against charges of Pounds
1.27m. Earnings per share were 19.1p (16.4p). The interim dividend has been
increased by 3.3 per cent from 7.5p to 7.75p.
The national newspaper titles - the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday
Express - had a turnover similar to last year with a 6 per cent increase in
advertising revenues counteracting lower circulation revenues.
All three titles lost circulation with the Daily Express down 9 per cent,
although United said it had now steadied at 1.34m and started to rise in
September, and the Daily Star down 3 per cent.
United is at the moment looking at possible exhibition and business magazine
acquisitions in the US and the east Asia.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson said the
profits were Pounds 4m higher than expectations but he was sticking with his
full year forecast of Pounds 139m, compared with Pounds 118m.
The shares moved from 498p to 500p on the day.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Irish Permanent plans October
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Permanent, Ireland's largest building society before it converted to
plc status, is coming to the market late next month.
The company is planning to raise IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.4m) capital and is
expected to be capitalised at IPounds 182.9m. Just under half the shares are
being made available to people who were members of Irish Permanent when it
was a mutual organisation, while the remainder have been placed with
institutions in Dublin and London.
Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, has made it clear that the society's
decision to become a public company was based primarily on the desire to be
able to raise equity capital, in order to compete more effectively with
banks.
He has emphasised, however, that Irish Permanent would not actively be
seeking acquisitions after conversion. Instead it would be looking for a
period of consolidation, after its recent purchases of Prudential Life of
Ireland, the life insurance company, and Guinness &amp; Mahon, where the main
activity is private banking.
Its strategy is to continue to expand its retail financial services
business, broadening its range of services and making more use of its
extensive branch network.
With some 79,000 mortgage accounts and 590,000 savings accounts, Irish
Permanent has a strong position in the Irish retail financial market, but
its cost/income ratio is the highest in the industry in Ireland.
Some 30.8m shares are being offered at 180p each. A forecast final dividend
for the year to December is 6p, giving an annualised gross dividend at the
offer price of 6.67 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Headlam to Pounds
2.15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Headlam, the fabric and floorcoverings distributor, almost doubled pre-tax
profits for the six months to June 30, after contributions from two recent
acquisitions.
On turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 42.9m) pre-tax profits
rose from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 2.15m.
However, the core floorcovering division experienced what was referred to as
'turbulent demand', with a poor second quarter reflecting the depressed UK
housing market.
Floorcovering sales increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 36.7m, but the return
on sales stood at 2.9 per cent, compared to 8.5 per cent for its
newly-created soft furnishings division.
Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the group expected sustained progress
in the second half, which includes the high demand traditionally experienced
in the autumn.
In May, the company launched its second rights issue within a year to help
finance two purchases worth Pounds 2.98m. Gordon John Textiles distributes
curtain lining and Wiltrex Readymades readymade curtain. They contributed to
sales of Pounds 11.3m by the soft furnishings operations.
The following month, Headlam spent Pounds 550,000 to acquire William
O'Hanlon, the window furnishings distributor, which is expected to make a
modest contribution to this year's results.
Interest charges for the half-year rose from Pounds 249,000 to Pounds
455,000.
Earnings per share rose by 1p 3.8p and the interim dividend was up from
0.85p to 1p.
The shares closed down 11p at 200p.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New supermarkets help Morrison advance 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the regional superstore group, shrugged off
intense price competition in the grocery market and beat expectations with a
24 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds
47.4m.
The improvement was driven by a 15.2 per cent increase in takings, in spite
of what Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, called the 'growing tendency for the
consumer to seek improved value and lower prices in all purchases', and
deflation in many product areas.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, increased 4.4 per
cent, although the rate of increase had slowed in the second half.
'Trading at the moment remains keenly competitive with ever present pressure
on profit margins,' Mr Morrison said.
He added that sales had been boosted by the legalisation of Sunday opening,
but 'the profitability of this development has not yet been confirmed'.
Five new stores opened during the first half, with a further two so far in
the second half, and one more opening due this year. Morrison is planning to
open 10 stores next year, and has begun a refurbishment programme of older
stores.
It has secured a Pounds 150m revolving credit facility to finance future
expansion plans.
Total turnover in the half year to July 31 increased 15.4 per cent from
Pounds 746.5m to Pounds 861.8m. The increase in sales was backed by an
improvement in gross margins through better buying, and a fall in wage
costs. That enabled the group to report a 24 per cent increase in operating
profit, from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 48.5m, representing an increase in
operating margin from 5.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Interest receivable was higher than expected at Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1m).
The interim dividend is 0.24p, a 20 per cent increase on last year's 0.2p,
with earnings per share increasing 19.8 per cent from 3.38p to 4.05p.
COMMENT
It is tempting to ask how Morrison does it. In what the chairman describes
as 'undoubtedly a buyer's market' it has increased its gross margin 0.4
points, reduced costs, and achieved a 15 per cent sales increase.
Like-for-like sales growth has slowed in the second half, but new store
openings are likely to keep total sales growth healthy, and the gross margin
is expected to be held or improve slightly. With full-year forecasts
upgraded yesterday to about Pounds 117m, the shares are on a prospective
multiple of 14.4, almost on the market rating. Some might think earnings
prospects could justify a small premium to the market.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Graystone turns in Pounds 4.13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graystone, the engineering company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.13m
on turnover of Pounds 36.2m for the first half. In the comparative period,
the group was known as Ptarmigan Holdings and was a mini-conglomerate with
interests which included flowers, hotels and sausage skins. Profits then
were Pounds 200,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 9.9m.
Mr Dick Richardson, the chairman and chief executive who has overseen the
metamorphosis - in operation, management and financial control - since his
arrival in June 1992, said the results were the first with all the
acquisitions in place.
These included three engineering companies from Prospect Industries - which
Mr Richardson originally floated out of Tace - Cableform and British Syphon
Industries.
He said that there were still non-core activities - two hotels and a
publishing business - within Graystone, but that there were profitable and
accounted for less than 2 per cent of group turnover. They would be sold
when the right price was offered, he said.
Borrowings of Pounds 4.1m at December 31 had been reduced to Pounds 1.2m at
June 30 through the sale of non-core businesses. Mr Richardson expected
that, thanks to the cash generative nature of the equipment and electrical
distribution divisions, the group would be cash positive by the end of the
year.
The acquisitions contributed operating profits of Pounds 2.14m on turnover
of Pounds 17.3m, while continuing operations made Pounds 1.98m (Pounds
714,000) on turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 8.98m).
Exports were 'miniscule a year ago': now direct exports accounted for 12 to
14 per cent of turnover and indirect exports for about 25 per cent.
Earnings per share were 1.45p (0.57p) and a final dividend of 0.14p is
recommended for a total of 0.24p (nil).

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CLS makes Pounds 8.37m at six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLS Holdings, the property investment company majority-owned by Sweden's
Mortstedt family, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.37m in the
first half of 1994, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.49m last time.
Excluding exceptional items, though, the company's first set of figures
since making its stock exchange debut in May showed a profit before tax from
continuing operations of Pounds 1.95m, against Pounds 575,000 before.
After adjusting for transactions completed since flotation, net assets per
share were 129p.
The first interim dividend is 0.4p, although the Mortstedt family, who own
53 per cent of the shares, have agreed to take a scrip alternative.

FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man offer price cut to 180p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation price for shares in ED&amp;F Man has been cut by more than 15 per
cent from the level indicated three weeks ago, since when the market has
fallen by about 6 per cent.
The offer price of 180p announced yesterday gives a notional yield of 6 per
cent and a multiple of actual historic earnings of 9.5. It values the
commodity trader and financial services group at Pounds 462.6m.
The prospectus warns that a disappointing investment performance from the
group's fund management arm will lead to a 'substantially reduced
contribution' from the division this year. In the year to March 31 1994 it
made Pounds 25.5m out of a group Pounds 67m.
Analysts believe fund management profits may fall by up to 50 per cent but
that strong growth from agricultural products and futures broking side will
more than make up the shortfall. Group earnings per share are expected to
increase by around 10 per cent.
Though very low by the standards of recent new issues Man's share rating is
in line with that of Exco, the money broker, for its successful flotation in
June. Both companies operate in markets with a history of corporate upsets
and had to work hard to explain their businesses to institutions.
'In the end Man had a good response from institutions but some thought it
was just too much effort to get to know it,' said one of the company's
advisers.
A total of Pounds 110m of shares are being sold, of which Pounds 27.5m are
the subject of a public offer, with the remainder placed with investors at
the offer price. The offer is sponsored by Schroders with brokers James
Capel.
The company is currently owned by 100 of its top managers. Board members are
selling less than 8 per cent of their holding and have undertaken not to
dispose of any more before the announcement of next year's interim figures.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Guinness fills gap at Utd Distillers after flat results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, the spirits and brewing group, disappointed the City with its
interim results yesterday - then surprised it by choosing the head of a
Swedish building company to lead United Distillers, its spirits division.
The shares closed down 13p at 448p after the group reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 320m for the six months to June 30, up from Pounds 305m,
reflecting sharply lower interest payments. Profits from continuing
operations eased from Pounds 369m to Pounds 366m on sales slightly lower at
Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.98bn).
Mr Tony Greener, chairman, described the results as 'sound in the difficult
circumstances'.
The new managing director at United Distillers is Mr Finn Johnsson, chief
executive of Euroc, Sweden's largest building products group. He replaces Mr
Crispin Davis.
Mr Greener said that after an extensive search Mr Johnsson was 'clearly the
best candidate', with substantial experience running international
businesses in competitive industries.
Operating profits at United Distillers, accounting for more than two thirds
of the total, fell by Pounds 12m to Pounds 258m, while sales slipped from
Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.05bn.
The first quarter was particularly tough in two important markets - the UK
and the US. The UK suffered from destocking after Christmas, the absence of
the Budget in March while bad weather adversely affected trade in the US.
The group said it had performed well in its emerging markets, with the
exception of Japan in Asia and Venezuela in south America.
Guinness Worldwide Brewing profits rose by 9 per cent from Pounds 99m to
Pounds 108m on sales ahead from Pounds 867m to Pounds 916m. The group is
increasing marketing of Guinness stout, which benefitted from 'a publicity
bonanza' after sponsoring the Irish football team in the World Cup.
Included in the latest result is a Pounds 23m contribution from the
investment in Moet Hennessy following the reorganisation last April of the
relationship with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The transaction reduced
borrowings by Pounds 400m to Pounds 1.5bn; an interest credit from the deal
helped to cut interest payable from Pounds 98m to Pounds 69m.
The deal also diluted the earnings per share, which were 11.1p (11p). The
interim dividend is increased from 3.62p to 3.90p. After payment of
dividends the free cash flow was Pounds 23m - down from a previous Pounds
116m.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Marc Rich gives way to Glencore in name only: Trading
group's new head talks to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tremendous upheaval at the world's biggest diversified trading company
culminates this month with a change of name - from Marc Rich &amp; Co to
Glencore International. In the past three years the company has been
convulsed by a succession struggle at the very top, staff defections and
accusations about wrong-doing, particularly in the former Soviet Union.
Mr Willy Strothotte, who emerged as chairman and chief executive, dismisses
suggestions that all this weakened Glencore's position in commodity markets.
These suggestions come from rivals, he says, and were sometimes taken
seriously by the media because of the personal difficulties of Mr Marc Rich,
the Belgian-born founder of the group. He was charged with tax evasion and
other offences by the US authorities in 1984 and has refused to return to
the US to answer the charges.
Mr Strothotte said it would be a tragedy if Mr Rich was remembered more for
being a fugitive than for building from scratch a world-class business and,
in turnover terms, Switzerland's second-biggest corporation after Nestle. As
a private company, Glencore does not give financial details but Mr
Strothotte does not argue with analysts' estimates of an annual turnover of
Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19bn) and net profits of Dollars 125m
to Dollars 160m. Mr Rich recently revealed the group's capital base to be
about Dollars 750m.
Glencore is one of the biggest operators in global oil and oil products
markets, trading about 1.5m barrels a day. It is the biggest player in the
international aluminium and alumina markets, trading 2.5m tonnes of
aluminium and 3m tonnes of alumina a year, and it owns a handful of
industrial companies. Some of these are held by Sudelektra, once a sleepy
investment fund, and now the best-performing Swiss stock. Its shares have
soared from around SFr350 when Glencore took control in 1990 to SFr1,920. Mr
Strothotte describes Sudelektra, in which Glencore has a 53 per cent stake,
as 'our window to the capital markets'.
Mr Strothotte, 50, started his trading career in 1961 as an apprentice with
Frank &amp; Schulte. In 1966 he joined C. Tennant and moved to ICC Metals in
1972. He was hired to Marc Rich in 1978, four years after it was founded, by
Mr Alex Hackel and groomed as his successor to head metals and minerals
trading operations.
The retirements in 1992 of Mr Hackel and two other senior Rich executives
sparked a dispute about how quickly Mr Rich himself should follow them and
sell his shares - more than 50 per cent of the capital  - to the new
management team. In the event, Mr Rich stayed on but Mr Strothotte and two
other senior executives resigned.
By March last year, Mr Rich had decided to call back Mr Strothotte as chief
executive. Mr Rich's holding has been reduced to 25 per cent and Mr
Strothotte is confident that his remaining shares will be transferred to
management and employees.
There are now about 360 Glencore shareholders, compared with 150 when Mr
Rich was chairman. The company pays no dividends and all net profit goes
into retained earnings to inflate the shares' value. When shareholders leave
the group they must sell their equity which is passed on to other employees
at the management's discretion. Mr Strothotte says the group does not pay
big bonuses as management and senior employees benefit from share ownership
instead.
Mr Strothotte says the change of name is simply to prevent confusion between
Glencore and Mr Rich's own finance and property group, Marc Rich Holding.
'You don't change an image by changing a name. You change your image by
changing your conduct - and that I don't want to change.' Neither does the
change of name signal a change of direction, he insists. Glencore will
continue to trade base metals, non-ferrous and ferrous metals and ores, coal
and grains - it is now the biggest exporter of European Union grain to
eastern Europe.
'Our business is physical. We use terminal markets as a means of protecting
that business but we don't trade paper or derivatives. We have no seat on
the London Metal Exchange or other markets. We are happy to use brokers
rather than to act as brokers ourselves.'
Before Mr Strothotte leaves Glencore he says he 'would want to see the
restructuring completed and to complete a number of exciting things I know
are ahead'.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Piech set to oust VW finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen's finance director, Mr Werner Schmidt, is expected to be ousted
shortly as a consequence of last year's near collapse of the group's Spanish
subsidiary, Seat.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, is understood to be seeking backing for his
removal from key members of the company's non-executive supervisory board
which will be asked to decide on the issue on November 25.
While he can expect to garner a simple majority in favour of replacing Mr
Schmidt from among his political and workforce allies on the board, he is
believed to be taking pains to persuade members representing the Deutsche
and Dresdner banks that Mr Schmidt, 62, should go at the end of this year.
Relations between the two men have been poor since Mr Piech's appointment in
January 1993. However, the chairman's determination to unseat Mr Schmidt has
hardened recently following completion of a secret auditor's report on the
circumstances surrounding last year's unexpected DM1.4bn (Pounds 574m) loss
at Seat.
Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman, was fired last autumn, and the rest
of the top management has since been replaced. Mr Schmidt was chairman of
the Spanish company's supervisory board at the time, although there has not
been any suggestion so far that he was any more aware of Seat's straits than
Mr Piech.
Shortly after details of the debacle emerged, Mr Piech remarked that
earlier, much-lower estimates of the deficit from Seat's management board
amounted to 'misinformation', which, in his view, was 'a crime with penal
consequences'.
It is believed, however, that further action is unlikely, especially since
the situation at Seat is still not resolved, and labour unrest and other
pressing problems are building up elsewhere within the group.
A controversial Spanish government subsidy of Dollars 308m (Pounds 195m),
officially earmarked for Seat's research and development budget, remains
unpaid while the European Commission competition authorities examine its
legality. Labour unrest is fermenting at the Czech subsidiary, Skoda, where
the group wants to cut 800 jobs. VW has responded to a strike in its
Brussels factory by transferring some the plant's production to Germany.
At home, VW wants to reduce the workforce at its Emden factory, main source
of the Passat range, by 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the plant has been given the
job of repairing or replacing 9,000 faulty gearboxes discovered in the new
generation VW Polo, due to go on sale next month.

FT  23 SEP 94 / RMC buoyed by UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued strength of the German construction market, and a firm
recovery in the UK, helped RMC Group achieve a 60 per cent rise in
first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.6m to Pounds 98.8m.
Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 1.92bn (Pounds 1.69bn), with Germany
contributing Pounds 782.2m, an increase of Pounds 55.4m on the previous
year. Profits from German operations - where RMC has a dominating 16 per
cent share of the ready mixed cement market - grew 8 per cent from Pounds
52.9m to Pounds 57.2m.
UK profits more than doubled from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 33.3m on turnover
16 per cent ahead at Pounds 527m (Pounds 454.3m). Mr Derek Jenkins, finance
director, said price increases of around 8 per cent in the UK concrete
business were being passed on to customers.
'We are simply recovering some of the ground lost during the recession and
getting back to something like adequate returns,' he said.
However he did not expect price rises to continue at the same rate during
the second half, although RMC would benefit from the 'plateauing' effect of
the new higher prices at the full-year.
RMC confirmed recent evidence from others in the construction industry of a
strong recovery in the UK's new house market, with the south-east in
particular seeing good demand.
Margins in eastern Germany remained firm and Mr Jenkins forecast
double-digit growth in volume terms for the foreseeable future. The
country's housing market was also maintaining solid expansion and RMC said
that fears that the market may peak would be offset by the beginning of a
pick-up in the commercial market. The transfer of the government from Bonn
to Berlin - close to RMC's German operations centre - would underpin this
growth, according to Mr Jenkins.
Turnover from RMC's other European operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds
421.6m (Pounds 353m) with profits 33 per cent higher at Pounds 16.4m (Pounds
12.1m). France was undergoing a 'gentle recovery', while Spain was beginning
to pick up after its recent slump.
Improved conditions in Israel and the US saw profits from the non-European
division jump 75 per cent to Pounds 10m (Pounds 5.7m) on turnover 24 per
cent ahead at Pounds 188.3m (Pounds 151.2m).
Earnings per share almost doubled from 13.4p to 24.6p. The interim dividend
rises from 6.6p to 7p.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Storm likely as former NHS chief executive joins Bupa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Heath Service until
earlier this year, is to join the board of Bupa, the UK's largest private
healthcare organisation. The appointment is likely to cause political
controversy.
In July, Sir Duncan launched Healthcare 2000, a commission to investigate
the future of healthcare provision.
Critics of the government's effort to encourage greater private-sector
involvement in the NHS will regard the Bupa appointment as evidence of an
increasingly uncomfortable overlap between the two sectors.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'This is the clearest
indication yet of the degree to which the government is blurring the
distinction between a public NHS and the private health sector.'
The appointment will also revive arguments over how soon after leaving
public office senior civil servants should be able to take up such posts.
The Department of Health would not comment last night on any possible
conflict of interest. Civil servants of Sir Duncan's rank must apply for
approval to take an a outside appointment if it is within two years of
leaving Whitehall. Sir Duncan's move had been handled with 'statutory
propriety', an official said.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said: 'The appointment is a matter
for Bupa and for Sir Duncan. There is positive benefit to the NHS in close
co-operation with the private sector.'
Sir Duncan, 53, was appointed NHS chief executive in 1989 and held the post
until March this year. He was the first career NHS manager to head the
service, having started as a management trainee. Some colleagues will regard
his decision to join Bupa with surprise, since he was regarded as a staunch
supporter of the public health service.
Bupa has 46 per cent of the private healthcare market and the biggest number
of private hospitals, with 29 units and 1,785 beds.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Portillo uses veto on EU statutory paternity leave: Britain
opts out of elected works council ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK yesterday vetoed European Union attempts to extend statutory parental
leave to fathers. It also formalised its divorce from its 11 partners on EU
social policy by staying out of new rules for elected works councils in up
to 1,500 trans-European companies.
The European Commission will now recast the parental leave proposal for the
11 to go ahead for the second time without the UK, under the social chapter
of the Maastricht treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out.
Mr Michael Portillo, UK employment secretary, on his debut at a meeting of
EU employment ministers in Brussels, said plans to give fathers of new-born
or adopted children the right to three months' unpaid leave would be
'immensely disruptive and destructive'.
'As far as the UK is concerned, this is not a right I think we should extend
at a time of very high unemployment,' he told journalists.
Mr Portillo, a leader of the rightwing Euro-sceptics in the Conservative
party, denied that the UK's veto was evidence of the emergence of a
multi-speed Europe. 'We are just going in different directions.'
Asked whether he would personally want to spend time with a newborn child if
he became a father, Mr Portillo said: 'Yes, and my employer could give me
paid holiday and I would arrange that with my employer.'
This, he said, was 'a matter of personal responsibility'. On parental leave
and the works councils directive, UK companies, and 'foreign companies
operating in Britain', would have a choice denied to the 11 other EU member
states, Mr Portillo added.
Offered a four-year exemption from the paternal leave provisions, with a
review in 1999, Mr Portillo said: 'The best favour I can do the Council (of
Ministers) is to say that these compromises will not work, because it is a
matter of principle.'
All EU member states except the UK and Ireland already have some provision
for paternity leave, and in all but Belgium's case, it is more generous than
the EU proposal.
On works councils, companies inside the UK are legally exempt from the
directive, which is intended to ensure that workers' representatives in
companies employing more than 1,000 people, and more than 150 in at least
two member states, are consulted on cross-border decisions that affect them,
such as redundancies and investment relocation.
However, about 100 UK companies operating in mainland Europe will be
covered, against some 300 if the rules had applied on British territory.
Among the most affected, according to a German study, will be 450 German
companies, 250 US corporations in Europe, and 220 cross-border French
concerns.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the opt-out for Britain.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said: 'It is now up to the UK
employers affected by the directive to choose whether to include their UK
employees or not.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Japanese coalition agrees to reduce income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists last night agreed a
package of income tax cuts worth Y16,500bn (Pounds 107bn) over the next
three years, to be followed by a rise in sales tax, bolstering the fragile
economic recovery and giving the government added stability.
The unpopular sales tax - similar to Europe's value added tax - will rise in
April 1997 from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. It is needed to compensate for an
expected decline in the income tax base caused by the tax cuts and an ageing
population.
Agreement between the three parties in the coalition paves the way for the
end of a divisive year-long argument over fiscal reform. It marks new
stability in the coalition, which had looked shakier than its short-lived
predecessors on taking office at the end of June.
Until a few days ago, the Social Democratic party of Mr Tomiichi Murayama,
the prime minister, opposed an increase in sales tax. But Mr Murayama
changed his mind in return for a promise from the Liberal Democratic party -
his enemies until the SDP joined forces with them three months ago - to
spend the extra revenue on welfare.
Washington has been pressing for tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand in
the hope of reducing the trade surplus, but wanted Japan to defer the rise
in sales tax for as long as possible. Accordingly, the deal drew a cautious
welcome from the US. Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, said the
package was positive but not perfect.
The income tax cut consists of a Y3,500bn per year permanent reduction, plus
Y2,000bn annually of temporary cuts, to last until March 1997. The
government will decide six months before then whether the temporary cuts
should continue.
At the same time it will review whether to change the size of the increase
in sales tax. That will depend on the amount of savings in administrative
spending achieved by then, in response to a demand by the New Harbinger
party, the coalition's smallest member, which is led by Mr Masayoshi
Takemura, finance minister.
The government will submit the tax reform package to the next session of
parliament, starting at the end of this month, and hopes to pass it into law
by the end of the year, in line with a promise to Japan's Group of Seven
industrialised country partners at their summit in July. Fresh legislation
will be needed if the review results in a change to the agreed rise in sales
tax.

<TEXT>
Man's flotation price announced yesterday was lower, and its yield higher,
than expected. The group's managers and advisers may console themselves that
disappointing ratings were partly the inevitable consequence of a 200-point
fall in the FT-SE 100 share index since the pathfinder prospectus was
published. But there is more to it than that.
The City clearly has a problem with commodities traders. That is not
surprising given its unhappy experiences during the 1980s with the old
Berisford group and Gill &amp; Duffus. Added to that legacy is the difficulty
for analysts in following such a curious beast as Man with its businesses
ranging from peanut shelling to shipping, and money broking to commodity
trading. The visibility and predictability of earnings is a further concern.
The growth of two of Man's three divisions has been erratic, and earnings at
the historically most stable wing, fund management, collapsed during the
first half of this year.
Tarring Man with the same brush as Berisford and Gill &amp; Duffus may not be
fair. The group clearly has a more mature attitude to risk. It has also
successfully diversified, in contrast to the earlier groups. And the fact
that the management is retaining a strong stake in the business should
provide considerable comfort. If the management can deliver earnings growth
and commensurate dividend growth, the group will build up a following. But
it will struggle to overcome City prejudices about commodity traders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new tax package was broadly welcomed by the US but it seems unlikely
to do much to stimulate the economy and suck in imports. While the cut in
income tax will be implemented before the increase in consumption tax, the
impact on consumer confidence may be limited by the Finance Ministry's
emphasis on the need for fiscal revenue to care for an ageing population.
Nor is the equity market likely to be particularly happy while the dollar is
trading at less than Y100. So there is unlikely to be much of a boost to
confidence from rising share prices either.
Efforts to stimulate the economy might have more impact if they were
accompanied by a further aggressive cut in official interest rates. The Bank
of Japan seems reluctant to undertake this course because it fears another
asset bubble. Some in the US might worry that a consequence of lower
interest rates would be a weaker yen which would make Japanese goods cheaper
internationally. But Japan is one industrial country where the inflationary
threat remains minimal. Lower interest rates and an easier currency might
also encourage an outflow of capital which would bring relief to
international bond markets generally.

<TEXT>
For the past 2 1/2 years, RMC has successfully insulated shareholders from
the full brunt of the savage downturn in the UK construction industry,
chiefly by virtue of its engagement in Germany where the construction
industry has defied recession. Yesterday's results show that the group has
reached a turning point, with the impetus coming from the UK. Profits at
home more than doubled on turnover up 16 per cent, reflecting a favourable
mix of higher volumes and prices as well as lower costs.
This leaves RMC in a strong position. There is scope for further recovery in
the UK and other continental European countries such as France, Spain and
Austria. As for Germany, house building in the west may tail off modestly in
the current year, but RMC is confident that this will be offset by a revival
in commercial and industrial market. In the east of Germany, the
construction industry is set to be the motor of recovery for years to come.
RMC's low cost cement production facilities allow it to compete with cheap
imports from Poland. RMC's decades-long engagement in Germany seems to have
rubbed off on the company's culture. The group invests for the long term and
is prudent in the way it husbands its cash. The only surprises are positive
ones, such as yesterday's better than expected figures. The group's
qualities have not gone unrecognised and the shares have outperformed the
market by 12 per cent in the past year. The group has won, and deserves to
keep, a premium rating to the sector.

FT  23 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Flagging spirits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness's first-half results were another case of pleasure deferred. The
Spanish beer market has at least stabilised. In the spirits market, the
product mix has improved, with single malt and de luxe brands ahead of last
year. Overall, though, volume sales of spirits fell 5 per cent in the first
half and profits from this division were down 9 per cent after adjustment
for exchange rate changes. Guinness again alluded to special factors like
the bad weather in the US and de-stocking in the UK during the first
quarter, but there is still no evidence of demand strong enough for the
company to make much headway with premium prices. Indeed, the relaunch of
Bell's whisky in the UK seems simply to have prompted rivals to cut their
own prices.
Like BTR after its margin disappointment, Guinness now stresses that it is a
late cycle business. The new head of its spirits division will not be asked
for a new strategy because the company remains convinced that only patience
is required till Guinness can again exploit its undoubted brand strength.
Yet with interest rates now on the way back up in both the US and the UK,
one wonders whether the 'feel-good' factor which encourages consumers to
move upmarket will ever show through strongly in this cycle. If not, much
time has been wasted. Profits are unlikely to be much higher this year than
they were in 1991.
Obviously, a company as wedded to brand values as Guinness cannot easily
switch to a tactic of sacrificing price for volume. But it makes little
sense for Guinness to sit on its hands while gearing continues to fall. If
its business really has matured, it would be better to buy back shares
sooner rather than later. Earnings would be enhanced with the share price
below 450p. The recovery would then simply be all the more sweet if, by
contrast, market conditions did eventually turn decisively in the company's
favour.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Supermarket fire risks cause increasing concern to insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The risk of fire in larger supermarkets is causing increasing concern among
insurers and safety experts following a spate of losses in recent months.
The lack of compartment walls, which would halt the spread of fire, and the
absence of sprinkler systems and roof venting in many stores have been
singled out as potential hazards.
The risks were highlighted at a conference this week organised by the Fire
Protection Association, a body linked to the insurance industry.
Recent losses include a supermarket fire in Hull in June, which caused
Pounds 10m property damage, and a blaze at a superstore in Chichester last
December, where damage amounted to Pounds 11m. The association reports nine
total losses over the last two years. Mr Stewart Kidd, a director of the
association, said recent incidents showed stores to be at 'considerable risk
from fire, no matter how it is caused'.
Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British
Insurers, said: 'It is a real worry. Fires can spread very quickly from one
corner to the whole building.' The association has been in touch with the
Home Office and is pressing for tougher regulations, including compulsory
installation of sprinklers.
'The cost of installing sprinklers in large retail outlets is the same as
that of laying carpet,' Mr Kidd added.
Retailers insisted yesterday that fears were overplayed. 'We are constantly
being attacked on grounds of fire safety. It is an assertion which is not
borne out by the facts,' said Mr Mark Bradshaw, assistant director of the
British Retail Consortium, which represents about 90 per cent of the retail
industry.
Mr Bradshaw said supermarket owners fully complied with the statutory
framework and that criticisms exaggerated the effectiveness of sprinkler
systems.
'The basic concept that fire sprinklers are an all-round solution to our
problems is absolutely wrong,' he said. In a false alarm, sprinklers could
damage stock and building structures.
Instead, supermarket operators and other retailers placed more emphasis on
evacuation procedures, so that employees and customers could escape quickly.
He added: 'The assertion that sub-standard buildings are being constructed
is absolutely absurd. You have to pass very stringent building controls
which are tightly enforced by local and fire authorities.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Opposing within
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strengths and weaknesses of the British government's often theatrical
battle against the European Union's social dimension were fully displayed in
Brussels yesterday.
Mr Michael Portillo, the aggressive new employment secretary, denounced a
proposal to offer unpaid leave to fathers upon the birth of their children.
But he had nothing to say about the potentially much more significant
European works council directive on employee consultation, finally passed
after nearly 15 years of debate.
His silence on works councils is a consequence of Britain's decision to 'opt
out' from that directive, which means that it has excluded itself from the
final discussion. All the same, many of the 100-plus UK companies which will
be affected by the directive through their European subsidiaries are likely
to include their British employees in its requirements. And several
employers' organisations have privately regretted that Britain was not on
the inside, fighting to amend the proposal.
Whereas the UK's opt-out has generally been unproductive for Europe's
employers, its persistent niggling from within on dubious legislation has
been more helpful than critics acknowledge. The new balance between social
protection and job creation that is now evident in Brussels is the result of
several factors including high unemployment and the changing political
balance in several capitals, but it also owes something to British
truculence.
Mr Portillo acknowledges those positive new signals about the social
dimension and accepts that most of the directives now under discussion are
the last gasps of an earlier era.
He would probably even accept that in the areas of UK labour market
legislation where Europe does play an important role - such as health and
safety, and gender equality - it has produced acceptable results. But in his
determination to wield the opt-out again on relatively minor measures, such
as paternity leave, he is making a faulty analysis of British interests. As
Britain's limited success in revising the Acquired Rights directive has
shown, fighting from within can work.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Private finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost two years since Mr Norman Lamont launched the private finance
initiative. The then UK chancellor's aim was to mobilise the private sector
to meet needs that had traditionally been met by the public services. A
vision of new privately-built roads, railways, schools and hospitals was
conjured up.
As the initiative approaches its second birthday, that vision has yet to be
achieved. Some modest projects have taken off in the health service, and
several road and rail projects have been put out to tender. The Treasury has
lifted its objections to financing new roads through shadow tolling -
payments to the operators according to the number of vehicles using them.
But there remains an absence of holes in the ground, as Mr Howard Davies,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry, put it last year.
There is continuing scepticism about the initiative in Whitehall, and among
the investment community which might provide the capital. Civil servants
seem to have unrealistic views about the degree of risk that the private
sector is prepared to assume in infrastructure projects. It is not clear
that they or ministers are yet prepared to countenance the rates of return
required to attract private capital. On the other side, the absence of
progress on the initiative is leading many potential partners in the private
sector to conclude that involvement is unlikely to produce early returns.
If the initiative is to achieve its promise, renewed efforts are needed to
remove obstacles. One would be to provide some incentive for civil servants
who succeed in bringing private finance into government services. At
present, they can see only the downside of failure. If a project fails, or
the private sector partner makes a large profit, there is likely to be
criticism from the National Audit Office and excoriation by the Commons
Public Accounts Committee.
A positive incentive might encourage clearer analysis about the appropriate
share of risk between the public and private sector. Sir Alastair Morton,
chairman of the panel advising the chancellor on the initiative, last night
urged the government to 'loosen up' its approach to risk-sharing. In a
speech at the London Business School, he said that it makes sense for the
public sector to bear the political risks of large infrastructure projects
such as the Channel tunnel rail link. By putting the link out to tender
before the planning process is complete, private operators have been asked
to bear risks they cannot control.
Lessons should also be learnt from public services where private finance is
already playing a part. Housing associations were transferred to the private
sector in 1988 and have since raised more than Pounds 5.5bn of private
capital to supplement government grants for building low-cost homes. A
similar transfer for NHS trusts and grant-maintained schools would allow
them to raise capital against the value of their assets without adding to
public borrowing.
Finally, some projects need to be started soon if private finance is to be
attracted into public services. Without the prospect of lots of holes in the
ground, the cost of bidding for the occasional large project will do little
to encourage private sector enthusiasm.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Balladur's big balancing act: The French premier is aiming
for fiscal discipline without choking off incipient economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For someone usually so cautious, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has
just taken a gamble.
This week, less than eight months before the presidential election he hopes
to win next May, he unveiled a deficit-slashing budget for 1995. He and his
budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, described their plans to forgo income
tax cuts, to freeze overall public spending and to prune another FFr25bn
(Pounds 3bn) off the deficit, as 'courageous'.
It is either that, or foolhardy, to place before a country recovering from
recession and still suffering from record unemployment a pre-election budget
which merely chips away at the heavy welfare charges that so deter job
creation in France.
Mr Balladur is trying to pull off a delicate, multiple balancing act. He is
aiming for fiscal rigour without choking off France's incipient economic
recovery. He wants to bolster his government's pro-European and
anti-inflationary credentials while putting enough people back to work to
win what is likely to be a fiercely contested presidential election.
Whether courageous or foolhardy, the Balladur government has promptly set
about selling its new budget to the French and foreigners. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economics minister, flew to New York yesterday to try to
convince Wall Street investors that France is still a good bet.
Foreigners shed more than FFr100bn of their investments in French government
paper in the first half of this year. As well as being deterred by the
general fall in bond prices, they were bothered by the prospect of a
protracted campaign for next May's election and by an aura of corruption
gathering round some of its leading companies.
Pressure is also coming from Europe. Early next month, Mr Alphandery will be
grilled by fellow European Union finance ministers on France's plans to
reduce its budget deficit in order to conform with the Maastricht treaty
convergence targets. By that time, the budget debate in the French National
Assembly will be also under way.
For French politicians, EU partners and foreign investors alike, the central
question is the same: can the Balladur government meet the demands of
Maastricht and of the markets for fiscal discipline, while also curing
France's chronic unemployment problem?
The government believes this is possible, largely thanks to the upswing in
the economy. Shaking off months of caution, Mr Alphandery predicted this
week that the economy would grow by at least 3.1 per cent in real terms next
year, after 2 per cent this year.
Such growth would be kick-started by extra spending on public works and
housing as well as government incentives for car purchases, and led by
internal demand, Mr Alphandery predicted. Increased purchasing power would
sustain the rise in household consumption, while rising order books
encouraged companies to make new cap-ital investments.
Internal demand would therefore probably rise faster in France next year
(3.2 per cent) than elsewhere in Europe (an average of 2.7 per cent). The
economy minister said the recovery looked like being 'healthy and durable',
unconstrained by worries over inflation or trade imbalances. The rate of
price rises, now running at 1.7 per cent a year, would stay below 2 per cent
next year, while this year's expected FFr80bn trade surplus would only slip
to FFr60bn, he claimed.
However these predictions turn out for next year, the upturn has already had
an effect on the job market, with an extra 117,000 finding employment in the
first half of this year.
The last time such a surge took place was in the expansionary years of
1987-89. No one in the French government expects a repetition of that
expansion, unfettered as it was by Maastricht treaty fiscal disciplines.
But the Balladur administration says it is determined not to 'waste' the new
upturn in the way its Socialist predecessors failed to use the late 1980s
boom to rein in France's public deficit and reform its labour market. Even
Socialists now privately admit that if they had done more in this regard,
they would not have left the country in such a mess in 1993.
Luckily, the Socialists left something behind to help Mr Balladur's
conservatives clean up the mess: the expensive nationalisation programme of
the early 1980s, in which they bought holdings of well over 50 per cent in a
number of big companies. Receipts from privatisation - FFr94bn in the past
18 months - have been crucial to Mr Balladur's redressing of public finances
so far, and the government is planning a further FFr55bn in asset sales next
year.
Doubts centre on the magnitude and use of these receipts. Most of the easy,
big sales have been made. Renault is next on the block, but its
privatisation will only be partial and unlikely to bring more than FFr12bn
into state coffers.
Assurances Generales de France is due to follow, but there is short-term
weakness in the insurance sector. Groupe Bull - possibly third in line for
sale - faces longer-term difficulties in the computer sector.
At any event, the government made no bones this week about its intention to
use FFr20bn of the FFr55bn in capital receipts to help plug the gap in its
budget next year.
As a result Mr Sarkozy's reduction in the budget deficit from FFr301bn this
year to FFr275bn next looks for the most part like an honest cut. It needs
to be. For the Maastricht timetable clock is ticking louder than ever for
France.
Mr Balladur is not exactly passionate about eventual monetary union, but he
likes to see himself and be seen as a man who likes to take a long-term
view. Right at the start of his government in April 1993 - before he could
begin to hope the opinion polls would lift him to his current position of
'presidentiable' - he laid out a five-year programme for France to scrape in
under the Maastricht wire by 1997.
Now that he has a reasonable hope of being in the Elysee at that time, he at
least wants France to be in a position of strength to bargain with Germany
on the terms of any currency union. He also thinks he knows with whom, and
over what, he might be bargaining. Germany's Christian Democrats, favourites
to win next month's election, have come out in favour of a 'hard core' with
France within the European Union.
Paris is haunted by fears of falling behind in the long Maastricht march. As
Mr Sarkozy said this week, 'all our partners are committed to a policy of
deficit reduction . . . and to think that France alone could dispense with
such an effort would be a grave error'.
The government is particularly impressed with the current signs that Germany
is finally getting a grip on its deficits. Maastricht requires that the
total of all public sector deficits - on the budgets of regional governments
and quasi-state bodies as well central government - should equal 3 per cent
of gross domestic product or less.
On this week's plans, France's central budget deficit should fall from 4.1
per cent of GDP this year to 3.6 per cent next, but its overall public
sector deficit will next year be no lower than 4.6 per cent of GDP. Most EU
countries have a problem here.
But France has two particular difficulties in closing the spending gap
outside its central budget. The first is that, in contrast to other EU
countries except Belgium, it is still in the process of devolving more power
and money to its regions. Paris is thus ill-placed to lay the heavy hand of
Maastricht on its regions - though an indirect start was made this week with
the government's decision to reduce the subsidy it pays companies on their
local tax bills.
The second, and far more important, difficulty is the expansion of
off-budget welfare deficits. The French state is now increasingly assuming
responsibility for these deficits, for two reasons.
First, the deficits are now beyond the means of employers and unions whose
payroll contributions have traditionally funded much of the French welfare
system; the government took over FFr100bn worth of the welfare debt
accumulated in 1991-93, and may have to do the same with this year's
estimated deficit of nearly FFr60bn.
Second, virtually everyone agrees in France that levying welfare charges on
the workforce simply discourages employment, and that welfare costs should
be progressively shifted more to the central budget and the general
taxpayer.
But views vary on the desirable pace of this shift. Those who think it
particularly important that the deficit be reduced or contained are keen
that it take place rapidly; those who see the former as less important would
be content with a slower shift.
This is where France's European policy and its impending presidential
election come in. The European Parliament elections in June showed that
France remains divided over Maastricht. To the alarm of the centre-right
coalition government, 14 per cent of the vote went to the list led by Mr
Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht conservative.
That fact could further fuel the undeclared but now overt rivalry between Mr
Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR gaullist party, for the
presidency. Mr Chirac is not anti-Maastricht, but equivocal about it. In his
quest to squash Mr Balladur's presidential pretentions, he may well cast
about for the de Villiers vote.
That would mean adopting a less rigorous approach to the Maastricht
convergence criteria. The question is how he is to start marking out his
policy differences on the issue with fellow-gaullist Mr Balladur, and when.
He could start to do so in next month's budget debate. Mr Bernard de
Froment, the RPR deputy who advises Mr Chirac on budgetary matters, rejects
'fetishism on balancing the budget' and the idea that 'employment levels can
be fixed by the play of the market alone'. Many in the Chirac camp incline
to the 'don't-just-stand-there-intervene' school of economics. However, for
the moment, Mr Chirac is producing silence, not ideas.
His muteness is in sharp contrast to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president
of the government's other coalition party, the centrist UDF. The
ex-president has thrust his oar into the debate with a series of detailed
articles in Le Figaro, showing how welfare charges of up to 40 per cent
levied even on the minimum wage of FFr6,010 a month negate any incentive by
employers to hire low-skilled workers. He urged the government to make deep
cuts in these welfare charges, to be offset by a temporary hike in value
added tax.
It is hard to read the plan as Mr Giscard d'Estaing's launch-pad to regain
the Elysee next year. The Figaro articles are more like something penned by
a young finance minister, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing was back in the early
1960s, than the vague generalities beloved of senior French politicians like
the 68-year-old UDF leader now is.
But the ex-president's intervention will give yet a further twist to the
budget debate that will set the shape of the coming presidential contest. Mr
Giscard d'Estaing is basically in the same camp as Mr Balladur, but he leads
a different party, the UDF, and wants the prime minister to be more radical
in allying job creation to budget rigour. Mr Chirac, by contrast, is of the
same RPR party as Mr Balladur but sees a more fundamental contradiction in
the prime minister's 'budget rigour plus jobs' approach.
It is small wonder, therefore, that, despite the impression Mr Balladur was
seeking to give this week of courageous constancy, the international markets
believe French economic policy will take a political buffeting in the next
eight months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians established the rules, now politicians must play by them. In a
little over two weeks, European finance ministers must establish the fiscal
qualifications for entry to Europe's fast-track to economic and monetary
union. The Maastricht Treaty provides them with two reference numbers, and a
good deal of scope to fudge both. Given the EU's current state of fiscal
disarray, one of the targets may well be dropped. The signs, however, are
that it will be the wrong one.
From an economic standpoint, the arguments for imposing fiscal rules for
entry to European Monetary Union were always quite weak. Once individual
governments have handed over independent control of monetary policy, so the
fear goes, they will have an incentive to overcompensate on the fiscal side,
running up unsustainable public budget deficits. Investors might not believe
that the EU would allow a member to suffer a default. In that case, Europe
as a whole would bear the cost, in the form of higher European interest
rates.
In principle, the 'no-bail-out' condition written into the Maastricht Treaty
solves this problem. In truth, however, the threat might never be credible.
The best reason for additional, numerical, fiscal constraints was that, by
only admitting countries with a proven record of sound fiscal policy, there
would be less chance that this commitment would be tested, particularly in
the early, politically sensitive stages of EMU's history.
Two arbitrary indicators were chosen: a public budget deficit of no more
than 3 per cent and national debt not exceeding 60 per cent of GDP. Neither
is a particularly cogent indicator of a country's ability to pursue sensible
fiscal policies. Certainly, few EU member states are likely to satisfy both
by 1997.
The European Commission appears to have decided to apply the deficit
criterion rigorously, while casting a benevolent eye over the level of a
country's debt. This is not surprising, since the Commission wants as many
countries as possible to qualify and knows that it is easier to meet a
target for a deficit (which is an annual flow) than for the debt stock. In
addition to Luxembourg, the only country already meeting both targets, it
decided not to recommend Ireland as a potentially divergent country, a
decision which the EU finance ministers, rather more surprisingly, accepted
on Monday.
Both can justify their decision by pointing to the impressive reduction of
the Irish debt ratio, from nearly 120 per cent in 1987 to the current 90 per
cent of GDP. But it sets a dangerous precedent.
Regardless of the current stance of its fiscal policy, a country with a high
debt ratio has a greater risk of encountering debt service problems than a
country with a relatively low level of debt. The Maastricht Treaty's chosen
'safe' ratio may be arbitrary, but debt is the more justifiable and the more
important of the two criteria.
Some room for manoeuvre around the 60 per cent figure is required, but
effectively deciding to ignore it, by exempting countries with ratios of
80-90 per cent, could prove damaging. Such a decision may have been
necessitated by the need to offer hope to Belgium, whose debt ratio is far
higher still. But the end result will be the effective obliteration of the
only fiscal criterion that made an iota of sense.

More whispers that Kenneth Baker, former UK cabinet minister, is poised to
return to government. The Beast of Bodmin, a large cat-like creature, is
still supposedly roaming the west of England. So the reasoning is that
Baker, as home secretary at the time of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, is just
the man to deal with dangerous beasts - particularly a sheep in wolf's
clothing.

nothing will change except 'a yellow-faced Chinese, not a blue-eyed British'

John Major ended his epic trip to South Africa with a private visit to a
safari park yesterday, predictably insisting that any resemblance between
him and a dodo was a ghastly mistake: 'I am not an endangered species,' he
piped, a remark surely destined to find its home in the quote books
alongside 'never had it so good' and 'there is no alternative'.
Norma Major did her bit for wildlife, too, courtesy of knife and fork. She
lunched at a well-known Johannesburg restaurant which specialises in
traditional dishes such as crocodile, worms and boiled ox-tripe - not that
she tucked into that sort of stuff. 'She was really nice but we didn't think
she'd like them,' the proprietor remarked realistically.

There have not been many laughs in the White House recently, but at least
the place is now acquiring a public face with a well-developed sense of
humour.
Mike McCurry, a cheerful Californian veteran of the Clinton campaign who has
been an effective mouthpiece for the state department, is about to take on
some of Dee Dee Myers's functions. The president's press secretary herself
is being given 'broader responsibilities' - whatever that may mean.
One of McCurry's better moments came last Saturday. Bored with waiting for
news from Carter's Haiti team, he and his boss, Tom Donilon, ambled over to
the White House to share a pizza. Wolf Blitzer, the hyperactive White House
correspondent for CNN, spotted them and immediately went on air, speculating
that something big was about to break.
McCurry watched it all on TV. At a later briefing he revealed: 'It was
pepperoni, Wolf.'

Limping back under tow to the Hamble River, near Southampton, last night was
a dismasted 41-foot Beneteau sailing vessel named Ingotism. Its doughty
crew, who had dispatched a Mayday call in the early hours as they struggled
against the elements off Barfleur in the Bay of the Seine, hailed from the
registrar's department of the Bank of England in Gloucester. And yes,
Ingotism is the pride of the fleet at the 20-year-old Bank of England
Sailing Club.
Open to all staffers working for the Old Lady, the Club boasts nearly 200
members, and the Commodore is none other than Eddie George, who inhabits
that rank not by virtue of his governorship but because he enjoys messing
about in boats. While the good ship will, at best, be in dry dock for some
time, all hands were safe. The governor was on terra firma all day, and the
gilt-edged market, for once, was not taking on water either yesterday.

Gin drinkers and others who have been hanging on thirstily to see who would
replace Crispin Davis as head of Guinness's spirits division, United
Distillers, were yesterday left uncertain as to whether to raise their
glasses in a toast. An almost 12-month search has culminated in the hiring
of the boss of a Swedish cement company.
Sadly, Finn Johnsson, chief executive of Euroc, may well not bring immediate
cheer by reversing the dastardly act committed by his predecessor, who
reduced the proof of Gordon's gin to 37.5 per cent from 40 per cent. But he
will certainly be able to put to use those international marketing skills
about which his prospective employer was yesterday enthusing. While
followers of the drinks business were enquiring as to what Euroc did for a
living, Guinness was inundated by calls from curious Swedish journalists who
cheerfully admitted that they had never heard of the British company.

Jacob Haugaard, a 42-year-old comic satirist, is laughing all the way to the
Danish parliament. Calling for uncontroversial social goods such as a
following wind on cycle tracks, he is only the second independent candidate
to secure election in nearly 80 years.
It's a case of seventh time lucky for Haugaard and his Party of Consciously
Work-shy Elements who look forward to the day when unemployment is not a
mere 12.5 per cent, as now, but 75 per cent.
A familiar figure in television, cinema advertising and through his one-man
shows, Haugaard grabbed 23,211 votes in his Jutland constituency of Aarhus,
Denmark's second-largest city. He had hoped to pull in 25,000 votes; the
shortfall he ascribes to one of his least popular proposals - less sex in
school staff rooms.
While Haugaard promises to treat his Folketing membership as a practical
joke, establishment politicians fret as to what his election says about
their profession - as well they might.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last year, John Gummer, the environment secretary, called together a
group of manufacturers of packaged goods and retailers, and challenged it to
develop and implement a plan to recover value from used packaging
('Packaging industry given deadline for recycling waste', July 28).
Since then, there have been reports in the media of how this
unrepresentative group of companies - known as the producer responsibility
group - has addressed the challenge.
Unfortunately, the group has failed to broaden its membership to reflect the
importance of packaging manufacturers in properly developing such a plan.
However, it has suggested that these same unrepresented packaging
manufacturers should pay any additional costs of increasing recovery and
recycling rates.
In addition, the group's estimates of the amount of these costs may well
prove to be wildly inaccurate.
And now it is reported that the group is developing a plan to implement its
ideas through a top-heavy bureaucratic organisation to be called Valpack,
whose structure will further disadvantage packaging manufacturers.
Surely the time has come for Mr Gummer to call a halt to this process which
he, himself, initiated. He should insist that the group reconstitutes itself
to be more broadly representative of the entire packaging chain before
finalising proposals which are of such long-term, strategic significance to
this leading industry.

FT  23 SEP 94 / The FT Interview: Deals fall out of fashion - Giorgio Armani
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giorgio Armani the fashion designer re-mains calm; but Giorgio Armani the
entrepreneur is shaken. Admittedly it has been a bad week for Italian
fashion. On Monday, the close-knit Milan community learned that bad-boy
designer Franco Moschino had died at the weekend, aged only 44. Then it
emerged that an inquiry into bribes paid to Italy's tax police had spread to
the fashion world. Big names, such as Santo Versace, brother of designer
Gianni and chairman of the Versace group, and Krizia (designer Mariuccia
Mandelli), have already been questioned by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's
best-known investigating magistrate - although the interviews were described
as routine.
Mr Armani is more worried, however, about the problems of Simint, a
Modena-based clothing company in which he holds a 22.5 per cent stake.
On Saturday, the company reported a loss of L222bn (Pounds 90m) for the year
to April 30 on turnover of just L266bn. A boardroom row about how to restate
previous accounts to reflect previously hidden losses ended in the
resignation of Mr Massimo Varazzani, Simint's chairman since March.
For Mr Armani, the man who pioneered loose suits, it has come as an
unpleasant surprise to find his name associated, albeit indirectly, with
allegations of loose accounting.
His business reputation and his carefully tended image have both been
dented, and the Simint affair has cast a shadow over celebrations of his
60th birthday and 20 years in business. But it could also represent the next
phase in the maturing of Armani the entrepreneur, which began when his
partner and best friend, Mr Sergio Galeotti, died 10 years ago.
'I've lived through some pretty critical moments recently,' says Mr Armani.
'I found myself faced with problems I'd never come across - problems with
lawyers, newspaper articles which say things about you which aren't true.
That shocked me.'
Simint's problems began in late 1992, a year after its US subsidiary
launched a new concept called A/X Armani Exchange. The stores were aimed at
the mass market, unlike the existing Giorgio Armani boutiques and
second-line Emporio Armani stores, and were supposed to sell Armani jeans
and other casual clothes, manufactured by Simint, from top locations across
the US.
Simint was not the first example of Mr Armani putting his money where his
designs were. He also has a stake in Luxottica, the successful Italian
spectacle manufacturer quoted in the US. But in the case of Simint, Mr
Armani appeared to relax his famously strict control over any venture
connected with his name.
'A/X was born with a very precise concept of salespoints for A/X products
and Armani jeans, but locations were very badly evaluated,' the designer now
says.
'The personnel structure was also very heavy, with too many people -
exaggerated for the type of work we were trying to do.'
Simint's investment costs in the US bore down on the group's profits, and
last February Mr Francesco Micheli, the Milan financier who took control of
Simint in the late 1980s, sold his 22 per cent stake, claiming that the US
venture had become too risky.
Mr Armani now says he regrets the investment, and points to Simint as an
object lesson in what can go wrong if you fail to keep control of a concept.
'It's the first time this has happened to me. I delegated a lot because I
heard people talking with great fluency and competence about the problem and
I said, well, OK, they know what's what, I'll use them.'
He is cagey about allocating blame for the Simint debacle, but feels a
responsibility to do as much as possible to keep the company afloat. Armani
business now accounts for 90 per cent of Simint's turnover, following the
loss of other licences. The designer has allowed Simint to defer L50bn worth
of payments due to Armani and committed many of his own staff to help rescue
the company.
Simint's survival also hinges on the outcome of negotiations to sell the US
subsidiary to Mr Ong Beng Seng, another shareholder, for L20bn, which Mr
Armani says should be concluded shortly.
None of this means the designer is himself short of cash. Giorgio Armani
SpA, founded with Mr Galeotti in 1975, is in the best of health in spite of
the international recession. Armani clothing and accessories, from scent to
suitcases, turned over L1,130bn last year, up 31 per cent on 1992. Armani
style ('fashion which helps people live better, not fashion which is done
for the mass media, for the petits bourgeois, to shock') seems to have
become a staple part of the wardrobes of the well-off.
That said, it seems unlikely that he would now be described - as Forbes
magazine did in 1991 on the eve of the A/X launch - as 'one of the sharpest
businessmen you are ever likely to meet', without at least some
qualification.
The Simint affair has instilled a once-bitten-twice-shy caution into the
designer. For example, he is co-operating with CVC Capital Partners  - the
European venture capital arm of Citicorp - on undefined plans to rescue GFT,
another troubled Italian supplier of Armani clothes, and prop up Simint. But
Mr Armani insists that his group would be an industrial partner and not a
shareholder in GFT.
'If you asked me now whether I wanted to take a shareholding in any type of
company, I would say no,' Mr Armani says.
The episode has also reinforced Mr Armani's wish to exert absolute control
over a fashion empire. 'It's obviously been illuminating for me,' he says.
'In our business, you absolutely cannot delegate to anyone, unless you
decide simply to exploit your name, take a lot of money and forget about it:
that means, however, not lasting long, not having a future and deciding to
wrap things up. I'm still very young to want to wrap things up.'
Such an attitude raises the inevitable question about what will happen to
the designer's business creation 'after' Mr Armani, an issue which he admits
he is only just beginning to consider in any detail. 'I'm not so egotistical
to think we have to close the business down just because I close my eyes,'
he said this week.
But the lesson of Simint, his 'first professional problem', seems to be that
there will have to be some very careful planning if Giorgio Armani SpA is
successfully to outlive its founder.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('The role of a third party', September 21) only takes the
argument half way. There are two evils associated with drugs. The first is
the harm resulting from their use and the second is the incalculable damage
to society inflicted by the crime resulting from their prohibition. In my
opinion, the second is by far the greater and its continuance is a greater
moral evil since it could be so easily removed by a stroke of the
parliamentary pen.
We would then be free to tackle drug use as we do tobacco or alcohol abuse.
The distinction between soft drugs and hard is irrelevant.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The question will not go away. If Ulster is to be granted
self-determination, why not Scotland? Why not Wales? Even the most
recalcitrant Conservative, afraid of rationality, fearful of any dilution of
the mythical powers of a long-dissolved empire, must grant that there is
some anomaly here. There is an explanation, of course. Northern Ireland has
been the subject of terrorist violence for 25 years, while Scotland has not.
As an excuse, that awful observation is insufficient. It does not answer to
the Scottish nationalists, whose 60th birthday is being celebrated at their
annual convention this week. The secessionist party is riding high in the
polls, its faith in the democratic process not to be doubted. The inference
is unavoidable. A settlement in Ulster may be a long way off, but pulling at
the Irish thread could unravel the British polity.
Wait. Flash back. There on the videotape is Mr John Major, standing on his
soap-box. It is April 5 1992, the Sunday before election day. The prime
minister, fighting a campaign most people reckon he is about to lose, warns
against proposals for a Scottish parliament, or, worse in his eyes, Scottish
independence. 'If I could summon up all the authority of the office I now
hold, through the ages, I would put it into this single warning,' he
declaims. 'The United Kingdom is in danger. Wake up now before it is too
late.'
We will never know how many minds were changed by that uncharacteristically
passionate moment of oratory. Perhaps millions, perhaps none. Mr Major
himself is in little doubt that his Sunday speech, regarded at the time as
quixotic, helped the Conservatives win their fourth consecutive spell of
office. His views will certainly not have been unpopular in middle England.
'Consider the outcome - the walls of this United Kingdom that appear so
strong, undermined from within,' he said. He urged voters to shy away from
proportional representation, at that time proffered by the Liberal Democrats
alone. In European affairs Conservatives would 'speak for Britain' while
Labour and the Lib-Dems would 'act for Brussels'.
Now flash forwards on your virtual reality screen. It is spring 1996 or
1997. There is Mr Major again, in mid-campaign, looking more mature, more
filled-out than previously. The central issue is, as always, whether the
existing set of rascals is to be trusted with management of the economy, or
whether the rival gang is to be given a chance. Yet there is chatter on the
periphery. Senior politicians are arguing about the future shape of the
European Union, and Britain's role in continental politics. Ulster has its
own parliament, in session or on the way. We can imagine what the Scottish
nationalists say about that. Labour and the Lib-Dems, their campaign
literature stuffed with talk of national renewal, have undertaken to
renovate the constitution. High-flown talk of a 21st century settlement
between the peoples and governments of these islands has become commonplace.
Up springs Mr Major, onto the box. The prime minister recalls his words of
four or five years previously. 'Quebec,' he says, 'Slovakia', he adds, 'and
Serbia, Croatia, unspellable pieces of old Russia and what about Spain?' He
speaks of the historic glories of the United Kingdom, the distinctiveness of
the island nation, the enduring values enshrined in the most ancient of
parliaments, the true freedom of those fortunate enough to be born British.
He dresses from head to toe in the Union Jack. That, as they say in New
York, could go down like chopped liver.
Or perhaps not. The debate has yet to begin. The mainstream opposition
parties both promise systemic reform. Labour and the Lib-Dems would give
Scotland its parliament, bar hereditary peers from the House of Lords,
create regional authorities in England and perhaps an assembly in Wales,
enact a bill of rights, and introduce proportional representation for
elections to bodies other than the House of Commons. The latter is to be
decided by referendum. No one is surprised that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Lib-Dem leader who has had an unfortunate week at his party's conference,
favours such a programme. What now needs to be established is the strength
of commitment of Labour's new leader, Mr Tony Blair.
He must either campaign strongly on the reform theme, or quietly bury it.
The latter would be difficult. One argument for devolution was set out by Mr
George Robertson, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary, in a speech in
Frankfurt earlier this month. It is that some give, some flexibility, and a
great deal of decentralisation of power would prevent a break-up of the
United Kingdom. 'Today's British government plays into the nationalist hand
by a staggering lack of vision in adapting constitutionally as it has done
over 150 years,' he said.
There is, however, another case to put. Britain has not been well-served by
the concentration of power at the centre. Since 1979 the Conservatives have
behaved with the arrogance of the single party in a one-party state. They
have weakened or overturned one democratic institution after another. They
have neutered local government. They have appointed friends and cronies to
sit on school boards, hospital managements, and at every station on the
network of quangos. The Treasury controls these unelected bodies by
exercising authority over their expenditure. Meanwhile Ulster, Scotland and
Wales, not to mention Lib-Dem Cornwall and Devon, boast their own
traditions, separate from those of England. Across the water, Europe is
being reshaped. It is time to modernise the way Britain is governed.
Mr Blair has shown himself to be aware of the strength of this argument, and
conscious of the appeal it has in some quarters, not confined to Charter 88,
the energetic pressure group. Reform was consistently cheered by the
Lib-Dems this week. The Labour leader will be spared the embarrassment of
negotiating a post-election arrangement with Mr Ashdown if he can steal
enough of the latter's voters away. It is highly unlikely that an election
will be won on the issue of constitutional reform. Against that, there is
little else to enthuse opposition supporters. Labour's pronouncements on the
economy too closely resemble the Conservatives' to cause the blood to rush
round activist veins. If there is to be a Left vision, it has to be reform.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Argument that company cars are
tax-efficient is a fallacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Michael Landon (Letters, September 17) seeks to resurrect the old -
and ultimately self-defeating - chestnut that company cars are still 'a very
cost-effective way of providing a benefit to employees'.
The truth of the matter is that the government has finally achieved its
long-standing aim of establishing a level playing field in company car
taxation. That is not to say that all cars are tax neutral - indeed there
are many winners and losers. Rather, the playing field is now undulating,
but, on average, is level.
One common fallacy committed by those who argue that company cars are still
very tax efficient is to forget that a proportion of any cash alternative
can also be paid tax free either under the fixed profit car scheme or on the
strict statutory basis. Hence it is not correct to state that a private car
must be financed out of after-tax earnings - only the private use proportion
of the cost need be so funded.
In practice, the main factor in determining whether a company car is now tax
efficient is the relative purchasing power of employer and employee. As with
other benefits in kind (for example, private medical care), the ability of
the employer to negotiate a discounted rate is the true perk. However, even
here the playing field is beginning to level out as manufacturers and
leasing companies develop ever more sophisticated personal lease
arrangements and as phantom fleet insurance becomes more commonplace.
Notwithstanding the above, most employees will choose to retain their
company cars for a variety of non-monetary reasons: for example, there is no
hassle involved and they have no responsibility for the car.
My belief is that the status car culture is slowly but surely being eroded
as companies turn to flexible benefit packages and employees begin realising
the attractions of non-conventional pay practices. Those looking for an
overnight change in company car practice will, however, be sorely
disappointed. Brian Friedman,

FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK economic trend argues against
monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the new set of trade figures released on Wednesday reveals, the UK
economy is finally cashing in on Britain's forced exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism two years ago ('Non-EU exports rise to record
highs', September 22). This outcome had not really been too difficult to
predict (Letters, September 28 1992).
While fears of any repercussions on the inflation front have proved
unfounded as well, the opportunity costs of an artificially high exchange
rate have become all too clear. 'Black Wednesday', even though it should be
considered
a humiliation of the government's economic policy at that time, was a real
blessing for Britain's economic pros-pects.
Moreover, it offers some food for thought regarding future EU economic
policy. As there is no way to prevent economies from diverging at some
point, any fixed exchange rate will eventually prove wrong as well.
Consequently, the recent British experience is the best argument available
against the planned European monetary union]

FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Model for international total quality
award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROWAN ASTBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The message in Alan Mitchell's article (Management: The Growing
Business, September 20) is absolutely right - the quality assurance system
BS EN ISO 9000 is a small component of total quality and not the whole
answer. He reports on various ways of trying to add total quality to quality
assurance . . . but how cumbersome and confusing these ways sound] What is
needed is an internationally endorsed, systematic approach to total quality,
and this now exists. It is the model used in the new UK Quality Award.
Strongly supported by the British Quality Foundation and the European
Quality Foundation, the model is endorsed by the Department of Trade and
Industry and government generally. The prime minister, John Major, will be
presenting the first awards to UK companies using the model in November.
What is more, the model is designed to be used by organisations of all
types, sectors and sizes, and can be adopted on a self-help basis, without
the need for expensive advice.
We work with voluntary sector organisations and often recommend that they
use this model.
Interestingly, some large private sector organisations are now wondering how
they can offer help to voluntary organisations working on quality. The
principles can be the same regardless of sector and size, and such help can
show the private sector organisation's commitment and expertise to good
advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fear your leader, 'Well done, Mr Clarke' (September 17), gives too
much credence to the harsh judgment of the financial markets over the UK's
inflation prospects.
You omit any acknowledgement that the reduction in inflation since
sterling's abrupt departure from the ERM was achieved despite highly
unfavourable circumstances. During that two-year period sterling has
declined by 15 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, while commodity prices
have risen by more than a third.
In view of the scale of these external inflationary shocks that have been
successfully absorbed by UK industry, I am sceptical of your comment that
the recent mild upturn in inflation indicates an absence of excess capacity.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Poor Superman - a Play with Captions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful artist David (Ian Gelder) is suffering from painter's block. His
friends, Shannon (Jude Akuwudike), desperate for a sex change operation
before he dies of Aids, and Kryla (Elaine Collins, excellent), a sardonic
hackette equally desperately seeking The Man, know exactly what he needs: a
new boyfriend. They are less than enchanted when he picks up Matt
(Christopher Simon), the naive young restaurateur who just happens to be
happily married to the devoted Violet (Kathryn Howden).
Super hot Canadian playwright Brad Fraser takes the well worn theme of
tainted love in Poor Superman - a Play with Captions, but embroiders it into
a compelling insight into the power of sex over the lives of gay men. In
director Ian Brown's sharp and discrete production, which started life at
the Traverse, Edinburgh (where it was well received on this page by Martin
Hoyle), Fraser surely has another award to add to his mantelpiece.
The only question marks hang over the title. The Superman leitmotif never
justifies itself, and the captions, which light up in neon at the back of
the stage to beam the real thoughts of the characters behind their polite,
and not so polite, conversation, are hardly needed in such punchy dialogue.
The lives of gays and young entrepreneurs in Calgary, Canada, are not the
traditional stuff of drama but from the first you care desperately about
Matt, with his faltering cry of 'I'm not queer' as he falls into the arms of
David; and Violet, whose horizons are happily confined to stove and nappies;
indeed all the credulous victims hanging round David, who may be an ageing
charmer but proves an ill equipped Superman.
Fraser's great achievement is that he does not take sides: David is quite
prepared to exploit people in the cause of art: it is up to the audience to
decide who are the winners and who the losers. Fraser has also dusted down
some sharp Wildean aphorisms to set alongside the easy lies of normal talk.
Almost incidentally Poor Superman contains some of the most explicit sexual
acts seen on the London stage. The fact that they perfectly underpin the
action and develop the characters is a triumph for cast and director.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Berlin tunes in to Goldschmidt - The 91-year-old
composer's work is being recognised at last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has finally made its peace with Berthold Goldschmidt. Forced to flee
the Nazis in 1935 for London, where he has lived ever since, the 91-year old
composer has been the toast of this year's Berlin Festival.
Both his operas have been performed - Der gewaltige Hahnrei in a slick,
hyper-active Harry Kupfer staging at the Komische Oper (which put on a
special Goldschmidt exhibition), and Beatrice Cenci in a concert version
linked to a commercial recording. The nearby city of Magdeburg organised a
parallel set of events, including the stage premiere of Beatrice Cenci.
Goldschmidt's three concertos and other symphonic works have also been
played.
The response from the German press, public and music establishment has been
ecstatic. There have been full houses, standing ovations and a touching
ceremony at which Goldschmidt was presented with some early manuscripts,
previously thought to be lost. The warmth of his reception can be put down
partly to genuine delight at such performable music, and to the sight of a
nonagenarian enjoying every minute.
Goldschmidt's time has come, and he deserves a medal for surviving to
witness it. For many Germans, he is a living link with a golden age in their
country's musical history, a symbol of what might have been if Nazism had
not intervened so decisively. But the Goldschmidt revival is also a mark of
collective guilt - a chance to atone for all Jewish artists whose creative
spark was extinguished in the gas chambers. Would Goldschmidt's music have
survived if he too had died? Would there be the same interest today if it
had been played 60 times in the 1930s?
But that is playing with history. To hear staged performances of his two
operas in quick succession last weekend was to be confronted by a composer
who takes care over word-settings and chooses juicy topics for the theatre.
The music itself may not blaze with originality or natural drama, but it is
well-made and easily assimilated. The two operas deserved to be heard, and
the evidence suggests they would repay further investigation.
Der gewaltige Hahnrei (The Mighty Cuckold), first staged in Mannheim in
1932, was the last opera by a Jewish composer to be premiered before the
Nazis came to power. Along with hundreds of others, Goldschmidt's music was
quickly categorised as 'degenerate'. By the end of the war, the trends of
the 1920s and early 1930s had sunk without trace, buried in the rubble of
the Third Reich. It was time for a fresh start. Serialism was the new
orthodoxy, and anyone who did not subscribe to it was old hat. Like
thousands of other German Jews who escaped, Goldschmidt had to pick up the
pieces of his career elsewhere - becoming a British citizen in 1947 and, as
a conductor, playing an important role in the British Mahler vogue. Hahnrei
had to wait 62 years until this month's revival, borne along on the recent
surge of interest in Germany's 'lost' interwar era.
It is a precocious work for a 28-year old. Based on a play by the
contemporary Belgian dramatist Fernand Crommelynck, and subtitled a 'musical
tragi-comedy', it tells of the man who believes in his wife's love but
cannot trust her. Bruno is so convinced that Stella is unfaithful that he
forces her to do what he fears most - to take other men to bed. She believes
she is demonstrating her love for him by obeying. He ends up disguising
himself and seducing her.
Here is a kinky story - but psychologically fascinating, full of sexual
neurosis and very much a product of its time. Goldschmidt's score is equally
a period piece. He comes across as a German Poulenc or Ibert - a master of
pastiche and a brilliant orchestrator, with lots of expert doodling. There
are echoes of his teacher Schreker, of Weill, Krenek, Shostakovich, Mahler,
jazz, cabaret. Over a 100-minute span, you just sit back and watch the
styles change. The drama itself goes nowhere.
The Komische Oper's production did nothing to counter that impression.
Kupfer, with his designers Hans Schavernoch and Reinhard Heinrich,
underlined the work's surrealist fantasy, keeping the visual framework as
abstract as possible. The set - an undulating pink cat-walk looped round a
stylised see-saw and climbing rack - fell somewhere between wedding-cake and
playground. Costumes and make-up were pure pantomime. The air was thick with
irony, but anyone ignorant of the plot would have been lost. The more Kupfer
spun the stage turntable, the more tedious the performance became. An
earthier, less artful approach would have done the work greater service - so
it is good to hear another staging is planned for Bern.
In every other respect, this was a strong ensemble performance. Under Yakov
Kreizberg, the Komische Oper's new music director, the orchestra negotiated
the different styles and rhythms with commanding verve. The cast was headed
by Yvonne Wiedstruck, who captured Stella's innocent beauty, and Gunter
Neumann's tormented Bruno.
Hearing Beatrice Cenci 24 hours later in Magdeburg was to discover a
composer who had found his own style - an amalgam of incisive themes and
Busoni-like counterpoint. Commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but
unperformed for various unsavoury reasons until a 1988 concert in London,
Cenci gives compact operatic form to Shelley's sordid tale of the Italian
Renaissance. As in Hahnrei, the theme is sexual violence and the
exploitation of women, but in more sinister vein. Unlike Hahnrei, it
benefited immeasurably from the stage setting.
The Magdeburg production was given at the Theater am Jerichowerplatz, a
converted cinema at the former Russian barracks. Despite an unhelpful
acoustic and crude lighting, Max Hoffmann's staging told the story clearly
and honestly, leaving plenty of room for the imagination. Eberhard
Matthies's realistic set combined simplicity and grandeur, while Renate
Schmitzer's costumes had a 20th century flavour, without being too specific.
The cast, singing in the original English, was headed by the Canadian
soprano Heather Thomson as Beatrice. She acted sensitively and brought
character to Goldschmidt's unvarying vocal moderato - not least in the
beautiful Act 3 lullaby. Irena Sylya was the sympathetic Lucrezia, and David
Cumberland made a properly tyrannical Count Cenci. Under Mathias Husmann,
the rest of the cast, chorus and orchestra gave fulsome support.
The concert performance of Cenci in Berlin (which I heard on the radio),
featuring Roberta Alexander, Della Jones and a coarse-sounding Simon Estes,
may have had greater musical polish, but Magdeburg gave the opera theatrical
life. It is now time for a British company to follow suit.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: The Mortal Ash - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Cameron's new play at the Bush Theatre - his third to be premiered
there - is a dialect drama about life on a council estate in South Yorkshire
and hence, by all too ready extension, about the state of Britain, the
demoralising effects of unemployment. Actually the private and public themes
of The Mortal Ash tend to pull apart, just as its tragic and comic impulses
often seem at odds. Billed as a comedy, the play impresses first as a
melodrama in which a working-class family confront calamity from every
corner but keep cracking jokes in the best down-to-earth, hard-bitten, North
of England manner.
Feuds, vendettas, hooliganism, estrangement of father (Tom) and eldest son
(Chris), imprisonment of another son for GBH, unruliness of a third (Duane),
cynical disaffection of daughter (Rainy) - these are just some of the
Wheatley family problems. The aviary in their backyard has been smashed up
as the play begins, and a brick been hurled through the window while Rainy
(Jane Hazlegrove) was watching telly. Throughout the evening one expects
further hurled bricks and calamities; but all we actually see of trouble are
the bare legs and torso of Duane (James Hooton) covered with nettle stings
and Calamine after a gang-fight on Mortal Ash.
Mortal Ash is an area of ponds that has been unpopularly filled in by a
tough local businessman, and by hard-up Tom Wheatley as one of his
labourers. A young girl died during a protest there, which leaves Tom
conscience-stricken in ways he can barely express and which baffle and
alienate the principled Chris, who has left home to live impecuniously with
his now pregnant girlfriend, Linda (Colleen Prendergast), scion of an enemy
family. Much, therefore, has to be sorted out during the play, but there is
always someone on hand to make tea when things get too difficult, in the
best Northern tradition.
Screaming fits - Mrs Wheatley is particularly prone to them - and one-liners
jostle each other in a way that is truer to the theatre than life. Each act
devolves into a long set-piece in which mother and father respectively
disburden themselves, conceding with wry humour in the one case, and bitter
anguish in the other, that parents do not know much more than their children
about the way things are. One realises that the intended thrust of the play
is not so much comical, tragical or political as lyrical-pastoral. There is
much talk of fishing and birds. At the end, Tom sets out to reconstruct his
garden, building a pond and planting an ash.
Director Simon Usher finds a leisurely pace for the action which seems
mostly right and at times even poetical. Paul Copley is crisply convincing
as the neo-Lawrentian muck-stained father home from work and delivering
apophthegms like 'Thiy either will or thiy won't' when asked if Chris and
Linda will cope with their child. Richard Standing makes a sympathetic Chris
and Jane Cox is robustly entertaining as his soft-hard, wise-cracking
mother.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Mahler and Henze - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday the London Symphony not only began its cycle of Mahler
symphonies with Michael Tilson Thomas - half this autumn, the rest in the
new year - but showed off the newly improved acoustics of the Barbican Hall.
Mahler's First made a very good test. On all counts, the performance was
resoundingly impressive.
After the hall opened in 1982, there was some anxious tinkering with things
that affected the acoustic, and since then it has been pretty good: forward
and full, though in orchestral tuttis there was sometimes a hard glare of
upper partials. Last month new absorbent surfaces were attached at strategic
places along the walls of the circle and stalls, and the balconies got
handsome wooden fronts. The result is an inconspicuous but decisive
improvement in the sound: no glare, but no muffling either, and - with the
LSO, at least] - lovely clarity and balance.
The most striking virtue of Tilson Thomas's Mahler 1, which is a work
studded with hazardous turns and abrupt switches, was that it sounded
seamless. One was lost in admiration; that effect is not to be achieved by
mere suavity or steadiness, but only by thinking the music all the way
through. That was manifestly what Tilson Thomas was doing, and transmitting
his intentions completely to the orchestra. There were dozens of gorgeously
realised passages (without indulgence, though the Knaben Wunderhorn tunes
were illuminated with the utmost tenderness), and an overriding arc of clean
purpose, with a grandly built triumph at the end.
Perhaps a little of the First's sheer wildness was tamed away. For Mahler,
this was a defiantly fractured symphony; to Tilson Thomas it seems a
finished monument, and its irruptions of village-band dances were tamped
smoothly into place - there was no snarl from the elegant woodwinds. But it
was a hugely musicianly reading, and superbly played; it promised great
things in the symphonies to come.
It was prefaced by James MacMillan's new ten-minute fantasy Britannia,
characteristically ingenious and funny (it caught the audience slightly off
guard, I thought), and Tilson Thomas's own From the Diary of Anne Frank -
honest, effective film-music, with narration gently delivered by Debra
Winger.
On the previous night, the Nash Ensemble honoured the composer Hans Werner
Henze with a Wigmore programme of his recent chamber music. It is always
nice to know what he has been up to, but there were no substantial
surprises. A tiny 'Adagio adagio' for piano trio was exquisite salon
pastiche; five Nocturnes for violin were fragile, pretty and suggestive;
three short songs about snow boasted a delectable accompanying ensemble.
Much of the new Piano Quintet is interestingly angry, and the rest of it
haunted and inward. I fancy it wants a bolder performance than the Nash
players gave it this time, though they were scrupulous. The songs and dances
from Henze's operetta La Cubana, newly arranged, still sound too close to
Weill to bear the comparison, despite an appealing, Zerbinetta-ish final
number.

Surely we all know people who have gone to amazing lengths to get their
children into the state schools of their choice? I know a magistrate who has
lied repeatedly about her address and spent years collecting school letters
from friends' houses, and others who have actually moved house for the sake
of being in the 'right' area. So Class Action will have to dig up something
truly extraordinary if the first programme in its new series is going to
surprise us on that subject (8.00 C4). Radio 3 has a couple of promising
programmes. At 9.20 the Endellion Quartet play three Haydn pieces (Op 33 No
3, Op 20 No 5 and Op 76 No 2) and Webern's Langsammer Satz. That is followed
by the 'Friday Feature' Born Under The Star Of Comedy in which Joe Farrell
tells the story of Carlo Goldoni, an 18th-century Venetian who churned out
no fewer than 250 plays (10.45). I found the opening episode of Knowing Me,
Knowing You embarrassing rather than funny, but perhaps Alan Partridge's
spoof chat show will improve (10.00 BBC2). The opening programme in a new
run of Clive Anderson Talks Back was, by contrast, very funny indeed (10.30
C4).

FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology: Drugged by the deep blue sea - The oceans may
contain the ingredients to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer and
arthritis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH

<TEXT>
From the coral reefs of the Pacific ocean to the Antarctic, scuba divers are
scraping barnacles from rocks, digging deposits from the sea bottom, bagging
fish and algae and filling vials with seawater in the hope that their
findings will one day yield an important drug.
Marine biotechnology is attracting the attention of companies in the US,
Europe and Japan, many of which are searching the ocean for potential drugs.
They include Lederle, a division of American Cyanamid; the biotechnology
groups FMC and Martek; pharmaceutical groups Merck and SmithKline Beecham;
and Japanese companies Nippon Steel and Mitsui.
The US government has set up a Dollars 45m (Pounds 29m) programme for marine
biotechnology research, and the Japanese government is also investing
heavily.
Many scientists are convinced that remote regions may hold the secrets to
treating dozens of diseases. Research in the world's rainforests in recent
years, for example, has produced drugs such as the anti-tumor agents
Vinblastine and Vinvristine, both developed from the Madagascar periwinkle.
However, marine biotechnologists say the potential of the rain forests pales
in comparison with that of the ocean. 'It comes down to the numbers game, to
accessing the greatest biodiversity possible,' says Brad Carte, senior
investigator in bio-molecular discovery for SmithKline Beecham. The oceans
cover 71 per cent of the earth's surface and much of the life within them is
still a mystery. To many scientists this offers the possibility of
discovering more potentially life-saving drugs.
'The ocean is an untapped resource,' says Henry Linsert, chief executive
officer of Martek. 'It is a rich source of organisms. Algae alone makes up a
tremendous amount of the plant biomass on Earth.'
Results from marine biotechnology efforts have so far been mixed. Some of
the most promising compounds, such as the anti-cancer agent didemnen B, and
some anti-inflammatory agents have been dropped from research over the last
few years. Yet marine biotechnologists say failures in marine compound
screening, just as in terrestrial compound screening, are inevitable. In the
long run, they believe, they are bound to make some hits.
This autumn, Martek hopes to launch a fatty acid, DHA, which it discovered
in marine algae, on the European market. The product will be added to infant
formula to make it more similar to human milk.
With pollution and misuse threatening a number of ocean species, scientists
say they are concerned about losing marine biodiversity, and with it,
valuable compounds. This concern has lent their work a sense of urgency.
'The ocean has been used as a dumping ground for a long time,' says Debra
Steinberg, group leader for the Maine marine biotechnology effort at
American Cyanamid. 'Concern about pollution makes scientists feel that we
should try to find out what is there before it is destroyed.'
Marine biotechnology is still in its infancy. No leading drug has yet been
launched. A handful are in clinical trials in the US, mainly cancer
treatment hopefuls being studied by the National Cancer Institute, which in
the 1970s became one of the first organisations to engage in marine
biotechnology research.
Scientists say the small number of products in clinical trials merely
reflects past lack of interest in the sea. With more companies now involved,
marine biotechnologists believe the next two decades will see a number of
products moving on to the market and many more entering clinical trials.
Three likely disease targets are cancer, arthritis and other inflammatory
illnesses, and diseases affecting the central nervous system.
It has taken this long for companies to gain an interest in the sea, marine
biotechnologists say, because the modern pharmaceutical industry grew out of
a long-term human interest in the curative qualities of plants.
'We live on land, and we've traditionally looked at terrestrial plants for
cures,' says Gerald Weissmann, a professor of medicine at the New York
University Medical Centre. 'Most pharmaceutical companies don't have any
direct contact with the sea. They are based inland; they don't own boats,
and they don't usually have a lot of divers or marine scientists on their
staff. That's why it has taken them so long to get interested in the ocean.'
Pharmaceuticals also faced practical barriers - it is only in recent decades
that long-term, deep-sea exploration has become possible.
Scientists also had difficulty replicating marine compounds in the lab. 'It
is not that marine compounds are more difficult to synthesise,' says William
Fenical, professor of oceanography of Scripps Institute of Oceanography. 'It
is just that we haven't had as much practice in that area, and so we are not
as good at it as we are at synthesising terrestrial compounds.'
Scientists are excited by the potential of marine life. Barnacles clinging
to ocean rocks may yield a special glue that would resist salt and
temperature changes and could play a role in surgical procedures such as
joint replacement. Sponges, which fall apart so easily, could provide a clue
to the prevention of cell binding and in turn lead to a treatment for
inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.
Marine life can be used not only as a source of compounds, but also as a way
of testing drugs. The male contraceptive gossypol, for instance, relied
partly on studies in sea urchins for its development.
Yet just as scientists turned from macro-organisms, such as plants, to
microbes, many believe the emphasis in marine biotechnology will eventually
be in microbes. 'The state of the art is in microbes,' says Fenical.
Ultimately, one of the main challenges facing the industry may be political,
rather than technological. The legalities of marine drug discovery are still
nebulous. If a company develops a cure for cancer based on a compound found
only on certain coral reefs, for instance, the government concerned might
demand royalties.
On the other hand, many companies see the ocean as a far less regulated
source of compounds than terrestrial areas. 'As sovereign issues become more
important in land research, such as in rain forests, companies may turn more
to the ocean,' says Susan Clymer, managing director of the marine
biotechnology group NichiBei Bio. 'In international waters, it's still kind
of a free-for-all.'

Researchers working in the fast-growing field of combinatorial chemistry aim
to make a wide variety of compounds simultaneously, which are then screened
to find useful characteristics.
The first set of computer tools to assist in this process have been devised
by Tripos, a US scientific software company. Tripos's Mass Screen software
will assist researchers to generate vast 'libraries' of compounds and
manipulate the data as they search for new leads in drug development.

<TEXT>
Car theft has become a European epidemic, writes Andrew Fisher. In Germany,
one is stolen every four minutes. The theft of items from vehicles -
particularly telephones and CD players - is also a curse of modern driving.
Now, VDO Kienzle has produced a device to ward off both types of thief. Its
VDO Combi Alarm 2000 security system incorporates contact-controlled
monitoring of all doors and also monitors the interior with switchable
ultrasonic sensors.
The system, which immobilises the car's fuel pump and ignition, is switched
on and off by radio remote control. Its alarm can also be integrated with a
central locking system. The Frankfurt company says the device activates
itself automatically 10 minutes after the ignition is switched off or, via a
door contact, 30 seconds after the driver leaves the vehicle. It costs DM920
(Pounds 380).

A drug that suppresses the immune system has been found to reduce brain
damage associated with strokes. Researchers working at the Fujisawa
Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh found that the
immunosuppressant drug FK506 substantially reduced brain damage if it was
administered up to an hour after the stroke.
The research, which was reported in this week's Nature, may shed light on
the role in brain cells of immunophilins, substances known to bind to FK506.

Pest-infested antiques and textiles are usually fumigated using poisonous
solvents or gases. A less toxic treatment, which does not leave the item in
need of restoration, is being introduced into the UK by Thermo Lignum, a
London-based company.
The process involves slowly heating the article up to a maximum of 55'C,
which destroys the pests. The procedure takes a few hours for fabrics and
eight to 20 hours for wooden objects.
Although the principle underlying the technique is simple, it needs
sophisticated computerised controls of temperature and humidity to prevent
the articles suffering structural damage.

A new detection system to catch drug smugglers and terrorists is undergoing
trials in the UK and US.
The ion trap mobility spectrometer works by heating samples to a high
temperature. Once the relevant molecules are ionised, they are detected
using a sensitive electronic collection and signal processing system.
The detector, which has been developed by Ai Cambridge of the UK and Ion
Track Instruments of Massachusetts detects explosives and narcotics between
10 and 100 times more sensitively than existing machines. The system is
capable of getting a strong signal from one picogram (10'12 gram) of
explosives or narcotics.
Field trials are expected to be completed in airports by the end of this
year.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (7): The property
market draws the map - The West End is as much an idea as a clearly defined
area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West End is a fiction. It is accepted as one of the world's largest
business centres but no-one can agree exactly where it begins and ends. It
exists only as an indeterminate swathe lying west of Whitehall and north of
the Thames.
Borders change according to the state of the market - or the views of
whoever is drawing the map. Tenants widened their search for space during
the boom, so King's Cross and Paddington were drawn into this amorphous mass
in the tidal wave of surveys produced by agents. Jones Lang Wootton has even
crossed the river into Lambeth - a sort of South-West End - since the
heightening of interest around Waterloo Station.
Demand and supply figures therefore need to be treated carefully. Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, for instance, says take-up fell from 1m sqft to 646,000 sq
ft in the three months to June, while supply fell 15 per cent from just
under 8m to 6.7m sq ft. JLW, on the other hand, puts take-up at 685,000 sq
ft with supply down 2 per cent at 8.76m sq ft.
Overall figures are relatively meaningless anyway. 'It is far more useful to
look at what is happening in specific areas,' says Philip Dawe of Herring
Baker Harris. 'The West End is not one single entity but a collection of
markets.'
MAYFAIR/ST JAMES'S, the core area, is in greatest demand from high-profile
tenants. It sets the tone for the West End: 'What happens here today affects
the rest of area tomorrow,' says Mr Dawe.
One key happening was the letting of Almack House to J P Morgan, according
to James Birkett of Richard Ellis. This was one of only a handful of 100,000
sq ft-plus buildings left in the whole West End, and must make other tenants
looking for headquarters feel distinctly nervous about what they will have
to pay in future.
The 40 a sq ft headline rent, while well below the 70 peak achieved in the
boom, sets a benchmark for valuing other space. 'It also reveals proven
demand in a market where there is very little space,' adds Birkett's
colleague John Olney.
That is one more factor which could get development moving again after a
long hiatus. So is the creeping erosion of a vast rump of second-hand space.
Rents have crept up from Pounds 30 to as much as Pounds 35 a sq ft in
buildings such as Lansdowne House and Berkeley Square House over the last
six months.
The Prudential was encouraged enough to started work on 55,000 sq ft of
speculative development at 30 Berkeley Square, which it considered selling
18 months ago. That might be thought a key move, as institutions hold a
near-monopoly of prime sites and buildings, leaving developers with little
chance of muscling in. Any big surge of development is likely to be in 1995
rather than this year, however.
'There are not enough deals at good headline rents to convince investors,'
says Paul Yearley of JLW. But pressure is rising as landlords notice that
rent-free periods have dropped from more than two years to around 18 months.
With a few more lettings, they will have enough evidence to move - and they
could be already in train. Pearson, for instance, which owns the Financial
Times, is understood to have offered Scottish Widows around Pounds 35 a sq
ft to put Lazards into the 40,000 refurbishment in Burlington Gardens.
SOHO and COVENT GARDEN stand next in the queue for reassessment, with rents
rising for the first time in five years, says Mr Birkett. The main thrust
comes from media companies which shed space early in the recession. 'They
are now lean, mean and hiring again - but have no space,' says Mr Yearley.
CD &amp; P had to fight off three other advertising agencies to take a sub-let
of 40,000 sq ft in Aquila House, Soho Square, from the Pru. There are
doubts, however, whether media groups will pay the new going rate for space.
While rents rose to Pounds 50 in the peak, real levels are now half this
amount, says Philip Dawe. 'The industry is notoriously cost-conscious,' he
says. 'It is difficult to see groups like publishers going above the Pounds
35 level needed to justify new space.'
Dormeil House, an 80,000 sq ft block going up in Golden Square, could test
the industry's confidence and courage, as this is likely to be priced at
more than Pounds 30 a sq ft.
One alternative is to move out of their traditional stamping ground.
VICTORIA has already laid claim as the new media centre, says Mr Yearley.
Channel 4 built its own HQ in Horseferry Road, which is bound to gather
like-minded production and publishing companies. Advertising agency DMB&amp;B is
thought to be paying around Pounds 25 a sq ft for the 80,000 sq ft released
by Tiphook in 123 Buckingham Palace Road and the Press Association is
understood to be buying Bank Paribas' 40,000 sq ft Denison House in Vauxhall
Bridge Road for more than Pounds 10m.
Some developers are well set to tap the spillover from Mayfair and Covent
Garden because they have started construction early in the cycle. Land
Securities has 50,000 sq ft underway at 25 Victoria Street, CIS is preparing
to start 60,000 sq ft in Wilton Street and Chesterfield Properties has an
80,000 sq ft refurbishment in Vauxhall Bridge Road.
The vacancy level in Victoria of 8 per cent is the lowest in the West End,
says Herring Baker Harris, but with rents static at around Pounds 27.50 a sq
ft there is little incentive for more new development. Victoria may have
broken out of its traditional second-tier role, however. Salomon Brothers
has voted to stay in the area by paying Pounds 80m for its lease on Victoria
Place, showing that this is a viable location for a leading financial group.
Ian Noble of Cluttons points out that there is still more than 1m sq ft of
space - much of it second-hand - on the market. That is bound to muffle the
impact of demand on rents. Prime new space is hard to find, however, which
means Victoria is back at the top of its traditional two-tier market.
NORTH of OXFORD ST, the opposite fringe of the West End, there is more
strong competition for tenants, particularly the half dozen or so
advertising agencies in the market for between 20,000 and 80,000 sq ft,
according to Brien Martin of Imry.
There is plenty of piecemeal, substandard accommodation, but few quality
blocks with strong identities, he says, which is the rationale behind his
company's 23,000 sq ft refurbishment of 54 Baker Street. But hefty
competition will come from schemes such as CIN's 130,000 sq ft renovation of
33 Cavendish Square and the glossy new 40,000 sq ft being built by AXA
Equity and Law at Wigmore Street.
These are exceptions to the rule, however. Rents of around Pounds 22.50 a sq
ft are again too low to stimulate much development. But Jonathon Evans of
KFR says the ever-tightening market in the core will spin off demand to the
fringes, just as it did in the boom.
If, as is likely, development lags the revival of demand for large
buildings, tenants may even spin as far as:
EUSTON ROAD, where Hammerson hopes to catch them with open arms in Marathon
House - providing the tenant does not take on a short-term renewal of the
lease as rumoured.
Perhaps the best sign of better things to come, however, is the Pounds 35 a
sq ft being asked by British Land for 60,000 sq ft of renovated space in
Regent's Place, the new name for the Euston Centre. Its chairman, John
Ritblat, rarely calls the market wrongly. If he thinks that will pull in the
tenants, perhaps the West End is on the verge of recovery after all.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (8): Government
offices head the list - Some of the principal occupants and their
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ambitious plans in the 1980s for decentralising ministries to
high-unemployment areas sent shivers through the property market. Government
bodies occupy around a third of all West End offices. They also tend to have
the biggest buildings - which can be the hardest to re-let.
Further threats came from the Next Steps programme, aimed at forcing
semi-privatised departments to cut costs - particularly rents. But
Armageddon has failed to arrive. In fact, government take-up is running at
similar levels to a decade ago.
The private sector appears just as reluctant to decamp. When Herring Baker
Harris (HBH) polled six major sectors forming around a quarter of tenants,
all but one insisted that a West End address was essential. They all had
different reasons; retailers and foreign banks cited need to be close to
clients, while oil and advertising companies voted mainly for ease of
communications. Management consultants put both these factors on a par with
access to skilled labour.
Having a presence is less important than how much space each will take in
the future, however. And that rests on even more complex factors affecting
each sector.
Government is obviously the most crucial player, particularly in Victoria
where it accounted for more than 40 per cent of take-up in the last decade,
says HBH. A single decision helped give the local market an edge of
respectability in the last 12 months. The Cabinet decided not to relocate
two major departments to Canary Wharf when their Marsham Street headquarters
are demolished.
Instead, the DoE will have its own environmentally-friendly, 250,000 sq ft
home built by Land Securities on the site of Elland House, while the DoT has
taken 220,000 sq ft in Horseferry Road. Along with the letting of Portland
House to the Crown Prosecution Service, that almost used up Victoria's
current stock of prime big buildings.
The Defence Ministry, a Bloomsbury occupier, could have the opposite effect
by halving its workforce, but the government will continue to be a major
overall force in future, says HBH. 'There is unlikely to be a significant
reduction as new agencies, departments and quangos continue to be
established and take up space released through rationalisation, says the
firm in its report Thriving in the Midst of Plenty.
Oil is the next largest sector, with 56 companies occupying 2.3m sq ft -
around 6 per cent of the West End stock. While most companies want to keep a
presence, this appears likely to be much smaller. Mobil, Total, Chevron and
Conoco are among big names either moving out of London or reassessing space
demands. Victoria, which is still home to more than a quarter of the sector,
will feel the draught most keenly.
Telecommunications is also set for decline. It is the only sector which does
not believe a West End location is important and, with 5 per cent of the
office stock, this could have important repercussions.
BT is the driving force, with the lion's share of both the industry and
office space. The company is determined to cut its workforce by more than
100,000 by 1997, but an even bigger knife will slash the national property
estate from almost 50m to 7m sq ft.
That casts a shadow over 25 West End centres comprising around 1m sq ft.
Even if they survive, it is likely that most will shift out of central
London.
Some 80 advertising agencies occupy around 4 per cent of the area's office
space. The large majority are in Soho, Covent Garden or north of Oxford
Street, mainly in buildings of less than 50,000 sq ft. This sector is among
the most dedicated to the West End, despite one or two important moves to
places such as Docklands. While recovery is bringing demand for more space,
HBH forecasts further rationalisation through mergers and takeovers, with
any expansion limited to small setups.
Retailers are also set for fundamental changes. They, too, occupy around
1.5m sq ft of offices as an administrative back-up to the country's largest
shopping centre. But this will decline as new technology reduces staff
required for tasks such as sales forecasting and analysis.
Headquarters will shrink and computing services relocate out of central
London. That will leave many companies with the difficulty of getting rid of
space tied into long leases.
More than 90 foreign banks occupy a similar total space as retailers, and
mainly in the same areas of St James's and Mayfair. New ones are expected to
emerge, but just like most existing setups they are likely to be small
operations.
This is another sector committed to the West End, but any return to rent
increases could see back-office space decamping to cheaper locations.
Management consultancies are the final piece in the jigsaw, covering a wide
variety of services. But despite rapid growth in the 1980s, they make up
only around 1 per cent of West End space. While demand will grow from both
larger agencies and boutique offices, the scale is unlikely to be
significant.
Government therefore appears to have a key role in the future of the West
End. While other sectors are set to remain stable or decline, Whitehall's
appetite for space should keep growing.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (6): UK institutions
take the slack - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's West End investment market is very different from that of the early
1990s, leading West End agents agree.
Foreign investors have ceased to be the driving force; pension funds are a
declining influence; bank financing through mortgages has given way to cash
purchases; but, paradoxically, some long term institutional funders are
happy for developers to blow the dust off long-stalled schemes.
Most important of all, UK institutions are back, keen not to miss the rental
growth they now believe is coming.
Foreign investment peaked in 1990. 'The light went on when the UK left the
ERM,' says Stephen Hubbard of Richard Ellis. In that year foreigners were
the market, accounting for 90 per cent of all activity. High yields, which
moved in line with interest rates, created a bond-style market in property
with which foreigners were familiar. UK institutions, by contrast, were
dismayed at the absence of growth potential.
Foreign buyers could not continue to dominate such a big market for long, of
course. By 1992, their influence had dropped back to 80 per cent. Last year,
as the market began to recover its nerve, the foreign figure was down to 64
per cent and in the first half of this year had fallen back to perhaps 40
per cent.
Middle Eastern investors continue to remain interested; they have been a
permanent feature of the market for many years, as have the Dutch pension
funds. The Germans, however, appear to be digesting the West End properties
they snapped up so enthusiastically at the start of the decade. As for the
promised influx of US money, it remains a case of 'Will they, won't they?'
Far Eastern investors are more reliable; Jones Lang Wootton expects them to
account for as much as Pounds 200m of the Pounds 1bn likely to be spent in
the West End this year. Far Eastern investors, for instance, are thought to
have paid around Pounds 30m for Trevelyan House, though that was perhaps
atypically large.
The investment market as a whole went very quiet over the summer. 'Not a lot
happened in August,' Mr Hubbard noted, while JLW was predicting little more
than Pounds 100m of new deals would be sewn up in the third quarter.
In early September fourth quarter prospects were beginning to look more
active, especially for deals around or under Pounds 10m. But will the
picture change again if investors perceive interest rates to be on the rise
once more?
Before the Chancellor raised interest rates in mid month, Richard Ellis's Mr
Hubbard was confident that 'the ingredients are there for rental growth'.
His counterpart at rival JLW, John Stephen, was even prepared to go public
with a prediction that 'rents will go well over Pounds 50 per square foot
during 1995'. (The current peak is thought to be the Pounds 42.50 paid by JP
Morgan for the headlease on Almack House in St James's)
But both agree that the recovery so far is only patchy and investors'
confidence will only be sustained if that rental growth starts showing
through. They have had enough of promises.
Promise, however, is spurring on a number of developments. Prudential, for
instance, is showing signs of activity over its four-acre Portcullis project
in Knightsbridge which has lain fallow for some years; and Norwich Union has
woken up in Golden Square in Soho.
They and other developers are encouraged as much by the shortage of
investment grade properties in an area dominated by small, listed buildings,
as by hard evidence that rents have begun to rise.
Yields have been hardening on office property but the trend has been sharper
and hascome earlier on prime retail space. Agents Healey &amp; Baker report
yields of between 4.5 and 5 per cent in Oxford Street west of Oxford Circus
and as low as 6 per cent even east of Marks &amp; Spencer's Pantheon site beyond
which tenant quality falls off dramatically.
H &amp; B's Tim Sketchley even predicts that the north side of Oxford Street
East will show the greatest improvement in both yields and rents.
Part of the reason lies in the historic concentration of properties in this
stretch into just a few long-term hands such as Grand Metropolitan, London &amp;
Manchester and Standard Life. But a new factor is the imminent redevelopment
of the Virgin Megastore for Pounds 90m.
Once Virgin and Grand Met agreed the details, Grand Met put the property on
the market as a completed and fully let development. Contracts should be
exchanged very shortly at a price expected to reflect the rejuvenation the
rebuilding will create.
Longer term, the quality of the far east end of Oxford Street will also
improve when London Underground completes the upgrading of the Charing Cross
Road entrance to Tottenham Court Road station. Oxford Street has always been
a cyclical market, dependent on tourism as well as domestic consumer cycles.
Today's top rents - Pounds 240 per square foot Zone A, west of the Circus -
are just the same as they were in 1979 and a long way from the early 1980s
peak of Pounds 350.
But Mr Sketchley confirms that they are in a steep upward phase at present.
On those grounds - and with the boost from the Megastore and Underground
improvement - he is confident that rents of Pounds 100 to Pounds 140 in the
eastern stretch will soon be historic and deals will produce benchmark
yields.
The buyers prepared to pay such prices will most likely be British (no
offence to Irish Life which recently acquired a site just west of the
Pantheon at a price reflecting a 5 per cent yield). As with offices, foreign
investors are now taking more of a back seat in the retail investment
market.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (5): Bugs Bunny and
the IRA - Complex factors refresh the retail sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unlikely alliance between a lunatic rabbit, several designer labels,
Northern Ireland's peacemakers and a gang of roadworkers is dragging
Britain's largest shopping centre out of deep gloom.
In the furore about the impact of out-of-town shopping on city centres,
problems faced by London's West End have been pushed to the sidelines.
That, perhaps, is just as well, as the crisis is now fading. Rents have
bounced back to near-boom levels and empty spaces filled as retailers no
longer scramble to escape crippling overheads.
The problems - as in much of the property market - arose from the Age of
Excess. Retailers measure occupation costs according to the front 30ft of
their premises. Rents during the 1980s for this 'zone A' space soared to
Pounds 350 a sq ft in Oxford Street and Pounds 175 in Regent Street.
Then came the crash and a flurry of liquidations. Landlords were forced to
repossess and try reletting at market levels, says Chris Austin of Hillier
Parker. By 1992, rents were down to Pounds 250 and Pounds 150 respectively.
Knightsbridge saw an even more spectacular boom and crash, with Sloane
Street racing from Pounds 55 in 1981 to a Pounds 400 by 1989 as it assumed
the mantle of a fashion centre. 'This was never sustainable,' says John
Buckingham of Jones Lang Wootton. Values almost halved in the slump,
although Brompton Road is probably still the most expensive West End
location.
Then the strange alliance raced to the rescue. Bugs Bunny is setting up shop
in the new Warner Bros store on Regent Street, part of a stream of flagship
lettings to speciality retailers. One site is being let for more than Pounds
175 - breaking the 1989 rent record, says Mr Austin. This is partly due to a
recovering economy but also because of aggressive management by the Crown
Estate, which owns the street.
Several million pounds have gone into improving the pavements and lighting.
A careful policy of tenant selection has also begun to dispel the boredom of
'dead' frontages from airline and similar premises.
Only a handful of units remain empty and the transformation has impacted on
investment. Hamleys is understood to have sold its lease for around Pounds
18.5m to a Dutch fund, showing a yield of less than 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile,
Gucci has helped turn Bond Street back into an international attraction
after moving to new premises, says Mr Buckingham.
Versace confirmed the revival by taking the old Midland Bank premises and
Fahey has slotted between Asprey and Hermes, paying Meteor Properties around
Pounds 600,000 a year for the former Air France space. Donna Karen New York
is the latest fashion name to move in, taking the old Gucci store, now
transformed by the new Japanese owner. Development is also happening,
despite the fact that rents are static at around Pounds 200 a sq ft.
CIS is renovating its section of the street after years of inaction and
London &amp; Regional has paid Pounds 8.75m for possible redevelopment of the
former Refuge Assurance holding. Scottish Widows also has a scheme for the
Oxford Street end, all of which will enliven an image blighted by empty
windows.
Another long-awaited transformation is happening in Oxford Street, where
Westminster Council road gangs are widening pavements and generally giving
one of the world's most famous shopping streets an appearance it deserves.
If the Ulster ceasefire holds, this could coincide with a revival in trade
from tourists put off by bomb fears.
Rent growth normally lags a year or two behind tourism figures, but this
time any increase would be icing on a cake already baked by rising domestic
demand. Tesco has seen its new Metro store turn into a roaring success and
probably wishes it could have also taken the neighbouring unit. This is said
to be the only vacant prime pitch west of Oxford Circus but is already
reserved.
The likely rent of more than Pounds 270 a sq ft shows how Oxford Street
shopping has climbed back off the floor. There are still businesses who
would like to escape rent levels set at the peak of the boom but they, too,
face some relief. Next April new business rates come into force, and bills
could drop 15 per cent in Oxford Street and as much as 40 per cent in Sloane
Street. Investors are also betting on growth. Despite Burford's highly
conservative spending strategy, it beat off several other potential buyers
by paying Pounds 94m for the Trocadero on Piccadilly Circus, perhaps the
most popular tourist shopping and entertainment pitch in London.
With long-term finance now in place, chairman Nigel Wray might be forgiven
for sitting back and enjoying the 9 per cent return. But he has bold plans
to increase the current estimate of 14m visitors a year, with bold plans for
the 120,000 sq ft of remaining space. The impact should ripple out to boost
values in the surrounding shopping.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (4): Long march of
the planners - Rival schemes to develop Paddington's Victorian backwaters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve years on and the ambitious plan to regenerate the seedy West End
fringe at Paddington is still just a blueprint. Delays, controversy and
changes in ideology have dogged the project ever since Westminster City
Council first designated Paddington in 1982 as a preferred location for
large scale office development. And there is still more to come.
In the past 12 months two giant commercial schemes intended to provide 3m sq
ft of offices plus shops, cafes, small craft units and some 450 flats have
become entrapped in the backlash of Westminster City Council's 'homes for
votes' scandal.
Paddington Station, a Grade I listed building, has been put on the market as
one of the dozen or so stations for which Railtrack is required to find new
owners under rail privatisation. Crossrail, the new Underground link between
West and East London through Paddington, has either been scrapped or sent
back to the drawing board. St Mary's Hospital's rebuilding plans are on ice
while it waits to learn its fate in the reorganisation of central London
hospital services.
Only one of the private sector schemes - the entirely self-contained and
independent extension of the Metropole Hotel on Edgware Road - is actually
under way. Meanwhile, the public sector must content itself with progress on
the London Heathrow Express; the rather more important Crossrail project was
on, then off and, if it may be on again, it won't be just yet.
Whatever their cause, the delays are acutely frustrating to planners,
property developers and local residents who are united - if only in the
general principle - in the need to eliminate the present tattiness. However,
as 1994 moves into its final quarter, there is reason to hope that not all
the Paddington plans may be irreparably stalled.
Imperceptibly, perhaps, the two commercial schemes are starting to move
ahead. Bishopsbridge, the joint venture between NFC and Regalian to develop
the 13.5-acre Paddington Goods Yard north of the station, claims to be more
advanced than its nearby rival, the Trafalgar House/ British Waterways
redevelopment round Paddington Basin at the head of the Grand Union Canal.
That is debatable.
Bishopsbridge was 'launched' at the end of August four months after it
received outline planning consent from Westminster Council. But the 'launch'
amounted to no more than inviting a few more interested parties to visit the
showroom in Mayfair which had been open for the past two years.
Moreover, as NFC and Regalian already know to their cost, the gulf between
outline and detailed permission can be difficult to bridge. A public inquiry
after an earlier outline had been approved in 1989 meant a major rethink of
the original scheme. The current artist's perspective and perspex model
cannot be relied on as an accurate guide to the final appearance of the
buildings.
In that respect Trafalgar House may be slightly further ahead. In early
September, it was in the final two weeks of negotiations with Westminster
planners which would underpin its detailed planning application. The pretty
pictures which Trafalgar is touting may, therefore, be closer to the future
reality.
But both have a long way to go before being set in stone. Trafalgar has not
yet assembled its entire site; some owners remain to be bought out.
Grainhurst (the vehicle for the Bishopsbridge scheme) has a vacant, but
difficult, gully of a site to tie in with Paddington Station and the
proposed new Underground station it must pay for as a condition of its
planning permission.
Meanwhile, both developers must bite their knuckles while they await the
verdict of two independent investigations into whether the consents they
have received had 'contaminated motives'. The District Auditor and a retired
former County Planning Officer for Shropshire are both searching to see
whether the council's housing policy has been based on sound planning
principles or 'contaminated', like the designated house sale programme, by
gerrymandering.
Property professionals with no axe to grind are confident that the plans
will win a clean bill of health. They point out that Westminster's
insistence on mixed use developments in the Paddington area has a consistent
history which relates to a transport policy of minimising traffic increases.
Even if that is so, the two schemes then face their biggest gamble: the
extent of future demand for office space in Paddington. With Bishopsbridge
designed to provide 1.4m sq ft of offices and Paddington Basin more than
1.5m, the two schemes combined will amount to the largest West End
development since the Second World War. And they are in an area which has
always rebuffed developers' ambitions to push the West End westwards.
Some think that St Mary's plans for a 950,000 sq ft terrace of offices on
its western boundary (which would pay for new hospital buildings to the
east) were ambitious enough for such a fringe area.
Grainhurst cites the example of Broadgate which sceptics were adamant could
not breach the City's northern boundary. Its executives also draw
encouragement from research the company commissioned from the City
University Business School. That shows that the top 10 agents in the West
End agree that a shortage of top specification space is imminent, however
long the hangover of substandard space remains.
According to the consensus, less than one year's supply of prime space
remains available and no new building over 100,000 sq ft. Given that West
End stock has traditionally been in small buildings and the council wants to
push large space users to the Paddington Special Policy Area, this must be
cause for optimism. However, it has yet to translate into firm good news.
Neither Trafalgar nor Grainhurst are close to a pre-letting which would
persuade them to push ahead to the construction stage.
No one doubts the area's main commercial attraction; its already excellent
westwards connections will be further enhanced by the Heathrow Express
Railway. With construction well under way the railway looks likely to meet
its most recent completion target - December 1997.
A journey time of just 17 minutes to Heathrow should impress international
companies which do not need a prime Mayfair location but seek a relatively
central position. But will enough of them want to locate in a deep dip
beneath the Westway (Bishopsbridge) or in Trafalgar's community-oriented
enclave on the edge of the Edgware Road?

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (2): Westminster
lifts the lid - Christine Moir reflects on where politics ends and planning
begins
</HEADLINE>

Lady Porter now spends a lot of time abroad and the notorious Designated
Homes sales programme may have abruptly halted. But the scandal of how the
Tory Westminster Council strove to buy votes by turning the disaffected into
home owners on the cheap still rumbles on.
The Unitary Development Plan for the city has now been re-examined by the
District Auditor and by Mike Laws, a retired County Planning Officer for
Shropshire, to see if the entire housing policy has been flawed by what are
described as 'contaminated motives' ie gerrymandering. Their reports are
expected shortly.
Meanwhile, it has recently emerged that Porter's administration may have had
a fine sense of self preservation in trying to buy votes. Boundary changes
may soon threaten the Tories' age-old hegemony over Westminster, turning the
district into a potential marginal.
But it would be wrong to dismiss Westminster's housing policy out of hand.
Long before Porter all Westminster's local governors laid special emphasis
on maintaining a strong residential element in every part of the city. The
most recent requirement - that developments involving increased office space
must provide matching amounts of self-contained residential units - is
compatible with the post-war history of planning in Westminster.
Westminster's approach to planning has always been very different from the
City's. The latter welcomes offices so long as they meet design criteria.
Some retail provision is the only extra the developer need consider.
Westminster has never seen itself primarily as an office location. Its
planning priority is urban renewal and it believes that this means mixed
uses even in its core area, the so-called Central Activity Zone.
The concept goes back to the late 1950s when the then council insisted that
Temporary Office Use permits were just that - temporary. Companies had been
permitted to take over houses in Mayfair as wartime headquarters, but the
council insisted that they revert back to housing when the TOUs expired,
mostly by the late 1980s.
In Covent Garden and Soho, the local authority became even more insistent
that housing should be an integral part of the mix. The concept has won
international praise as a benchmark for urban regeneration.
For close on 50 years, therefore, the presumption has always been that all
new developments would be a mix of housing, shops, offices and even
workshops. Moreover, this applies in every sub-district, including one, like
Paddington, designated a Special Policy Area and a preferred location for
large-scale offices. What is new in the current Unitary Development Plan is
the explicit commitment to owner-occupation and the resistance to converting
houses into flats in desirable areas such as Belgravia, Pimlico,
Knightsbridge and Bayswater.
According to Mike Straw of Richard Ellis's planning department, one question
the examiners will be asking is whether this council is as fully committed
to affordable housing as to residences for Conservative voters.
Developers have a separate objection to the current formulation of the
housing policy: its inflexibility. Not all office developments are suitable
for incorporating self-contained flats with a separate entrance; the site,
the location, the immediate outlook may not recommend themselves to
residential occupation. They believe the council should lay down the
residential requirement for a neighbourhood and leave them to parcel that in
the most convenient way.
History suggests they may eventually be heard. In the 1960s, Camden Council
had a similar plan which forced Harry Hyams to provide a handful of flats in
the penthouse of Centrepoint, his controversial office tower at the junction
of Charing Cross Road and Oxford Street. The requirement made a mockery of
Camden's housing policy, which was quietly modified.
Controversy - but without the overtones of impropriety - also surrounds
another aspect of planning for the West End: transport policy. It is a
fraught issue everywhere, as central and local government are each
responsible for different aspects of it.
In central London, matters were made worse by the abolition of the GLC which
left no one body with an overview of the region's needs. One example
suffices: the Heathrow Express Railway, a joint venture between British Rail
and the British Airports Authority, went back and forth to central
government during its planning phase with no one to judge whether it was
good for London.
Instead, different local authorities bickered among themselves: while
districts near the airport wanted traffic taken off their roads, Westminster
opposed it on the grounds that it would suck in traffic to the proposed
terminal at Paddington.
Westminster lost. HER is going ahead. Westminster is reduced to trying to
limit the inevitable increase in traffic in Paddington by forcing the two
giant commercial developments which will feed on the express to reduce the
car parking they provide. The transport programme which would have had a
really positive effect in driving West End traffic off the roads - CrossRail
 -was in central government's gift and now lies gathering dust.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (3): Confidence
stirs - New Development Options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development proposals are being dusted off as land owners and investors
consider whether the time is right to resurrect plans for some of the
biggest office projects undertaken in the capital, writes Andrew Taylor.
Two of the biggest projects are in Paddington, designated by Westminster
City Council in 1982 for large scale office development and where rival
development groups are proposing to develop up to 3m sq ft of new office
space.
Funding institutions, however, remain very nervous after their experiences
during the early 1990s when rents and capital values fell sharply. Major
schemes, therefore, are unlikely to proceed unless they are pre-let.
Planning hurdles also may have still to be overcome as developers seek to
turn outline planning approval into detailed consents for their proposals.
Some of these construction projects have been around for many years and it
could be some time before concrete starts to be poured.
Nonetheless the outlook for development has begun to brighten. The balance
between supply and demand, at least for new properties, is again favouring
the developer.
This week, for example, Mr Elliott Bernerd's Chelsfield group announced
plans to start work on 120,000 sq ft of office space at Wool House, St
James's after selling a 50 per cent stake in the project to AMP Asset
management for Pounds 20.5m.
City University Business School, which has studied the findings of 10 of the
largest commercial agents and chartered surveyors in the capital says:
'There remains significantly less than one year's supply of new
accommodation available and, for large occupiers seeking in excess of
100,000 sq ft, there are no new buildings currently available.'
As a result, rents for modern high quality accommodation are beginning to
rise as the property market comes out of recession.
The shortage of new space, described by City University as 'acute', compares
with a general oversupply of empty secondary space, much of it poor quality,
of 8m sq ft. The take-up by tenants is expected to be about about 3.5m sq ft
this year, according to agents Jones Lang Wootton, indicating that there is
at least two years supply of ready built accommodation. The extent of this
over supply will prevent rent from rising too quickly.
Westminster council's long standing policy of maintaining a strong
residential community alongside office and retail schemes traditionally has
restricted the pace of commercial development. More recently it has required
developments involving increased office space to provide equivalent
residential space.
The council's housing policies are now being investigated by the District
Auditor and a retired former County Planning Officer for Shropshire
following the votes for homes scandal operated under Westminster's right to
buy scheme.
The inquiry, however, is not expected to undermine the general thrust of the
council's housing policy or threaten outline planning permissions granted
for some of the large proposed schemes in Paddington where Westminster is
seeking to direct commercial development under its urban renewal policies.
It has been aided by the start of construction of the Pounds 300m Heathrow
to Paddington rail link designed to provide fast direct rail access to the
airport as well as coping with increased passenger numbers if the proposed
fifth terminal at Heathrow goes ahead.
Beneficiaries could be two of the largest schemes to be undertaken in
central London since the massive Broadgate and Ludgate office developments
undertaken by the Stanhope/Rosehaugh joint venture. Rosehaugh subsequently
went into receivership while Stanhope is still wrestling with its large
borrowings.
The main Paddington schemes are:
Bishopsbridge: a 1.4m sq ft office development with retail and residential
elements proposed by Grainhurst, a consortium representing Regalian property
development group and the National Freight Consortium. The site is the the
former Bishops Bridge railway goods yard.
Paddington Basin: a joint development proposed by Trafalgar House, the UK
construction, property, shippings and hotels group, and British Waterways.
The scheme is to provide up to 1.5m sq ft of offices as well as retail and
residential accommodation.
Both schemes seem likely to require a significant amount of pre-lets before
financing institutions will agree to fund construction. Funds will also need
to be convinced that there is the prospect for sufficient rental growth to
justify such large investments.
Prospective tenants, given the oversupply in the West End may be prepared to
look elsewhere rather than bid up rents, notwithstanding the shortage of new
space. This initially may lead to a growth in refurbishment rather than new
development.
Companies are not so long out of recession that they will be prepared to
accept a sharp rise in property costs. There is plenty of choice of empty
buildings if prospective tenants look further afield.
The City of London and the capital's former docklands areas may not have the
glamour of a Mayfair or St James's address but might be regarded as
preferable to a Paddington address if rents start to appear uncompetitive.
The Paddington/Heathrow link promising a 17 minute journey from central
London to Europe's biggest airport is an important attraction but may not be
enough on its own. The construction of CrossRail, a Pounds 2bn rail project
link east and west London, blocked earlier this year by MPs, would have been
an even bigger attraction.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Property: Facts and forecasts - The paucity of credible
market analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a market should be judged by the quality of its analysis, property is
still in the dark ages. This complaint is most often heard from fund
managers, especially those who cut their teeth in equities or bonds. But the
point is not lost on property professionals themselves.
Mr Peter Evans, head of research at surveyors DTZ Debenham Thorpe, said: 'In
terms of available data, the property market is like a third world country.'
The culture of the industry is partly to blame. Agents have traditionally
sold themselves on the basis of what they know, rather than how they
interpret commonly-held information about transactions and market
conditions. The culture of transparency which governs the equity and bond
markets has simply passed by.
The consequences could be profound. The long-term decline in institutional
holdings of property is due, in part, to the paucity of credible market
statistics and analysis.
'We certainly have not felt as comfortable with property as with other
financial assets,' said one fund manager at a life insurance company.
'Defending investment decisions on the basis of gut feel is no longer
enough.'
It is also possible that the information gap has contributed to the extreme
cyclical nature of the property market. This is a view shared by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Earlier this year RICS published research on the links between the economy
and the property cycle. Mr Clive Lewis, then president, hailed the work as
'the best hope yet of finding a way to tame damaging boom and bust cycles'.
Sceptics point out that research did nothing to prevent the 1987 UK stock
market crash. Either way, though, investors' thirst for quality information
and analysis is a commercial opportunity.
The Investment Property Databank, set up 10 years ago, was the first to spot
the requirement for raw data. Its work laid the foundations on which the
first brave attempts at forecasting were built. Most of the big surveying
practices now offer forecasting services, while independent forecasters have
flourished over the past five years.
The property establishment sees the introduction of forecasting techniques
as step forward rather than a threat to the valuers' art.
The Mallinson report on valuation, published earlier this year, came out
broadly in favour of forecasting: 'We . . . see it as an area in which
surveyors, with the aid of other skills, can offer valuable insight to
clients. But we see (forecasting services) as distinct and believe they
should be kept very carefully distinct from the practice of valuation.'
This attitude is broadly shared by investors. 'We are inclined to use
forecasts more and more, although the jury is still out on their
performance,' said Mr David Hunter, head of property investment at Scottish
Amicable.
Forecasters see themselves as giving investors the tools to make better
decisions - closing the credibility gap between property and other financial
assets.
'Our job is to help property fund managers approach their asset allocation
committees on equal terms,' said Mr Colin Barber of forecasting consultancy
Barber White.
Yet the limits of forecasting are a matter for hot debate. Some are doubtful
about forecasters' ability to predict the market at all.
'All property market projections are based on macroeconomic forecasts which
themselves have a poor record,' said Mr Chris Brown of Manchester
consultancy Kenrick Brown. 'It is also possible that the factors which drive
the property market change over time, but not in a linear way.'
Investors are sceptical about using forecasts to guide anything other than
broad decisions on asset allocation.
Local markets react to local factors which can not be predicted,' said Mr
Hunter. 'We would never buy a shop we did not like simply because the
forecasts told us to.'
Even zealots admit that forecasting down to regional or local level is
tricky. 'As the scale becomes smaller, the task of forecasting becomes
progressively more difficult,' said Mr Bryan MacGregor, professor of land
economy at the University of Aberdeen.
Factors such as new developments, which are especially difficult to predict,
are much more important at local level. Moreover, economic data for
particular towns is simply not available. If these problems can be overcome,
though, forecasters see the biggest gains to be made at local level because
these markets are least efficient.
'The market gets less efficient the lower down you go. We should be able to
add more value at the level of a town or an individual building,' commented
Mr Andrew Baum of Real Estate Strategies, the forecasting company now linked
to fund managers Henderson Administration.
So what of attempts to use rental forecasts and discounted cash-flow
techniques to value individual buildings? Property companies increasingly
use such methods when deciding whether to make strategic investments.
Retailers such as Boots model underlying cash flows before deciding whether
to buy or lease individual shops.
Again, the Mallinson report came down in favour of greater use of discounted
cash-flow techniques by the property profession. But it envisaged such
methods being used in combination with - not in place of - traditional
valuations based on market evidence.
Some would like to go further. The collapse last year of hotels group Queens
Moat Houses caused many investors to question property valuations in company
accounts. Two firms of surveyors - Wetherall Green &amp; Smith and Jones Lang
Wootton - came up with widely divergent valuations of the company's assets.
The British Association of Hotel Accountants has since proposed a method for
valuing hotels for accounting purposes based on discounted cash flow
analysis.
This was rejected by RICS last month, on the grounds that the worth of a
property to an investor need not be the same as its open market value.
The distinction is critical. It is the difference between underlying worth
and open market value that forecasters and their clients are trying to
identify and exploit.
Whether they can do so successfully over the long term remains an open
question. But if the growth of forecasting increases understanding of what
drives the market - and helps investors feel more comfortable about holding
property in their portfolios - it will have proved its worth.

FT  23 SEP 94 / People: UD catches Finn Johnsson in its gin trap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness has ended the almost year-long search for a successor to Crispin
Davis, former managing director of United Distillers, with the surprise
choice of Finn Johnsson, chief executive of Euroc, Sweden's largest building
products group.
The decision to plump for a second MD for Guinness' spirits division who has
no experience of the drinks market came as a surprise to City analysts. The
departure of Davis - famous for the decision to reduce the strength of
Gordon's gin - after little more than a year was widely attributed to his
experience in marketing consumer goods with Procter &amp; Gamble.
It is widely believed that Davis wanted UD to compete more strongly on price
 -as competitors are doing - while Guinness chairman Tony Greener, with his
background in Dunhill, retained his faith in building premium brands.
Greener says there is no reason why the head of UD should be a drinks man,
as the company has 'plenty of people with drinks and marketing experience. I
was not specifically looking for somebody who understands the drinks
industry. I was looking for somebody with substantial international
experience, running businesses around the world in highly competitive
markets and who knew his way around the world.
'Finn Johnsson fulfils that specification. He is someone who is a good
leader and general manager of a highly competitive international business.'
Greener adds that after a Europe-wide search, Johnsson was 'clearly the best
candidate'. Analysts suspect Johnsson's lack of drinks experience means
Greener will continue, initially at least, to have a dominant influence on
UD's strategy.
But Johnsson's achievements at Euroc, which he joined as chief executive in
1990, suggest he is not a soft touch. He has gained respect in Sweden for
turning the company round and restoring it to profit, in spite of a
recession in building products and cement.
Before Euroc, he spent 14 years running international consumer products
companies with Swedish Match, subsequently Stora. He ran companies whose
business interests were mainly outside Scandinavia, and gained management
experience in the US, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Johnsson says he is excited at returning to branded consumer goods where he
spent so much of his career. But he has to wait a few months yet. The
agreement with Euroc is that he will not take up his new post until
February. (See Observer)

FT  23 SEP 94 / People: Head of Private Finance Unit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has a new mastermind for its efforts to attract private capital
into the provision of public services. Richard Saunders has taken over as
head of the private finance unit from Kingsley Jones who joins the team
working on the department's fundamental expenditure review.
Saunders, 42, has spent the past two years in Washington, where he was
economic counsellor at the British embassy. His work there has included
liaison with the administration and Congress on economic issues, banking and
tax.
Before that, he was Treasury press secretary between 1990 and 1992, seeing
Norman Lamont through the deepening recession and the negotiations over
European Monetary Union leading up to the Maastricht treaty.
A graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, Saunders joined the civil service
in 1974, initially with the old Civil Service Department. When it was
abolished in 1981, he moved to the Treasury, where his posts have included a
spell as private secretary to the permanent secretary, Sir Peter Middleton.
He worked on the 1986 building societies reform and covered health in the
public expenditure division during the government's national health service
reforms.
Saunders' new role involves liaising with Sir Alistair Morton's Private
Finance Panel and its full-time team in identifying projects where private
finance could play a part. His job will be to lift any obstacles blocking
such projects, either in the Treasury or elsewhere in Whitehall.

David Kappler, 47, was appointed group finance director designate of Cadbury
Schweppes yesterday, replacing David Jink who retires in March next year
after 32 years' service.
Kappler joined Cadbury in 1965 as a trainee accountant. After qualifying in
1969, he completed various assignments before becoming factory accountant at
the Bournville plant. Promoted for his accountancy acumen, he was also known
for his rugby playing talents and captained the Bournville rugby team.
In 1977 he left to become financial director for the cleaning products group
Jeyes, which was then owned by Cadbury Schweppes, leaving seven years late
to join Trebor, the sugar confectionery company, where he became finance
director.
In 1989 Kappler was one of the driving forces behind the negotiations
leading to Cadbury's purchase of Trebor and was appointed finance director
of the Cadbury Group after the acquisition. He joins the Cadbury Schweppes'
board in January 1995.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Management: Matter of years, not weeks - Employers have
welcomed annualised hours because of the flexibility they allow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One issue which might have been on the table at this week's intensive
bargaining between Railtrack and the RMT transport union - but isn't - is
the introduction of annualised hours for signal workers.
After considerable debate, Railtrack management decided that such a proposal
 -which would define the amount of working time on the basis of work over 12
months, not each working week - is a step too far for the moment.
'There is a lack of understanding, many staff have difficulty grasping the
concept,' admits Paul Radley, Railtrack's employee relations manager.
The long-term aim of the state-owned company which runs the UK's rail
infrastructure is nevertheless clear: 'It would give us enormous flexibility
in matching employees' hours to service needs, eliminate excessive premium
payments for overtime working and give us greater freedom in changing daily
working time patterns,' explains Radley.
His wish reflects a growing conviction among managers across British
manufacturing and services that annualised hours are a more effective and
profitable way of organising an employee's scheduled working time than the
traditional weekly approach.
As Gregor Gall from Stirling University's management school explains: 'In
its simplest form annualised hours is based on the number of working weeks
in the year multiplied by the number of working hours per week minus
holidays.' In most schemes, he points out, there are a number of rostered
hours and unrostered hours that are banked to allow maximum flexibility.
The Department of Employment recently estimated that around 2m employees, 9
per cent of the UK workforce, are now covered by annualised hours. The
largest proportion (15.8 per cent) are to be found in professional
occupations with a high number in teaching. They are followed by plant and
machine operatives (10.3 per cent) and craft and related occupations (9.0
per cent). The lowest incidence of annualised hours is among managers and
administrators (6.6 per cent).
Companies which have introduced annualised hours to cover at least some of
their employees in recent years include BP Chemicals (at its Grangemouth
plant in 1993); British Airways; Findus Foods in Newcastle; Fisons
Pharmaceuticals; Tesco Distribution; Valor Heating; Matsushita Electric,
Hotpoint, Whitbread Beer, Scottish Power, Thames Water, Blue Circle
Industries; Manchester Airport; and a number of national health trusts.
Companies operating annualised hours seem well satisfied by its results.
Half the companies surveyed by the independent group Incomes Data Services
last year, for example, welcomed the 'flexibility' such schemes provide.
Matching work to seasonal patterns of demand, reduced labour costs through
elimination of overtime and lower absenteeism are among the advantages
cited.
Earlier this year British Coal introduced annualised hours to cover just
over 9,000 of its employees as part of a package designed to increase
flexible working in the pits. Under its plan there is no actual change in
the number of hours worked every year. Colliery managers decide the length
and starting time of shifts 'in accordance with the business needs' of each
pit while attendance patterns are settled after consultation with the
unions.
Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director, argues the new
system allows managers and workers 'the opportunity of working fewer shifts
and to make more use of leisure time'.
Imperial Chemical Industries brought in annualised hours as part of its 1991
staff agreement with the trade unions and an estimated 80 per cent of its
9,000 manual workers now have their working time structured in that way. 'We
have found it an efficient and cost-effective way of organising our
workers,' says Malcolm James, ICI's industrial relations manager.
'Absenteeism has been halved since the arrival of annualised hours, while
the savings made from abolishing overtime have been used to finance other
changes in the company.'
The trend, meanwhile, is not confined to manufacturing. Annualised hours
contracts have been introduced at television companies such as ITN,
Yorkshire and HTV. The Bristol and West Building Society has had a scheme
for the past three years for its staff. A growing number of companies are
using annualised hours as part of a wider restructuring exercise. Its
introduction is often combined with team-working, performance-related pay
and the harmonising of terms and conditions of employment between manual
workers and white-collar staff.
So far the arrival of annualised hours has not aroused much resistance from
employees, many of whom can see advantages. As Railtrack's Radley points out
it ensures 'much greater predictability of earnings' as it removes the
uncertain fluctuations suffered by those paid on a weekly hours basis.
The use of annualised hours is more common in mainland Europe, particularly
in Germany and France where it began to grow in the late 1970s. The concept
developed in the UK in the mid-1980s.
Gall argues that schemes aimed at smoothing peaks and troughs in demand
carry drawbacks for employees. 'Annualised hours can lead to loss in
earnings, restrictions on the choice of when to take holidays, reduced
manning levels and inflexible shift rotas,' he claims. Annualised hours,
however, are here to stay. The development, which reflects the wider social
revolution at work, is arguably the most significant in working time since
the arrival of the five-day working week after the second world war.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Management: Learning from inner experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a truism, but one which managers forget all too easily, that companies
have a lot in common with most species in the natural world. In order to
survive, they must adapt to changes in the environment around them.
The analogy is limited in that companies have an ability, denied to all but
a few species, to change their environment. Witness the impact of Apple,
Intel and Microsoft on the computer industry, or Marks &amp; Spencer, Ikea and
Wal-Mart on retailing.
In order to adapt, a company needs to know what to change, and how. Hence
the concept of 'learning organisations' - a mantra whose popularity is
matched only by the confusion that besets most companies over how to put it
into practice.
Since most companies tend to be inward-looking, they are forever - and
rightly - being advised to improve their learning from outside. Hence the
current emphasis on benchmarking, on closer contact with customers and
suppliers, and on more effective ways to connect technology with emerging
consumer patterns and behaviour.
But the drive for better external learning is blinding companies to one of
the most valuable sources of insight and added knowledge: their own
experience. Few organisations make a serious attempt to analyse the lessons
of their own recent successes and failures.
Powerful and detailed evidence of how this sort of learning can best be
achieved, from the projects by which a company develops new products and
processes, has been amassed in a study carried out by a team of US
academics.
Drawn from Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Purdue University, the researchers worked closely with top executives in
five leading US companies: Chaparral Steel, Digital Equipment, Eastman
Kodak, Hewlett-Packard and the Ford Motor Company, examining 20 development
projects. The companies succeeded in learning extensively from some of them,
but failed dismally in others.
In a lengthy, three-article report on the project in the latest Harvard
Business Review* the academics argue that managers seldom realise that the
learning to be gained from a development project is often more important to
the company than the new product or process itself. By selecting projects
carefully, a company can use them to develop new skills, knowledge and
systems.
The reason why development projects are such a good source of learning is
that they are, in a sense, a microcosm of the whole organisation, the
academics argue. Since project teams are usually made up of people from many
parts of the company, development projects test the strengths and weaknesses
of its systems, structures and values.
The academics exemplify this by using contrasting examples from Ford in the
late 1980s: the development of the compressor for an air conditioner from
which all sorts of organisational lessons were learned and applied on other
projects; and the almost simultaneous development in a different part of the
company of the 1989 Thunderbird, where potential lessons were neither
planned for nor learned.
Probably the most successful learner in the study was Chaparral Steel. A
mini mill specialist founded 20 years ago which has become one of the
largest US steelmakers, it is best known for its 1980s innovations in
horizontal casting techniques.
At Chaparral, virtually everyone is involved continually in development or
improvement projects. People work in a variety of functions. They may lead
one team and then be members of another. But where Chaparral stands out from
the other companies in the study is in the systematic way it selects
projects and then applies learning from one project to another.
Chaparral does several things that serve as a model for every company, say
the academics. It requires every project to advance the company's
capabilities, and plans combinations of them in a logical flow to ensure
that they do so. After each project has been completed, Chaparral analyses
it to find out what it achieved or failed to, and why.
Auditing of this kind is surprisingly rare, as the academics point out. Only
a handful of companies have any kind of auditing system. Moreover, audits
tend to be done merely to ensure that a project complies with formal
procedures, rather than to analyse its positive and negative aspects so that
the company can learn.
Of the 20 projects in the study, few were audited systematically. The work
was sometimes done by reviewers reluctant to highlight problems for fear of
embarrassing people and seeming unfair. As a result, a string of projects in
the same company tended to suffer from the same mistakes.
In their keenness to transform the way managers think of development
projects, the academics do not tackle in sufficient detail the equally
challenging question of how to transfer learning not just from project to
project, but also from individual business units to the whole organisation.
They also fail to warn against one of the pitfalls of their message; that,
in a belated rush to understand the factors that determine the success or
failure of individual projects, managers may forget that wider
organisational influences - including strategic vision, shared values and
reward systems - have an equally important impact on learning.
But the vast majority of companies have no need to worry about this problem
as yet. They have not even started delving into the goldmine of their
project experience.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Fiat chief calls for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector
industrial group, called in London yesterday for the reform of the Italian
public sector and welfare state.
Italy's public-sector debt was an obstacle to investment and economic
recovery, Mr Agnelli said at a ceremony to announce the UK's 1994 Venturer
of the Year award.
Italy's public-sector deficit has risen to more than 10 per cent of GDP and
the stock of debt is more than 120 per cent of GDP, considerably higher than
in the rest of Europe.
Mr Agnelli said Italy's economy was moving in the right direction, with
inflation falling, the balance of trade positive and competitiveness
improving but the situation in the Italian public sector and welfare state
was 'particularly grave'.
The Venturer of the Year award, sponsored by Cartier, the jewellers, The
Financial Times and the British Venture Capital Association, was won by Mr
Stephen Noar, a 47-year old dentist who eight years ago formed Denplan, a
company which provides private dental healthcare programmes.
He sold the company last year for Pounds 42m to Private Patients Plan, the
medical insurer.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Car output shows 6% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK car production was 70,633 last month, 6 per cent higher than the figure
of 66,653 in the same month last year, confirming the rising trend of output
in the past three months.
In the first eight months of this year car production has risen by 2.3 per
cent to 949,450 - helped by higher output for export markets.
UK car production was 'becalmed' at about 1.375m a year between September
1993 and May 1994, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, with lower output for export offset by higher production for the
domestic market.
Yet in recent months output for export markets has been growing consistently
 -by 4.3 per cent year-on-year in the first eight months to 362,309 and by 7
per cent in August to 28,524.
Export growth has come from Rover - in particular its Land Rover
four-wheel-drive vehicle division - Jaguar, Honda and Toyota. This helped to
offset declines at Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot and a sharp fall in production
at Nissan.
The SMMT has forecast significant growth in production in the second half of
the year, in particular in response to a demand recovery in continental
European new-car markets.
Production of commercial vehicles in August more than doubled to 12,040 from
5,506 in the corresponding month a year ago, when output was very depressed
with a decline of 56 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Peugeot invests Pounds 30m in Ryton plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot Talbot is to spend around Pounds 30m to start production of a saloon
version of the Peugeot 306 hatchback early next year at its Ryton plant near
Coventry.
The company said yesterday that the plant's output was to be increased from
1,820 cars a week to 2,000 cars a week from January creating 'several
hundred' new jobs among Peugeot Talbot's 70 component suppliers. The
government is providing Pounds 1.2m in grants for the expansion.
Peugeot Talbot, UK production and distribution subsidiary of the French
vehicles group, expects the additional cars to lift Ryton's total output
from 73,000 this year to approaching 90,000 in 1995 and return the company
to profitability. Last year Peugeot Talbot made its first loss since the
late 1980s - Pounds 8.7m before tax.
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, Peugeot Talbot deputy chairman, said there was little
early prospect of more jobs at the Ryton plant itself, which employs 3,000
people. This is because it has maintained double-shift working - with
downtime and temporary lay-offs - in spite of the slump in UK and
continental European markets which caused Ryton's output to fall from a peak
116,000 units in 1990.
By keeping the workforce intact, Ryton retains its capacity to make 120,000
cars a year.
Even with the saloon 306, Ryton is unlikely to be utilising its full
capacity unless export demand for both 306 models expands considerably.
Mr Whalen said there were no plans to reintroduce the larger 405 saloon - or
its successor to be launched in France next year - to Ryton's assembly lines
alongside the 306 models. The 405, a big success in the UK fleet market,
accounted for most of Ryton's production until the Continental market slump
led Peugeot to confine 405 output to France at the end of 1992.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Bristol freight link to tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outline planning consent has been given for a private rail terminal at
Avonmouth, near Bristol, which will provide the west of England with direct
freight services to the Channel tunnel.
The terminal, costing about Pounds 50m in its first phase, will be built on
107 acres of land owned by Western Properties, part of RTZ, the mining
group.
The development is likely to be in the form of a joint venture and the
terminal will be operated by Bristol Port Company, which runs the nearby
docks.
West of England companies have been concerned at the lack of direct freight
services to the Channel tunnel. Their nearest intermodal terminal - one able
to handle freight arriving by road or rail - for European services would
otherwise be at Cardiff. Railtrack said yesterday: 'With this terminal
Bristol will become the west country's freight centre for the Channel
tunnel.'
RTZ ceased industrial operations at Avonmouth several years ago, but still
owns 400 acres there. Part of the land has been contaminated since munitions
work during the first world war.
The terminal will be close to the M5 motorway and the second Severn
crossing, due to open in early 1996. It will connect with the railway line
between Avonmouth and Bristol Parkway, on which Railtrack has just completed
a Pounds 50m programme of improvements.
Bristol Port Company said the terminal would have 500,000 sq ft of storage
and industrial space. It hoped some freight operations could start next
year.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Ashdown hints at pact with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday wound up the most fractious Liberal Democrat
conference since 1989 by signalling his hopes that party would provide the
reforming edge in a post-election partnership with Mr Tony Blair's Labour
party.
In a coded message to Mr Blair Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats had
'enough confidence in our own strength to make common cause with others to
achieve the best for the future'.
He told the final session of the conference that the main question facing
the party was what sort of government it wanted after the next general
election. The answer was one in which the Liberal Democrats provided key
policies.
His attempts to keep the idea of co-operation alive did not, however,
disguise the gloomy assessment of senior party figures that this week's
gathering has been the worst since the conference which followed the
break-up of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance five years ago.
To a polite if far from ecstatic reception from party activists, Mr Ashdown
said the party's 'historic role' was to act as the catalyst for
constitutional change in Britain. That meant the dismantling of the
'centralised state' and the entrenchment of a pluralistic political culture
through a proportional voting system.
The implicit offer to Labour of a longer-term alliance to deprive the
Conservatives of a fifth term in office in return for PR was accompanied by
a call for a cross-party approach to the National Health Service to test
Labour's intentions.
But faced by a conference which saw his leadership defied in two
embarrassing votes over social and economic policy, and which exposed clear
divisions over political strategy, Mr Ashdown ducked an explicit offer of an
anti-Tory pact.
Mr Ashdown warned delegates - after their decisions this week to back the
decriminalisation of cannabis and vote in favour of a minimum wage - that in
the run up to a general election the party must focus on the concerns of
voters rather than on peripheral internal debates.
But to avoid another backlash from anti-Labour party activists, Mr Ashdown
chose deliberately not to spell out any details of his strategy to secure
closer co-operation between the two parties.
Instead he set a series of benchmarks against which he insisted Mr Blair's
intentions would be judged. Warning that a Conservative victory would
prolong the 'disaster' of one-party rule, Mr Ashdown said it would be
equally damaging if it were replaced by 'candy-floss' visions and
'candy-stick' promises.
Those who claimed 'to stand for progress and a modern Britain' had to
endorse a market-based economy built on enterprise as the only route to
prosperity.
Labour should also indicate that it was willing to build on rather than
reverse the reforms of the public services.
On Europe it should recognise that Britain's future would be safeguarded
only by co-operation with its European Union partners. But above all Mr
Blair should commit his party to 'fair votes' - the Liberal Democrat term
for a proportional voting system at Westminster.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Old-style radicals torment their moderate partners:
Divisions between the party's two traditions surfaced at Brighton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone thought the disputes had been settled when the Liberals and Social
Democrats merged to form the Liberal Democrats five years ago.
But, as they departed from a near-disastrous Brighton conference yesterday,
the two traditions were struggling to hide their divisions. For former
Liberals it had been a triumphant week. They voted to legalise cannabis and
tried to abolish the monarchy.
'It's been just like an old-style Liberal conference,' said Mr John Tilley,
the new leader of Kingston Council in south London. 'I can't remember the
last time I saw the party's youth and its radical activists in such great
form.'
But for the former Social Democrats it had been a week of torment. The
radicalism of the party's youth groups had been embarrassing, the economic
policies were vague and self-contradictory and the tabloids were
resurrecting the 'loony' image that haunted the Liberals.
A former SDP parliamentary candidate said: 'We've got to do much better than
this to be taken seriously by the public. You can't debate cannabis without
comprehensively discussing crime. Some of these people don't care whether
they get elected or not.'
Several delegates said the divisions between the two groups - above all over
whether to strike a deal with Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader - had
turned the conference into the most disorganised for years.
Most Liberals with a tradition of fighting Labour in local elections are
against any rapprochement with Mr Blair. Former SDP members, many of whom
came from Labour ranks, find it easier to envisage a deal with the new
Labour leadership.
Mr Neil Sherlock, a traditional Liberal activist and speechwriter for Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said: 'The obsession with Blair meant we
completely took our eye off the ball. The party did not bring together the
different views of its policy groups on the economy. We need to work on that
urgently.'
Another delegate, Mr Jonathan Davies, a former SDP member from Hendon in
north London, said the conference had been too pre-occupied with relations
with other parties and had failed to make the most of its electoral
successes.
'We have just won thousands of local authority seats in the council
elections,' he said. 'And yet, the one thing the party did not do this week
is celebrate its new councillors. Any other party would have done so.'
A few MPs were still smiling at the end. Mr Robert MacLennan, the party's
new president, struck a surreal note by telling delegates it had been a
'great week'. Mr Archy Kirkwood, the chief whip, admitted there had been
presentational difficulties, but added: 'The conference must offer a
showcase of our policies in the run-up to the election.'
There was genuine satisfaction, too, that the party had debated issues such
as drugs and the monarchy, in spite of their political sensitivity. 'These
are the issues being debated in the pubs and clubs,' said Mr John Pointon, a
young delegate from St Helens, Merseyside. 'Other parties just avoid them.'
But for all the confidence of Mr Ashdown's closing speech, many departing
delegates were at odds over the biggest issue of all - how to deal with
Labour.
'Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams and all those SDP people should either
get out of the party or shut up,' said Mr Ralph Bancroft, a veteran
campaigner for the Liberals in Harrow, north London. 'They have done us an
enormous amount of damage over the past few weeks. Let's concentrate on our
own policies.'
But Ms Sarah Prentice, a young councillor in Lambeth, south London, said:
'We have got to think about a strategy towards Labour. Their leader is a
very talented, very able personality. We have to be realistic.'
The debate over Labour will run and run. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats
went back to their constituencies and prepared for Tony Blair.

Party leaders shrugged off the defection to Labour yesterday of Mr Tony
Armstrong, the party's candidate for Coventry South-East. The timing of the
announcement of his switch to Labour added to the embarrassment of Liberal
Democrats at the end of a conference dominated by uncertainty over their
electoral future. Mr Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro, said Mr Armstrong was no
loss because he had been 'inactive for the last two years'.

Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, reaffirmed Liberal Democrat commitment to

Delegates approved a resolution calling for city technology colleges and

The party also wanted to provide parents with a real choice in their
children's education. Mr Foster urged 'choice for all, not just for the few

FT  23 SEP 94 / Komatsu makes it to a milestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Komatsu UK, the hydraulic excavator manufacturer, reaches a milestone today
when it hands over its 10,000th machine from its Birtley site in Tyne and
Wear.
The years since 1985 have not been easy. That was when Komatsu took over the
plant from its US rival Caterpillar. After initial rapid growth Komatsu UK
saw production slashed from a 1989 peak of 1,900 units to 1,200 in 1992
because of the UK construction industry's dramatic slump.
In spite of two bouts of job losses which cut employee numbers from 430 to
350, its Japanese parent insisted it remained committed to Birtley and
continued an Pounds 8m investment programme.
Now, nearly three years since the dark days of winter 1991-92, Komatsu UK
has been helped by a sharp rise in the UK and US markets - although this is
counterbalanced by a downturn in Germany, its main export market.
It is also having to fight increasing competition from imported and UK-made
equipment, but is maintaining a 20 per cent share of the UK market, where it
sells a fifth of its output. The rest is exported to continental Europe and
Scandinavia.
'It seems like we're running very hard to stand still,' said Komatsu
managing director Mr Keith Tipping. But he added: 'We think it's going in
the right direction.'
This year has seen important advances which could help iron out future
troughs in the cyclical construction equipment business. For the first time
Komatsu UK has exported to the US, with sales of tracked excavators and
machine arms worth Pounds 4m to its parent operation. Arm exports to the US
will continue in 1995 and possibly beyond.
A wheeled excavator, the second model designed entirely at Birtley, will be
launched soon. Until now its designs have been solely for Europe - but it
has been asked by its parent to design a new excavator for the world market.
Birtley hopes also to win the manufacturing of the model.
The plant's turnover this year should be about Pounds 78m and its output
1,300 excavators - less than 60 per cent of its 2,400 unit capacity - but
the likely 1995 target is 1,500.
'We have come through the worst,' Mr Tipping said. 'We are certainly looking
at more stable prospects.'

<TEXT>
Mr Michael Oatley, a former M16 officer who played a key role in the early
stages of the Northern Ireland peace process, has resigned as a senior
partner from Kroll Associates, the New York-based corporate investigation
agency, Jimmy Burns writes.
Mr Oatley last night said he wanted to be more independent and intended to
form his own investigative consultancy together with Kroll's former chairman
Mr Patrick Grayson, who resigned this summer.
According to industry sources his resignation is expected to be followed by
others in the coming weeks because of growing dissatisfaction with the
management of the company.
Mr Oatley, who used the alias 'Mountain Climber', initiated contacts with
senior republicans as part of an effort to bring about a ceasefire.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Fears of fire risks at large stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The risk of fire in larger supermarkets is causing increasing concern among
insurers and safety experts after a spate of losses in recent months.
The lack of compartment walls, which would halt the spread of fire, and the
absence of sprinkler systems and roof venting in many stores have been
singled out as potential hazards.
The risks were highlighted at a conference this week organised by the Fire
Protection Association, a body linked to the insurance industry.
Stores hit recently by fires include a supermarket in Hull, which suffered
Pounds 10m damage, and a superstore in Chichester, which suffered Pounds 11m
damage. The association says there have been nine big fires in the past two
years.
Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British
Insurers, said: 'It is a real worry. Fires can spread very quickly from one
corner to the whole building.'
Retailers insisted yesterday that the fears were overplayed. Mr Mark
Bradshaw, assistant director of the British Retail Consortium, which
represents about 90 per cent of the retail industry, said supermarkets fully
complied with the statutory framework, and the criticisms exaggerated the
effectiveness of sprinkler systems.
Instead retailers placed more emphasis on evacuation procedures, so that
employees and customers could escape quickly.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It has been choreographed more carefully than a bourgeois wedding.
The post-ceasefire procession to Washington by Northern Ireland's leading
politicians is being accompanied by an attention to detail that would do the
most assiduous mother-of-the-bride proud.
These diplomatic niceties may seem tiresome. But they have the virtue of
giving observers a way of assessing where the main participants in the
Northern Ireland peace process stand in the US administration's eyes.
This is particularly welcome since it is not clear what tangible rewards the
politicians will achieve from their journeys.
The most important guest is Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman
Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
This unmatched status is his reward for painstakingly building contacts on
Capitol Hill over a period of 20 years and for his strenuous efforts to keep
Northern Ireland high on the political agenda.
It is significant that he was the first of the Ulster retinue to arrive. He
was also granted an audience with President Bill Clinton during his meeting
with Mr Al Gore, vice-president, on Tuesday.
Whether his request for duty-free entry to the US for some goods made in
Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Irish Republic will bear
fruit remains to be seen.
Other honoured guests are the Ulster Unionist party delegation who arrived
in Mr Hume's slipstream. They too were granted a meeting with Mr Gore as
well as with senior administration officials.
Earlier this week Mr David Trimble, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, offered an
insight into the delegation's agenda, saying: 'Our concern is to ensure that
the pressures of domestic American politics do not intrude into our
affairs.'
Mr Adams, due to arrive in the US shortly, is the black sheep who is likely
to be kept away from the top table.
The Sinn Fein president, who is expected to meet members of both the House
of Representatives and the Senate foreign relations committee, will attempt
to build on the propaganda success of his trip to New York earlier this
year, visiting at least 10 US cities.
His visit is set partially to coincide with the presence in the US of Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. According to the Foreign Office, Mr
Hurd will make sure he gets the opportunity to 'put on the record' the
government's views on the way ahead.
At present the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist
party, is the aggrieved relative who could not bring himself to attend the
ceremony.
This may change, however. There are definite signs of a thaw in the party's
chilly relations with London after Mr John Major's promise of a referendum
within Ulster on the outcome of political talks on the province's future.
DUP officials acknowledged yesterday that Mr Paisley - currently in Canada -
had received invitations to visit the US later this year and emphasised that
he travels there frequently on private business.

FT  23 SEP 94 / N-plant's removal in 130 years proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric is proposing that Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in
Snowdonia will not be completely removed from the national park for more
than 130 years, Roland Adburgham writes.
The state-owned company yesterday published its strategy for decommissioning
the Magnox station, which stopped generating electricity three years ago. It
said that, after local consultation, it had agreed to lower the two 179ft
reactor buildings to 104ft to ease the visual impact.
'Safestore' structures to seal the buildings would be created as speedily as
possible, starting in 1996. Dismantling of non-radioactive plant would start
that year but the work of removing the safestores would not begin until
2128, with completion eight years later.
Nuclear Electric put the additional cost of its revised plan - yet to be
approved by the industry regulator - at Pounds 22m, with the total cost of
decommissioning at Pounds 138m.
Kingsnorth Power has won government approval for a Pounds 500m plan to build
a 600MW power station on the Medway estuary in Kent.

FT  23 SEP 94 / EU to be pressed on procurements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to urge the European Commission to play an increased
role in monitoring the Pounds 500bn-a-year European public procurement
market in an attempt to reduce alleged malpractice by other member states.
The move is intended to address concerns that British companies may be
losing out in Europe because of abuses of the European Union's public
procurement directive, which is intended to open all but the smallest public
contracts to European-wide competition.
The directive, introduced at the beginning of last year, is a central
element in the EU's single-market programme. The public procurement market
accounts for about 15 per cent of EU gross domestic product.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade minister with responsibility for internal market
issues, said many UK companies were making the most of opportunities which
the single market had brought and were winning new business in Europe.
But, he said: 'It is important that where the single market is not
delivering those opportunities, we should take action to put things right.'
He was unveiling the final report of the Department of Trade and Industry's
year-long public procurement review, conducted with the help of members of
the Confederation of British Industry and trade organisations.
It showed there had been no significant change in cross-border purchasing
patterns.
It also found some systematic abuses of the system by purchasers in other
member states which were likely to put British companies at a disadvantage.
These include abuse of the so-called 'accelerated procedure' for fast-track
contracts, and the use of procedures for selecting bidders in a way that
disadvantages foreign or non-traditional suppliers.
DTI officials said individual complaints were few. Of about 220 replies to
the department's questionnaire, only eight of substance remained, excluding
companies which did not want to pursue their complaint.
A 19-point action plan includes recommendations that alleged malpractice be
taken up immediately at a high level within the commission, which is urged
to monitor the market more closely.
UK officials said more needed to be done to advertise public contracts and
awards properly in the EU Official Journal.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Semtex found at IRA breakout jail: Anglo-Irish talks today
under fresh pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police yesterday discovered three detonators and just over a pound of Semtex
explosive at the prison in Cambridgeshire at which five IRA terrorists
attempted an armed breakout this month.
The discovery - which puts Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, under new
pressure and strains the Northern Ireland peace process - came on the eve of
the first Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference since last month's IRA
ceasefire.
Mr Howard last night described the find - inside Whitemoor prison's
perimeter wall but outside its special secure unit - as a 'very very grave'
matter. The find will cast a shadow over the future of Mr Derek Lewis,
prison service director-general.
Since the breakout the six high-security prisons in Britain have been
undergoing intensive searches by tracker dogs for explosives and guns.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the
Irish foreign minister, are expected to use today's meeting in London to
take stock of the situation in Ulster in the light of recent developments.
Mr Spring will have his first meeting with Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, at
breakfast today.
Dublin is keen for discussions to cover the sensitive subject of north-south
economic co-operation and general prospects for the province's economy.
The government said last night that six more roads on the Irish border were
to be reopened, bringing the total to 16.
Mr Major, speaking in South Africa yesterday, ruled out an amnesty for
convicted terrorists. Circumstances in Northern Ireland were 'not remotely
similar' to those in South Africa, where some prisoners convicted of
offences committed before the first all-race elections in April have been
released.
Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will review progress on the framework document
which they hope will inject momentum into political talks involving the main
political parties in the province.
With significant differences understood to remain between the two sides on
important constitutional issues, it seems increasingly likely that the
framework document will not be published until at least November.
Preliminary talks between London and Sinn Fein, to which the government is
committed within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence, could
start before it appears.
Prominent nationalists are said to be keen that round-table talks involving
the parties should not resume until Sinn Fein is able to take part.
But the longer the document is delayed, the longer the province may have to
wait for an end to loyalist violence.
Yesterday's Semtex discovery brought sharp political reaction. Mr John
Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, questioned Mr Howard's competence. He
said: 'I hope the prime minister will have him in to talk about what is
going on in our prisons.'
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: 'Mr Howard
must stop escaping full responsibility for the state of the prisons and make
sure the resources are there to carry out the searches which are needed.'
Initial reaction from unionists was restrained. Mr John Taylor, MP for
Strangford, said he did not think it would pose a problem for the ceasefire.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Unit trust charge rules to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further step in the process of deregulating the Pounds 100bn unit trust
industry came yesterday with rules liberalising charges and the range of
markets in which unit trusts can invest.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, said the
regulations would apply from the start of November.
Unit trust schemes will be allowed to impose exit charges when an investor
sells units, provided these are properly disclosed.
The other significant change will be the replacement of SIB's list of
approved securities and derivatives markets with a duty on managers to
ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria.
The deregulatory measures come against a background of broader changes
expected in the industry.
On Tuesday the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the
private investor, published plans for requiring unit trust companies to
provide customers with more information.
The most important shifts are the likely introduction next year of
open-ended investment companies and a move away from the existing system of
pricing unit trusts.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Ministers determined to sell Post Office stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, yesterday underlined their determination to press ahead
with partial privatisation of the Post Office.
At an informal meeting of the cabinet's committee on industrial, commercial
and consumer affairs, the ministers voiced their support for a majority sale
of the Royal Mail.
They are understood to enjoy the support of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, but Mr John Major, the prime minister, is still wary about the
potential political cost of a decision that Labour says will damage rural
post offices.
A final decision will be deferred until the conclusion of the consultation
period at the end of this month.
The meeting came as Mr Richard Dykes, managing director of Post Office
Counters, said yesterday that investment in advanced technology in village
post offices should put an end to rumours that partial privatisation would
lead to closures.
The Post Office said bids would close today for the first stages of a Pounds
100m plan to automate the UK's 20,000 post offices. The project, announced
in May, will place a computer terminal on each post office counter, making
it simpler to pay benefits.
The smallest rural post office will then have access to information and
services such as international cash transfer and travel insurance. The
system should make social security fraud more difficult.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Swans suitor unveils proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Organisation Management and Survey, the Manchester-based consulting
engineers, yesterday announced details of its proposals for Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure.
OMS, which has been in discussion with receivers Price Waterhouse for some
time, said it was leading a consortium which had received expressions of
interest from potential customers in immediately placing two orders at Swans
worth a total of up to Dollars 360m (Pounds 225m).
Mr David Tristram, OMS managing director, said the orders were from a US
corporation for diving support vessels and from Olympic Seas Maritime for
two large catamaran ferries for use on the Athens-Brindisi route.
OMS said it had reached agreement in principle with an unnamed 'experienced
Anglo-American marine company' which would become the shipyard's operator.
OMS envisages acquiring all Swans' assets. It would focus on merchant
shipbuilding, and also proposes ship refurbishment, repair and engineering,
and diversification into alumin-ium extrusion manufacture.
Mr Tristram said he expected to make a firm offer within 10 days.
'Significant interest is being shown from leading financial institutions to
provide the necessary funding,' he said. The consortium's advisers include
Cornhill Commercial Services.
OMS would aim to buy Swans after its last vessel - a Type 23 frigate -
leaves in November. It would wish to recruit Swans employees.
It faces competition for the assets. The receivers have already received
firm bids for the Hebburn site, and for Swans' intellectual property.
OMS's high-profile launch of its proposal met a cautious response from the
receivers.
Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said: 'I am able to confirm that an
approach was made a number of weeks ago by OMS to acquire all the assets of
Swan Hunter but to date no acceptable offer has been put to the receivers,
nor have we yet seen any evidence of a capability to fund such an offer were
it to be made.'
The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday called on unions to mount a rescue
buy-out bid for Swans.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Inflation 'toughest on the rich' under Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richer households have suffered a rate of inflation some 3 percentage points
higher than the official inflation rate under the Conservative government,
an economic study says.
In contrast, the rate of inflation experienced by the poorest 10 per cent of
the population was about 1 percentage point lower than the officially
defined measures.
The research, carried out by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and sponsored
by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, shows that between 1979 and 1992 the rate
of inflation experienced by households has varied significantly from the
official inflation data shown in the retail prices index.
The report admits that the retail prices index is not an entirely accurate
measurement of inflation because of the differing impact of housing costs.
If capital gains and losses on housing are included, for example, the data
suggests that elderly poor people who own their houses may have been
disproportionately hit.
Nevertheless the findings are likely to prove controversial, not least
because they run contrary to the usual wisdom that poor households have
suffered under Conservative rule.
The main reason for the discrepancy, the report says, lies in the differing
patterns of consumption of rich and poor households. Rich households, the
report notes, spend a large proportion of their budgets on luxury items,
with two-thirds of their income spent on items that have been subject to
value added tax.
Poor households, by contrast, spend more on basic necessities such as food,
fuel and clothing, with only a third of their income spent on items subject
to VAT.
Because the cost of luxuries has risen faster than overall inflation, not
least because of the rise in VAT on luxury items, this has meant that richer
households have been disproportionately affected. Poorer households, by
contrast, have benefited from the fact that the relative cost of food,
clothing and fuel has fallen during this period.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Group to campaign against antibiotic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A group has been set up to campaign on behalf of people who claim to have
suffered side-effects from taking Septrin, one of the world's top-selling
antibiotics.
The Septrin Action Group, formed after a weekend meeting in Birmingham, is
planning claims for personal damages and to campaign for the drug's
withdrawal.
Septrin is used against bronchitis and urinary-tract infections and has an
HIV-related application. The group claims the drug has been linked to 134
deaths and a range of side-effects since its introduction in 1968. It says
Septrin causes reactions to sunlight, skin rashes, damage to blood cells and
potentially fatal damage to the kidneys and other organs.
The group points out that Septrin combines two active agents, one made by
Wellcome and one by Hoffman La Roche, and that the side-effects are mainly
linked to the latter.
The Department of Health said yesterday: 'The committee of safety of
medicines has received 134 reports of suspected adverse reactions with a
fatal outcome associated with co-trimoxazole (Septrin's scientific name).'
It said, however, that more than 80m prescriptions had been dispensed in the
UK and 'a report of an adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that the
drug was responsible'.

Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has followed some of the other
large lenders in announcing a rise in its standard variable mortgage rate of
0.46 points to 8.1 per cent. Bristol &amp; West Building Society also announced
a rate rise from 7.89 per cent to 8.14 per cent.
Any movement in C&amp;G's rates is particularly sensitive because of the agreed
cash offer for the society of Pounds 1.8bn by Lloyds Bank.
The offer must be approved in separate votes by investing and borrowing
members of the society - but C&amp;G has been barred from offering cash
inducements to its 370,000 borrowers to vote for the takeover.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Overseas equities fall out of favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutions invested less in the second quarter of the year than the first
but increased purchases of domestic equities and property, government
figures released yesterday show, Simon London writes.
Net investment in all financial assets fell to Pounds 10.18bn from a record
Pounds 14bn in the first three months of the year. Net investment last year
averaged Pounds 12.5bn a quarter, stronger than analysts had anticipated and
helping to support financial markets.
The biggest decline was in purchases of overseas equities, which fell to
Pounds 800m from more than Pounds 3bn in the first quarter. Pension funds
divested a net Pounds 1.3bn of overseas shares, while life insurance
companies continued buying but at a slower rate.
UK government bonds also attracted less money, with Pounds 3.5bn added to
institutional portfolios against Pounds 4.2bn in the first three months of
the year. In contrast, Pounds 5.3bn was invested in UK equities, up from
Pounds 4.9bn in the first quarter, while net investment in property and land
rose sharply to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 276m.
The flow of funds into property was led by life insurance companies, which
invested a record Pounds 1.5bn in the three months to the end of June.
Pension funds were net sellers of property, shedding Pounds 246m-worth in
the same period.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Private cash plan for Scots M-way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's intended method of financing road construction with private
funds is set to make its Scottish debut. Ministers hope to use the method to
complete the M74 motorway in southern Scotland, and could eventually
transfer 100km (62 miles) of new motorway to a private operator.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the Scottish Office was exploring the
possibility of using the private-finance route for two remaining sections of
the M74 project, on which work has not yet begun. He said the Scottish
Office was talking to the Department of Transport about applying the same
solution to an English stretch of the A74 between Carlisle and the border at
Gretna.
Under the design, build, finance and operate method, the contractor finances
the construction of the road and maintains it for 15 to 25 years, recouping
money from the exchequer through 'shadow tolls' based on the amount of
traffic using the road.
Last month Mr John Watts, roads minister for England and Wales, asked
contractors to bid for the first four such road schemes in England.
The Scottish Office envisages that a contractor which undertook to complete
the M74 in Scotland and England would then take over the full 100km from
Abington to Carlisle and operate it. To complete the three stretches would
cost about Pounds 160m.
Mr Lang was opening an 18.6km stretch of the M74 between Dinwoodie Green and
Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway.
The four sections have been completed for Pounds 100m by Miller Civil
Engineering and Balfour Beatty.
Two further sections under construction will be finished towards the end of
this year, meaning that more than two-thirds of the project will have been
completed at a total cost of nearly Pounds 350m.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Major ends row with Thatcher on South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A long-distance row between Mr John Major and Baroness Thatcher over the
economic prospects for South Africa is over, the prime minister said
yesterday.
The row blew up after Lady Thatcher told businessmen in Bombay that foreign
capital was unlikely to flow to South Africa because of concerns about
violence.
Her comments - which cast a shadow over Mr Major's three-day official visit
to South Africa - irritated the prime minister's party because they directly
contradicted his repeated declarations of confidence in the ability of the
government of national unity to achieve prosperity.
Mr Major welcomed a clarification of Lady Thatcher's remarks - issued by her
office in London after worried British officials pointed out the potential
diplomatic damage.
The statement, which expressed support for the South African government and
confidence in the country's economic future, 'answers the point thoroughly',
Mr Major said before leaving for London.
He said Lady Thatcher had encouraged investment in South Africa and
assistance for impoverished black townships throughout her 11 years as prime
minister, which ended in 1990.
'That she wishes South Africa well, and has done so continuously, I don't
think there is a shred of doubt,' he said.
Mr Major's successful South African trip, which also took in short visits to
Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, has reinforced the growing confidence among his
advisers that the government's worst problems are over. Asked at a press
conference whether the government's fortunes had reached a turning point,
the prime minister responded cautiously: 'No wise politician ever says
that.'
But he is clearly hopeful that the government's popularity will be revived
by recent improvements in economic indicators, combined with progress
towards peace in Northern Ireland and the unofficial truce between the prime
minister and the Tory right.
'There are a series of things we have been doing for the last four years
which are now beginning to come together,' he said. 'People are beginning to
see the fruits.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Government backs down on pension trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is backing down from proposals to force employers to allow
pension scheme members to elect representatives to boards of trustees.
The Department of Social Security proposed in a white paper this summer that
employers should hold ballots of pension scheme members on whether they
wanted to appoint a third of the trustees. The government proposed that
schemes would be allowed not to have trustees appointed by members only when
a majority of members did not want them.
The right of scheme members to appoint some of the trustees is considered an
important factor in alerting regulators to possible wrongdoing or
underfunding in pension schemes.
At a Confederation of British Industry conference on pension reform, Mr
William Hague, social security minister, said the government had received
178 responses to its proposals on member trustees.
Mr Hague said: 'Two points were expressed quite clearly by many respondents.
Firstly, that requiring a referendum in every scheme, even when members may
be perfectly content with the arrangements, is a cumbersome and costly
process.
'A majority of respondents proposed that the process for allowing members to
decide if they wish to nominate trustees should be triggered only when a
proportion of members express dissatisfaction with current scheme
arrangements.'
Mr Hague added: 'We will implement our reforms with this in mind.'
Both the CBI and the National Association of Pension Funds, the occupational
pensions trade group, had urged the government to ease its requirements for
balloting.
The association, which has 1,200 members from the largest schemes, says 60
per cent of its members have member trustees and there is little point
interfering with schemes which are working well.
Mr Ron Amy, association chairman, said: 'We welcome the fact that the
government have taken our views on board.'
Mr Hague reiterated the government's intention to put in place a minimum
solvency requirement, which employers' groups say will increase the cost of
running pension schemes. This will require schemes to have assets equal to
at least 90 per cent of the 'cash equivalent' value of buying out each
member's accrued benefits.
Mr Hague said that to avoid schemes suddenly falling below the minimum
solvency floor in the event of a sudden collapse in stock prices, pension
funds would be able to use an average of equity prices over a period.
The pension funds association has urged that for these valuations equity
prices should be averaged over six months.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Output growth may weaken, CBI forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first hints that the recent strong growth in UK manufacturing
output might be levelling off emerged yesterday in a Confederation of
British Industry survey.
The survey, which covers about half of UK manufacturing employment and
exports, showed that the proportion of companies which expect output to
increase in the next four months fell in September.
Thirty four per cent of companies questioned said they expected output to
rise, while 11 per cent expected it to decline. The positive balance of 23
per cent was lower than in August's survey, when the positive balance was 30
per cent.
The CBI said yesterday that August's balance was the highest figure for six
years, and noted that this month's balance was still higher than last
September's balance of 17 per cent, and on a par with figures seen earlier
this year.
But the hints that the recent surge in activity might be levelling off are
unlikely to surprise the City, where many economists have been predicting
that output growth would ease slightly towards the end of this year.
The CBI said yesterday that more than 90 per cent of the survey was
conducted before the latest interest rate rise.
Some industry groups have warned that a rise in interest rates may damp
economic growth further.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday sought to rebut
these charges by insisting that a rate rise at this stage of the recovery
seemed just as likely to encourage business confidence in the sustainability
of the expansion and to encourage business investment as to damp them.
He told a CBI dinner in Gateshead: 'It was too much to hope that the
business community would actually welcome the move. By acting sooner rather
than later we can keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace and avoid
the need to bring it eventually to a grinding halt.'
Meanwhile, in a trend that will provide some boost to the government's fight
against inflation, the CBI survey showed that there was no increase in the
proportion of companies expecting to increase prices.
The proportion of companies which expect to increase prices in the next four
months, compared with those which expect to reduce them, was a positive
balance of 15 per cent, the same as in August, with two-thirds of companies
expecting no price change.
The survey showed that the proportion of companies reporting total order
books and export order books above normal was unchanged on the month,
suggesting that demand is stabilising. Meanwhile 17 per cent of companies
said that stocks were more than adequate, compared with 6 per cent which
said that they were less than adequate.

FT  23 SEP 94 / British Steel to raise prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel is raising list prices on its strip products - one of the
manufacturing industry's most important raw materials - by between 7 per
cent and 10 per cent from January 1, the sixth increase since the beginning
of last year.
The rise, foreshadowed in September when British Steel raised prices for
both strip and plate products, amounts to Pounds 25 a tonne - but the
company said it would not raise strip prices again before the end of next
June.
The latest increase would restore UK strip prices to their previous peak in
June 1990, before the recession, and would mean that prices have risen 46
per cent since the low point in March last year. Strip products are used in
the automotive, domestic appliance and many other industries.
British Steel's action is bound to heighten concern among smaller steel
users about raw material price increases, which they are often unable to
pass on to their larger customers. Big steel users negotiate their own
long-term contracts.
Last night, British Steel played down the effect of the rise on the UK
inflation rate. Each 1 per cent increase in steel prices, if fully passed
on, would add only one two-hundredths of a percentage point to inflation, it
said.
Defending the rises, it said that in spite of the company's low cost base,
its profitability was still not high enough. Strip mill product prices were
still 'substantially lower' than those in the US and Japan, it said. Demand
had risen over recent months, particularly in the UK, and was likely to
continue to strengthen with the next 18 months. Also, there was continuing
evidence of steel shortages at some European mills and a number of blast
furnace relines.
The UK steelmaker is also reviewing its carriage rates - unaltered since
1989 and typically between Pounds 5 and Pounds 10 a tonne for big customers.
The percentage rise, to be announced next month, would not be substantial,
it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A British-Greek joint venture, Christiani &amp; Nielsen-TEGK, has signed an
Ecu40.2m (Dollars 50m) contract to build an undersea tunnel linking two
ports in western Greece.
The tunnel project, which is still to be ratified by parliament, is the
first infrastructure project to be launched under the European Union's new
Ecu16.8bn funding package for Greece.
Christiani &amp; Nielsen-TEGK was the low bidder among 10 consortia shortlisted
for the project, the environment and public works ministry said.
The 1km tunnel between Aktion and Preveza at the entrance to the Ambracian
Gulf will be constructed using a 'cut-and-cover' method. Several pre-cast
concrete segments will be sunk into a channel to be dredged in the seabed.
The choice of a tunnel rather than a bridge to replace a ferry crossing
between the two ports was made on environmental grounds to protect the gulf
and the site of a famous ancient naval battle in 31 BC, at which the Roman
fleet defeated Antony and Cleopatra, according to the environment and public
works ministry.
The tunnel link, due to be completed in 1998, is part of an EU-funded plan
to improve the road network and expand harbours in western Greece.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Clinton renews sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton yesterday warned Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono that
unless agreement was reached by September 30 on opening up the Japanese
market he would have to resort to sanctions.
At the same time US and Japanese negotiators headed into the last lap on
talks covering procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment,
insurance, glass, vehicles and vehicle components. Agreement is reportedly
close on insurance and procurement; reports of at least a partial deal in
the making have begun to emerge.
This would not preclude sanctions for the remaining issues, particularly the
car sector which is responsible for a the greatest share of the Dollars 60bn
trade deficit and on which agreement seems most unlikely.
President Clinton and his advisers met recently to consider potential
sanctions if no agreement is reached. With the president still to prove he
can be as tough as his predecessors in military and trade confrontations,
threats of sanctions have a ring of authenticity.
Around Washington, administration officials had a consistent hard line
message. Mr Lawrence Summers, treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, said the 'turn-the-other-cheek' approach, demonstrated by the US
after the second world war, is no longer acceptable.
'It is absolutely critical that the US be prepared to combat egregious trade
practices in Japan or any other country,' he said.
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said: 'It would be irresponsible for
any administration to sit on its hands and do nothing in the face of those
facts.' Administration trade adviser Clyde Prestowitz yesterday released a
report calling for use of 'legal remedies available under US trade law'.
Mr Prestowitz called for a programme to monitor price data in Japan and a
task force to advise the president and Congress on 'the feasibility of
utilising multilateral processes,' bilateral remedies or whether additional
remedies are needed.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SNCF, the French state-owned railway system, is to buy 100 diesel
locomotives, in a deal worth FFr2.5bn (Dollars 470m), from GEC-Alsthom
Anglo-French engineering group.
Under the terms of the deal announced yesterday, which could rise to 250
diesel units, France's regional councils are to assure the financing of the
building of the locomotives. The state is to give a subsidy of FFr80m for
the first 100 units. SNCF will finance part of the research and launch costs
for an amount of FFr211m.
The order will come as a relief to GEC-Alsthom, which is jointly owned by
Alcatel Alsthom of France and GEC of the UK. SNCF has long delayed the order
for new diesel locomotives, contributing to a decision to restructure and
cut jobs at the joint venture's transport division earlier this year.
The diesel units, which will each comprise one motor wagon and one trailer,
are likely to be built at GEC-Alsthom's plant in La Rochelle in western
France.
The first locomotive is due to be delivered in 1997, with the rest of the
order staggered until 2000. While the contract is a significant order, it is
not the largest of its kind to be received by GEC-Alsthom. Orders for the
high-speed trains a grande vitesse have sometimes represented more than
twice as much.

Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, said yesterday that the process of ratifying the Uruguay Round
trade accords was 'definitely moving in the right direction' but warned that
stated intentions had yet to be reflected in concrete results.
Just 26 of the 125 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round have ratified
or concluded 'domestic processes'. Most have been waiting on the 'Quad'
group of leading traders, the US, the European Union, Japan and Canada, none
of which has yet ratified. The accords, including establishment of Gatt's
successor, the World Trade Organisation, are due to take effect on January 1
next year.
Speaking to a meeting of the WTO preparatory committee, Mr Sutherland said
the meeting on October 25 would be a 'watershed'. That is when he hopes to
fix the date and agenda for the implementing conference, planned for
December, which will formally decide when the WTO is established.
Asked to report on how ratification procedures were going, all four Quad
members expressed confidence ratification would be completed by the January
1 deadline.
Mr Booth Gardner, US ambassador to Gatt, said the administration would
submit legislation soon and expected a vote before Congress recesses on
October 15.
The EU, struggling to surmount a complex legal dispute over respective
responsibilities of the executive Commission and member states on trade
issues, said it was still committed to the January deadline. Mr Jean-Pierre
Leng, EU Gatt ambassador, expressed confidence the process would be
completed in good time. This is despite the fact that no accord has yet been
reached on an EU code of trade conduct, which would obviate the wait for a
ruling by the European Court.
The Japanese government expects approval of implementing legislation during
the special two-month Diet session due to start on September 30. Canada
plans to introduce legislation next month.
Also yesterday, Mr Andras Szepesi of Hungary, chairman of Gatt's contracting
parties, said he would begin consultations early next month on the future
head of the WTO. The decision, for which a consensus is needed, must be
endorsed at Gatt's annual meeting in December.
Mr Szepesi confirmed that the Brazilian candidate, Mr Rubens Ricupero, was
standing down. The three declared contestants are outgoing President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and Mr Kim Chul-su
of South Korea.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Kozyrev adds to doubts over Azerbaijan oil
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday added his voice
to doubts surrounding the the Dollars 8bn Caspian oil contract signed
earlier this week between the government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of
foreign oil companies.
Mr Kozyrev said that Russian interests had to be taken into account in any
agreement to exploit the reserves in the Caspian sea.
Agreements signed by the Soviet Union limiting exploitation were still in
force - 'no one has annulled them,' he said. 'The former Soviet republics
are the Soviet Union's legal heirs, while Russia is its main successor.
Obligations have to do with all the former Soviet republics. Azerbaijan is
well aware of this.'
Mr Kozyrev's statements were greeted yesterday with muted anger by other
Russian institutions concerned with the contract. These include the energy
ministry, which sent a deputy minister to applaud the signing of the deal
and Lukoil, the partly state-owned oil company which is a partner in the
consortium with 10 per cent of the contract.
An oil ministry spokesman said the ministry had 'no special comment' on Mr
Kozyrev's statement, adding that various interests were involved including
those of the ministries and oil companies - 'each of which could have a
different position'.
For Lukoil, Mr Alexander Vasilenko said that 'we signed a statement of
intent with the state oil company of Azerbaijan last September. There was an
inter-government agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan signed last
October, which Mr Yuri Shafrannik (the Russian Energy Minister) signed,
permitting an agreement between Lukoil and Azerbaijan. Lukoil works always
within the bounds of the law, and that is how we intend to work now,' Mr
Vasilenko said.
The issue has an importance beyond that of the Azeri contract - signed by
BP, Amoco, Statoil, Pennzoil, McDermott and other western oil companies.
Russia could effectively block the flow of oil by refusing to allow a
pipeline through its territory. It could also apply pressure to Azerbaijan
against running a pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean.
If so, it would send a message to other oil companies that deals with former
Soviet republics cannot be made without Russian approval.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 130m GM contract for Saab

Sweden's Saab Automobile said yesterday it had received a SKr1bn (Dollars
135m) order from General Motors, one of its joint owners, for the supply of
40,000 manual gearboxes a year over five years, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
It is the second large order which Saab has received from GM since the US
group took a 50 per cent stake in the company five years ago. It will
increase Saab's production by around 50 per cent to 115,000 manual gearboxes
a year while deliveries to GM will rise six-fold to 48,000 gearboxes a year.
The order was placed by GM's US Powertrain Division, GM's main US
development centre. The gearboxes, used in Saab's 900 and 9000 models, will
be fitted to a new GM model which is due to be manufactured in the US later
this decade. In 1990 Saab received an order for up to 65,000 gearboxes a
year for GM cars produced in Europe. Deliveries are currently running at
only 8,000 a year because of the recession in the German car market.
Bouygues Offshore, a unit of Bouygues of France, has signed a FFr840m
(Dollars 158m) contract to rebuild Nigeria's Forcados oil terminal for the
Nigerian unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Japan's four steel pipe makers - Sumitomo Metal, Nippon Steel, Kawasaki
Steel, and NKK - are set to export steels pipes to Russia between October
and the end of this year.
Electrolux of Sweden is considering a joint venture with Polish washing
machine producer Swiatowit Myszkow to develop appliance sales in central
Europe. Electrolux has signed a letter of intent with Myszkow to start
assembling Electrolux products in January next year.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Round opponents make their mark
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US foes of the Uruguay Round world trade pact have been flooding the Senate
with telephone calls as the focus of opposition has moved to the Dollars
40bn cost in the form of lost tariff revenues over the next decade.
Urged on by groups on the right and left, opponents have been demanding that
senators commit themselves to a vote against a waiver of budget rules, which
could raise the deficit.
The tactic is the latest in a lengthy battle against the new world trade
pact. The Clinton Administration has made passage a priority, but time and
election year pressures have become a serious obstacle in the effort.
Opponents have turned the debate into an issue of fiscal responsibility six
weeks before many Democrats are facing extraordinarily tight races.
'Gatt's complicated,' said Miss Lori Wallach, one of the anti-Gatt leaders,
she said. 'But there's nothing complicated about busting the US budget to
pay for foreign tax cuts. The Gatt package asks for increased taxes and
budget busting. It makes this a nightmare for many Democrats.'
Labour leaders, rightwing Christian groups, conservative talk show
commentators and Mr Ross Perot, the erstwhile presidential candidate, have
stepped up their opposition. Mr Perot's citizen brigades have targeted key
Democratic senators who are up for re-election. These include Tennessee
Senator Jim Sasser, the heir presumptive to Majority Leader George Mitchell,
who is retiring this year.
Senator Bob Kerry, a Nebraska Democrat, is also coming under strong
pressure. Like most Democrats, both are already suffering from the political
weakness of the president and could be helped by a delay in the vote until
next year.
With Congress due to adjourn in October for campaigning, the administration
will next week be forced to submit the implementing legislation which has
left key issues unresolved in Congress.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, must decide the timing of a
controversial rule of origin for textile and apparel imports for one year -
for one year as the House Ways and Means Committee wants it - or five years
as the senate wants it. The opposition is targeted at the Senate, where 60
votes will be needed to waive budget rules before a vote can be held.
The year-long struggle to pass the Gatt has lowered the stock of Mr Kantor,
who was considered one of the most successful members of the cabinet in the
wake of the Uruguay Round deal last December. Business lobbyists talk openly
of wanting a new trade team.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Cedras says he will not leave Haiti: US officials make
contact with military junta's missing police chief Francois
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING and JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, has repeated that he will not
leave the country after he steps down from power next month.
He told CBS TV in a interview on Wednesday night that the Haitian
constitution 'forbids exile' and that, in any case, the agreement reached
with the US delegation headed by former President Jimmy Carter did not
require it.
However, US officials in Washington were able to report that contact had
been established with the third member of the military junta - Col Michel
Francois, the police chief, who was not a party to the Sunday agreement and
whose whereabouts had been unknown.
A senior US military officer had a 1 1/2 -hour meeting with Col Francois at
police headquarters to discuss crowd control. This follows the violence used
by Haitian police against crowds on Tuesday, and the arrival of 1,000 US
military policemen on Wednesday.
Although the US, and UN Resolution 940, which authorised a military
operation to restore elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, called on the
ruling army elite to resign and go into exile, few expected Gen Cedras would
flee unless explicitly required to do so.
Last Thursday President Bill Clinton had demanded in his TV address that Gen
Cedras leave the country or face an invasion. But Mr Clinton has
subsequently said it was sufficient that Gen Cedras and other military
officers leave power - though adding that he expected them also to leave the
country.
Gen Cedras's decision to stay has bitterly disappointed Aristide supporters
who hoped that the army generals and police chief, who usurped power in a
1991 coup and had ruled the country ruthlessly since then, would be
eliminated with the arrival of US forces.
But President Aristide himself late on Wednesday finally accepted the logic
of the Sunday agreement, having withheld approval for nearly three days.
The prospect of the continued presence of the junta in Haiti also increases
the pressure on Haiti's parliament to pass an amnesty law in the next three
weeks as required by the agreement.
The military-backed Haitian government yesterday asked parliament to pass
such a law. The government also said it would 'very soon' announce a
timetable for votes to elect more than 2,000 senators, deputies, mayors and
local officials.
Meanwhile, as more and more US troops arrived and took to the streets of
Haiti, military commanders in Port-au-Prince sought to clarify the rules of
engagement for personnel on the ground.
After several incidents of political violence in which US troops were
ordered not to intervene, Mr Clinton declared that a repeat of Tuesday's
violence 'cannot and will not be tolerated'. Defence Department officials
said the safety of US servicemen would, however, remain paramount.
As of yesterday morning the exact circumstances of such intervention were
still being worked out. Ultimately, the decision was being left in the hands
of individual US servicemen. 'People on the street must use his or her best
judgment. In the end it is up to that individual soldier or sailor (to
decide whether or not to) intervene,' a US army spokesman in Port-au-Prince
said.
The news that US soldiers were now ordered to protect people seemed to have
been welcomed. In the streets by the docks, where business was brisk
yesterday, Pierre, a former businessman now working as a driver, said things
had already changed. 'I worked all night last night - I would not have done
that before, I wouldn't have even gone out of my house. . . people are not
afraid today.'
At the US embassy, the mood was generally buoyant and the beginning of the
US peace-keeping operation was viewed as a great success. 'Haiti today is
better off than it was yesterday and better off yesterday than it was the
day before,' said Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Hearings on baseball strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The current baseball strike reached the halls of Congress yesterday when a
House judiciary subcommittee began hearings on whether the sport's team
owners should continue to enjoy immunity from the nation's anti-trust laws.
Mr Bud Selig, the acting commissioner of baseball, testified in favour of
retaining the exemption and Mr Donald Fehr, chief of the players' union,
against. Congressman Jack Brooks, the committee chairman, showed his colours
by warning in advance that though the owners could hide from the fans they
could not avoid Congress on anti-trust matters. But Congress is unlikely to
vote until next year, at the earliest, with much possibly depending on
whether next year's baseball season also remains in doubt. At issue is the
1922 Supreme Court ruling, written by the legendary Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes. He wrote then, at a time when the sport was in difficulty, that
although baseball was certainly a business it did not engage in 'commerce'
in the 'normally accepted understanding of the word'. The anti-trust
exemption permits the owners, in effect, to act as a cartel and removes from
them the obligation of other than minimal disclosures of their finances and
discussions.

<TEXT>
Mr Mike McCurry, chief State Department spokesman, is being moved to the
same position in the White House to try to improve relations with the media
and to get over President Bill Clinton's policy messages more effectively.
The move is one of the personnel shifts being orchestrated by Mr Leon
Panetta, the chief of staff. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the present spokeswoman, is
being given what is described as 'broader responsibilities' but will be
replaced as the regular daily briefer by Mr McCurry. Mr Mark Gearan, the
overall communications director, is also to be given a new job, as yet
unspecified, on Mr Panetta's staff. Press relations have been a thorn in the
White House flesh ever since Mr Clinton took office. Initially they were
handled by Mr George Stephanopoulos, but only with much friction with the
press corps. He was shifted to a far more influential position as counsellor
to the president in the summer of last year, but even his activities are now
to be subject to greater control by Mr Panetta. Ms Myers is personally well
liked by the press, but she has never been a member of the inner
policy-making team, thus reducing her effectiveness. Mr McCurry, on the
other hand, has established a close working relationship with all the senior
echelons of the state department, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary
of state, in the year he has been on the job. His light touch has also made
him popular with diplomatic correspondents.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Cardoso's poll lead slips
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SALVADOR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, front-runner in Brazil's presidential
election, has seen his lead slip slightly in opinion polls, increasing the
chances of a second-round run-off with his nearest rival. Under Brazil's
election rules, a candidate only wins in the first round if he polls more
votes than all his competitors combined. According to a Gallup poll
published yesterday in the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper, Mr Cardoso's
support has slipped 2 points to 41.1 per cent. He is still well ahead of his
main rival, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who polled 20.6
per cent. Mr Cardoso's fall means his margin of victory over all the
candidates has fallen from 6.3 points earlier this month to 3.3 points. This
is within the poll's 4-point margin of error, suggesting Mr Cardoso's
first-round victory on October 3 is no longer assured. He still remains
clear favourite to win in a second round set for mid-November. His fall
appears to be a result of combined criticism by the other candidates, which
has led to an increase in the number of undecided voters.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's centre-right opposition is set to govern the industrial city of
Monterrey after an electoral court annulled votes from over 40 of the city's
polling stations in last August's election. The reversal of the
Institutional Revolutionary party's initial victory in Monterrey follows the
opposition's claims that the ruling party's vote in parts of the city had
been boosted by ballot-rigging. The capital of the northern state of Nuevo
Leon and home to many of the country's best known companies, Monterrey will
become the largest city ever in Mexico to be run by the National Action
party (PAN) opposition.
Federal electoral tribunals also annulled votes in a few polling stations in
other parts of the country, but the move is not expected to affect the
result of last August's election, in which the ruling party won a
comfortable victory in the presidential and congressional races. The
tribunal's move should improve relations between the government and the
centre-right opposition, and may increase the chances of a successful
outcome to imminent talks between the main political parties on political
reform. The centre-right PAN had made the election in Monterrey a test case
of the PRI's commitment to run free elections.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Clinton not to seek more nuclear arms cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has decided not to look for deeper cuts in the US's
strategic nuclear arsenal until reductions already agreed with Russia have
been carried out.
After a year-long review of US nuclear strategy, the administration decided
against trying to move beyond the limits on nuclear warheads already agreed
with Russia in the Start 2 strategic arms reduction treaty, which would cut
the US arsenal from around 6,000 warheads to around 3,500.
Mr Clinton overruled some senior administration officials who had argued
that the US should pursue an agreement on still deeper cuts in the Russian
and US nuclear forces.
Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, was due to give details of the new
nuclear policy yesterday evening. Earlier this week, however, he warned that
Russia had fallen behind schedule in its programme for dismantling nuclear
weapons.
Military officials argued that the US needed to maintain an adequate
security hedge against the risk of a reversal in Russia's progress towards
democracy and its possible failure to complete its promised cuts.
Mr Clinton is expected to offer more money for dismantling nuclear missiles
when he meets President Boris Yeltsin in Washington next week.
The US has decided, however, to trim its stockpile of short range tactical
nuclear weapons, which will leave approximately 480 weapons in Europe.
In addition, the US is expected to cut its fleet of nuclear missile
submarines from 18 to 14, and reduce the number of B-52 bombers from 94 to
66, instead of complying with the Start 2 limits by having each submarine or
bomber carry fewer warheads.
The US is now concentrating its efforts on talks aimed at extending the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The White House yesterday also called on China to join the moratorium on
nuclear test explosions declared by the other nuclear powers, and urged an
acceleration of negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Doubts cast on Quebec independence referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec separatists have begun to raise doubts about their commitment to hold
an early referendum on independence from Canada, barely a week after winning
elections in the French-speaking province by an unexpectedly narrow margin.
Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, whose 53 MPs promote the
separatist cause in the federal House of Commons in Ottawa, said the
referendum would not be held until the pro-independence forces were likely
to win. 'There is no way the sovereignists will engage in a losing
referendum,' Mr Bouchard said.
Mr Bouchard's remarks contradict pledges during the election campaign by Mr
Jacques Parizeau, leader of the Parti Quebecois, the party which will form
the next government in the French-speaking province.
Mr Parizeau said at one time the referendum would be held within 8-10 months
of the election. But he gave himself more latitude in the closing stages of
the campaign by promising a vote 'sometime in 1995'.
Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in Quebec's National Assembly, it
garnered only fractionally more of the popular vote than the defeated
Liberals.
Many voters who supported the PQ in the election do not necessarily favour
outright independence.
A poll of Quebec voters in by the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday showed
that 48.8 per cent of respondents would vote against independence in a
referendum, compared to only 35.8 per cent in favour of independence.
Political observers have also interpreted the signals put out by Mr Bouchard
and Mr Parizeau as evidence of divisions which have long been suspected
within the separatist ranks. Mr Bouchard, who is in his early 50s, is widely
seen as Mr Parizeau's most likely successor should the PQ leader, aged 64,
stumble over the independence issue.
Business leaders both in and outside Quebec have urged the new PQ government
to hold the referendum as quickly as possible to lift uncertainty over
Canada's political future. Mr Ghislain Dufour, president of the Patronat,
Quebec's main employer group, said: 'Our members want the political
uncertainty now weighing down on Quebec lifted as soon as possible. The
sooner the debate is over the better.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Fed warnings to banks on easier credit standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Top US Federal Reserve officials have issued a warning that banks may be
unduly relaxing their credit standards and making risky loans that could
turn sour.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday told the
Senate banking committee he had received reports from Fed bank examiners
that some banks under their supervision were 'competing more aggressively
for loans, and . . . are relaxing their credit standards'.
And Mr William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
warned in a recent speech against the temptation for banks to 'let the
pendulum swing too far' by cutting their rates or easing loan restrictions
as they try to rebuild lending operations after a very tight period.
'Pressure on pricing and other credit terms, such as loan covenants, must
not be permitted to sow the seeds of a new round of asset quality problems
down the road,' Mr McDonough told a symposium hosted by the New Jersey state
banking department.
Fed officials began to detect some cause for concern a while ago, but their
suspicions have been fuelled by a recent survey of senior loan officers.
Nevertheless, Mr Greenspan insisted: 'The condition of the banking system is
sound and much improved.'
Other Fed officials said they wanted to 'look beyond the silver lining' of
the current good health of the banking industry.
And Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, whose office supervises
nationally chartered banks while the Fed oversees state chartered banks,
said better bank profitability stemmed largely from improved credit quality.
'Banks have substantially recovered from their credit quality problems from
the late 1980s and early 1990s due, among other factors, to the improvement
in the economy,' Mr Ludwig told the Senate banking committee yesterday.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's latest quarterly survey,
published yesterday, showed that the nearly 11,000 banks in the US made
profits totalling Dollars 11.2bn (Pounds 7bn) in the second quarter of this
year, level with their performance in the first quarter and nearly 9 per
cent higher than in the second quarter of 1993.
Mr Greenspan also renewed his call for Congress to tear down more of the
barriers which restrict banks from entering other sectors of the financial
services industry, such as insurance and securities, and warned against
excessively tight control of activities such as derivatives.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Brazil's bankers lament victory over inflation: The
introduction of the Real has meant an end to banks' big overnight profits on
short-term lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's new currency, the Real, has sent inflation tumbling and public
support soaring. But the country's bankers are not yet celebrating. For
them, low inflation means lower profits, at least until the banks have been
thoroughly restructured.
Banks were the main beneficiaries of Brazil's years of high inflation. They
profited from lending to the government at very high short-term interest
rates. They gained from holding customers' money in cheque accounts because
funds lost value daily. In June, just before the Real's introduction, daily
inflation reached 2 per cent, a windfall for the banks.
Many banks earned more than 30 per cent of their income from such
inflation-related revenue. When inflation fell with the Real to less than 2
per cent a month, this income disappeared. The first serious signs of strain
appeared last week when Banespa, the biggest state owned bank, faced a
liquidity squeeze, and the central bank closed down a small private bank,
Brasbanco.
Most analysts agree that private-sector banks, except for a handful of very
small ones, can quickly adjust to low inflation. Larger banks like Bradesco
and Itau have strong balance sheets and should be able to find alternative
income sources, especially from an increasing demand for consumer credit if
economic growth continues.
The transition will be more painful for the much less efficient 23 banks
owned by the Brazilian government or individual Brazilian states. Banespa's
costs per employee reached Dollars 26,240 (Pounds 16,600) in the first half
of this year, compared to Dollars 8,820 for the similar-sized Itau.
State-owned banks are also limited by law in dismissing workers, which
prevents them from cutting costs as rapidly as their private sector
counterparts.
Then there is political pressure. State banks are subject to interference by
politicians, and have been used to channel jobs and loans to supporters,
especially before elections. As a result, small towns often have three or
four bank branches owned by the central or state government. The central
bank failed in an attempt earlier this year to close down loss-making
branches after local politicians complained their campaigns would be
undermined.
'Governments have regularly used their state banks to finance elections and
other non-banking activities,' says Mr Erivelto Rodrigues of financial
analysts Austin Asis. 'The problem is, the banks lend the money without
getting paid back.'
It is difficult to assess how much damage these policies have caused. Public
accounting disclosure is poor and, until the introduction of the Real, high
inflation made the comparison of accounting periods misleading. Analysts
also suspect state banks conceal non-performing loans to their respective
state governments by granting a new loan near the end of the bank's fiscal
year so they can be paid interest on the old loan.
Analysts estimate it could cost several billion dollars to restore the state
banks' balance sheets. As an indication of the sums involved, last week the
central bank provided RDollars 1.65bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in short-term
assistance, in the form of swapping central government for state government
securities, to the three large state banks thought to be most in need of
reform. Banespa of Sao Paulo received RDollars 1.1bn, Banerj of Rio de
Janeiro RDollars 340m, and Banrisul of Rio Grande do Sul state RDollars
210m.
At least over the next three months, the central bank is likely to continue
backing banks that face liquidity problems. Brazil holds presidential
elections on October 3 and the government is keen to avoid any financial
instability, especially if it undermines the Real.
Even in the long term, the central bank is not expected to let larger banks
encounter serious problems, which would highlight the entire state-owned
sector's weakness. The banks are likely to be urged to cut costs and merge
branches. Some smaller state-owned banks may be threatened with closure or
told to merge.
'Sorting out the state banks will be a long and very careful process which
won't be solved overnight and which cannot be done in an irresponsible way
because of the risks,' says Mr Carlos Langoni, a former central bank
president.
According to private bankers, the hope for long-term reform lies with
Brazil's new president, likely to be Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The
bankers say the new president must make a number of moves, starting with
measures to insulate banks from political interference. For example, a law
which prevents private banks from lending to their main shareholders could
be applied to state-owned banks to stop them funding their state's deficit.
'We need new regulations to restrict the banks' freedom. If they want to be
called a bank they should act like one,' says one Sao Paulo banker.
Other bankers argue that privatisation is the only way to guarantee
independence for the state banks, and to improve their efficiency. But this
would first require the states, some of which are already in deficit, to
repay their debts.
According to one model, a bank such as Banespa - which is owed about Dollars
7bn by the Sao Paulo state government - could be repaid with shares in the
state-owned electricity and water companies.
Mr Cardoso is thought to favour such schemes. But he will encounter stiff
opposition from state governors and the banks themselves, which argue that
in a country like Brazil, state banks also serve as development agencies and
should not aim to emulate the private sector.
Whether the banks are allowed to remain in the state sector will probably
depend on their own performance. The central government cannot afford to
lend financial support for long. Unless they quickly move to reduce their
losses, the government may start paying more attention to private sector
calls for the banks to be merged or privatised.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Tokyo's aim of boosting demand remains uppermost:
Longer-term outlook sees a shift from direct to indirect taxation - but that
could threaten the outcome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The tax changes announced yesterday started life a year ago as an
uncomplicated fiscal stimulus intended to breathe life into the ailing
Japanese economy.
Through a tortuous series of political and administrative twists in the last
year they came, for a while, to represent rather more. Some proponents even
claimed that tax reform was part of a broader strategy of social and
economic reform that would help Japan's economy to open up to the consumer
and to the world. But the final formula suggests that the overriding aim in
the end was the same as ever - to boost demand.
The key element remains the fiscal stimulus. The economy is benefiting from
income tax cuts of about Y6,000bn (Pounds 39bn). The average family this
year will be more than Y100,000 better off as a result. The main effect of
the package is to maintain that injection of demand for the next three years
at least. Fiscal retribution, if and when it comes, in the form of higher
consumption tax, is deferred.
That could normally be expected to boost consumption. But in the past,
Japanese taxpayers have tended to save a very high proportion of their extra
revenue from tax cuts - up to half by some estimates. That limits the
benefits to the economy of any fiscal stimulus. Worse still, some economists
fear that if consumers believe the benefits of the tax cut will be removed
in three years' time by an indirect tax increase, they may choose to set
aside even more of the extra money in savings.
But the inclusion of a clause in the tax proposals to allow the government
to reconsider the consumption tax increase in the light of prevailing
economic conditions is crucial.
It is likely to make consumers feel a little less uneasy about the delayed
tax rise. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research
Institute, argued that the opt-out clause was crucial.
'The income tax cut will only raise consumption significantly if the
taxpayer does not think he will have to pay higher consumption tax in the
future, regardless of the economic conditions,' he said.
Higher consumer demand should also translate into good news for the world's
trade imbalances. There have been signs in the last few months that the high
yen has started to stimulate imports; that process has been assisted by the
current year's tax cuts and is likely to be accelerated by the new fiscal
stimulus.
But in the longer run, Japan's trading partners may be less optimistic that
the changes will radically alter the structure of Japan's economy.
If the consumption tax increase goes ahead as planned, it will represent a
significant shift in the burden of taxation from direct to indirect tax.
It is unlikely that will encourage Japanese consumers to spend more and save
less. In fact the shift from direct to indirect taxation normally has the
opposite effect, since it raises the real cost to the taxpayer of spending
relative to saving.
However, the scope of fiscal policy, and of this particular fiscal package,
was not intended to be so wide.
As Ms Mineko Sasaki Smith, economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, pointed
out: 'This was never intended to do more than give an immediate stimulus,
while remaining revenue-neutral in the long run. Real economic reform still
awaits the opening-up and thorough deregulation of Japan's economy.'

World telecommunications ministers ended a meeting of the International
Telecommunication Union yesterday dominated by developing countries'
complaints that they were being left behind on the information superhighway,
Reuter reports from Kyoto.
The meeting of 49 ministers issued a vague communique that said they were
committed to developing global telecommunications but it left unresolved how
to cope with competition and how to bridge the gap between nations such as
the US and developing countries.
The meeting appeared to signal that developing nations believed the time had
come to raise their voices and demand more help to improve just their basic
domestic services.
It was in stark contrast to a satellite speech many delegates heard only
hours earlier from US Vice President Al Gore, who called for governments to
redefine their role in telecommunications.
'We believe that sound market principles can foster the efficient and free
flow of communications worldwide,' Mr Gore said in his speech from
Washington to the meeting in Kyoto.
The so-called Kyoto Declaration said: 'We will commit ourselves to work
toward advancing the world's telecommunications structure, enabling all our
citizens to share its benefits as we progress towards the 21st century.'
But speaker after speaker from the third world said they were struggling
just to provide a telephone call to a village, let alone drive on the Global
Information Superhighway.
'In view of the severe imbalance of global telecommunications development,
we believe that the construction of the telecommunications networks for the
21st century should start from the actual situations of various countries
and progress in a planned and step-by-step way,' Mr Wu Jichuan, China's
minister of telecommunications, said.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Premier's fast fiscal footwork likely to be welcomed by
Japan and US: The reforms that follow a year of wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, yesterday showed
himself to be just as unencumbered by ideology as his new partners in the
Liberal Democratic party.
The fiscal reform package his cabinet approved includes a rise in
consumption tax, opposed by Mr Murayama's own Social Democratic party until
he ditched its fiscal dogma yesterday, in the interests of keeping the
government together and staying in power.
Needless to say, the other part of the scheme, cuts in income taxes, will
bolster the coalition's recently rising popularity. It will also win some
applause from the US government, eager for Japanese consumers to spend more
on imports and reduce the politically troublesome trade surplus. The US,
never sympathetic to the Japanese finance ministry's attempts to increase
the tax base, will be less happy about the rise in the sales levy.
Japan's Socialists have thrown out their old policies at high speed, since
taking office at the end of June in a three party coalition dominated by
their former enemies, the conservative LDP. Opposition to the military and
to Japan's security treaty with the US were the first to go; consumption tax
is the latest.
As a result, what started out only three months ago as one of the oddest
political marriages in the world, has grown into an effective working
alliance. Yesterday's decision opens the way to ending more than a year of
wrangling on tax policy, assuming the SDP can maintain unity on the tax
change. It suggests Japan may be less of a political mess than it looks.
Mr Murayama's fast fiscal footwork is equalled only by the LDP itself, which
took 10 years of painful internal wrangling to get consumption tax
introduced in 1989, under pressure from the finance ministry. Late the same
year, the LDP nearly scrapped sales tax after losing its majority in the
upper house of parliament because of popular resentment of the new levy.
Ever since, the finance ministry has been patiently working to bring a rise
in Japan's internationally low 3 per cent sales tax. It argues that the
government needs to raise more revenue from indirect taxes to make up for an
erosion of the income tax base caused by a the rising proportion of
pensioners and falling number of wage earners.
But the ministry's strategy of adjusting Japan's lop-sided tax base last
year became muddled up with the need to cut income taxes to stimulate
private spending. Soon after taking office in August 1993, the coalition
government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister, started to plan
an income tax cut, under pressure from the US.
The finance ministry saw its chance to capitalise on the confusion and
achieve that increase in consumption tax, by making it a condition of Mr
Hosokawa's income tax cut.
The aim was for the tax change to be revenue neutral; that is to say the
rise in private income was to be wiped out by the rise in consumption tax,
due to take effect in three years' time.
Yesterday's package suggests a rise in consumption tax from 3 per cent to 5
per cent, rather than Mr Hosokawa's original scheme for a 7 per cent sales
tax, but the broad economic impact will be about the same because the income
tax cut is smaller than that proposed by the former leader.
Mr Hosokawa went for the ministry's trade-off, but made the mistake of
announcing a combined income tax cut and consumption tax rise - last
February - without consulting the SDP, the largest partner in his coalition.
The ensuing row contributed to the downfall of Mr Hosokawa's government last
April and made it impossible for the SDP to trust his main adviser, Mr
Ichiro Ozawa.
The ensuing government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, also based on Mr Ozawa's
influence, managed to struggle on for only two months until the end of June,
when a disgruntled SDP threw in its lot with the main opposition party of
the time, the LDP.
Mr Murayama, a novice in the Japanese cabinet, had little choice but to take
the cue from his finance ministry advisers and promised a sceptical Group of
Seven meeting, in early July, just days after taking office, that he would
produce a tax reform by the end of the year.
Ironically, a cut in Japan's official interest rates would have been a
faster way to stimulate demand, believes Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist
at Baring Securities. Japanese direct and indirect tax rates are already low
by international standards, while corporation tax rates are higher than
average.
But an interest rate cut would have weakened the yen, harming US hopes for a
smaller trade surplus. That is why the spotlight has been kept on fiscal,
rather than monetary policy in US-Japan economic discussions.
Washington's fiscal message was driven home again earlier this week in a
discreet meeting between Mr Laurence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for
international affairs and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former LDP prime minister
who is now the government's behind-the-scenes dealmaker. It has left
Japanese bureaucrats with an uncomfortable feeling that the US had succumbed
to the temptation to intervene in domestic politics.
But for better or worse, that political decision clears the way for a tax
package to be presented to parliament at the next session, opening on
September 30. If Mr Murayama's Socialist followers prove as fast on their
feet as he, Japan's surprising new government will surprise its critics and
deliver on tax, where two previous administrations failed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe's president, Mr Robert Mugabe, brushing aside the demise of
communism, pledged his party's commitment to socialism yesterday and also
said he would speed up control of the economy by the black majority, Reuter
reports from Harare.
'Socialism remains our sworn ideology,' Mr Mugabe told a congress of his
ruling Zanu-PF party.
Amid applause from nearly 8,000 delegates assembled at the futuristic Harare
Conference Centre, he said: 'The challenge is to continue to redefine it
(socialism) in a manner consistent with our culture and historical
experience, the changing times and the aspirations of our people.
'Naturally, such an ideological synthesis calls for a committed and
conscious cadreship which agitates for the realisation of our objectives.'
Mr Mugabe, in power in Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980,
said Zanu-PF found it unacceptable that the majority 10m blacks, who
outnumber whites by 10-to-one, were still marginalised in the control of the
country's economy.
'Our people still suffer economic disablement as a result of myriad old
laws, business practices and prejudices, themselves a legacy of a colonial
past that sought a wholesale disempowerment of the blacks. Needless to say,
this situation is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue,' he said.
Mr Mugabe said his government was setting up an investment fund which,
together with an improved business climate in Zimbabwe brought about by
western-backed economic reforms, should quicken the pace of transfer of
economic power.
He also pledged to accelerate a controversial plan that allows the state
virtually to seize mostly white-owned farms to resettle thousands of blacks
thrown out of their original homes by previous white governments.
'Currently five million hectares of land is being purchased from the
large-scale commercial area to bring total land acquired for resettlement
purposes to 8.3 million hectares,' Mr Mugabe said. The plan, introduced in
1992, is opposed by Zimbabwe's 4,500 commercial farmers - producers of most
export crops and food.
The five-yearly congress will also elect new leaders for the party that has
ruled alone for the past 14 years.

Kuwait and Iraq are ready to accept a proposal by the International

from Kuwait.
Mr Arnold Luethold, ICRC delegate for the Arabian peninsula, said formation
of a technical team, the details of which had yet to be settled, would speed
the search for the missing.
Most of those missing are the 600 Kuwaitis alleged by the emirate to be held
in Iraq, which occupied Kuwait for seven months in 1990-91.
'Kuwait and Iraq have informed the ICRC that they are ready to accept the
proposal,' Mr Luethold, who is based in Kuwait, said in a telephone
interview.
The return of captives held in Iraq was a condition of the ceasefire imposed
on Baghdad after a US-led multinational force ejected its troops from Kuwait
in 1991.

The African Development Bank hopes to resolve a dispute paralysing its soft

something will be signed,' Mr Ernest Achonu, bank information officer, said.
The subsidiary, the African Development Fund, normally lends Dollars 1bn a
year on easy terms. But it has not functioned since last year, because of a
wrangle over lending conditions. Donors wanted only countries with per
capita incomes of more than Dollars 1,054 per year to be regarded as
acceptable credit risks and allowed to borrow from the bank; countries with
incomes of Dollars 543 or less would borrow only from the fund.

Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's federal treasurer, yesterday revised downwards
the government's growth forecasts for this year, saying that gross domestic
product would rise by about 4.25 per cent, rather than the 4.5 per cent
predicted in the May budget, Nikki Tait writes.
The revision was triggered by the severe drought which is affecting
agricultural production in the key eastern states of New South Wales and
Queensland. However, Mr Willis suggested that the effect of the drought
would be partly offset by faster-than-expected upturn in international
economies.

Officials from Israel, Jordan, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the
Palestinian self-rule areas have all accepted invitations to an
unprecedented Middle East economic conference, to be held in Casablanca at
the end of October, Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, announced
yesterday.
The three-day conference, to be hosted by King Hassan of Morocco, is
designed to bring representatives from companies around the world into
contact with the region's governments, to hammer out substantive projects
for Middle East development. About 1,000 international companies are
understood to have accepted invitations.
High on the conference agenda, said Mr Peres, are plans for a regional
development bank to fund Middle East reconstruction, initially capitalised
at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn), with 40 per cent coming from the Middle East
and 60 per cent from outside the region.
The meeting would also focus on projects to make the most of the region's
scarce water resources. He said a Dollars 13bn investment was required over
the next decade, and that a joint German-Japanese proposal for the
construction of a canal from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea was already
under serious consideration.
Other areas crying out for investment, he said, were tourism and
infrastructure. There were new hotels to be built to take advantage of a
boom he expected in package tours taking in Egypt, Israel and Jordan, and
new ports, airports, railroads and telecommunications networks to be
developed.
Mr Peres said the conference could be 'a turning point' for the Middle East,
if it helped give international investors the confidence to commit
themselves to big projects in the region. He noted that the Arab world had
made investments of more than Dollars 600bn in Europe over the past decade,
while Europe had invested just Dollars 20bn in the Middle East. It was time,
he said, to change that balance.
Estimating that living standards in the west were an average of 20 times
higher than in the Middle East, he stated that economic improvements
represented the most effective means of reducing extremism and instability.
'Fundamentalism cannot be countered with guns and rifles,' the Israeli
foreign minister said. 'There has to be an economic solution.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / Keating dodges Labor left in plan to sell 22 airports: 'Long
lease' clause to placate opponents will help make Australian privatisation a
flyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's Labor government yesterday approved plans to sell the 22
airports owned by the Federal Airports Corporation to the private sector, a
deal which could net ADollars 2bn (Pounds 900m) for the Treasury.
But the decision was taken only after an important concession to the left
wing of the party, which is opposed to privatisation. The airports will be
sold on a 'long lease', rather than a freehold basis, and the state will
continue to own the commonwealth land on which they are sited.
Even so, it still has to steer the proposal through its annual party
conference in Hobart next week. What shape the airports sale takes, and what
markers are set down for future privatisation policy, will be
keenly-debated.
The government of prime minister Mr Paul Keating is also hoping to sell off
a 75 per cent stake in Qantas, the national airline, an 80.6 per cent stake
in the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), an investment and
project finance group, and a handful of smaller assets.
The plans were outlined in the budget in May, and expenditure plans depend
on proceeds of ADollars 2.45bn during 1994-95. They are intended to follow
privatisation receipts of more than ADollars 5bnsince the late 1980s.
Labor party policy justifies public ownership because it makes 'essential
services . . . available at affordable prices to all Australians'. It also
requires that any privatisation proposal be scrutinised to ensure that it
does not 'weaken the sense of national identity' associated with the
business in question, or 'concentrate power in the hands of narrow private
interests'.
A new policy is being proposed for the conference. It refers to 'improving
the provision of community services through the public sector,
non-government community organisations and the private sector as
appropriate' and ensuring that any sale has a net benefit to the community.
Already, opponents have organised anti-privatisation rallies in cities
across Australia in recent weeks.
The Qantas sale has been accepted as a fait accompli, and is planned to go
ahead in the first half of 1995. A 25 per cent stake in the airline has
already been sold to British Airways and - from a management and financial
perspective - the company has been gearing up for a stockmarket share sale.
Earlier this week, it reported improved earnings results for 1993-94. The
only rumblings on the Qantas front centre on the scale of the employee share
ownership scheme required as part of the sale.
But the nation's airports are much more contentious. There are 22 separate
properties, ranging from Sydney's Kingsford Smith, which handles 16m
passengers a year, to Bankstown, with annual passenger throughput of 7,500.
The FAC was formed in 1988, to make national airport strategy more coherent
and less susceptible to political whim. It is profitable and, given the
potential growth in Australia's tourism industry with the Olympics Games in
Sydney in 2000, there is thought to be a lot of buyer interest. Britain's
BAA has already been mentioned.
While the larger airports, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, are
profitable, many of the smaller ones are not. Independent studies are
thought to advise that the maximum proceeds would be raised by selling the
assets as a single block. The FAC, which has said little publicly, is also
thought to prefer the option of remaining one entity - in part because of
the economies of scale this allows.
From a political perspective, however, clustering the properties might be a
more viable proposition, since this would offer more opportunities for local
or state-based investors to be involved. This approach might also have the
advantage of appearing 'pro-competitive', the argument being that different
groups of regional airports might then vie for business.
While wrangling continues over the particulars of the airport sale, the
bigger question is how much further a Labor government will be able to push
Australia's privatisation programme.
The biggest potential candidate is Telstra, the government-owned
telecommunications group. While privatisation gossip about Telstra surfaces
periodically, as does talk that outside investors might be introduced on a
joint venture basis in certain areas, ministers have indicated that it will
not be sold in the current term of office.

FT  23 SEP 94 / South Africa disappointed by credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has been given a BB rating by Ibca, the European credit rating
agency, in the first formal investment risk assessment since April's
elections.
The announcement is disappointing for the government, which had been hoping
for a BBB investment grade rating, but still puts it in the same category as
countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina.
Mr John Major, the first British Prime Minister to visit South Africa since
1960, nevertheless struck an upbeat note at the end of his three day visit,
saying that he had been deeply impressed by the ability and determination of
the coalition government, which took power after elections in April.
'The South African government is well aware of the need to create the right
climate for the private sector and private enterprise.
'They see no ideological barriers to creating that,' he said.
South Africa has been seeking an international credit rating since its April
elections and has appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to represent it
to the major agencies.
The price of South African government bonds fell on disappointment among
domestic investors that the country had been assigned a sub-investment grade
rating. As prices fell, yields rose by 28 basis points to 16.49 per cent.
'There is little surprise outside of South Africa about the decision, but
the feeling within the country was that it would get an investment grade
rating,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London.
He added: 'However, this reaction is likely to be short-lived. Ibca is not
as widely recognised as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two major
American agencies.
'Their ratings, expected next month, will provide more of a benchmark.'
Although the country has borrowed money in the European markets without an
official rating, the government is known be particularly keen to get access
to the US market.
If Moody's and S&amp;P give the same rating, this would preclude some major
funds from buying South African bonds and force the country to pay a premium
on any international issues it might make. In its June budget the government
announced its intention to raise R1.8bn (Pounds 320m) from international
capital markets in the current financial year.
In its report the Ibca acknowledged South Africa benefited from good
physical infrastructure, an advanced financial system, good managerial
talent and relatively low foreign debt.
However it warned that the economy's propensity to import remained high and
said that exports remain overly dependent on primary commodities.
Mr Christopher Huhne, Ibca Managing Director, said that although the rating
may have been lower than government officials hoped,
'the overall tone of the report is optimistic. If the government can
establish a credible fiscal track record over the next couple of years, the
rating could well improve.'
Mr Major, speaking in Johannesburg, said overseas investment was vital if
South Africa was to generate the jobs needed to achieve economic prosperity
and avoid social disruption. He urged British companies to add to the UK's
Pounds 10bn investment in South Africa, which accounts for nearly half of
all foreign investment.
Economic liberalisation has been a key theme of Mr Major's three-day visit,
during which he had talks with President Mandela, Deputy Presidents Mr Thabo
Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, and cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister
Mr Chris Liebenberg, and Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom
party.
Mr Major said the South African government would face 'many difficult
problems' and forecast 'setbacks as well as advances'.
The key to confidence would be clear indications that the government was
moving in the right direction.
'I think that if that is the case the South African government, although
there will be difficulties, will have every chance of carrying its programme
through,' he said.

FT  23 SEP 94 / HK group plans Dollars 12.7bn power plants in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
India said yesterday that Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong based group run
by Mr Gordon Wu, is planning to build two power stations worth Dollars
12.7bn in what would be India's largest foreign investment. Although the
scheme is at an early stage, the news will boost India'a efforts to promote
confidence in the economic re-forms started three years ago.
The announcement, made yesterday by Mr NKP Salve, power minister, comes a
few days before the annual meeting in Madrid of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, where India's economy will come under scrutiny.
Mr Salve said Hopewell's scheme would be the largest power project planned
in India. Hopewell has yet to decide the sites for its power stations which
would each consist of eight units of 660MW.
They would come on stream in stages between 1999 and 2003 if Hopewell
secures the necessary clearances by early next year. The stations would be
coal-fired using Indian coal.
Under a memorandum of understanding to be signed by Hopewell and Powergrid,
a state owned power transmission undertaking, the output is to be sold to
Powergrid which would sell the electricity to state electricity boards
(SEBs). Hopewell would therefore avoid dealing directly with the loss making
SEBs, which are subject political interference, notably over pricing.
India has received about 100 offers from private groups to build power
stations since it invited investment in the sector two years ago as part of
its economic liberalisation programme. Seven schemes are in the final stages
of preparation though none has yet received a final go-ahead from investors
and bankers. In order to encourage investment the government is backing
these seven schemes by offering guarantees that the SEBs will pay their
bills.
Turnover on India's bourses will more than triple over the next three years
with their capitalisation doubling to Dollars 300bn, according to a study by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Asia), Reuter reports from Bombay.
'Never since the East India Company landed 300 years ago has India been the
object of as much foreign commercial interest as today,' said the study.
BZW said India was at an early stage of the current business cycle. 'We see
this driving strong earnings growth for at least the next three years,'
according to the study made available to Reuters yesterday.
It forecast that the 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the
largest of 23 India's bourses, would reach the 5,000 level by March. It was
trading around 4,500 this week, down slightly from its September 12 record
close of 4,628.57. India has been one of Asia's most attractive emerging
markets this year, rising some 34 per cent since January.
But BZW cautioned that state elections in December and early 1995 would
create some uncertainty in the market, but would not be a long-term factor.

The Philippine government has suffered a new hitch in its bid to launch an
expanded value-added tax (VAT) system, a significant component of its
economic programme.
The Supreme Court told the government yesterday to refrain from implementing
the tax scheme, because a restraining order issued last June still applied.
The court injunction was issued after the filing of several cases separately
by groups opposing the expanded VAT because they argued it was
'unconstitutional' and would lead to sharp price increases.
VAT, originally introduced in the Philippines in 1988, is being expanded
under a new law to cover more economic sectors in order to bolster the
government's revenue base.
The government won a favourable ruling on the petitions, but the court said
this did not lift the injunction, which was separately issued.
After that ruling, the government announced it would start collecting the
new tax from October 1.
The opposing groups have appealed for a reconsideration of the August court
ruling, and the court said that since the case 'remained pending', the
temporary injunction would continue to be in force.
The government had hoped that the expanded VAT system would increase revenue
collections by about 8bn pesos (Pounds 195m) a year, helping keep its budget
deficit to 2.2 per cent of GNP this year under its economic programme that
gained International Monetary Fund support only last June.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Chinese will be encouraged to buy cars
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will soon begin providing incentives to individual car buyers to help
boost its fledgling automotive sector as part of a policy aimed at
encouraging widespread car ownership.
Speaking after a two-day conference in Beijing, Mr He Guangyuan, China's
minister of machinery, said that individuals would become the main
purchasers of cars and the incentives were designed to encourage this trend.
Mr He did not provide details but it seemed he was proposing that bank loans
or other forms of finance be made available to facilitate car purchases.
The official China Daily newspaper reported officials responsible for the
automotive sector as saying that to 'increase sales the state will introduce
incentives to car buyers to boost market demand'.
Individuals, as opposed to companies and work units, make up only a fraction
of car owners. Of the estimated 1.2m cars on China's roads 5 per cent are
owned privately, according to China Daily.
Mr He also announced the government would increase its support over the next
two years for four existing car makers in an effort to boost production.
China's new automotive policy sets as its goal the development of a mass
production automotive sector by early next century to meet an expected
booming demand for cars.
China's production goal for the year 2000 is some 1.35m cars, with 90 per
cent of the market to be supplied from local production. Output would rise
to 4m by the year 2010.
In 1993, China produced 234,000 passenger cars out of total production
nationwide of 1.3m vehicles. More than 300,000 vehicles including trucks,
commercial vehicles and cars were imported.
Among manufacturers singled out for government support were those in which
Volkswagen of Germany and Daihatsu of Japan are involved. Mr He did not
provide details of assistance, but Beijing recently announced it would
provide additional funds for the automotive sector.
The authorities are also making clear they will play an active role in the
rationalisation of an industry whose production has hitherto been scattered
among dozens of small inefficient plants, some of which produce a few
vehicles each month.
Thousands of components manufacturers are also being warned that unless they
achieve economies of scale through mergers or joint ventures with foreign
partners they will be forced out of business.
Mr He announced that some 350 components businesses out of an estimated
4,800 throughout China would get government assistance. Again, no detail was
provided of the form this assistance might take.
China has placed a freeze on new automotive manufacturers entering the
market until 1996, but international companies are being urged to
participate in upgrading the components sector.
Such companies as Ford, GM, Toyota and Nissan, have been told that to
participate in the components sector is virtually a prerequisite for
permission to become involved in manufacturing. This has prompted a scramble
for Chinese partners among component suppliers.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Danes begin talks to form a new coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic party leader, prepared
to form his second administration yesterday, despite the beating which his
four-party centre-left coalition suffered in Wednesday's general election to
the Folketing (parliament).
He handed his resignation to Queen Margrethe yesterday, but immediately
began negotiations for the formation of a new government, saying he was
confident that he could put together a new minority coalition.
He is expected to try form a government with the Centre Democrats and the
Radical Liberals, both members of his previous government, but his task was
made more difficult by the elimination from the Folketing of the fourth
member of the outgoing government, the Christian People's party. The
proposed new coalition would only have 75 seats in the 179-seat Folketing
and would require the parliamentary backing of the left-wing Socialist
People's party (SPP) and the Unity List.
The SPP signalled yesterday that it will set tough conditions for its
support. One report suggested that the SPP might try to force Mr Nyrup
Rasmussen to form a government of the Social Democratic party alone which
the SPP would seek to influence towards more left-wing policies. The SPP
leader, Mr Holger K Nielsen, declined to comment.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, thwarted in his ambition to become the country's
prime minister, although his own Liberal party went ahead by 13 seats to 42,
predicted that the coming government would be weak and would not survive the
full four-year parliamentary term. 'It won't be long before there's a new
election,' he declared on election night.
But as long as the Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats remain loyal to
Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, the Liberal party and its right-wing allies cannot force
a change of government.
The first task facing the new government will be to carry the 1995 budget
bill. The outgoing government planned to tighten fiscal policy next year in
order to reduce the budget deficit, now running at 5.1 per cent of the gross
domestic product. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen has said the the budget framework
presented in the draft budget, published in August, is not negotiable, but
the left-wing parties may try to exert pressure for higher government
spending on welfare and the environment.
Danish comedian Jacob Hougaard was elected as an MP on a campaign ticket of
shorter supermarket queues, better weather in Denmark, and a tail wind for
cyclists.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Welfare dilemma for Nordic social democrats: Can the
Scandinavian countries sustain high state benefits and reinvigorate the
private sector?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavia, the heart of western European welfare politics, is set once
again for a period of social democratic domination following elections this
week in Sweden and Denmark.
The return to power in Sweden of Mr Ingvar Carlsson's Social Democratic
Party ended three years in which the welfare state, built up during the
party's years in power since the war, was under challenge by conservative
prime minister Mr Carl Bildt.
In Denmark, Wednesday's election confirmed the Social Democrats of prime
minister Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen as the country's biggest single party and
the leading force in the new government. Although he lost ground to the
right-wing Liberal party, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen will be able to stay in power
with the support of centre and left-wing parties.
The Swedish and Danish elections followed the victory last September of Mrs
Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour party in Norway which, like its sister social
democratic parties to the east and south, has a profound commitment to
egalitarianism achieved through the universal provision of welfare.
To complete the picture, opinion polls in Finland suggest that the Social
Democratic party there, led by Mr Paavo Lipponen, will unseat the present
centre-right coalition of prime minister Mr Esko Aho in the general election
next March.
But this swing to the left is hardly a vote for state socialism.
In all four countries, private industry has been unchallenged for most of
the past 40 years as the engine of economic growth.
What the social democratic trend does seem to reflect is a deep-seated
determination to maintain the welfare state even at the cost of tax rates
which would be unsustainable in other western countries.
Over the years, Nordic citizens have grown accustomed to the state provision
of 'womb to tomb' welfare services covering health, education, social
services and generous safety nets such as high unemployment benefits.
In all four countries, for example, not only do mothers have
state-subsidised maternity leave rights much greater than those in most
European countries, but fathers have the right to paternity leave.
The big question, however, is whether the Nordic countries can sustain their
welfare states at current levels.
Norway, with the benefit of North Sea oil and gas revenues, has least cause
for concern, at least in the short to medium term.
But in Sweden, even the Social Democrats recognise that there is now a
damaging imbalance between the public and the private sector.
Last year, government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product
exceeded 70 per cent, well above the European average of around 50 per cent.
This imbalance, caused in large part by the huge cost of financing 14 per
cent unemployment, has left the country with the most serious crisis it has
experienced in its public finances.
The budget deficit is expected to be around 11 per cent of GDP this year and
government debt will shortly exceed 100 per cent of GDP.
Mr Carlsson is now preparing the country for a period of tough fiscal
medicine in which he has made no secret of the need for some severe cuts in
welfare benefits.
He may well have in mind the Danish example.
Denmark experienced a similar crisis in the early 1980s, but now has a
relatively strong economy after a decade of budget stringency.
The public finances were brought under control and, despite a long
recession, the budget deficit is now around 5 per cent of GDP.
Meanwhile, the welfare system continues to flourish. Indeed, Mr Nyrup
Rasmussen has this year introduced a popular new welfare programme.
As many as 100,000 Danes will take advantage of a 'leave from work' scheme
under which parents of young children and people undergoing job-related
training can take six months off work while receiving generous compensation.
But the Danish experience may not be as reassuring to Mr Carlsson as it
appears at first sight.
Denmark still ranks second to Sweden among industrialised countries in the
proportion of GDP accounted for by state spending (more than 60 per cent),
while unemployment continues to run at 12.5 per cent of the workforce.
But both Mr Nyrup Rasmussen and Mr Carlsson recognise that to tackle
unemployment, they must not only keep the public finances in order, but also
reverse a 40-year trend in the Nordic area of net job creation coming from
the public sector.
They are committed (as are Mrs Brundtland in Norway and Mr Lipponen in
Finland) to promoting private sector growth.
But many Nordic economists fear that the high unemployment benefits
encouraged by the welfare states have led also to high minimum wages that
hamper the private sector job creation needed to underpin the welfare
structure.
This is the awkward dilemma which Nordic social democrats must come to grips
with as they lead the region towards the end of the century.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Spain to reap benefits of strict budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy minister, will today tell his cabinet
colleagues that this year's public deficit is on target at 6.7 per cent of
GDP. This is not what the Madrid government, accustomed to budget overruns,
normally hears from its economic team, and it augurs well for market
perceptions of Mr Solbes' priorities as he puts the finishing touches to his
second budget.
Promoted from the agriculture ministry after last year's general election,
Mr Solbes inherited a 7.3 per cent deficit, an overshoot double that planned
by his predecessor, Mr Carlos Solchaga. Already he can claim two
achievements: he has restored the credibility of domestic finances and, in a
low growth year, he has succeeded in reducing the deficit.
Determined that this year's hard-won credibility will remain in place, Mr
Solbes intends to reduce the deficit to 5.9 per cent of GDP in his 1995
budget and to 3.4 per cent in 1996. But analysts say he has taken only a
first step towards righting the structural imbalances which lie at the root
of domestic deficits.
Mindful of such pressures, Mr Solbes has responded quickly to an August
price rebound and to an accompanying promise by the prime minister, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, that Spain's 7m pensioners will be fully compensated for a
year-end inflation that will now be above the forecast figure of 3.5 per
cent.
In a last-minute revision of his budget, Mr Solbes has cut the government's
1995 spending by 1 per cent. The government will use the savings to fund a
pensions bill that is expected to rise by Pta150bn (Pounds 742m) because of
the inflation increase.
The minority Catalan nationalist coalition, CiU, which was last night
meeting Mr Solbes' team, is expected to ensure the budget's safe passage
through parliament. Politically centre right, CiU backed Mr Solbes' first
budget last year after the general election left the ruling Socialist party
short of a parliamentary majority.
As before, Catalan support has been obtained at a price. The government has
agreed to regional demands, spearheaded by the Catalans, that they share in
the distribution of the EU's cohesion funds. It has also promised to
increase funding for regional health services. Reflecting the interests of
CiU's middle class electorate, the 1995 budget will reduce the social
security contributions made by employers and make up for the lost revenue
with a 1 per cent increase in value added tax.
With a forecast growth in GDP of 2.8 per cent next year - the economy grew
by 1.6 per cent in the first half of this year - the chief market criticism
is that Mr Solbes should use such expansion to cut back the structural
deficit more severely. 'A 5.9 per cent deficit next year is way too high and
nothing to be proud about,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, a senior economist at
the Banco Santander group.
Mr Solbes' department argues that several initiatives next year will meet
such criticisms. These include the liberalisation of telecommunications, an
overhaul of restrictive legislation on land use and reform of a state
pension scheme.
The problem is that such regulatory changes, together with deficit control,
could run foul of the left wing of the ruling party which favours a dash for
growth led by the public sector. Mr Solbes, however, needs to give quick
signals on liberalisation.
His budgets are necessarily market sensitive because the stock of government
debt, as a result of the ballooning deficits he inherited, is forecast to
rise from 55.8 per cent of GDP last year to more than 65 per cent in 1996.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Third minister accused of corruption: Gaullist denies
consultancy payments were for fictitious services as French allegations grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's sports and youth minister, Mrs Michele Alliot-Marie, was yesterday
reported to be under investigation for receiving payment from pharmaceutical
companies while a member of the health ministry's drug approval committee in
the 1980s.
Le Parisien newspaper cited judicial sources claiming that pharmaceutical
companies had paid money to a consultancy called Mediconseil which in turn
paid Mrs Alliot-Marie for 'fictitious services'. The minister responded that
she had been paid by Mediconseil for genuine work under a contract declared
to the tax authorities, that she had ended this work on becoming a Euro-MP
in 1989, and that she knew of no judicial investigation.
Mrs Alliot-Marie is none the less the third French minister to attract
allegations of corruption. The trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard
Longuet, is awaiting the justice ministry's decision on whether to pursue
allegations it received this week from a judge suggesting that he may have
allowed a contractor to subsidise the building of his Riviera villa, and
that he used money from other corporate sources to settle his construction
bill.
Mr Longuet said yesterday that he had no intention of resigning his powerful
government post, even if he was put under formal judicial investigation, as
is now the fate of Mr Alain Carignon. The latter asked in July to be
'suspended' from his job of communications minister in order to contest a
case in Grenoble of which he is mayor. A judge is seeking to establish
whether there is any link between a decision by Lyonnaise des Eaux, the
French utility company, to bail out a pro-Carignon newspaper and the
company's subsequent winning of the contract to manage Grenoble's water
supply.
Mr Longuet said he had asked for a formal 'judicial estimate' on the cost of
his St Tropez villa. He said the affair had not put into question any of his
roles as president of the Lorraine region, head of the Republican party, or
as trade and industry minister, and he had no intention of resigning.
As in the case of Mr Longuet, the allegations surrounding Mrs Alliot-Marie
arise out of a separate investigation. A Nanterre judge had been
investigating suspicions that a fellow RPR Gaullist of Mrs Alliot-Marie had
been receiving payments from pharmaceutical drug companies when he sat on
the same drug approval committee. The report on Mr Longuet came from a judge
trying to trace a commission paid by a St Gobain subsidiary to a Republican
party official in Nantes, in pursuit of a water pipe contract in the western
French city.
Yesterday Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who on taking office last year
suggested that he would encourage ministers under a cloud to resign, held
his first meeting with the three men he has appointed to look into ethical
links between business and politics in France, and current legal practice in
corruption investigations. The meeting was described as a first discussion
of the precise remit of the commission, on which an eminent businessman,
trade unionist and lawyer are to sit.

Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has thrown his weight behind calls
for a streamlined European Commission and a 'flexible' European Union, while
rejecting the idea of a 'hard core' of the most committed member states. In
an interview with Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, he welcomed a
fundamental debate on the future shape of the EU, which is supposed to
culminate in a new constitutional conference in 1996, and insisted that
Britain wanted more than a 'free trade zone' in Europe. 'I believe very
strongly in a common foreign and security policy,' he said, which should be
expanded step by step to include the countries of central and eastern
Europe. But flexibility meant that 'not everyone will do everything at the
same time, or in the same way'.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine has more hidden jobless than any other country in central and
eastern Europe and open unemployment is likely to soar next year as economic
reforms gather pace, according to a survey by the International Labour
Organisation. Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's east European team, said
yesterday the true unemployment rate in Ukraine was already in double
figures, compared with an official rate of less than 1 per cent. In
addition, some 12 per cent of workers are on long-term unpaid leave.
The survey, covering 348 manufacturing enterprises employing over 372,000
workers, contradicts suggestions that Ukrainian factories are clinging to
workers regardless of collapsing output. The survey shows widespread
job-shedding over the past year, especially in state-owned factories, as
well as extensive short-time working and resort to unpaid leave. With
enterprises still holding more workers than they need, Mr Standing predicts
a 'massive' increase in unemployment next year as industrial restructuring
accelerates. Over a quarter of factory managements in the survey expected
their firms to go bankrupt within a year.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Russian rouble at new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rouble tumbled by 5 per cent in Moscow yesterday to a new low of 2,460
to the US dollar, as the Central Bank refrained from intervention and
interest rates were pushed up sharply. Finance Ministry officials explained
the fall by reference to a call over the weekend by Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, the International Monetary Fund's executive director for Russia,
for stabilisation of the rouble early next year - noting that currencies
generally fell on the expectation of a currency stabilisation. At the same
time the bank is seeking to build up its reserves of hard currency and has
been reluctant to intervene in a major way in the market. The steady fall in
the rouble is not greatly worrying the government, in spite of its possible
effect on inflation, largely because it believes that a low rate will assist
in a stabilisation effort which may be attempted next year. At the same
time, its fall effectively reduces the government's commitments to unpaid
salaries and to cover the budget deficit.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Italians at odds over pensions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's right-wing coalition government last night failed to reach agreement
with the powerful trade union movement over pension reforms linked to the
1995 budget. After a day-long series of tough negotiating sessions, the two
sides agreed to meet again on Monday - but time is running out. An agreement
on changes in Italy's costly state-run and deficit-ridden pensions system is
central to preparation of the budget, which must be submitted to parliament
by September 30.
The lira weakened yesterday as dealers waited nervously for the outcome of
the government-union negotiations. The currency was traded at L1,011 against
the D-Mark, L8 down on the previous day; while share prices on the Milan
bourse fell by nearly 2 per cent. After the first session of talks yesterday
morning, the CGIL, largest of the three main trade union confederations, was
threatening a general strike. Despite new proposals tabled by the government
late in the evening, trade union leaders were still adamant in rejecting the
government's position as inadequate.
The government is seeking to raise close to L50,000bn (Pounds 20.3bn)
through fresh revenues and spending cuts to hold the budget deficit to below
9 per cent of GDP. Of this, the government originally sought to find some
L8,000bn in pension cuts. Yesterday, ministers were hinting the figure would
be closer to L5,000bn - placing greater emphasis on more fiscal revenue.

Dutch retail sales fell 4 per cent in the year to July, the Central Bureau
of Statistics reported yesterday. July retail sales in the non-food sector
were 8 per cent lower than a year earlier, while sales of outer garments in
speciality shops were 14 per cent down. The fall reflects last year's boom,
as well as unusually hot weather this year. While food sales rose a nominal
1.3 per cent in the year to July, after adjusting for price rises sales fell
by 1.3 per cent. Total retail sales, adjusted for inflation, were 5.2 per
cent down. In contrast to the retail performance, seasonally adjusted
industrial output for July was 3.6 per cent up a year earlier.
Sweden's current account showed a surplus of SKr2.8bn in July, but a deficit
of SKr0.6bn in the 12 months to July, central bank figures showed,
outperforming most expectations.
French household spending on manufactured goods rose 1 per cent in July, due
to a strong rise in car sales, and rose by 0.4 per cent in August despite a
decline in the car sector, national statistics institute Insee said.
Italy's industrial output rose an unadjusted 3.8 per cent in July from a
year earlier, following the rise in June of 5.3 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 94 / CSU leaves Strauss scandals behind and reasserts Bavarian
dominance: Michael Lindemann previews state elections that promise little
cheer for the SPD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Social Democrats in Bavaria, condemned for decades to thankless
opposition in Germany's most conservative state, call it the 'black
country'.
They mean Wolfratshausen, a prosperous little town nestling on the river
Loisach just south of Munich, and an area which boasts the second highest
per capita income in the country.
It is also the home town of Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian state premier,
and an undisputed stronghold of his ruling Christian Social Union, the
sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
Four years ago 55 per cent of the constituency backed the conservative and
Roman Catholic CSU, the party which has ruled the staunchly-independent Free
State of Bavaria with an absolute majority since 1962.
Last week Mrs Renate Schmidt, the Bavarian SPD leader, took the battle to
the heart of enemy territory, for a full-scale rally, complete with beer and
brass band, in the Wolfratshausen town hall.
She is the liveliest candidate the party has fielded in the state for years.
Yet Mrs Schmidt looks unlikely substantially to improve her party's
fortunes. Just as the SPD has slipped behind the CDU in polls for the
general election on October 16, so the party in Bavaria has seen its hopes
of unseating the mighty CSU fading.
Earlier this year there seemed to be some chance that the SPD might dislodge
a CSU reeling from a series of corruption scandals. Mr Stoiber's
predecessor, Mr Max Streibl, was forced to resign after accepting holidays
from a wealthy business friend.
Since then, the reign of the late Mr Franz Josef Strauss, father figure of
the CSU and the strongman of Bavarian politics since the war, has been
tarnished with further accusations of shady deals. For example Mr Eduard
Zwick, a multi-millionaire spa resort operator, who fled to Switzerland to
escape prosecution for income tax evasion, claimed that he had been promised
protection by Mr Strauss.
But the SPD's attempts to tar Mr Stoiber with the brush of scandal have
singularly failed. In the European parliament elections in June the
opposition managed only 23.7 per cent of the vote, its worst-ever European
result in the state.
'That (tactic) doesn't work any more,' says Mr Julian Gyger, an SPD
spokesman. Instead, Mrs Schmidt focuses on the need for more jobs and less
nuclear energy.
Mr Stoiber became state premier last May and admits he took over a party
which was 'insecure'. Once Mr Strauss's closest personal adviser, and then a
tough interior minister, he immediately demonstrated his political touch,
axing an array of official privileges, such as free seats at the opera.
The Bavarian premier is also an unashamed conservative who has taken a hard
line against asylum seekers, stealing fire from the right-wing Republicans,
once seen as a serious threat. The party, which was founded in Bavaria where
it still has its strongest support, is, according to the polls, hovering
around the 5 per cent mark needed to secure seats in the Landtag, or state
parliament.
Observers are wary of predictions because many Republicans do not admit
their voting intentions in polls. The party is, however, under considerable
pressure, given that it failed to make the 5 per cent four years ago. In
addition, Mr Franz Schonhuber, the charismatic 75-year-old party leader, has
said he will step down after the elections.
The CSU could secure an absolute majority with 46 per cent of the vote if,
as many observers expect, several smaller parties do not make it into
parliament.
Not all of Bavaria votes like Wolfratshausen. But even if Mrs Schmidt picks
up votes where she comes from in Lower Bavaria and Franconia, in towns such
as Hof and Schweinfurt - where the textile and ball-bearings industry is on
its knees because of the recession and competition from the neighbouring
Czech Republic - she would need at least another two parties to ensure a
parliamentary majority.
The SPD's chances are further diminished because historically the party has
been much weaker in Bavaria and there are parts of the state where it does
not even exist.
Mr Stoiber meanwhile says the Bavarians have stood rock-solid behind the CSU
for three decades because they have their own way of doing things, different
from the rest of Germany. 'We don't always follow the fashion here,' he
says.
As for suggestions that leading CSU politicians have been lining their
pockets in recent years - they impress very few Bavarians.
'Everyone is always talking about connections that leading CSU politicians
have,' a customs officer said at a Stoiber rally. 'Well what's wrong with
connections - at least you get things done.'

FT  23 SEP 94 / French battle to win third telecom licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French industry ministry is finalising its recommendations concerning a
fiercely contested battle for the country's third mobile telecommunications
licence and is awaiting a decision from Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister.
Officials said that a decision could come this weekend. But they indicated
that the sensitivity of the licence award, which pits three of France's
largest industrial groups in competition, may prompt a delay.
Alcatel Alsthom, the telecoms and engineering group, Lyonnaise des Eaux, the
utilities and communications group, and Bouygues, the construction and
communications company, are all bidding for the right to operate the third
digital network. They are seeking either to diversify into a new business
sector or, in the case of Alcatel, to extend telecommunications equipment
activities into the provision of mobile services.
Bouygues, considered by many industry observers to have edged ahead in the
contest, estimates that an investment of between FFr3bn (Pounds 360m) and
FFr4bn is necessary to establish the new network. The winner of the licence
will compete with existing networks operated by subsidiaries of France
Telecom, the state telecoms group, and Generale des Eaux, the utilities and
communications company.
The cost of the investment will be shared by partners in the various
consortia. Alcatel Alsthom has linked up with Stet of Italy in preparing its
offer. Bouygues' partners include Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and US West,
while Lyonnaise des Eaux counts Thyssen of Germany and Bell South of the US
amongst its consortium.
The sensitivity of the award stems from the influence of the companies
involved and the method employed to decide the winner. Bouygues operates
TF1, France's television channel, while Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of
Lyonnaise des Eaux, is a former senior official in Mr Balladur's Gaullist
RPR party. With the unofficial contest for next year's presidential
elections gathering intensity, Mr Balladur is anxious to avoid controversy
over the award or to alienate the contenders.
Rather than selecting the winner through an auction process, as in recent US
telecoms licence awards, the French government is to decide on technical
proposals and investment plans. 'The project which is the most viable on
these criteria will be the one selected,' said one official.
Despite the sensitivity of the award, the industry ministry is seeking a
rapid decision to prevent the French mobile telephone sector lagging further
behind its neighbours. According to Idate, the communications research
institute, France had only 725,000 mobile telephone subscribers at the end
of August, compared with more than 2.2m in Germany and about 2.7m in the UK.
Part of the explanation lies in the lack of competition. 'The two incumbents
have tended to behave like a cosy duopoly, keeping prices high and limiting
demand,' says one industry analyst. He adds, however, that competition has
intensified since 1992 with the introduction of rival GSM digital networks
by France Telecom and SFR, the mobile telecoms subsidiary of Lyonnaise des
Eaux.
The new licence will be to operate the digital system, DCS 1800. 'It is a
cheaper system to develop than the traditional GSM network, because the
infrastructure is lighter,' says Mr Didier Pouillot at Idate.

The growing mood of optimism about Germany's economic recovery, fueled by
senior ministers campaigning for re-election next month, is causing great
concern in the country's business community.
Industry fears that, in contrast to the gloomy British, Germans are falling
for the 'feelgood factor' too fast. And that could mean that they ease up
too soon on the process of drastic cost-cutting and restructuring needed to
make German industry competitive once again.
On the one hand, leaders of the main business lobbies are delighted at the
turnaround in economic fortunes, which has raised the latest growth
forecasts of the economics ministry to 2.5 per cent for this year, and 3 per
cent in 1995.
On the other, they fear the recovery will revive wage demands from trade
unions forced to accept real income losses over the past two years, and ease
the pressure on the government to cut spending and curb its borrowing
requirement, and on industry to reduce plant-level costs.
'It is still not 12 months since Germany was gripped in a mood of deep
foreboding about the future,' the German Industry Federation (BDI) said this
week. The severe recession had exposed more than ever the symptoms of
competitive weakness in the German economy, and unleashed a national debate
on how to revive the country's competitive advantage.
Yet this autumn, the mood has already been transformed to one of optimism,
with all the economic statistics confirming the recovery process, including
increased industrial orders, a recovery of manufacturing production, and a
strong growth in exports, the traditional motor of the German economy.
'The optimism is certainly exaggerated, if it means that sections of
industry which were classified only a few months ago as the sickest parts of
the economy are today being seen as the standard-bearers of a new upswing,'
the BDI thundered. 'The structural crisis of German industry is not and was
not simply a figment of the imagination, but a very real challenge.'
The message from the BDI, reflecting similar fears at the German employers'
federation (BDA), is clearly to cool it, election or not. But the other big
national lobby for the business community, the German chambers of commerce
and industry (DIHT), is altogether more sanguine.
'I have been accused of talking the economy up,' Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the
president of the DIHT, said yesterday. 'But the results of our surveys
confirmed it.

FT  23 SEP 94 / EU launches debate on new rules for IT: Talks open today on
how the single market will cope with the surge in information technology
</HEADLINE>

A crucial debate on the future of the European single market opens in
Germany today as ministers launch talks on how to handle the expected
explosion in information technology.
The outcome will shape the development of information services such as
interactive television, computer-learning and electronic banking across the
European Union, areas still seen as the missing link in the single market.
The argument today revolves around whether existing rules on the free
movement of goods and services and mutual recognition of other countries'
rules can provide the right framework for investment in information
technology or whether there is a need for supra-national regulation.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the European Commissioner responsible for the
single market, is expected to argue that present legislation is adequate in
most areas and that there is no need for a centralised European regulatory
authority.
Four areas - the protection of intellectual property rights, data
protection, encryption and media concentration - have been pinpointed as
needing special attention and legislation is being prepared.
However, this week the European Commission backed away from proposals to
harmonise laws on media ownership, worried that European-wide action could
trigger a backlash among member states.
The debate on the future of the service sector has also revealed an
ideological faultline inside the commission.
Officials responsible for the single market believe that too much regulation
risks fragmenting the market and creating an inflexible environment for
investment.
However, an action plan stemming from a report by Mr Martin Bangemann, the
industry commissioner, on the information society, talks of the need to
establish an authority at a European level.
'Whilst fully respecting the subsidiarity principle, the commission will
launch in-depth studies to examine institutional aspects and to see which
activities at present exercised by the member states and the commission
might be entrusted to such an authority,' says the report.
Those responsible for industry and telecommunications in the commission are
said to be uneasy about seeing the information society develop in a
relatively unregulated fashion. However, they deny there is any difference
within the commission about how best to proceed, arguing that the way ahead
is laid out clearly in Mr Bangemann's action plan, and that the most
pressing need is to present industry with a consistent approach.
Another argument is over how much emphasis should be put on protecting
consumers of the new services offered by the information superhighways
against the providers.
'We want to achieve an internal market in information services,' said an
official from the directorate responsible for the single market. 'To do
that, you need to have a balanced approach that takes into account all
groups involved - industry, users, rights holders and consumers - and not
just industry.'
The debate comes as officials and ministers, generally satisfied that goods
are moving freely around the community, have realised the need to focus on
the potential economic benefits from the free movement of services,
particularly information services, across the borders of the 12 member
states.

FT  23 SEP 94 / World Bank plans Dollars 165m operating budget cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The World Bank plans to cut its operating budget by about Dollars 165m
(Pounds 104m) over the next two years in response to calls for a leaner
organisation.
Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, has asked his vice-presidents to
propose administration cuts averaging 6 per cent in the fiscal year starting
July 1, and as much again in the following year.
Like other - all smaller - multilateral development banks, such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank has been
under attack for its high salaries and rich lifestyle. This year it
abandoned first-class air travel in response to criticism.
But senior officials of the Bank - which is based in Washington and lends
more than Dollars 9bn a year to finance development projects in the third
world and eastern Europe - say Mr Preston has suggested the cut not to curb
conspicuous consumption but as a means of getting staff to become more
selective in their activities.
The proposal is already fuelling friction between some industrialised
countries - especially the UK, Canada, Australia and the US - which have
long argued that there is plenty of fat to trim, and borrower countries,
which fear that cuts might jeopardise the quality of services.
The World Bank's administrative budget has climbed by 32 per cent over the
past three years to about Dollars 1.4bn for the fiscal year that began in
July. The proposed cuts would reduce spending to just above the fiscal 1993
level.
World Bank officials said the proposal was Mr Preston's and had not been
sought by the board of executive directors who represent shareholding
countries.
Each vice-president receives a cash budget, and could choose to cut staff
numbers, curb travel costs or delay equipment purchases.
Operational divisions have been asked to propose a cut of 5 per cent in each
year, and support divisions a 6.5 per cent cut each year. The cuts are not
final, and may be adjusted as the budget is developed over the next few
months.
'The majority of the board feels we really have to be very careful about
this because the bank does a lot,' said Mrs Eveline Herfkens, a World Bank
executive director from the Netherlands, who represents a constituency of
borrowing countries from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
'If we want to continue to do what our shareholders want us to do, there is
very little room to cut,' she said. More junior bank project managers also
expressed concern that the budget cuts might could make it harder for them
to fulfil Mr Preston's requirement that they should spend more time putting
projects into practice.
Other present and former officials say the bank is still only minimally
conscious of costs. Mr Frank Potter, a former Canadian executive director,
says continued increases in the bank's benefits package have 'led to a
structure in which no single benefit is outrageous but in which the
aggregate amounts to a cost burden which no private institution I know of
could afford'.
Other bank officials say the steady increases in its operating budgets,
although fuelled in part by rising demand for its services in new member
countries in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, were causing 'donor
fatigue' at a time when virtually every government is forced to trim its own
aid budget.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Unilever concedes detergent damaged clothing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Unilever yesterday admitted that its revolutionary detergent launched this
spring under the names Persil Power and Omo Power was 'defective'.
The detergent has been at the centre of an acrimonious row between Unilever
and Procter &amp; Gamble, its US arch rival in the Pounds 6bn a year European
detergent market, following claims that it damaged some types of clothing in
repeated high temperature washing.
Its formula was revised and a new version launched in June.
'We made a mistake. We launched a product which had a defect which we had
not detected,' Mr Morris Tabaksblat, co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, said. The re-launched product had remedied the problem, he
added.
In the first explanation by a senior executive of the problems, Mr
Tabaksblat said: 'I think we were very enthusiastic about an exciting new
product . . . and did not look closely enough at the negatives. Somewhere
between research and marketing, something went wrong . . . under the normal
pressure to be first to the market.'
The detergent, sold under the Persil name in Britain but as Omo on the
Continent, contains manganese catalyst 'accelerator'. This was found to
react badly to certain dyes in extreme conditions. The reformulated version
uses less accelerator.
The flaw was first publicised by Procter &amp; Gamble which discovered it in its
own tests. It has used the defect to attack Unilever unmercilessly in the
media and the market place.
Mr Tabaksblat was speaking in Beijing on the eve of the opening of
Unilever's Walls ice-cream plant in the city and the announcement of the
company's eighth joint venture which will become its second detergent
business in China.
He said one key issue appeared to be a lack of 'appropriate safeguards' in
tests before the launch.
At high temperature and with repeated use, the manganese catalyst reacted
badly with certain new textile dyes, which 'were not in our test battery'.
However, he expressed full confidence in Unilever's researchers. All
detergents caused some minor damage to clothes after repeated washings.
The Dutch consumers' association said last week its own tests on the new
formula still caused unacceptable damage to clothes and it was no more
effective than cheaper detergents.

FT  23 SEP 94 / British and US jets strike at Bosnian Serbs: Nato hits back
after attacks on UN troops
</HEADLINE>

British and US jets attacked a Bosnian Serb tank west of Sarajevo yesterday
after United Nations peacekeeping troops twice came under Serbian fire.
It was the fourth Nato attack on Bosnian Serb positions since UN troops were
deployed and reflected international exasperation with violations of a
weapons-free zone around the Bosnian capital.
The Nato retaliation was led by a US A-10 jet which strafed the Serbian tank
and was followed by two British Jaguars which dropped bombs on the position,
Nato officials said. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned in
Washington of more Nato air strikes if Bosnian Serbs violated exclusion
zones or attacked UN peacekeepers. But the Bosnian Serb army denounced the
air strike and said it reserved the right to attack Nato and UN
peacekeepers.
Earlier, a French armoured personnel carrier was hit by Bosnian Serb forces
as it monitored an exchange of fire between Bosnian Serb and Moslem-led
Bosnian forces near Sarajevo. One UN soldier was injured.
General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia,
defended the Nato action, saying the Serb attack on the French armoured
vehicle had been deliberate.
Gen Rose said the Serbs had one tank left in the weapons exclusion zone
around Sarajevo and that was chosen as the target. In his view, the strike
was a proportionate reaction to the Bosnian Serb attacks.
The air strike is the latest sign that the allies are taking a firmer stance
towards former Yugoslavia. Nato, urged on by the US, has been pressing hard
in recent days for a more vigorous effort to counter the Bosnian Serbs, who
have rejected an international peace plan.
The US administration has promised the powerful pro-Bosnian lobby in
Congress that it will start moves to lift the UN arms embargo against Bosnia
unless the Serbs accept the peace plan by October 15. European governments
have warned the US that that might lead to a disastrous escalation of
fighting.
The White House, which disclosed news of yesterday's air raid, has been
pressing for tougher enforcement of existing policies in Bosnia. General
Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said the
air strike was a 'proportionate' reaction to the Serb attack.
Senior Nato officials have asked the UN for a stricter interpretation of the
rules under which heavy weapons in Sarajevo and the enclave of Gorazde - and
any forces that attack the UN anywhere in Bosnia - are subject to air
strikes.
UN commanders say they are better judges than Nato of when air strikes are
appropriate. However, yesterday's action seemed to have the full support of
both international organisations.
