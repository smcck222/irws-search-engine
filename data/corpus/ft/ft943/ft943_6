FT  23 SEP 94 / Ashdown hints at closer Labour links
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday signalled his hopes that the Liberal Democrats
would provide the reforming edge in a post-election partnership with the
Labour party.
In a coded message to Labour leader Tony Blair, Mr Ashdown said the Liberal
Democrats had 'enough confidence in our own strength to make common cause
with others to achieve the best for the future'.
The government after the next election should be one in which the Liberal
Democrats provided key policies.
Addressing the party conference at Brighton, the Liberal Democrat leader
said the party's 'historic role' was to act as the catalyst for
constitutional change in Britain. That meant dismantling the 'centralised
state' and introducing proportional representation.
But Mr Ashdown (pictured with his wife, Jane, after his speech) ducked an
explicit offer of an anti-Tory pact and gave no details of his strategy to
secure closer co-operation with Labour.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Troubled Credit Lyonnais delays results for first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French state-controlled banking group,
surprised the markets by postponing publication of its results for the first
half of 1994 yesterday. The move aroused fears about additional provisions
still required to cover its heavy losses.
The bank said the results were unlikely to be released for several days as a
result of a board decision pending completion of 'certain analyses' in
progress.
Officials close to the bank said the delay was caused by a failure to
complete discussions with the government about the way in which extra
financial support should be provided.
News of the postponement helped to prompt a sharp fall in price of the
group's non-voting shares and reinforced speculation about substantial
additional provisions that may be required as part of its restructuring.
Credit Lyonnais lost FFr6.9bn (Pounds 820m) last year, one of the biggest
losses in French corporate history. In July, the bank was the subject of a
highly critical report from the government.
The bank admitted that the delay in producing its results was
'embarrassing'. However, it emphasised that it still had the full support of
the government.
Mr Jean Sassure, a banking analyst with Societe Generale in Paris, said
Credit Lyonnais could not cover its bad debts without additional government
support, and estimated that special additional restructuring provisions for
the first half of the year would exceed FFr10bn.
The delay is understood to have been caused less by the government's
refusing to accept the inclusion of extra provisions than by difficulties in
finalising the way in which additional support should be provided - through
cash, guarantees or other methods.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman appointed by the government, has been
holding a series of discussions with ministers in preparation for the
announcement of the bank's restructuring. The announcement is expected
before the end of the year.
As far back as June, the directors had scheduled a board meeting and
publication of the results for yesterday.
A decision was finally taken to postpone only on Wednesday, when it became
clear that not all details had been agreed. The delay may be for at least
two weeks.
Credit Lyonnais's certificats d'investissement - the only ones traded -
closed 5.6 per cent down at FFr401. After the company's announcement, they
reached a low for the year at one point of FFr390, down 7.05 per cent.
Earlier, Mr Peyrelevade had predicted that the banking group would break
even in the second half of this year and return to profit in 1995. It is
likely to have to make further provisions for doubtful loans and investments
by its Althus and SDBO subsidiaries.

FT  23 SEP 94 / Bossi challenge over state TV
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The populist Northern League plans a move that could oust the new government
appointees brought in to run the RAI, Italy's state broadcasting
organisation. The League yesterday unveiled a plan to introduce a
legislative amendment that would oblige the two-month-old board to resign
and allow appointment of fresh management by parliament. The League was
angered by the way the board of directors, headed by Mrs Letizia Moratti, a
former stockbroker, changed the entire editorial management of the three
television channels over the weekend with any reference to the existing
editorial teams.
Other members of the government dismissed the League's protests as pique
over having failed to get any of its own editorial nominees appointed at
RAI. Although this may be close to the truth, Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's
leader, has consistently expressed concern over prime minister Silvio
Berlusconi's ability to control both commercial and public broadcasting. Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest empire includes three channels controlling over 80
per cent of commercial television.
The League has some leverage because next month the government will need to
endorse a decree providing ongoing funding for the RAI. The League is
attaching its amendment to this decree. The amendment could pass if the
opposition decides to make common cause with the League. Staff at the RAI
are threatening further industrial action in the wake of Tuesday's 24-hour
strike in protest against the new appointments.

FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mobilfunk partners to increase
holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial partners in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the mobile telephone
concern, are to increase their holdings with the purchase of a 10.35 per
cent stake currently held by the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, DG Bank.
No information was available yesterday on the terms of the deal, although
the Mannesmann group, which owns 51 per cent of the business, said the stake
was expected to be shared among the partners in proportion to their existing
holdings.
This would give the German consortium leader a further 6.45 per cent.
AirTouch of San Francisco would take 3.3 per cent with the balance of about
0.6 per cent going to Cable &amp; Wireless.
Mobilfunk is the leading private mobile phone company in Germany.
After making its first profits in the first half of this year, it now has
well over 700,000 subscribers, and according to some estimates could have 1m
customers by Christmas.
The agreement coincided with confirmation that the German government will
press European Union partners to fix a date for free competition on European
networks at a joint meeting of industry and telecommunications ministers in
Brussels on September 28.
If there was still no agreement at a meeting of post and telecoms ministers
booked for November 11, the German group would consider going it alone,
according to a joint statement from Bonn's research, post and economics
ministries.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post minister, has said Germany might liberalise its
network on January 1, 1998, the date set for deregulating EU services.
The government has been convinced by private sector lobbyists that open
competition in data and telephone communications networks will provide
thousands of urgently-needed jobs.

American Airlines is considering buying up to 50 Canadair Regional Jets from
Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, to re-equip
three of its four fully-owned feeder lines, say US aircraft industry
sources.
The 50-seater RJ sells for about USDollars 20m. RJs are flying with Delta
Airline's feeders Comair and Skywest. The RJ launch customer was Lufthansa's
regional unit and several European airlines use the aircraft.
American Airlines would not comment on the reports. In Montreal, Bombardier
said it has had discussions with American Airlines but 'no active
negotiations are on the way at present'.
Avmark, the US aviation marketing and management group, said an American
Airlines deal for the RJ has been rumoured for two months.

<TEXT>
MVM Rt, the main operating subsidiary of Hungary's state electricity
monopoly, has reported pre-tax profit of Ft2.379bn (Dollars 22.03m) on
turnover of Ft52.78bn for the first half of 1994.
The company, which is due to be partly privatised by the middle of next
year, is expecting pre-tax profit of Ft1.4bn on turnover of Ft107.81bn for
the year, up from Ft329m on turnover of Ft101.4bn in 1993.
However, this year's turnover could rise by Ft22.7bn if, as expected,
electricity prices, presently 40-60 per cent of western European levels, are
increased by 30 per cent in October.
The rises are designed to make the company more attractive ahead of
privatisation. The government and AV Rt, the privatisation body, which is
being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, are due to
make a decision on the sell-off within the next month.
Under the plan being considered, the state would sell stakes in MVM's power
generation and distribution subsidiaries. MVM's nuclear plant and the
national grid would remain 100 per cent state-owned. The state is expected
to announce tenders this autumn for minority stakes in five of the country's
six household gas distribution companies.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus shares fall sharply
after warning on second half

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, fell sharply
yesterday, losing FFr25 to FFr874, following a fall in first-half profits
and a warning on full-year results.
Mr Claude Ravilly, finance director, told a meeting of financial analysts
that full-year net profits would be in the region of FFr900m (Dollars
167.91m) compared with FFr1.2bn last year and original estimates of FFr1bn
for 1994.
His comments followed the announcement on Tuesday night of first-half
results, which showed a 25.6 per cent decline to FFr503m. Revenues rose from
FFr4.28bn to FFr4.58bn.
According to Canal Plus, the decline in profits reflected losses from
associated companies, a swing from net interest income to net interest costs
arising from depressed financial markets, and the impact of promotional
campaigns.
It said first-half trends in revenues, operating income and net income are
likely to remain in the second half. Net income will continue to be affected
by the cost of new projects, notably in Germany, where a major promotional
campaign, unforeseen at the start of the year, is under way.
According to Canal Plus, net income will also be affected if financial
markets maintain their current direction. A supplementary charge of about
FFr100m is also expected to be taken, partly to cover a rise in costs at the
company's Spanish channel, Canal Plus Espagne.
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the recently merged French stores group, said
first-half net profit rose to FFr407m compared with FFr189m a year earlier,
agencies report from Paris.
The company added that it would sell 1.28m shares next week in a public sale
to part-finance the acquisition of a stake in FNAC, the French specialist
retailer. Pinault has had the shares on its books as treasury stock.

The Social Democratic-led Danish government of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was
last night set to remain in office despite a strong performance by the
rightwing opposition Liberal party in the general election, according to
exit polls on Danish television.
The two polls indicated Mr Rasmussen's four-party coalition would lose its
one-seat majority in the Folketing (parliament), slipping from 91 seats to
80. But it would still be strong enough to stay in power with the backing of
the leftwing Socialist People's party which was predicted to hold up to 14
seats.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberal party was set to achieve the greatest
gains. The polls indicated it would increase its representation from 29
seats to about 40, overtaking the Conservative party as the second biggest
party after the Social Democrats.
Mr Rasmussen's Social Democrats were seen losing eight or nine of the 69
seats they won in the last election in 1990. But the combined strength of
the Liberals and Conservatives, and their rightwing ally, the Progress
party, still only amounted to about 76 seats, according to the polls, well
short of the backing needed to form a government.
The polls predicted the Conservatives and the Progress party would each lose
several seats.
A new entry to the Folketing was set to be the Unity List, an extreme
leftwing and anti-European Union party, which could win up to six seats.
The Social Democrats came to power, after 10 years in opposition, without an
election in January 1993 when a Conservative-led government, headed by Mr
Poul Schluter, resigned in a scandal over government treatment of Tamil
refugees. Three small centre parties - the Radical Liberals, the Centre
Democrats and the Christian People's party - switched from supporting Mr
Schluter to Mr Rasmussen and have stayed loyal to the prime minister in this
election.
During the election campaign, Mr Rasmussen said he wanted to spend more on
Denmark's already generous welfare system.
A decade of budgetary restraint under centre-right governments during the
1980s and early 1990s saw Denmark bring its public finances under control.
Although government spending equals 64 per cent of gross domestic product,
the budget deficit stands at a 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
But the high level of government outlays requires Danes to pay more in taxes
than any other industrialised country.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Nato diplomats impatient at UN caution in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato ambassadors yesterday decided to extend air cover by alliance aircraft
beyond Bosnia to a small part of Croatia near the Bihac enclave. This means
that in principle alliance aircraft could carry out bombing raids against
Serb positions in Croatia if the Serbs were attacking UN forces around the
Bihac enclave in Bosnia.
The alliance ambassadors agreed that air cover could be extended to the
whole of Croatia, but that would require a more complex operation involving
the UN authorities in Zagreb.
Yesterday's decision falls short of the imposition of a draconian 'exclusion
zone' - where all heavy weapons are subject to air strikes. Any move in that
direction would require a fresh UN resolution.
However, diplomats said that even limited Nato air raids on Serb positions
in Croatia could mark an important ist in the conflict.
Yesterday's meeting in Brussels was the latest in a series of moves towards
a tougher Bosnian policy that has been taken at alliance headquarters, where
frustration over the cautious tactics of UN commanders on the ground is
growing.
The meeting took place amid pressure from US officials for a toughening of
the application of existing policies in Bosnia, including the commitment to
maintain six enclaves or 'safe havens' for the government side.
They say this is the minimum needed to parry pressure in the US Congress for
a unilateral break by Washington with the international peace effort and
stronger efforts to assist the Moslem cause.
Bihac has been at the centre of a bitter upsurge in fighting over the past
weeks, with Bosnia's Moslem-led government making spectacular gains against
the Serbs and driving the local warlord, Fikret Abdic, out of his
stronghold.
Fighting has spilled over into Croatia.
Further reverses for the Serbs in the Bihac area would deepen the isolation
of the Bosnian Serbs, who are facing a cut-off in support from their kinsmen
in Belgrade.
Earlier this week, Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, raised
eyebrows at alliance headquarters by threatening to call down Nato air
strikes against Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo, whom he accused of
provocation.
Nato officials have said that air raids against the government forces could
provoke a bitter political reaction, especially in the US.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Exit polls indicate greatest gains for Danish Liberals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal party leader Uffe Elleman-Jensen jokes with an election official
before casting his vote yesterday in the Danish general election. Exit polls
on Danish television indicated his party would achieve the greatest gains,
taking its representation up from 29 seats to about 40, to become the second
biggest party after the Social Democrats.
Despite the strong performance by the rightwing Liberals the Social
Democratic-led government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was set to remain in
office even though it looked likely from the exit polls it would need the
backing of the leftwing Socialist People's party to remain in power.

FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone shares continued their recovery, and were given a push yesterday by
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, who said the stock would respond very quickly
to sharply increased subscriber numbers for the third quarter, expected on
October 3.
Hoare's telecoms team is looking for Vodafone to announce a customer base of
some 120,000, more than twice that of the same time last year. The broker
described Vodafone shares as 'very cheap' and said it expected the stock to
respond vigorously to an expected bout of buying intertest from UK
institutions.
US selling, which has been strongly evident in recent weeks, has largely
dried up, dealers said.
Vodafone shares edged up 3 to 186 1/2 p, after 188p, with turnover reaching
4.6m.
Northern Electricity was the star turn in a generally strong Recs sector,
the shares racing up 19 to 813p after the company activated its share buy
back programme. BZW, Northern's broker, was said to have bought in around
10m shares but was acting as an agent for the group in a move seen by
dealers as a tender offer.
The Northern buy back offer, was viewed by marketmakers as a big switching
operation and especially lucrative for the market's big gross funds. Other
buy back moves yesterday included South Wales acquiring 225,000 shares at
817p.
Barclays Bank shares took a drubbing in the general market malaise, sliding
10 1/2 to 567 1/2 p; stories circulating in the stockmarket suggested that
the bank had moved recently to curtail its lending to property and building
companies, a move which prompted fears that the bank may have suffered a
further wave of losses in those areas.
Standard Chartered was one of the few strong performers in the sector, with
dealers talking of a chart break out for the stock.
Big falls in international bond and equity markets across the globe
triggered a fresh spate of concerns that many of the UK's big trading houses
could have come unstuck during the turbulent trading period. SG Warburg,
always viewed as the UK's leading integrated securities house, dropped 20 to
711p. Smith New Court, the London market's premier marketmaking firm,
slipped 8 to 416p.
Lingering fears that Commercial Union's rights issue might have run into
problems dragged CU shares down 13 to 488p and the nil-paids 13 to 15p.
A move to stem speculation over its interest in Scott Paper subsidiary SD
Warren pushed up market confidence in Arjo Wiggins and the shares improved
12 to 263p.
Arjo said that it would only be interested in acquiring a part of the
company in a joint venture with a US company rather than the whole.
After recent weakness in the stock, investors were pleased that any
large-scale dilution, which would be caused by a big purchase, was no longer
a concern.
Merger and acquisitions speculation continues to preoccupy the
pharmaceuticals sector, with most analysts concurring that in several years
there will be fewer drugs companies.
Compatibility between Zeneca and Wellcome, and the fact that there would be
little product overlap, is fuelling market talk of a merger between the two,
according to one analyst. Zeneca lost 9 to 833p and Wellcome gave up 10 to
689p.
Contract distribution shares were the feature of the transport sector with
Tillett and Britten tumbling 42 to 768p following a bleakish half-year
report.
A slip of 16 sent shares in Thorn EMI down to 972p as talk circulated of a
large line of stock hanging over the market. A seller was said to have
tested the water but marketmakers were reluctant to take on the block and
the price marked down.
The unwinding of a bull position was said to have been partly responsible
for a tumble in the price of BOC Group. The shares lost 14 to 709p.
Against prevailing weakness in the chemicals sector Courtaulds managed to
close the day unchanged at 471p albeit in thin volume as sentiment begins to
grow that the shares have been oversold.
The share price upset at BAe washed over on to Aerostructures Hamble, the
former BAE unit floated in June at 120p. The company gets around 80 per cent
of turnover from BAe and the shares crashed 50 to 73p.

FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace swung about wildly, trading 9.5m shares following harsh
profit downgrades from a number of major securities houses in the wake of
the company's half-year results.
The shares closed a full 26 lower at 445p after a low point at one stage in
the morning session of 439p as selling came close to panic levels.
BAe's interim figures were broadly in line with market hopes and the interim
dividend gain was above expectations. But analysts departed from a morning
meeting with the company's management in troubled mood.
BZW was among the most bearish, downgrading its pre-tax profits forecast for
1994 from Pounds 175m to Pounds 105m. Most securities houses are now clearly
concerned about BAe's potential for a severe near term squeeze on cash-flow.

FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bullish views on Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least two of the market's leading broking houses, notably BZW and Lehman
Bros were promoting British Gas shares yesterday, driving the stock price up
3 to 304p on relatively heavy turnover of 8.1m shares ahead of the strategy
meeting scheduled for September 29.
BZW, in a 50-page circular on the stock, described Gas as having the 'lowest
political risk of all utilities'; that 'its current cost cutting plans and
growing exploration and production profits will support five to seven per
cent nominal dividend growth per annum'; that its extra cost cutting and
cut-backs in capital expenditure; and that four of BZW's valuation methods
suggest 10 per cent upside in the stock.
Other energy specialists, however, said the shares had moved high enough in
the short term. One said that the market had become fixated with dividend
policy which may not be forthcoming in the September 29 meeting. 'If the
market doesn't hear what it wants,to hear on September 29, the shares are
heavily overbought,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback follows US housing
statistics - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate prospects continued to overshadow UK equities yesterday and a
brief rally was sharply reversed after Wall Street and US Federal bonds
reacted to an unexpected rise in the latest statistics on US housing starts.
Markets focused unhappily on the chances of a rise in US rates at next
week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.
The reversal of the market's trend in the second half of the session blotted
out an optimistic response to the news that growth in German M3 money supply
had moderated to 8.2 per cent in August, thus cooling, at least temporarily,
fears that the Bundesbank might feel obliged to tighten rates. An
improvement in UK government bonds had been largely eliminated by the close.
At the final reading of 3,014.8, the FT-SE 100 Share Index showed a further
loss of 22.5 points. Although trading volume was not heavy, the mood of the
market appeared to become more gloomy yesterday.
Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London securities house, sharply cut its
forecast for 1995 UK corporate earnings to only 8 per cent - now the lowest
in the City and barely half that of the consensus prediction. Mr Edmond
Warner of Kleinwort fears that profit forecasts from market analysts will
soon be tilted towards profits downgrades, as cost and pricing pressures
affect company earnings. Kleinwort has trimmed 1994 growth earnings
forecasts for non-financial companies from 17 per cent to 15 per cent.
The Confederation of British Industries, predicting some slowdown from the
consumer side, forecast growth of around 2.5 per cent in domestic GDP next
year, slightly under forecasts from the UK Treasury. There were also
suggestions in the stock market than one of the largest lenders to the
property and building industries was reining in loan policies to the sector.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 14.4 to 3,570.1. Another sizeable trading
programme, weighted to the sell side and covering a wide range of Footsie
and non-Footsie stocks was reported. The previous session featured a similar
sell programme, and there have been suggestions that fund managers,
particularly from continental Europe have been switching out of UK equities
and into British government bonds. Some analysts believe that domestic
conditions are ripe for a rally in the UK gilt-edged market, although the
worries over the outlook for rates in the US and Germany is seen as a severe
problem for UK gilt yields. One analyst urged equity investors to 'pray'
that value in the gilt-edged market is realised.
However, Seaq volume of 594.8m shares yesterday was not unduly heavy, and
compared with 602.8m on Tuesday. Retail, or genuine customer interest in UK
equities, was worth Pounds 1.33bn on Tuesday, implying persistent, if not
heavy, trading by the big investment funds.
The market was hit by weakness in British Aerospace after the half time
report found little favour with sector analysts. The dollar stocks gave
ground as the UK market kept a close eye on the Dow Industrial Average,
which was 19 points down in UK hours, following its heavy setback in the
previous session.
The general picture was fairly gloomy at the close, with only handful of
special situations offering relief from the generally red picture on the
screens in the City trading rooms.
Strategists said that worries over the near term outlook for interest rates
in the US are now likely to dominate a stock market increasingly nervous
about the dangers that domestic base rates might be forced higher again
before the end of the year. Doubts over UK company earnings prospects will
also unsettle investors as the market moves into the final quarter of the
year.

FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures spent a volatile day, trading within a range of no less
than 37 points in medium volume that was nearly 4,000 lots down on Tuesday.
At the close the FT-SE December contract was 3,018, against 3,046 a day
earlier for a premium to the cash market of four points. The fair value
premium was around 17 points.
The contract opened comfortably higher at 3,052 only to drift lower
throughout most of the morning session. Then Wall Street bonds opened in
bleak mood and a number of big sellers moved in.
The low point of the day - 3,015 - was touched just in front of the close
and was enough to tempt a smattering of buyers to lever the contract off its
bottom.
Trading volume was not heavy as the day's price movements might suggest with
activity extending to 13,799 lots, against 17,553 on Tuesday.
In contrast activity, in traded options was almost match for the previous
day at 37,003 lots, against 39,646. FT-SE volume accounted for more than
half the total but Euro FT-SE business was a desultory 1,481 lots.
The most actively traded individual stock option was British Steel with
2,600 lots, well ahead of Euro FT-SE. British Gas traded 1,069 lots and
Sears 1,060.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: FT-Actuaries World Indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At its last quarterly meeting, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee
noted the growing number of companies choosing to separate their
registration, tax domicile, share pricing, business and stock market listing
into different countries. If a sufficient number of large companies can be
found that individually satisfy the FT-AWI eligibility criteria, the
Committee may consider establishing an International index, allowing such
companies to be included in the World Index, although not in any of the
existing country indices. The Committee would welcome comments.
The Committee ratified its previously announced clarification of the
guidelines regarding treatment of certain government holdings in companies.
This will be applied with effect from October 1.
A change has been proposed (subject to confirmation) in the procedures
governing the FT-AWI Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices. Currently new
constituents are ranked as Large or Medium-Small on the date that they are
added to the Index. This makes it impossible to preannounce Large and
Medium-Small Cap Indices changes when this is done for the main FT-AWI
series. In order to give users of the Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices the
same notice as users of the other FT-AWI indices, the following amendments
are proposed:
1. Rank stocks before their effective addition date. These rankings would be
'official' and would not change, regardLess of changes in market
capitalisation between the ranking date and the addition date.
2. We currently use a 15-day notice period for the semi-annual re-balancing.
However, the changes are implemented 15 days after the beginning of the
quarter (January 15 and July 15), leaving no way to preannounce the rankings
for the regular quarterly changes.
3. To address this issue, the semi-annual re-balancings for the Large and
Medium-Small Cap Indices will be moved from January and July to March and
September, with the changes effective from April 1 and October 1. This will
enable us to preannounce the constituent changes to the Large and
Medium-Small Cap Indices. Other constituent changes in the main series of
indices will carry an indication of Large or Medium-Small Cap
classification. If implemented, the effect of the change would be to omit
the January re-balancing for 1995 and to carry out the first semi-annual
re-balance on the new basis in March 1995.
The following constituent changes to the Indices were agreed following full
market reviews, to take effect on October 3 1994:
France. Additions: Credit Local de France; Christian Dior; Poliet; Lagardere
Group; Castorama DuBois; Cap Gemini Sogeti; Sidel. Deletions: Elf-Aquitaine
(certs.); Salins du Midi; Radiotechnique.
Netherlands. Deletions: AMEV; New Rothmans Units; Central Suiker (CSM);
Gist-Brocades; Nutricia; Nedlloyd Group; Pakhoed Holding; Fokker.
New Zealand. Additions: Fernz; Ceramco; Progressive Enterprises; Skellerup
Group. Deletions: DB Group; Tasman Properties; Wilson Neil; Corporate
Investments.
Spain. Addition: Fomento de Construc y Contra. Deletions: Duro Felguero;
Agroman; General de Aguas de Barcelona; Union y Fenix; Esp. a. Tudor. Change
to capitalisation weighting: Banco Exterior 100 per cent (from 49 per cent).
The Committee confirmed that Thailand and Brazil will be added to the World

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities slip back as
pessimism prevails

Wall Street
US stocks extended their losses yesterday as pessimism over monetary policy
continued to dominate investment strategies, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.49 lower at 3,851.60, having
recovered from a 47-point deficit at mid-afternoon. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.9 at 461.46. Volume on the Big Board was
heavy, with 354m shares traded by the close.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 3.38 weaker at
454.77, and the Nasdaq composite was off 6.04 at 760.70.
Bargain hunters were in short supply at the opening, despite a 67-point
tumble by the Dow the previous session. Amid the current uncertainty over
interest rates, investors were unable to stem the losing tide.
On balance, the day's economic news was neutral for stocks. The commerce
department said August housing starts had risen by 2.1 per cent, surprising
analysts who were expecting a small decline. But economists later explained
away the increase as a reflection of activity in the multi-family sector.
Single-family starts, viewed as a more accurate barometer, were down last
month.
Equity investors again interpreted the data through its impact on bond
prices. Initially, the announcement of the headline figure send Treasuries
into retreat. Stocks took the bait and plunged.
After the data had been interpreted, bonds quickly pulled back to within a
few ticks of their starting point. The Dow industrials followed suit.
By early afternoon, however, the blue chip index was still showing solid
losses, as investors tried to calculate the odds on whether the Federal
Reserve policy would remain on hold until after the November elections.
Mr Wayne Angell, chief economist for Bear Stearns and a former Fed governor,
came out on the side of those betting on an early move, saying there was a
60 per cent chance the central bank would decide to tighten at its September
27 policy meeting.
With such speculation afoot, the market's negative tone would not budge. The
Dow industrials plunged anew, only to retrace their steps for a second time.
By the close, Caterpillar had slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/8 ,
Kodak fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 3/4 and General Motors dropped Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 48 5/8 . The session's biggest loser was Maybelline, whose
share prices plunged 24 per cent, or Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 .
Banco Wiese climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 in its debut session. It
become the first Peruvian stock to be listed on the NYSE with its IPO of
2.4m shares.
On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development led the technology sector's slide. The
stock fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/2 after Mr Timothy McCollum, an analyst
at Dean Witter Reynolds, warned that lacklustre European sales could depress
third-quarter results.
Canada
Toronto prices staged a late-session rally, but still closed lower in
moderate trading, as the Toronto market once again followed the lead of its
slumping counterpart in New York.
The TSE 300 composite index fell 18.25 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at
4,358.62. Volume was 62.22m shares down from Tuesday's 65.58m, but trading
value rose to CDollars 976.8m from CDollars 973.1m.
Brazil
Sao Paulo stocks rallied as Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's running mate
appeared to be absolved of responsibility in an alleged kickback scheme, to
which news reports had linked him.
The exchange gained 1,662 points, or 3.2 per cent, to 53,435 points on the
Bovespa Index, up from Tuesday's 51,773. The Rio de Janeiro Exchange gained
413 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 19,553 points on the BVRJ Index.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris dips below 1,900 despite
M3 data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT and MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German M3 data lifted sentiment in the morning, countering Wall Street's
fall on Tuesday, but trading was generally nervous.
FRANKFURT saw a volatile day as the Dax index hit an early low of 2,079.50
before closing the official session just 0.54 ahead at 2,079.50.
The M3 data which was released early on had a positive impact on trading as
it came in much better than analysts' had been expecting.
The Bundesbank reported that German M3 money supply grew by an annualised
8.2 per cent in August, down from 9.8 per cent in July. Expectations had
been for an increase of between 8.5 to 9.0 per cent.
In the Ibis the Dax strengthened slightly to 2,067.17.
Turnover was DM6.5bn.
PARIS closed under the 1,900 level for the first time since the beginning of
July as fears that interest rates might have to rise throughout Europe
outweighed the better than expected German data.
The CAC-40 index retreated 22.07, or 1.15 per cent, to 1,897.18
Turnover was FFr3.53bn.
The budget did not cause a stir as most of the proposals had already been in
the market.
Eridania Beghin-Say lost FFr59 to FFr750 on news that the chairman was to
resign. The company also announced first half half results, which were at
the bottom end of expectations.
Canal Plus fell FFr25 to FFr874 on first half results released after the
close on Tuesday, which were down some 25 per cent and a forecast of a net
profit fall for the full year.
ZURICH marked time in moderate trading, supported by the German M3 data, but
awaiting further developments on Wall Street and the SMI index rose just 1.0
to 2,594.0.
Shares in Swiss Reinsurance jumped SFr23 or 3.8 per cent to SFr628 in heavy
turnover amid rumours that the company planned to sell its stake in Eliva
Swiss Insurance. Elvia put on SFr40 or 2.1 per cent to SFr1,910
Banks were mixed mixed, with SBC falling SFr2 to SFr373, but CS Holding,
which fell On Tuesday after news of its takeover bid for a regional Swiss
bank, picking up SFr1 to SFr549.
AMSTERDAM declined moderately but trading was slow. The AEX index finished
0.46 easier at 401.09.
Philips was the most actively traded stock, going against the trend with a
gain of 10 cents to Fl 54.80 in volume of some 1.5m shares.
Unilever, off 70 cents at Fl 194.00, was affected by reports of lower
domestic sales for its washing powders and the weaker dollar.
MILAN found corporate developments a welcome diversion from political and
budget considerations and the Comit index rose 4.91 to 678.34.
Italcementi was L180 better at L11,800 in the wake of Tuesday's
higher-than-expected first half results and Fondiaria dipped L25 to L11,755
after releasing first half figures that were in line with expectations.
Manufacturers were underpinned by strong June industrial sales and orders
figures. Fiat was up L77 at L6,694 and Pirelli rose L47 to L2,608. Olivetti,
under pressure in recent sessions, was L11 higher at L2,027 ahead of today's
first-half results.
BCI gained L89 or 2.3 per cent to L4,031 as the market registered its relief
that the L2,400bn rights issue had closed.
Insurers continued to gain on hopes that they would benefit from pensions
reform.
Generali closed L371 higher at L39,884, RAS was up L429 at L25,728 and Toro
was L210 higher at L27,520.
MADRID was lower in trader-dominated volatile activity as the market tracked
fluctuations in the dollar and bonds, and the general index was down 1.93 at
294.79 in turnover of Pta23.3bn.
DENMARK was holding its general election yesterday. Unibank Securities said
that it expected the outcome to be a Social Democratic government with or
without the participation of the Social Liberals. But political stability
could be affected by the inclusion of the Socialist People's party and the
Red/Green Alliance, making it more doubtful that major reforms could be
implemented.
The KFX index was down 0.54 at 96.45.
STOCKHOLM picked up from early losses but turned lower again late in the day
after Mr Ingvar Carlsson's announcement that he intended to form a minority
SDP government. The Affarsvarlden Index fell 12.60 to 1,420.2.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds take lead in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares took the lead for the second consecutive session encouraged by
the bullion price. But some industrials retreated on some big sell orders
and generally negative sentiment.
Brokers noted that gold shares were reluctant to move with the bullin price
at Dollars 393/94 and there was some selling into strength, but investors
began to pick up interest after midday when it went through Dollars 396.50.
By the close of trade, bullion was easier around Dollars 394/5.
September near-term futures still called the market substantially lower and
there was continued nervousness on lack of clear direction from
international markets.
The overall index shed 18 to 5,782. The industrial index lost 70 to 6,368
but the gold index was 38 up at 2,473.
In golds, Vaal Reefs gained R16 to R488 and Kloof added R1.75 to R71.75.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur records an
eight-month high
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by public funds, investment trusts and overseas investors countered
corporate selling and the Nikkei index gained ground in spite of the higher
yen and the overnight decline on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 48.11 to 19,885.38 after a high of 19,961.59 and a low
of 19,691.44. The index initially fell on worries which were triggered by
the yen's rise against the dollar and by declines in US stock and bond
prices.
Arbitrage unwinding coupled with selling by companies looking to boost their
interim earnings weighed on prices. However, postal savings and postal
insurance, together with investment trust funds, lifted the index in the
afternoon.
The US currency closed below the Y98 level for the first time in two months
in spite of heavy Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention. The dollar's
weakness was triggered by the larger than expected US trade deficit figures
released on Tuesday.
Volume rose to 380m shares against 342m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks added 4.85 to 1,585.96, while the Nikkei 300 rose 0.88 to
289.84. Advances led declines 546 to 458, with 182 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.00 to 1,296.33. Large capital
steels were traded actively amid profit taking by corporate investors and
buying by public funds and overseas investors. Nippon Steel, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y388 after hitting a year's high of Y390 and
NKK added Y5 to Y285.
Semiconductor related stocks were higher. Oki Electric rose Y16 to Y788. The
company had said earlier this week that its pre-tax profit would rise to a
record Y30bn thanks to firm sales of semiconductors and its rationalisation
programme.
Brokers were mixed. Yamaichi Securities fell Y11 to Y773 and Nikko retreated
Y10 to Y1,110 while Nomura Securities gained Y10 to Y2,120. After the market
closed, the Big Four and second tier brokers announced downward revisions of
interim earnings due to the lower than expected trading volume on the Tokyo
stock market.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 107.97 to 22,089.58 in volume of 462.7m
shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight fall dampened the mood in much of the region
although there were exceptions. Hong Kong and Seoul were closed for public
holidays.
KUALA LUMPUR was spurred to an eight-month high by gains in key blue chip
stocks, although the broader market was easier as investors locked in
profits.
The composite index closed 5.49 higher at 1,191.14, but falls led rises 287
to 156.
Volume was a heavy 585m shares as retail investors swarmed into
rumour-driven stocks. MBf Capital again led the pack on takeover rumours,
adding another 22 cents to MDollars 4.20 in volume of 50.9m shares.
Berjaya South Island jumped MDollars 9.30 or 62 per cent to MDollars 24.0,
after Tuesday's MDollars 2.70 advance, amid talk of a water sewage project.
SHANGHAI's volatile A share index surged 6.2 per cent in a technical rebound
after the heavy losses of the previous six sessions. The index put on 58.31,
through the 1,000 level, to finish at 1,003.22 in turnover of Yn3.92bn.
The day's star performer was Fuzhou Dong Jie Kou Department Store, up Yn1.90
or 17.6 per cent to Yn12.68 in huge volume of 7.12m shares.
Shanghai's B share index edged up 0.40 to 83.76 on very thin volume.
Shenzhen's A share index rose 10.51 or 4.9 per cent, to 227.04 but the B
market halted trading for the public holiday in Hong Kong.
BANGKOK rebounded from early falls amid buying of finance and communications
issues.
The SET index closed 1.93 higher at 1,531.98 after falling as low as
1,506.90.
Securities One soared Bt56 to Bt884 after announcing a capital increase.
SYDNEY was lower in line with Wall Street's overnight decline, and the All
Ordinaries index dropped 18.5 to 2,026.6, its lowest closing level since
July 14.
The media sector recorded heavy falls with News Corp 24 cents lower at
ADollars 8.21 after its ADRs fell in New York.
TAIPEI finished lower in active trade amid profit-taking on financials and
worries about uncertainty in overseas financial markets. The weighted index
ended 48.80 lower at 6,999.44, off a 7,092.06 high. Turnover was TDollars
64.3bn.
Elitegroup Computer rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 51 on its
debut.
MANILA was steady with mining issues rising to counter the downtrend in
commercial issues. The composite index settled 0.27 up at 2,920.46 in volume
that dropped to 2.5bn shares from Tuesday's 3.1bn.
Philex Mining led the mining issue rally as its share price jumped 3.9 per
cent to 2.70 pesos.
BOMBAY was led ahead by late buying by domestic mutual funds, which reversed
an easier trend during the first half of the session as Calcutta-based
traders liquidated holdings on the last day of their fortnightly account.
The BSE 30 share index, which had lost more than 120 points in the previous
two sessions, picked up 18.73 to 4,507.11.
The IFC weekly emerging markets table has been held over this week and will
be published tomorrow.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark stabilises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark strengthened against the dollar and the pound yesterday as
Germany's M3 money supply figures came in lower than expected, writes Motoko
Rich.
Against the dollar, the D-Mark finished in London at DM1.5449 from DM1.5508.
Against the pound, it closed in London at DM2.438, up from DM2.4446.
The US currency came under some pressure as US treasury bond markets
interpreted a higher than expected rise in housing starts as an indication
that an interest rate hike is imminent. In recent months, the bond markets
have been leading the dollar.
The dollar fluctuated against the yen in the face of a raft of ambivalent
comments from US officials about trade talks with Japan in advance of the
September 30 deadline for sanctions.
In London the dollar closed against the yen at Y97.70 from Y97.75.
The D-Mark turned in a strong performance, due in part to market relief that
the M3 money supply showed a slowdown in annualised growth. Some investors
had spent the past few days preparing for a rise.
The M3 grew an annualised 8.2 per cent in August, below the consensus
forecast of 8.9 per cent and below a year-on-year growth rate of 9.8 per
cent in July.
Following the release of the data, Bundesbank deputy president Mr Johann
Wilhelm Gaddum said he was confident that the pace of money supply growth
would continue to slow down.
While some economists warned that the Bundesbank could use this news as an
opportunity to raise rates, Mr Gaddum further calmed the markets when he
said: 'We cannot be satisfied with the current inflation rate.'
The markets took these comments as reassurance that the Bundesbank would not
soon move to cut interest rates. 'The market feels that the bottom in the
German interest rate cycle has been established,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon,
economist at Citibank.
Another factor helping the D-Mark was a general opinion poll taken by the
Allensbach opinion research group, which showed the liberal Free Democratic
party, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior coalition partner, currently enjoying
8.5 per cent support for its bid to return to the national parliament in
general elections in October.
Worries that a poor performance by the FDP would force a coalition between
Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Social Democratic party had
been rattling the markets. 'The markets have taken some comfort from the
poll and the D-Mark has regained its composure,' said Mr David Cocker,
economist at Chemical Bank.
The dollar traded within tight ranges, restrained by a 21.1 per cent rise in
US housing starts to 1.442m units, above the average forecast of 1.40m and
against revised July housing starts of 1.413m units.
Mr Cocker said: 'The strong housing starts seem to suggest that the amount
of Federal reserve tightening to date has not been sufficient and leads
markets to worry about inflation, which depresses bonds and leads to a
sell-off of dollars.'
The dollar bounced around against the yen after several US officials sounded
off about trade talks with Japan. US Commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown and Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, unsettled markets with vague
comments about the progress of talks.
But analysts were most impressed by Treasury Undersecretary Mr Lawrence
Summers, who warned that the dollar would not be a 'tool of trade policy'.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS said: 'If the trade
discussions were going badly, no US official would have gone as far as to
say that they are not talking the dollar lower.'
Sterling edged up against the dollar in response to better than forecast
non-European Union trade figures. The seasonally adjusted trade gap dropped
to Pounds 262m after a revised Pounds 384m in July. The consensus
expectation was for a rise to Pounds 500m.
In London, the pound closed against the dollar at Dollars 1.5781 from
Dollars 1.5764.
The UK currency was also helped by the minutes of the 28 July monthly
monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and
Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor, which suggested that interest
rates rises were being used as pre-emptive rather than reactive strikes
against inflation.
The Bank of England set a rate if 5 21/32 per cent on money market repos and
secured loan facilities commencing today, maturing on October 6 and October
20. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m, the bank provided Pounds
350m in liquidity at 5 5/8 per cent. Overnight rates traded between 3 1/2
and 5 1/4 per cent.
The September short sterling contract, which expired yesterday, traded 9,150
lots to settle at 94.06 from 94.03. The December contract traded 66,670 lots
to finish at 93.07 from 93.03.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stop-go producers put jute
workers through the mill - A West Bengal union is striving to get one of the
'black sheep' operations reopened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years anarchy has reigned in some jute mills in West Bengal, where
most of India's jute industry is concentrated.
These 'black sheep' mills, as the Indian Jute Mills Association describes
them, produce jute goods only when the market is favourable. But while this
stop-go management approach causes economic hardship to the workers, it does
not provoke strong protests from the trade unions as the migrant workers
from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa who constitute the majority of the
labour force return to their villages during the frequent closures of the
mills to work in the fields.
The recalcitrant mills broke away from the IJMA one by one because they
would not submit to any kind of discipline. According to an IJMA official,
'a tripartite agreement involving the industry, the unions and the West
Bengal government spells out the wages and other benefits of the workers.
But some jute mill managements will have nothing to do with this agreement.
They make deals with the union leaders at the mill level to deny the workers
full wages. Moreover, they habitually default in the payment of provident
fund and gratuity to the workers'.
The association is angry with these mills for causing distortions in the
local jute goods market. Taking advantage of their lower costs of production
compared with the IJMA members, they have been regularly offering discounts
against the listed prices of jute goods. 'The losers are the ones which are
meeting the dues of the workers in full,' complains the IJMA official.
Even though the Left Front, dominated by the Marxist Communist Party of
India, has been in power in West Bengal for nearly 18 years, the government
has done little to give relief to the workers or to the mills remaining
within the IJMA fold.
The problem has now become a national issue, however, much to the
embarrassment of the Left Front government, because of the relentless
struggle by more than 3,000 workers of Kanoria Jute during the past nine
months to get the mill at Phuleswar reopened. The mill was closed on
November 26 last year. Unlike the other jute mills in the state, an
overwhelming majority of workers of Kanoria Jute hail from the surrounding
82 villages. 'Since the Kanoria workers have nothing else to fall back upon,
they are working to a one-point programme of reopening the mill on
respectable terms,' says Mr Purnendu Bose, a member of the advisory
committee of the Kanoria Jute Fighting Workers Union.
These workers have set quite a few milestones in West Bengal's trade union
movement. 'KJFWU was formed in February last year when the workers found
that the four registered unions, including two owing allegiance to the Left
Front government were not able to protect their interests,' explains Mr
Nazibur Rahman, its general secretary. 'The new union, born because of sins
of omission of the existing unions, enjoys the support of more than 90 per
cent of the workers.'
Although the KJFWU leaders insisted that they wanted to avoid 'a
confrontation with the state authorities and the other unions at all cost',
they made the big mistake of forcing their way into the mill and starting
production of jute goods using the raw jute lying in the godown. The
Calcutta High Court ordered the KJFWU to desist from producing and selling
jute goods.
Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal and an active trade union
leader, has made it clear that the forcible takeover of the mill offers no
solution to the Kanoria Jute crisis. 'Such moves will only confuse the
workers,' he warns. The minister is not finding it at all easy to attract
industrial investment to West Bengal and he knows only too well that a few
more cases of forcible takeover of factories by the workers would scare away
the potential investors.
Moreover, he cannot but take note of the humiliation suffered by the Marxist
union at Kanoria Jute.
The mill is also a considerable embarrassment for the Kanorias, an important
Indian business family that is successfully running three other jute mills -
Ludlow, Cheviot and Reliance - besides other industrial operations.
The Kanorias bought the mill from the Mafatlals in 1974 and ran it till
September 1987, when a lockout was declared. Unlike the other three mills,
Kanoria Jute was not modernised. Neither did it take up production of high
added value jute materials. Like so many other sick jute mills in West
Bengal, Kanoria was taken over by a raw jute trader, who before reopening
the unit in January 1991 made the unions agree to a cut in wages and a
reduced workforce. The state government did not oppose the action as it
wanted the mill to be reopened somehow.
Anticipating prolonged labour unrest, the Kanorias pleaded with the new
promoter to change the name of the jute mill. The fear of the Kanorias had
been realised, but the name of the mill remains unchanged. Aberrations like
the futile attempt forcibly to take possession of the mill notwithstanding,
the KJFWU is doggedly pursuing with the federal and state government and the
Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction its demand for the
reopening of the mill. According to Mr Rahman, 'the existing promoter is
welcome to run the mill provided he clears all past dues of the workers and
respects the labour laws. The mill may be handed over to a new promoter if
the existing promoter does not want to run it. We will be happy if the
government takes over the unit. We are also ready to run the mill as a
workers' co-operative or as a joint venture with a private promoter'.
Both the federal government and the BIFR are well disposed to the idea of a
new promoter contributing 60 per cent of the equity capital and the workers
bringing in 40 per cent. In fact, the government has indicated that it may
give loans to the workers equivalent to their contribution to the equity
capital.
A professional with many years of experience in jute has agreed to play the
role of the new promoter and he is acceptable to the KJFWU.
In the meantime, the KJFWU has been able to mobilise the support of the
intellectuals all over the country for the Kanoria workers' movement. 'We
have not put forward any new economic demands. We want the mill to be
reopened and run professionally. The workers must get their dues and be able
to work with dignity,' says Mr Bose.
Perhaps the mill will reopen. But unless the new management is able to
modernise the factory, introduce new products and improve productivity,
there will be no future for Kanoria Jute.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures rally - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures closed firmer in London yesterday after a choppy run marked
by producer selling and trade and arbitrage buying, dealers said.
'The market was erratic in thin trade but it did perform better than
expected this morning,' one said. By the close the November position at the
London Commodity Exchange, which had earlier dipped to Dollars 4,053 a
tonne, stood at Dollars 4,091, within Dollars 9 of the day's high.
The latest weather forecast from the US-based Weather Services Corporation,
which said Brazil's hot, dry weather was expected to continue through the
next five days, added a sense of urgency to the market, a trader said.
A mid-afternoon rise in London Metal Exchange base metals was not maintained
and when COPPER stalled most other prices lost their way.
Three months ALUMINIUM recorded a fresh 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 1,624 a
tonne before profit-taking and speculative selling snuffed out the move.
NICKEL prices mostly fluctuated in line with the overall trend. LEAD
continued to make slow progress back up to the Dollars 630-a-tonne level and
another attempt at recent 2-year highs.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian sugar output forecast to
rise by 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's sugar production will rise by 24 per cent this year to 9.8m tonnes,
reversing the steady decline of the past three years, according to the food
ministry. A further spurt is expected to push output to 12.2m tonnes in the
next sugar season starting in October.
The increase in production comes as the nation's sugar industry launched a
campaign for complete deregulation of the sugar market.
The Indian Sugar Mills Association believes that production could rise to
13m tonnes if the industry were deregulated. This could save Rs20bn (Pounds
400m) a year in wasted output and import bills.
Isma has been galvanising public opinion by placing large advertisements in
India's daily newspapers urging the public to support the reforms they have
suggested to the government, beginning with a policy of complete
deregulation for the sugar industry.
The association estimates that half of the money lost through current
policies 'goes down the drain', in the form of sucrose left unrecovered by
some processors.
'Unfortunately, this happens in a scenario where the established capacity of
sugar manufacturers is left unutilised, due to a lack of cane,' Isma says.
Another Rs10bn goes on import costs, caused by the production shortfalls of
sugar units.
An equitable distribution of cane between all processors would minimise the
diversion of cane, and allow production units fully to utilise capacity and
expand further to take advantage of economies of scale, which would in turn,
bring down sugar prices.
The association has also urged the government to announce a clear-cut policy
on the creation of buffer stocks when there is a bumper crop, for effective
utilisation during times of shortage.
An official of the food ministry said the government was examining the
proposals forwarded by the association. 'But it will be some time before the
sugar industry can be fully decontrolled,' he said.
'The government would be exposing itself to rampant inflation if this
essential commodity were out of its control,' the official said.
The government currently distributes sugar through subsidised public
distribution and a system of ration cards. Though sugar is freely available
on the open market, the price difference is significant.
The association says decontrol will stabilise prices and decrease the
disparity between the price of sugar for public distribution, and free
market sugar prices.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western Mining joins Cuban
nickel venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group, announced
yesterday that it had reached agreement in principle with Cuba's state-owned
Commercial Caribbean Nickel company, to assess and possibly develop the
Pinares de Mayari West nickel deposit.
The deposit lies in the Holguin province. WMC said that preliminary data on
the near-surface deposit provided by CCN suggested 'a significant nickel
laterite resource estimated to contain in excess of 200m tonnes of ore, at a
grade of greater than 1 per cent contained nickel and 0.1 per cent contained
cobalt'.
WMC will be able to earn a 65 per cent interest in the joint venture, by
funding a drilling programme, metallurgical test work, and a feasibility
study, with CCN holding the remaining 35 per cent. The drilling programme
could start in a matter of months.
Several Canadian mining companies - including Sherritt, the nickel and
cobalt producer - have unveiled plans or joint ventures in Cuba recently,
and others are believed to be seeking a foothold there. US companies are
barred by the longstanding trade embargo. Cuba is relatively rich in
resources and some estimates suggest that it may house over one-tenth of the
world's known nickel resources. WMC has major nickel operations in Western
Australia.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resistance caps rises in
precious metals markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold and silver prices made further gains yesterday before hitting overhead
resistance.
During the London bullion market's afternoon 'fixing' the gold price was
tried as high as Dollars 395.50 a troy ounce, but that proved to much and it
eased to Dollars 394.90, the highest fix since January 5. By the close the
price had drifted to Dollars 394.60 an ounce, up 80 cents on the day.
In the absence of the Tokyo investment fund buying that had pushed the price
upwards on Tuesday a day of consolidation was to be expected, dealers told
the Reuters news agency. Some thought a retreat to the Dollars
390.50-Dollars 391.00 area, where a 'chart gap' had been left by Tuesday's
sharp rise, was on the cards if the market failed to break strong resistance
above Dollars 395.50. But others pointed to good physical interest
supporting the market around Dollars 393.
The silver price was fixed in the morning at 567.15 cents a troy ounce, its
highest price since May 24, but it shied away from a test of resistance at
570 cents resistance and settled back to 562 cents, up just 2 cents on
balance.
One analyst suggested to Reuters that the attempted break-outs by gold and
silver had come too early in the day. 'It leaves them open to retracement,'
he said.
Palladium achieved its highest fixing since May 15, 1989 at Dollars 156.25
an ounce, encouraged by tight supplies and continuing good offtake from the
electronics industry.
'The market's fundamentals are the key,' said one analyst.
The platinum market was also buoyant, although it was held within its
recently-set price range.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose ground on fears of tighter
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds lost ground yesterday, with stronger than expected housing
data fuelling speculation over the timing of the next change in monetary
policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 lower
at 99 15/32 , with the yield rising to 7.799 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 9/16 , to yield 6.473 per cent.
The day's economic news was mildly unfavourable, and provided an excuse for
traders to lighten up on government securities amid the current uncertainty
over interest rates.
The Commerce Department reported that August housing starts had risen 2.1
per cent, against forecasts of a slight decline.
Bonds lurched downward on the headline figure, but immediately began to
retrace their steps on closer examination of the report.
Economists pointed out that most of the month's activity was concentrated in
the multi-family sector. Single-family housing starts, a more reliable
measure of the industry's strength, showed a 2.7 per cent downturn in
August.
Still, the pessimism dominating the market over the past fortnight held
prices firmly in negative ground. Traders appeared divided in their bets on
when the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates again.
The recent signs of accelerating inflation and last week's evidence of a
bubbling economy suggested an early move by the Fed.
Despite the data, some observers believed the central bank would wait until
after the mid-term elections in early November before taking any action
which could be construed as politically motivated.
The first camp was given a boost yesterday by Mr Wayne Angell, chief
economist at Bear Stearns and a former Fed governor.
In a statement prepared for clients of the securities house, Mr Angell said
he believed there was a 60 per cent chance that the central bank's
policy-making arm would decide to lift rates at its September 27 meeting.
He said the Fed was likely to sanction an increase in both the Fed funds and
discount rates by 50 basis points each, to 5.25 and 4.50 per cent
respectively.
Lower than expected German money supply numbers gave European government
bonds an early lift but prices drifted lower in the afternoon to end the day
weaker.
'M3 provided some support, but the reaction was pretty anaemic, which
suggests that underlying sentiment is still very weak,' said Mr Philip
Tyson, European bond analyst at CS First Boston.
European bonds were dragged lower in the afternoon by weaker US Treasuries
amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve plans to tighten monetary
policy in the near future.
German bunds ended the day slightly stronger but off their highs, with the
December bund future closing around 88.32, up 0.24 on the day.
Shrugging off strong producer prices, bunds rose on lower than expected
August M3 money supply data showing an annualised growth rate of 8.2 per
cent. However, they were dragged back down by weaker US Treasuries.
The German market remains overshadowed by Bavarian state elections this
weekend, which are seen as an indication of voting behaviour in the federal
elections on October 16. Moreover, a heavy supply burden looms in the final
quarter, all of which is likely to keep bunds subdued.
UK gilts drifted in lacklustre trading, led by overseas bond markets. The
December gilt future on Liffe rose just  1/32 on the day to 98 1/8 in late
trading.
UK trade figures were shrugged off by the market, as were the minutes of the
July meeting on monetary policy between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of
the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Traders
said the minutes were overtaken by last week's 50 basis point rise in the
base rate.
Mr Simon Briscoe, of S. G. Warburg, said the trade figures were good for
gilts, as were the minutes, since they showed agreement on policy between
the governor and the chancellor.
But Mr Huw Roberts, at NatWest Markets, said there was little sentiment
behind gilts, and any rally was met with a wave of selling. 'It is a brave
man who would step back into this market.'
Among the higher-yielding markets, Italy put on a strong performance, with
the December bond futures contract on Liffe rising by 0.81 to 98.64.
Elsewhere, Portugal appears to be mulling the issuance of floating-rate debt
for the first time since 1992. After failing to place fixed-rate Treasury
bonds for six consecutive weeks, a senior finance ministry official told
Reuters that 'it is very likely that the state will issue more OTs
(fixed-rate bonds) this year or perhaps floating-rate paper'.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan tops OTC swaps poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second year running, J. P. Morgan has topped the rankings of firms
in the over-the-counter swaps market, while Swiss Bank Corporation continues
to dominate the over-the-counter options market, according to a poll
published in September's Risk Magazine, a monthly publication specialising
in derivatives. More than 100 banks, investment houses and brokers were
polled in June and July.
Among their closest competitors, Credit Suisse Financial Products gained
ground in several areas, including currency swaps and options.
In the market for more complex or exotic derivatives such as 'differential'
swaps and look-back options, Bankers Trusts' pre-eminent position showed
signs of slipping. Although still ranked in each of the 10 categories,
Bankers was voted top of only six categories this year, possibly reflecting
adverse publicity due to corporate losses on swaps arranged by the bank.
The number of banks nominated rose in many areas, reflecting increased
competition in the derivatives market. However, domestic banks swept the
board for many individual swaps markets, including sterling, French francs
and Swiss francs, suggesting that it is still possible to conduct successful
swaps business in niche areas.
Among derivatives brokers, Intercapital and Tullet &amp; Tokyo dominated the
field, with Intercapital particularly strong in interest rate and equity
products and Tullet well ahead in forward rate agreements.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Belgium mulls DM1bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Belgium is thought to be close to launching a DM1bn eurobond
offering but is undecided whether to go for a floating-rate or fixed-rate
structure.
Some banks are advising Belgium that an issue of floating-rate notes (FRNs)
would get a better reception from investors in the light of current market
conditions. They also say an issue of FRNs would be cheaper.
However, other banks believe that Belgium would be wiser to opt for a
fixed-rate offering so as not to collide with the Bundesbank's issue of
10-year floating-rate bunds which is scheduled for next week.
If Belgium chooses to do an FRN offering, the most likely maturity would be
between five and seven years, syndicate managers said. They expect a
discount margin of around five basis points over Libor which would produce a
coupon of Libor flat.
With respect to the likely pricing of a fixed-rate offering, syndicate
managers said Belgium would have to offer a yield spread of between 20 to 25
basis points over bunds for a five-year issue and a spread in the low 30s
for a 10-year issue. Belgium is expected to make a decision today but the
issue is not likely to emerge until next week.
Another issue in the pipeline is a debut Hungarian forint offering from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) which will be offered to domestic
and foreign investors.
Mr John Borthwick, principal financial officer, said the IFC put in place a
Ft5bn medium-term note programme this week, arranged by CS First Boston. The
IFC plans to use the programme to fund back-to-back loans to its clients in
Hungary. Mr Borthwick said it would be the first time the IFC made loans to
its clients in their local currency.
Meanwhile, the National Bank of Hungary is seeking to raise FFr1bn through
an offering of eurobonds with a maturity of six to eight years. The issue,
via Credit Lyonnais, is expected to be priced to yield around 235 basis
points over French government bonds.
Sterling-denominated issues dominated yesterday's offerings, with the
Japanese City of Kobe raising Pounds 200m through a 10-year offering.
Syndicate managers said the pricing of 40 basis points over 10-year UK
government bonds was fair but that investor demand for that maturity was
low.
Nestle Holdings took advantage of the arbitrage opportunities at the shorter
end of the curve, raising Pounds 75m through an offering of three-year
eurobonds.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Thomson Financial in trade
confirmation deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson Financial Services, a provider of software, research and analysis
for the securities industry, has signed an agreement to become the sole
provider of electronic trade confirmation services for Sicovam, the French
central depository for securities.
Trade confirmation occurs between counterparties immediately after a bargain
has been agreed. Full settlement of securities cannot be completed without
trade confirmation and electronic confirmation cuts transactions costs
significantly.
Sicovam is owned by French financial institutions and the Paris Bourse.
Although it already provides electronic trade confirmation for bargains
struck between brokers, it does not do so for bargains between French
brokers and their institutional or foreign counterparties.
French securities trans - actions settle three days after each bargain is
struck, a system which has dramatically raised the costs of trade
confirmation for firms which still use manual systems.
The deal is also significant for Thomson, which has been seeking a toe-hold
for its electronic trade confirmation services in Europe. In the UK market,
its leading competitor for the service is the London Stock Exchange's
Seaqual.

On Monday, investors will not just be able buy and sell shares in Western
Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest resources groups  - they will
also be able to trade futures contracts covering the same underlying stock.
As with all futures contracts, this will mean that exposure to the shares
can be 'leveraged' so that a relatively small movement in Western's share
price is magnified into a much larger movement in the stock future.
Moreover, complex trading strategies will become possible - at least in
theory. For example, WMC, which is still a fairly good proxy for the gold
price, could be bet against the Australian stock market.
The WMC futures contract is one of four new contracts being offered by the
Sydney Futures Exchange from September 26. The other companies involved are
MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals company; BTR Nylex, the
diversified conglomerate controlled by Britain's BTR group; and Westpac, one
of the big four Australian banks.
These contracts will augment the three existing individual share futures
contracts - covering Broken Hill Proprietary, National Australia Bank and
News Corporation - which started to trade in May. Another three contracts
are due to be unveiled before the end of the year.
But the SFE's ambitions do not stop there. The 10 contracts introduced in
1994 all require settlement in cash, not scrip. In other words, investors
are not required to deliver the underlying physical stock.
The SFE has made clear that it would like to introduce 'deliverable' share
futures contracts as well, and is talking to the Australian Securities
Commission about this. The regulator would need to give permission before
such a product could be launched.
Secondly, while Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the SFE, sees the number
of Australian share futures contracts being pegged at 10 for the foreseeable
future, he holds out the prospect of introducing SFE-traded contracts for
companies whose physical stocks change hands on overseas exchanges. 'Imagine
an IBM or General Motors contract,' he says.
'Imagine' may be the key word. All this is highly ambitious and totally
uncharted territory. Sydney is the only market in the world where futures
contracts are available on individual shares in any meaningful fashion. In
the US, such contracts are specifically prohibited, in part because of price
manipulation concerns.
Even in Sydney, the SFE's go-go approach has run into some stumbling blocks.
For a start, in spite of the publicity surrounding these new derivative
instruments, trading volumes have not been large. During the first three
months, the BHP/NAB/News share futures traded 14,046 contracts.
'I'm patient about these things - development is very dependent on the cash
market,' says Mr Hosking, pointing out that the stock market itself has been
sluggish in recent months. Nevertheless, even the SFE concedes that many
institutional investors are reluctant to get involved with the new contracts
until liquidity has developed.
The SFE's second problem is a continuing turf battle with the Australian
Stock Exchange over who should run this type of derivatives market. No
sooner had the SFE got permission for its three initial contracts than the
ASX's derivatives department countered with a new type of options contract
called the 'Low Exercise Price Option' (or LEPO), and was simply a very deep
'in-the-money' call option, whose exercise price could be as little as one
cent.
LEPOs were designed to trade in line with the physical stock, but - thanks
to the options market's margin system - the full price would only be payable
on expiry. The ASX's LEPOs covered five stocks - including the three
targeted by the SFE.
Since then, the ASX has come out with a more sophisticated rival offering:
share ratios. These, it claims, are an entirely new equity-based derivative,
which allow investors to gain exposure to a share based on how it performs
relative to the stock market, not on whether it goes up and down in price.
However, by giving investors a chance to punt on whether BHP, say, betters
the stock market generally, the share ratio contract will compete directly
with one of the main uses for share futures contract.
The problem for the ASX, however, is Australia's Corporations Law. This
currently imposes a fairly rigid divide between 'futures' and 'securities',
making these products the concerns of the SFE and ASX respectively.
Earlier this month, the attorney-general proffered a helping hand when he
proposed some amendments which, if passed into law, would permit share
ratios to start trading. His office, while emphasising that this is a
decision in respect of one product only, suggests that the legislative
adjustments could be made by the end of this year.
But this has not stopped the SFE from fighting a fierce rearguard action. It
has already taken court action over the proposed LEPOs, for example. Any
decision would probably be open to appeal, so this product is unlikely to be
available before the end of this year.
While jockeying between the exchanges continues, some of the companies whose
stock is involved in these new contracts are less than enthralled. When the
first trio of contracts got under way, BHP pointed out that promotion of
futures contracts on its shares tended to cut across its own investors
relations department's efforts to promote the underlying physical stock.
For the exchanges there is the additional concern that they are playing in
an international marketplace and that if their products are held back, other
overseas exchanges will throw caution to the wind and take the initiative.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan's brokers lower
forecasts

Sluggish trading volume on the Tokyo stock market has led to Japan's 'big
four' brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and 10 second-tier
brokers revising downwards their interim earnings forecasts for the six
months to September.
The move could herald another round of cost-cutting at the houses.
At the start of the current business year in April, the brokerage houses had
hoped to see a recovery in corporate earnings support share prices and
trading volumes.
A rush of buying of Japanese shares by overseas investors during the
January-March quarter of this year helped to fuel such expectations.
However, domestic institutions have remained pessimistic over a sharp
corporate earnings recovery, while flotations of former state-owned
companies have triggered fears of over-supply and depressed investor
confidence.
Although many brokers had hoped that average daily turnover would total
around Y400bn (Dollars 4.04bn) for the first half, the actual figure has
been Y350bn.
Although the brokerages have been reducing trading expenses and
administrative costs, many have yet to restructure their fixed costs. 'Until
now their cost-cutting hasn't really been long-term rationalisation. They'll
be forced to cut more into the fixed area,' said Ms Elizabeth Daniels,
banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo.
Nomura Securities lowered its interim pre-tax profits forecast to Y23bn,
down 9 per cent from the previous year and a 42.5 per cent decline from its
initial estimate. The company blamed lower stock brokerage income and
revenue linked to convertible and warrant bonds. Operating revenue for the
interim period is forecast to be Y190bn, down 5.9 per cent from a year
earlier, and after-tax profits are expected to decline 10 per cent to Y9bn.
For the full year to March, the company has revised down pre-tax profits to
Y70bn - still 38.3 per cent higher than that achieved in the previous 12
months - on a 2.8 per cent rise in operating revenue to Y410bn and an 8.8
per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y27bn.
Daiwa Securities said interim pre-tax profits would plunge 80 per cent from
a year earlier to Y7bn instead of the previously predicted Y25bn.
Operating revenue for the first six months is expected to fall 21.6 per cent
to Y124bn and after-tax profits to decline 82.8 per cent to Y3bn. For the
full year, Daiwa predicts pre-tax profits to fall 23 per cent to Y40bn on an
8 per cent decline in operating revenue to Y273bn.
Nikko Securities expects to break even at pre-tax and after-tax levels in
the first half. Operating revenue is expected to fall 16 per cent to Y115bn.
For the year to March, the company expects a 14.2 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y30bn on a 6.9 per cent decline in operating revenue to Y279.4bn.
Yamaichi Securities, which expected to post a pre-tax profit of Y10bn, now
expects pre-tax losses of Y9bn on a 17.3 per cent fall in operating revenue
to Y100bn.
For the year, the company forecasts a 26.9 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits to Y13bn on a 3.4 per cent fall in operating revenue to Y228bn.
Meanwhile, all 10 second-tier brokers said they expected to post pre-tax
losses for the six months to September.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Qantas climbs into the black
with last figures before float
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Increased passenger loads and a large reduction in abnormal items helped
Qantas, the government-controlled Australian airline in which British
Airways holds a 25 per cent interest, climb back into the black for the year
to June.
The carrier said that profits after tax and abnormals stood at ADollars
155.9m (USDollars 114.6m), compared with a loss of ADollars 377.2m last
time. Revenues were up by 13.2 per cent at ADollars 6.6bn, although this was
partly due to the inclusion of the domestic operations of the former
Australian Airlines for 12 months (compared with 10 months previously).
Earnings before interest and tax more than doubled to ADollars 480m.
This is the last set of full-year figures which Qantas will produce before
the government floats its remaining 75 per cent interest in the airline on
the stock market in the first half of 1995.
Precise timing of the float - expected to raise more than ADollars 2bn for
the government - is undecided. Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman, said the
prospectus would contain a profits forecast for 1994-95 and possibly for
1995-96.
The increase in operating profits during the past financial year was
attributed to increased passenger loads both in Australia and overseas. The
company said total revenue passenger kilometres on international routes rose
by just over 10 per cent, and load factors increased from 67.9 per cent to
70.6 per cent.
However, yields - revenue per passenger kilometre - were merely stable, due
to continued fare discounting.
Mr James Strong, chief executive, added that the Pacific routes, which have
long been lossmaking, became 'marginally profitable'. A number of big US
airlines, such as Continental and Northwest, have abandoned these routes and
fares have risen significantly.
Revenue from domestic operations increased on the back of a 15.7 per cent
rise in capacity, and yields showed 'a slight improvement'. Costs overall
rose, but by less than capacity. Fuel costs for the year were 'down
marginally, net of hedges,' according to Mr Pemberton. Interest charges were
ADollars 178.2m, compared with ADollars 197.4m previously.
Abnormal items amounted to ADollars 64.9m before tax, made up of redundancy
provisions, asset writedowns, and a provision for under-recovery of rentals.
A year ago, Qantas was hit by a massive ADollars 446.4m abnormal charge.
Qantas said that 'with no strengthening of yield in prospect, further
reductions in overall unit cost levels will continue to be a major
priority'.
However, Mr Pemberton said that the carrier had been 'quite happy with the
first couple of months' of the current trading year,' although he also
warned that 'future prospects will depend to a considerable extent on trends
in the aviation market particularly a continued strengthening in market
demand and maintenance of reasonable yields'.
Qantas said later that it was in the process of organising a ADollars 750m
five-year standby facility, to replace a USDollars 400m note issue facility
and separate USDollars 300m multi-option facil-ity.

Italcementi

Income from Ciments Francais and other foreign operations helped
Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, to overcome the continued
depression on its domestic market in the first half of this year.
Italcementi, which bought Ciments Francais in 1992, has unveiled
consolidated first-half profits, before amortisation, provisions and taxes,
of L306.5bn (Dollars 196.47m) compared with L218.5bn in the first half of
1993.
But the company's Italian arm was hit by the continued stagnation in the
Italian construction market. Production fell by 12.6 per cent, faster than
the average drop in demand.
Overall income of the group, which is headed by the industrialist Mr
Giampiero Pesenti, was L2,545bn compared with L2,556bn last time, but the
Italian group registered a drop in turnover to L529.4bn, compared with
L614.1bn in the first six months of 1993.
Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company indirectly controlled by the
Ferruzzi holding company, returned to net profit in the first half of 1994
due to extraordinary gains on the sale of investments and property.
After tax, the company recorded a profit of L14bn for the first half,
compared with a loss of L121bn in the equivalent period.
Investment gains amounted to L64.2bn, compared with L9.6bn, and property
sales realised a profit of L22bn. No property was sold in the first half of
1993.
Premium income also increased during the period, and the reduction of debts
to L748bn on June 30, compared with more than L1,000bn a year earlier, also
helped. Total group company premiums increased to L3,167bn, up 2.3 per cent.

succeeds Dr Nicolas Bru with immediate effect and will have responsibility
for UPSA's worldwide operations. Dr Bru will become president of UPSA's
advisory board.
UPSA is a research-based company with annual sales of about Dollars 350m. It
is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of analgesics in France
and Belgium and has subsidiaries in Belgium, Spain, Italy and Portugal. It
also develops and markets cardiovascular and gastrointestinal medicines.
Mr Charles Heimbold, chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, said the deal would
enhance its participation in Europe's growing self-medication market.

The scheme will be open to foreign companies and residents, overseas

A government economist said the share issue would amount to issuing new
capital that would be privately held, diluting state ownership.
New regulations say the purchase and sale of bonds and shares should be in

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden agrees to meet Kazarian
for bid talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group that last week agreed to a
Dollars 2bn takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street
investment firm, yesterday reluctantly agreed to meet another would-be
suitor in the shape of Mr Paul Kazarian, owner of a Rhode Island investment
firm called Japonica Partners.
Neither party would comment on the agenda for the meeting, but it is
believed that Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of
Sunbeam-Oster, the US consumer products group, has repeatedly expressed an
interest in bidding for Borden since the food group put itself on the block
earlier this year, only to have his approaches rebuffed.
Borden's decision to agree to a meeting with Mr Kazarian comes amid mounting
evidence that some Borden shareholders are deeply unhappy about the KKR deal
and may revolt against it.
Yesterday, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said it was advising
the pension funds of its 150 affiliates, which between them hold at least
247,000 of Borden's 141.5m shares, not to tender their shares to KKR.
It also said it was meeting other institutional investors to discuss its
concerns about the KKR offer.
Under the complex deal announced last week, KKR offered to exchange half its
35 per cent stake in RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, for 80 per
cent of Borden's stock. RJR Nabisco would buy the remaining 20 per cent of
Borden's shares, using newly issued RJR stock, and would also take an option
to buy a 10 per cent stake in Borden from KKR.
Borden shareholders are irked by several aspects of the deal.
If they reject the offer, KKR still gets a 19.9 per cent stake in Borden at
a bargain price of Dollars 11 a share - Borden's shares closed up Dollars
1/8 at Dollars 14 yesterday - and will receive a Dollars 50m fee from
Borden. Conversely, if the deal succeeds, Borden will have to pay KKR a
Dollars 50m 'advisory' fee.
Mr William Patterson, director of the office of corporate affairs at the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the bottom line was that Borden
shareholders were having their stock purchased at a time when it was at its
lowest point with 'tremendous' upside, and in return they were receiving
stock in RJR Nabsico which had substantial downside risks because of its
potential tobacco liabilities.
'We are equally alarmed that this seems to be an extremely self-serving
transaction from the point of view of KKR in the sense that they are paid a
very large fee whether or not the deal happens,' he said.
Few analysts believe Japonica's Mr Kazarian has access to the financial
resources necessary to launch a serious bid for Borden.
However, Mr Patterson said Borden's shareholders should wait and see whether
other, better offers come along before accepting the KKR deal.
'Why the rush?' he said. 'The company's not going to implode overnight.'
However, Mr Arthur Cecil, a research analyst with the T. Rowe Price mutual
fund management group, a Borden shareholder, said the fact that investors
were venting their frustration with the KKR deal was not necessarily an
indicator that anything better will emerge.
'If I were a betting man, I would say that the KKR deal is pretty well
done,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Serfin and Inverlat merger put
in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Financiero Serfin and Grupo Financiero Inverlat, Mexico's third- and
fourth-largest financial groups, are on the verge of calling off their
proposed merger after failing to reach agreement on the valuation of the two
institutions.
The merger was proposed in June, and would, according to some measures, have
made the combined group Mexico's second-largest financial institution. It
would have given Serfin control over Inverlat, which controls the Comermex
bank and was seen as the weaker of the two groups.
Inverlat said yesterday it was unlikely the merger would proceed.
Mr Roberto Aguirre, of Serfin, said a formal decision would be taken at the
group's board meeting tomorrow. But he was not optimistic: 'There have been
a lot of problems in the negotiations and the merger will probably not go
ahead.'
Mr Aguirre said the main stumbling block was over the terms of the share
swap that would have lead to the fusion of the two companies. Serfin wanted
to exchange 3.7 shares of Inverlat for every one of its shares, while
Inverlat had proposed a ratio of 2.5, according to Infosel, a financial news
agency.
As negotiations over the transaction proceeded, both organisations concluded
that the process of merging the banks would have been more complex and
expensive than thought, and could have taken years to complete.
Serfin and Inverlat had hoped a merger would help them compete more
effectively with the market leaders, Banacci and Bancomer, by enabling them
to benefit from economies of scale in administration and systems.
'Under this situation, the probabilities of merging are very low,' a Serfin
executive told Reforma newspaper yesterday.
'On a scale of zero to hundred, the probabilities of a merger are zero.'
Serfin was quoted as saying the disagreement was not over the value of the
two groups' assets or liabilities, but on the intrinsic worth of the
different institutions.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly expects to beat
targets

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, yesterday indicated its third-quarter
earnings would be ahead of most analysts' expectations, due largely to
stronger-than-expected sales of Prozac, the anti-depressant which is its
biggest-selling product.
Mr Sidney Taurel, executive vice-president, pointed to 'solid worldwide
growth in new prescriptions' and a build-up of inventory by wholesalers in
the US ahead of a price rise which took effect yesterday. The company said
earnings per share for the three months to the end of September would reach
Dollars 1.08-Dollars 1.12, after a 14 cents a share charge for the takeover
of Sphinx Pharmaceutical.
Lilly revised estimates of earnings per share for the year to Dollars
4.65-Dollars 4.85, up from Dollars 4.55-Dollars 4.65. This is before special
charges, including those for the acquisition of Sphinx and the planned
Dollars 4bn takeover of PCS, a drug distributor.
In early trading, Lilly's share price rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59, but
later fell back to close unchanged at Dollars 57 3/4 . Lilly's shares slid
by nearly 20 per cent in July on fears that it was paying too much for PCS,
but it bounced back on takeover speculation to close to its high for the
year.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Picco quits unexpectedly as
chairman at Eridania

Mr Renato Picco yesterday unexpectedly resigned as chairman of Eridania
Beghin-Say, the French agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Montedison,
prompting a FFr59 fall in the company's shares which closed at FFr750.
Mr Picco, 60, was one of the last top managers appointed by the old regime
at Montedison and Ferruzzi, its holding company, under Mr Raul Gardini, who
committed suicide last year.
New directors took over at Ferruzzi-Montedison in the middle of 1993, after
the full extent of the group's debts became clear, but Mr Picco decided to
stay on at Eridania to work with the new directors as Montedison
restructured.
Eridania yesterday reported a consolidated net profit of FFr623m (Dollars
117m) in the first half of 1994 on sales of FFr24.8bn. In the first half of
1993, Eridania, which is quoted on the Paris bourse, reported profits of
FFr614m and sales of FFr24.75bn, but it said comparison was misleading
because of changes in the companies consolidated.
Net operating profit was down nearly 6 per cent to FFr1.87bn from FFr1.99bn,
mainly because the important sugar operations were unable to repeat what
Eridania described as exceptional results in the first half of 1993, and the
increased contribution of other sectors was not enough to offset this.
The company said it expected full-year results to be broadly comparable with
1993, when net profits reached FFr1.34bn on turnover of FFr50.9bn.
Mr Picco will be replaced by Mr Stefano Meloni, 46, director general of
Ferruzzi-Montedison responsible for finance. Mr Picco was praised by the
board for his 'absolute independence and managerial rectitude' which had
protected Eridania from the main repercussions of the crisis which hit the
rest of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group last year.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: CANTV on tip of a debt iceberg -
The Venezuelan telecoms group is rescheduling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compania Anonima Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), Venezuela's national
telecommunications company that owes more to foreign creditors than any
other private concern, has rescheduled its foreign debts due to Venezuela's
foreign exchange controls imposed in June.
Mr Bruce Haddad, CANTV president, said his company began negotiating what he
called a refinancing programme after it missed a payment on an international
loan in August. Mr Haddad did not give a precise figure for CANTV's external
debt, but said it was 'hundreds of millions of dollars'.
CANTV, privatised in 1991 by an international consortium headed by GTE of
the US, had external obligations in bonds, notes, commercial loans, trade
credits and others, Mr Haddad said. Over 40 financial institutions from the
US, Europe and Japan are involved.
Mr Haddad said exchange controls announced by the government on June 27 had
hurt the company's capital investment programme and made rescheduling a
difficult proposition.
'We have no doubt whatsoever about CANTV's ability and willingness to
service its debt on time,' said one international banker who works with the
company. 'But the exchange control bureaucracy is excruciatingly slow and
entirely beyond the company's control.'
Bankers here said they knew of no large sums disbursed by the government to
cover private sector foreign debt. However, the government is aware of the
problem and reportedly allotted Dollars 400m for private external debt. But
it is not clear how soon the government will begin supplying the funds.
The public sector is apparently servicing its own debt normally.
However, CANTV's dilemma is only the tip of the iceberg. Strict foreign
exchange controls and slow processing of applications for US dollars to
service external debt has hurt many Venezuelan companies, including local
subsidiaries of multinational concerns.
CANTV was planning a Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m eurobond issue in June, but
cancelled the offer because of exchange controls.
'We have a huge problem here,' commented one international banker based in
Caracas. 'Our clients cannot obtain foreign exchange to keep their debt
payments current, and we have hundreds of millions of dollars in overdue
loans.'
Mr Julio Sosa, minister of finance, said Venezuela's private sector external
debt stood at about Dollars 5bn, but the total could be higher.
A large devaluation of Venezuela's currency and high inflation forced CANTV
to cut back its capital investment programme this year. Mr Haddad said the
company had reduced this year's projected capital spending of Dollars 705m
by Dollars 125m, and next year's planned capital outlays of about Dollars
700m would be cut 'by over 50 per cent'.
Quarterly rate increases for CANTV's services this year have been below
inflation, and cannot come close to offsetting the higher local currency
costs of imported capital goods caused by devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar this year. The government questioned CANTV's most recent request for
rate increases, and set up a special commission to study the matter.
Regular rate increases to compensate for inflation are stipulated in the
concession agreement signed by CANTV and the last government.
Inflation in Venezuela last year was 46 per cent. The government is
predicting 65 per cent inflation this year, but private sector estimates
suggest it may reach 84 per cent, even with widespread price controls in
place.
The consortium that manages CANTV, Venworld Telecom, was carrying out a
Dollars 6bn capital spending programme for Venezuelan telecommunications
when unfavourable economic circumstances forced it to make reductions in
capital and operating expenditures.
Venworld is the largest foreign investor and the largest private investor in
Venezuela. The group, which paid Dollars 1.89bn in 1991 for 40 per cent of
the government's shares in CANTV and operating control of the company,
includes GTE, with 51 per cent of the consortium; Telefonica Internacional
de Espana; La Electricicad de Caracas, Venezuela's largest private power
company; CIMA, the Banco Mercantil group and AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group.

Horsham, the Toronto-based holding company controlled by financier Mr Peter
Munk, plans to take its wholly-owned Clark USA Oil Refining Unit public with
a USDollars 150m offer of 7.5m new common shares at Dollars 20 each.
Horsham will retain two-thirds of the Clark shares and may buy 10 per cent
of the new issue. The offer is being underwritten by a syndicate led by
Kidder Peabody, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and BT
Securities.
Clark is also offering CDollars 100m (USDollars 72.4m) of unsecured senior
notes through a syndicate led by Kidder Peabody, BT Securities, Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Proceeds of both offerings will be used to finance part of Clark's
acquisition of Chevron's Port Arthur refinery and to retire half of Clark's
zero-coupon notes maturing in 2000.
Mr Munk holds control of American Barrick Resources, the world's
third-largest gold producer, and Trizec, a North American property group,
through Horsham.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: ENI rebound opens way for
privatisation options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong return to profitability by ENI, the Italian state oil concern, has
opened the way for the Berlusconi government to look afresh on the various
options for privatisation.
Mr Franco Bernabe, ENI chief executive, told parliament yesterday the group
was heading for a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.28bn) net profit in 1994 with the bulk
of costly restructuring of loss-making sectors such as chemicals nearly
complete. He said this improved performance allowed the government to opt
for two separate paths in privatisation.
It could either be via the formation of a company grouping all the interests
with those still controlled by ENI. Alternatively, ENI could be split into
three - energy, chemicals, and other activities - that would be owned
directly by the state. ENI, on its L50,000bn annual turnover, is the sixth
largest oil group in the world.
The government has been sitting on earlier proposals put forward by Mr
Bernabe which were in line with guidelines laid down by the previous Amato
and Ciampi governments that envisaged the creation of a 'super-Agip' centred
round the core of the group, Agip, the producer of oil and gas. Mr Bernabe
appears determined to force the government into deciding a clear policy for
the group. However, the government is far from united with the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance resisting large-scale privatisation.
On ENI's performance, the improved profit projection against a mere L419m in
1993 in part is attributed to extraordinary items from continuing
divestments. Through August, ENI had raised L1,776bn from 60 new assets
sales. The burden on the consolidated balance sheet continues to come at
least for this year from the chemicals side which lost L2,600bn in 1993 and
which accounts for only 15 per cent of turnover.
Mr Bernabe said that if ENI's energy interests were hived off, it could
remain in charge of running the privatisation of the other activities. But
he clearly outlined his preference by pointing to the creation of strong
state-dominated energy holdings with private stakes like Spain's creation of
Repsol from INH.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cockerill confirms Eko Stahl bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steelmaker, yesterday confirmed it had
put in a bid for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill.
However, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which is selling Eko Stahl, one
of the few large industrial enterprises still on the Treuhand's books,
declined to disclose the bidding price or confirm that Cockerill was the
only party interested in acquiring Eko Stahl.
Cockerill made its offer after carrying out several studies at Eko Stahl,
located in the eastern state of Brandenburg, and following the collapse last
May of a bid by Riva, the Italian private steel company. The Belgian group
had originally considered joining an international consortium, including
Thyssen, the biggest German steelmaker and Usinor-Sacilor, the largest
French producer, to prepare a feasibility study on Eko Stahl's prospects.
A consortium led by Thyssen and Preussag had earlier proposed buying 50 per
cent of Eko Stahl's cold rolling mill, closing down the hot blast furnace
over a period of three years, and providing 1,000 jobs through its
subsidiaries.
However, the Treuhand wants to retain the mill's manufacturing capacity
largely for political and social reasons since the 50,000 inhabitants of
Eisenhuttenstadt are dependent on the plant.
Until German unification, Eko Stahl had supplied steel to the east European
and Russian market and had an annual capacity of more than 2m tons. This has
since been reduced to 900,000 tons a year while the workforce has been cut
from 12,000 to fewer than 3,000 since 1991.
The Treuhand is anxious to privatise Eko Stahl, preferably before the
federal elections which take place next month.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lehman barely breaks even
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers barely broke even in the three months to the end of August,
managing a return on capital of just 1.6 per cent, according to the first
results from the US investment bank since being spun off from American
Express.
The latest figures come a month ahead of other US investment banks' results
and point to generally weak profits and more cost-cutting on Wall Street.
The Lehman figures reflect a fall-off in activity in many areas of the
financial markets due to the volatility of recent months, according to Mr
Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive. Uncertainties about interest
rates and concerns about inflation 'continued to dampen the activities of
both issuers (of securities) and investors,' he said.
Lehman is also labouring with a higher cost base than many of its rivals,
and continued yesterday to point to cost-cutting as a way of improving
profitability. Since the beginning of the year, staff numbers have fallen by
about 775, to some 8,625, with 300 of the jobs cuts coming in recent days.
During the latest quarter, revenues were lower across the board compared
with the third quarter a year ago, which ended on September 30 1993.
Revenues from principal trading fell 24 per cent to Dollars 335m, while
investment banking revenues slipped 8 per cent to Dollars 172m, net interest
and dividend income fell 29 per cent to Dollars 83m and commission income
was down 10 per cent at Dollars 113m.
If current market conditions continue to the end of the year, bonuses paid
to Lehman employees are expected on average to be 30-40 per cent lower than
in 1993.
Overall, the bank reported post-tax income of Dollars 22m on revenues after
interest costs of Dollars 719m, compared with Dollars 112m on revenues of
Dollars 893m earned on the same businesses the year before. Earnings per
share were 10 cents, compared with 96 cents on all Lehman businesses
including some later sold the year before.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Imi profits fall to L208bn in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult financial markets and reduced commission on investment activities
took their toll on first-half profits at Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the
Italian banking group partly privatised earlier this year.
Consolidated profit fell to L208.1bn (Dollars 133m) in the six months to
June 30, after tax and provisions of L327bn, against L283bn in what Imi
described yesterday as an 'exceptionally favourable' first half last year.
The group pointed out, however, that profit was in line with the second half
of 1993. Imi's board indicated yesterday that the company was likely to pay
an unchanged dividend of L400 per share for 1994.
In January, the Italian treasury sold just over half of its 60 per cent
stake in Imi in one of the first large public offers by the government, and
now owns 28 per cent. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, indicated in
June that once the nine-month freeze on selling more shares was over - in
November - the treasury would consider reducing its holding still further.
Imi is studying the possibilities, which could include a direct offer to
foreign investors, or a reinforced 'hard core' of large Italian banks, such
as Cariplo, San Paolo di Torino and Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which are
Imi's largest shareholders after the treasury. At the moment, however, it
looks as though a combination of less favourable market conditions, and
reluctance to undermine other privatisation issues will delay the sale of a
second tranche.
Imi's main activities are medium and long-term lending, personal financial
services and investment banking. During the first half the group said that
it had generated a 'significant flow of commission' from its corporate
finance and share placement activities.
During the first half the group's credits rose to L50,783bn, up 1.2 per cent
compared with the end of last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental
telecommunications operator, yesterday announced a 15.2 per cent rise in net
consolidated profits to Es2.2bn (Dollars 14m) for the first half of 1994,
due mainly to a 16 per cent increase in traffic.
Operating profits, buoyed by cost containment, rose 123.8 per cent to
Es8.3bn. However, Marconi registered a financial loss of Es1.4bn compared
with a profit of Es533m in the first half of 1993.
The company attributed this to the negative results of telecommunication
holdings, particularly Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais, a mobile telephone
operator of which Marconi owns 33 per cent.
TMN's sales increased 48 per cent to Es9.3bn in the first half and the
five-year-old company is forecast to show a profit next year.
Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, is expected to be brought into
Portugal Telecom, the state telecommunications group, before 25 to 30 per
cent of PT is privatised nextyear.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: A long haul for Credit Lyonnais
 -David Buchan explains why the heavy losses will continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is still light at the end of the tunnel for Credit Lyonnais, Mr Jean
Peyrelevade believes, but the tunnel is proving far longer than he thought
when he took over as chairman of the state-controlled bank nearly a year
ago.
Credit Lyonnais will today announce a hefty first-half net loss after
provisions. Last year the bank reported a full year loss of FFr6.9bn
(Dollars 1.3bn).
In the first six months of 1994, Credit Lyonnais suffered from the decline
in the demand for bank loans by France's cash-rich companies, but also saw
its profits from trading on more depressed capital markets fall sharply.
At the same time, Credit Lyonnais still reckons it must maintain a high
level of provisions throughout this year to clean up its messy past.
One result is an inevitable delay to the further capital increase that
Credit Lyonnais needs, beyond the FFr4.9bn that it got in July from the
state, the state-owned Thomson electronics group and the Caisse des Depots
bank, which together make up 80 per cent of its capital.
At 8.3 per cent, Credit Lyonnais's solvency ratio is in need of further
strengthening.
Committed to public spending rigour, the Balladur government has no means to
buttress the bank's capital any further, and has told Credit Lyonnais that
it can tap the stock market any time before the full privatisation expected
in the late 1990s.
But realistically, the bank realises it has no chance of attracting
investors until next year, when it hopes for strong expansion in the French
economy and the start of the turnaround in its own finances.
Provisions against bad risks and loans are clearly the main millstone around
the neck of Credit Lyonnais.
For last year, Mr Peyrelevade set aside a total of FFr17.8bn, with just over
half of this considered normal provisions on 'current' banking business and
the rest 'exceptional' measures to compensate for precautions which the
previous regime of Mr Jean-Yves Haberer should have taken earlier,
particularly in non-traditional banking activities such as investments in
industry, property development and cinema.
It is clear, however, that both categories of provision will remain high
this year. The bank says this is not because it has uncovered any new real
horrors, but is mainly because its branch managers have decided to take
advantage of the 'big sweep-out' to make a clean breast of all past problems
as well as to be far more cautious on new business. This has been welcomed,
even encouraged, by the bank's new auditors.
By contrast, the French Treasury has not been totally enthusiastic about
continued high provisions, wiping out hope of any dividend for the state and
maintaining the question mark over how it let Credit Lyonnais get into such
bad shape in the first place. But after a parliamentary inquiry's critical
conclusions about their competence, or lack of it, the Treasury has been
ill-placed to oppose Mr Peyrelevade's stringency.
This stringency has uncovered further problems, and need for provisions, in
the group's Althus and Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO) subsidiaries.
It was the proud boast of the high-rolling Mr Jean-Francois Henin that when
he ran Althus from 1990-93 he multiplied its balance sheet many times over
but never increased its staff.
The upshot was a chaotic back office, out of which dubious dossiers are
still emerging. SDBO was the vehicle for loans to Mr Bernard Tapie. After
all the fuss it made in mortgaging and eventually seizing the
politician-tycoon's valuables, Credit Lyonnais has discovered this summer
that Mr Tapie's art and furniture are only worth perhaps a tenth of the
FFr350m the bank was counting on.
The one shaft of light penetrating the tunnel so far is that growth in the
group's operating costs and depreciation which was 4.1 per cent last year
has been kept close to zero this year.
Mr Peyrelevade has frozen his own salary and those of his top two dozen
lieutenants, and is cutting 1,100 banking jobs in France and a further 900
in Europe over the current year.
This is part of the two-pronged strategy to:
Improve profitability and efficiency in the core banking business.
Measures already announced include closure of some UK retail branches to
focus more on corporate banking and market trading there, and new
centralised management of European banking and foreign exchange trading
worldwide.
Sell FFr20bn worth of non-core industrial participations in 1994-95.
This programme is on track, and so far FFr6bn worth of assets have been
sold. They include big stakes in the Fnac record and book chain, the UAF
life insurance company (with Credit Lyonnais still retaining the majority),
the Essilor spectacle lens company, and the TF1 television station.
Credit Lyonnais is now said to want to sell its 10 per cent stake in the
Meridien hotel chain to Forte, the UK group which is buying control of
Meridien from Air France.
Even though the eventual plan is for Credit Lyonnais to keep some FFr30bn
worth of industrial holdings, for the moment 'anything that is outside
banking is, in principle, sellable,' says one bank executive.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield climbs to Pounds 4m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsfield, the property company chaired by Mr Elliott Bernerd which came to
the market last December, announced interim pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 4.03m and plans to press ahead with a large central
London office development.
The company also announced the sale of a 50 per cent stake in Wool House, an
office block in the St James's area of London's West End, to AMP Asset
management for Pounds 20.5m. The price is equivalent to half the book value
of Wool House in Chelsfield's accounts.
Chelsfield will use the proceeds to build up to 120,000 sq ft of new office
space in partnership with AMP.
Mr Bernerd said that rents were moving in the company's favour, so the
decision had been taken to start development without pre-letting space to
tenants.
In the six months to June 30 net income from properties amounted to Pounds
8.4m (Pounds 6.9m). Mr Bernerd said that the outcome of rent reviews due to
take place at the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands, in which
Chelsfield has a 50 per cent stake, will have a big impact on future rental
income.
Interest costs were sharply lower at Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 7.38m), and
administration expenses were Pounds 2.32m against Pounds 2.83m. Earnings per
share were 2.1p, adjusted for shares issued at the time of the float,
against 2.2p.
The interim dividend is 1p and the company plans to make a 1.4p final
pay-out.
The shares closed unchanged at 163p against an offer price of 155p in
December.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fluctuating milk prices behind Golden
Vale's fall to IPounds 4.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fluctuations in milk prices led to a 52 per cent drop in pre-tax profits at
Golden Vale, the Irish diary group, although acquisitions lifted turnover at
the interim stage.
In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 9.14m to
IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.37m). Operating profits fell from IPounds 10.03m to
IPounds 6.61m, which included a reorganisation charge of Pounds 1.52m.
Turnover increased by 39 per cent from IPounds 184.5m to IPounds 256.1m,
including a IPounds 77.9m contribution from acquisitions.
Sales in the dairy and food products division were down from IPounds 164m to
IPounds 154.6m.
Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, reiterated a warning first issued in June
that pre-tax profits for the full year would fall by a third.
The share price, which shed 30 per cent after the first profits warning,
closed up 2p at 57p yesterday.
The fall in profits was caused by a number of factors, he said. The
imbalance between the price paid to suppliers for milk and the market price
of products caused a IPounds 2m drop in the contribution to operating
profits from milk.
However, production efficiencies and improved margins produced a IPounds
800,000 contribution from milk related products.
An unchanged interim dividend of 0.6p was declared. Earnings per share fell
from 4.66p to 2.3p.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety in Spain
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group that owns Spillers, yesterday
bought two privately owned Spanish pet food companies as part of its
strategy of expanding its European pet food business.
Last week, announcing a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 120.1m
for the year to end June, the group said it would be seeking more
acquisitions in continental Europe, where it will be focusing on food
ingredients and pet foods.
The price of the Spanish deal was not revealed, but the group is thought to
have paid close to the two companies' combined annual turnover of Pounds
17m. Their combined assets are Pounds 11m and operating profits Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety chief executive, said the group had had no
presence in Spain.
Last year, Dalgety paid Pounds 42m for BP's Paragon Petcare, giving it
access to the French, German, Dutch and Belgian markets.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Malaya to acquire Heron dealership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaya Group, the USM-quoted motor distributor, has agreed terms in
principle to acquire Heron Motor Group, the motor dealership arm of Mr
Gerald Ronson's Heron group.
Industry sources suggest that the consideration will be about Pounds 16m.
Malaya's shares were suspended yesterday, pending a further announcement 'in
the next few weeks'. Mr Nick Lancaster, chief executive, said this was to
staunch rumours that had been circulating in the trade. He expected
completion at the end of October.
He added that the Stock Exchange was treating the deal as a reverse, because
until August 1992, when Mr Lancaster and a concert party bought into the
group, it had been virtually as hell. Mr Lancaster said that most of
Malaya's acquisitions took place in the second half of the last financial
year and the first eight months of this.
As a reverse takeover, the exchange has concerns over continuity of
management and it is understood this accounts for the delay. Malaya wants Mr
John Bradley, managing director of Heron Motor, to join the Malaya board.
Heron Motor includes the London-based businesses of HR Owen, HMG Bromley and
Stockport-based Hollingdrake. Turnover of the combined group is expected to
be about Pounds 150m-Pounds 160m, with Heron contributing some Pounds 90m.
The sale proceeds will help cut debt at Heron Corporation, a subsidiary of
Heron International, which is currently undergoing financial restructuring.
Under this, bondholders will receive no payment until the bank creditors of
Heron Corporation have been paid off.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Waverley Mining Finance, the mining investment company which has changed its
year end to June, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 259,445 for the period
to June 30. For the year to March 31 1993 there were losses of Pounds
63,411.
The company said this reflected the cost of professional advisers retained
during the takeover of Westralian Resource Projects in March 1994 and the
'technical assessment' of unquoted investment opportunities.
Losses per share rose to 1.8p (0.6p).
Net asset value per 5p share was 40.9p at June 30 compared with 33p at March
31 1993.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me shares dip 20p on fall to Pounds
13.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market reacted critically to a fall in headline pre-tax profits at
Photo-Me International, marking the shares of the world's largest
photo-booth manufacturer and operator down 20p to 235p.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 16.2m) in the year to April 30,
though the group was keen to stress that operating profits rose, albeit
modestly, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 31.3m and that group profits were up
at Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.4m), after depreciation of Pounds 15.8m (Pounds
16.2m).
Below this the devaluation of sterling in the previous year contributed
Pounds 4.15m to last time's figures, against a mere Pounds 93,000 this time.
Further there were exceptional costs of Pounds 1.67m arising from the
group's merger with KIS of France, which was agreed by PMI's shareholders in
February.
Although KIS was part of the group for only for two months, PMI has stated
its accounts as if it had been on board not only for the year under review
but also the previous 12 months.
Mr Dan David, chairman, said that the merger with KIS, with which PMI had
had a three-year relationship previously, had added 'a new technological
dimension', specifically Argentic, which freezes video images into high
quality still photographs.
Mr David Miller, group managing director, added that a 15 per cent increase
in revenue was expected from this new technology, derived from 10 per cent
cheaper manufacturing costs, more customer choice and lower consumables.
Group turnover declined to Pounds 172.4m (Pounds 175m), after the sale of
two 'chunky, but distant' subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand to local
owners. Mr David said, though that they were still contributing to the
group's profits.
The group currently has more than 18,000 photo-booths sold and serviced in
more than 100 countries, of which PMI has agents in about 70.
Mr David expected the group to have some 19,700 in the current year,
including 500 Imagemaker booths, which create larger photos. PMI was also
'cautiously excited' by the prospect of photographs on UK driving licences,
which should be introduced during 1996.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.26p (11.52p) but the final dividend is
lifted to 3.3p (3.2p) for a total payment up 0.2p at 4.8p.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Gas production rise helps Seafield leap to
Pounds 1.08m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp jump in gas production helped Seafield Resources, the USM-quoted
exploration company, to announce a fivefold increase in net profits from
Pounds 216,000 to Pounds 1.08m for the six months to June 30. Turnover rose
40 per cent from Pounds 3.01m to Pounds 4.2m.
The company warned that annual profits would not show such a substantial
rise, owing to the nature of its gas contracts. The profits had been helped
by a 60 per cent increase in production from its main producing asset, the
Victor field. However, this was sold at an average annual rate and so
profits in the UK were expected to be similar to those achieved last year.
Profits were also helped by higher gas prices and lower losses in the US
after disposals. Earnings per share rose from 0.4p to 2.1p. As in previous
years, there was no interim dividend.
Mr Roger Witts, finance director, said the group was encouraged by its
exploration success so far this year. Seafield made its second discovery on
the 21/16 North Sea block and won an interest in neighbouring acreage that
was 'potentially very significant for the company'.
Seafield plans to participate in the drilling of a further 16 wells in the
UK and overseas before the end of 1995. The drilling activity is expected to
erode the group's net cash position, although it Mr Witts said it would
'remain cash positive' at the year-end. The Schooner field, in which
Seafield has a 0.69 per cent fixed equity interest, is on track to produce
its first gas in 1996.

fall
</HEADLINE>

   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fluctuations in milk prices led to a 52 per cent drop in pre-tax profits at
Golden Vale, the Irish diary group, although acquisitions lifted turnover at
the interim stage.
In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 9.14m to
IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.37m). Operating profits fell from IPounds 10.03m to
IPounds 6.61m, which included a reorganisation charge of Pounds 1.52m.
Turnover increased by 39 per cent from IPounds 184.5m to IPounds 256.1m,
including a IPounds 77.9m contribution from acquisitions. Sales in the dairy
and food products division were down from IPounds 164m to IPounds 154.6m.
Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, reiterated a warning first issued in June
that pre-tax profits for the full year would fall by a third.
The share price, which shed 30 per cent after the first profits warning,
closed up 2p at 57p yesterday.
He said however, that the doubling of the company's processed cheese
business as a result of acquisitions, as well as the integration of its UK
sales and distribution businesses, provided a sound basis for medium-term
development.
The fall in profits was caused by a number of factors, he said. The
imbalance between the price paid to suppliers for milk and the market price
of products caused a IPounds 2m drop in the contribution to operating
profits from milk. However, production efficiencies and improved margins
produced a IPounds 800,000 contribution from milk related products.
A decline in volumes affected the contribution from processed cheese which
fell by IPounds 700,000, while a reduction in margins in spreads cut that
division's contribution by IPounds 600,000.
An unchanged interim dividend of 0.6p was declared. Earnings per share fell
from 4.66p to 2.3p.
Acquisition talks with Vonkpol in Poland and Haslington in the UK had been
abandoned, Mr O'Mahony said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures shares dive 50p after
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Aerostructures Hamble, the former British Aerospace aircraft
components subsidiary floated last May, nosedived yesterday after a trading
statement warned of difficulties with several contracts.
The shares, issued at 120p, fell by 50p to close at 73p.
At the time of the float, four of the directors involved in the 1990
management buy-out from BAe sold 2.9m shares worth almost Pounds 3.5m. Mr
Andy Barr, the chief executive, who retained a 5.93 per cent stake, sold
1.45m shares.
Yesterday's statement - described by one City analyst as 'nebulous' - opened
with a bald statement that British Aerospace, Aerostructure's biggest
customer, had 'published its interim results this morning.'
Aerostructures - chaired by Lord King - has been working to reduce its
dependency on its former owner, which accounted for 93 per cent of its
business in 1990 and 78 per cent last year. However, the statement did not
refer to any particular British Aerospace contract.
The company said that, while trading in the first half was broadly in line
with expectations, 'operational difficulties encountered recently have led
to margins on a number of contracts being placed under pressure,' adversely
affecting the full-year result.
British Aerospace said yesterday that costs were being cut at the Jetstream
and Avro regional passenger aircraft businesses. The intention was to stem
losses caused by reduced production volumes because of poor demand. It added
that suppliers had agreed to price cuts.
Aerostructures has contracts to build parts for both the Avro RJ/146
regional jet and the Jetstream 61/ATP.
Aerostructures, which will report its interim results early next month, said
the board was 'acting to rectify the operational problems.' It was also
'examining the need for further action in the light of the continuing
unfavourable conditions in the aerospace sector.'
The prospectus, in which the directors described the long-term outlook for
the civil aircraft market as 'positive,' showed that operating profit
margins had been lifted from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 11.3 per cent last
year.
One analyst suggested yesterday that if BAe were losing money on its
aircraft, it would not be pleased by such high margins at its
subcontractors.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas highlights recovery with
11% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in the UK building market was once again highlighted yesterday
when Tilbury Douglas, the construction group, reported an 11 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits on continuing operations at Pounds 6.1m for the
first six months of the year.
Overall, the pre-tax figure showed a fall from Pounds 12.8m, although this
included the Pounds 6.8m proceeds from the sale of Douglas Concrete among
the exceptional items.
Tilbury's equipment division was the driving force behind the growth, with
pre-tax profits there increasing nearly threefold to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds
593,000) on turnover 17 per cent higher at Pounds 14.49m (Pounds 12.35m).
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said that overseas contracts had
bolstered the performance, with the group providing the equipment needs for
some high profile projects, such as the Pounds 10m Ma Wan Viaduct project in
Hong Kong.
Within group turnover ahead 18 per cent to Pounds 199.07m (Pounds 169.35m),
construction accounted for Pounds 172.12m (Pounds 139.62m) - an increase of
23 per cent. However, profits declined 14 per cent to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds
3.52m). Mr Bottjer blamed tighter margins, although he added that the
benefit from the higher turnover would feed through to the profit line
during the second half.
Profits in the Scottish housing division fell from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds
1.3m on slightly improved turnover of Pounds 7.58m (Pounds 7.37m). Mr
Bottjer said the situation remained tough, although he foresaw a slow
improvement. 'Providing land prices are reasonably contained, Scottish
housebuilding looks set for medium term growth,' he said.
Construction work in hand was ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 215m, with
mainstream building and specialist contracting showing improved order books.
Contracting in the civil engineering business was stalled by concerns in the
water industry over regulatory issues, but the company expects work to begin
picking up, following the recent issue of the Ofwat report.
The interim dividend was held at 10.5p, with the company expecting to pay a
maintained total of 33p. Earnings per share came to 11.9p, against 26.9p.
The shares responded positively, closing 15p ahead at 563p.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten advances 11% - Growth
provided by car distribution but difficulties in clothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tibbett &amp; Britten, the distribution group, reported an 11 per cent increase
in first-half profits, but failed to keep pace with expectations that the UK
economic recovery would translate into increased revenues from its core
business.
The shares fell 42p to 768p, after Tibbett revealed pre-tax profits of
Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.4m) for the six months to July 2, on turnover up 15
per cent to Pounds 203m (Pounds 177m).
Mr John Harvey, chairman, said that 'the present trading environment is
tough, with margins generally under pressure.' Most brokers marked down 1994
profit forecasts by some Pounds 1.5m to a new consensus of Pounds 27m.
However, the group's UK business has secured substantial new contracts, from
companies including Mars and Jacobs Bakery, which bodes well for next year.
Profits growth for the period came primarily from Silcock Express, the car
distributor purchased in late 1992 and strengthened by the purchase of
Toleman in March. Divisional profits increased by Pounds 1.5m to 5.5m.
Tibbett &amp; Britten Ltd, the core UK business, fared less well, with profits
edging up to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 7m). The subsidiary suffered from
difficulties in its clothing network.
The group has been making a substantial push overseas, and the UK accounted
for 71 per cent of revenues, compared with 97 per cent in 1991.
Tibbett &amp; Britten International increased turnover by 62 per cent. Progress
in its three main markets of Canada, South Africa and Portugal helped lift
operating profit from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 600,000.
Profit margins overseas remained razor thin, but Mr Harvey said this
reflected the level of investment in new facilities.
He said the international division should be able to achieve the 6.6 per
cent profit margins of the UK, compared with 2 per cent now, but the
improvement would be slowed by continuing investment.
Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 39m, bringing net
borrowings to Pounds 33m. Mr Harvey suggested that the year end figure could
rise to Pounds 55m.
The increase in the interim dividend to 5p (4.5p) is in proportion with
earnings per share, up from 17.5p to 19.4p.
COMMENT
The danger with a premium stock market rating, is that investors expect
earnings growth to match. Tibbett's shares remain at a 29 per cent premium
to the stock market, and parts of its UK business are looking decidedly
mature. Profits should hit Pounds 27m this year, representing a p/e of 18.3.
International expansion offers good longer-term prospects, and the
management performance justifies a high stock market rating. However, it
does not justify the current level, and the shares are likely to lag in the
short-term.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exco on target with Pounds 28m but third
quarter 'subdued'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the moneybroking company that returned to the stock market in July,
yesterday announced profits in line with prospectus forecasts, but said that
trading in the third quarter of the year had remained 'subdued.'
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose by 31 per cent from
Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 28m, marginally higher than the Pounds 27.5m
forecast.
There were substantial increases in the contribution from the three
moneybroking businesses of spot foreign exchange, money markets and
derivatives, while the fixed income securities broking continued to grow.
The company said that 'banks around the world (are) adopting a more cautious
approach to trading,' and there had been little sign of recovery from the
summer lull.
Exco operates a global business, but the bulk of earnings growth came from
Europe, where operating profit more than doubled to Pounds 9.59m (Pounds
4.35m), aided by newly-acquired CMS, in Zurich.
North America remained the largest contributor, with profits of Pounds 12m,
up from Pounds 10.2m. Asia Pacific showed a marginal decline to Pounds 5.32m
(Pounds 5.78m), reflecting uncertainty in Japan.
Turnover overall rose 22 per cent from Pounds 103m to Pounds 126m, while
operating costs rose to Pounds 100m (Pounds 85.2m).
Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 11.9p (9.5p). A delayed interim
dividend will be paid in mid-January, representing a part payment of the
final dividend.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: LDV talks on east European link -
Significant expansion potential for largest UK-owned vehicle maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LDV, the Birmingham-based van maker rescued from last year's crash of the
Anglo-Dutch DAF commercial vehic-les group, is in advanced negotiations for
its vans to be assembled in eastern Europe and for the resumption of
exp-orts to west European markets.
A successful outcome for both sets of talks would provide significant
expansion potential for LDV, which has become the biggest UK-owned vehicle
maker as a result of the sale to BMW of Rover Group. As Freight Rover, LDV
was itself part of the formerly UK state-owned Rover Group until being hived
off to DAF in 1987.
LDV yesterday disclosed a further rise in profits and production levels,
having already added 200 jobs since a management-led buy-out from the
receivers in April last year.
The near 1,200 employees at the Washwood Heath plant were told that LDV made
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m on a Pounds 72m turnover in the six months
to June, compared with Pounds 8.6m on Pounds 80m in the company's first
eight months of operations last year.
With the UK's light commercial vehicles market continuing on a firm recovery
course - sales are up 16 per cent so far this year - predictions made by LDV
that it would achieve a Pounds 150m turnover this year are already appearing
conservative.
The company, whose Pounds 40m buy-out was backed by the 3i venture capital
group, Royal Bank of Scotland and United Dominions Trust, is investing
Pounds 30m in improving manufacturing facilities and developing the Bulldog,
a replacement for its existing van ranges which will appear in about 18
months' time.
LDV's own UK sales were up 25 per cent in the first eight months of the year
and it has twice increased output rates. The plant is currently producing
300 vans a week, compared with 200 in March, and total production this year
is expected to reach 12,500 compared with a claimed break-even level of
9,000. LDV's UK current market share of around 12 per cent compares with
just over 6 per cent at the time of the buy-out.
Agreement with LDV's as yet unnamed east European partner could be finalised
within three or four months, after nearly a year of negotiating, Mr Allan
Amey, LDV's chief executive, said yesterday. The intended production site is
understood to be in one of the former eastern block countries like Hungary
or Czechoslovakia rather than Russia itself.
LDV is also negotiating with three prospective distributors of its vehicles
in western Europe, including DAF Trucks, the Dutch commercial vehicle
operations rescued by the Dutch and Belgium governments from the original
DAF group's wreckage.
Before DAF collapsed in January last year, up to 7,000 of the
Birmingham-built vans were being sold each year through its continental
European dealerships.
LDV's intention is to conclude a west European distribution deal within six
months, said Mr Amey, who in February was voted Midlands 'businessman of the
year'. Continental Western Europe should be able to provide LDV with at
least another 4,000 to 5,000 sales a year, according to Mr Amey. He refused
to disclose the potential size of the east European venture but said: 'We're
getting pretty excited about it.'
About 5 per cent of LDV's output is already exported, mainly outside Europe,
and an assembly venture in South Africa is currently being explored.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill recovers to Pounds 3.8m
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel Burrill Jones Group, the insurance and reinsurance group, yesterday
returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.79m for the first
half of 1994 compared with losses of Pounds 3.92m.
Mr Christopher Burrill, finance director, said the turnround had been
achieved through a restructuring of the business during the last year.
He added that the group's trading profit of Pounds 4.39m, before loss on
disposal of the group's north American subsidiary, was 25 per cent higher
than the Pounds 3.52m last time. However, he admitted that 'the overall
trading environment remains tough.'
Turnover slipped 2 per cent to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 23.4m). In the London
marine market, turnover dropped 13 per cent to Pounds 4.95m (Pounds 5.69m),
while the non-marine business slid 7 per cent to Pounds 7.93m (Pounds
8.57m).
However, there was an improvement in the retail broking and consultancy
business where turnover rose by 2 per cent from Pounds 9.91m to Pounds
10.2m.
Investment income declined by 34 per cent to Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 2.9m),
with the company blaming lower interest rates 'which continued to work
through on the group's liquid assets.'
The interim dividend is maintained at 3p, payable from earnings per share of
4.66p (7.62p losses).
As a result of the company's restructuring and reorganisation, which
involved a charge of Pounds 4.39m last time, total expenses fell by 32 per
cent to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 30.2m).
Mr Burrill said that the benefits of the cost cutting were now being
bolstered by the stability in the group's general business, with the
non-marine business in particular encouraging.
However, Mr Clive Richards, the chairman, struck a cautious note. 'It would
be unwise in present market conditions to expect any early underlying
increase in brokerage and fee income,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pittards back into the black at Pounds 1.1m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of its clothing business enabled Pittards, the leather
manufacturer, to return to the black with profits of Pounds 1.06m for the
first half of 1994, compared with losses of Pounds 310,000.
Operating profits were Pounds 1.85m, against Pounds 635,000 which included
losses of Pounds 837,000 on discontinued activities. In addition, the
comparable pre-tax figure was struck after closure losses of Pounds 135,000.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said the outlook for the rest of the year was
mixed. The gloving division had a reasonably full order book at satisfactory
margins but the shoe and leathergoods side would continue to struggle with
expensive raw material.
Turnover was Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 58.5m), including Pounds 307,000 (Pounds
8.34m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share came out 3.6p (2.2p
losses) and an interim dividend of 0.75p (nil) is declared.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BrightReasons coming to market with Pounds
70m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BrightReasons, the private company which owns the Pizzaland restaurants
chain, is planning to come to market after its annual results are published
late next month.
The group, which is expected to be capitalised at about Pounds 70m, plans to
clear its debts of more than Pounds 15m and raise a small amount of
additional capital in order to maintain its growth rate.
As well as 117 Pizzaland outlets, the group owns a chain of 32 Bella Pasta
restaurants and 17 Pizza Piazzas.
Mr Michael Guthrie, group founder and chairman, said yesterday that
Pizzaland, which has an average spend of Pounds 6 a head, was represented in
80 towns and cities in the UK. There were 100 other places with the right
profile to launch a new branch.
Bella Pasta, which Mr Guthrie claimed was the only pasta chain in the
country, could expand to a further 100 sites, and Pizza Piazza to a further
25.
The group made operating profits of Pounds 4.07m in the nine months to June
30 on sales of Pounds 56.1m. It paid interest of Pounds 1.19m.
Mr Guthrie, a former chairman and chief executive of Mecca Leisure, started
the group with the purchase of a chain of 136 lossmaking restaurants from
Grand Metropolitan for Pounds 16m in 1991. A further 44 restaurants were
purchased from Rank early last year.
The pizza chain was given a more European feel and a wider range of menu,
and returned a small profit in its first year.
Mr Guthrie said the UK market for pizza and pasta restaurants had grown by
more than 25 per cent in real terms since 1986, and he expected further
strong growth as eating out continued to become more popular.
The main shareholders in BrightReasons are Mercury Asset Management, with 53
per cent, and the management, with 29 per cent.
Some of the management will be selling shares, but Mr Guthrie will not be
selling any of his 8 1/2 per cent stake.
Sponsors to the issue will be Samuel Montagu, and UBS is broker.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Steel in east Asian expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel is continuing its expansion in east Asia, destined to be the
main growth market for steel over the next decade, through the signing of a
joint venture to establish a steel roll forming facility in Kuala Lumpur.
European Profiles, a British Steel subsidiary, is linking with Zelleco
Holdings, a large Malaysian construction company. It brings the number of
operations in British Steel's Asia-Pacific network to 12.
It recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and exports to
the region are continuing to grow.
European Profiles, based near Swansea, is one of two profiling companies
bought by British Steel from RTZ earlier this year. It has been exporting
profiled steel cladding to the east Asia for 12 years.
The new company, to be called European Profiles (Malaysia), will use steel
from South Wales as its raw material.
Profiled steel cladding is used in the construction of power stations, and
the new company's first order will be to supply 85,000 sq m of cladding to a
power station project in Surabaya, Indon-esia.
Financial details of the joint venture were not disclosed. It comes less
than a week after British Steel announced a restructuring of its profiling
operations in the UK in response to overcapacity problems.
A profiling plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, will close with the
loss of 56 jobs, and production will be concentrated at the two former RTZ
plants.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: William Sindall shares dip 16%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in William Sindall retreated 16 per cent yesterday after the building
company said it was in talks which 'could result in a major acquisition and
fund raising exercise.'
The statement continued: 'However, it is envisaged that any issue of
ordinary shares made in connection with these proposals would be at a
discount to the current midmarket price.' The company refused to comment
further.
Sindall shares closed down 17p at 88p. The announcement had been prompted by
a recent surge in the shares.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cash &amp; carry sale blamed for
Fitzwilton depression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fitzwilton, the Irish industrial holding group with significant food
retailing interests, reported a reduction in pre-tax profits from IPounds
1.02m to IPounds 259,000 (Pounds 255,730) in the six months to June 30.
However, profits from continuing operations surged from IPounds 941,000 to
IPounds 3.23m. The shares closed 1p up at 44p.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman and owner of a 15.23 per cent stake, said the
period had been influenced by four developments.
Of these, the sale of the M6 Cash &amp; Carry division to Nurdin &amp; Peacock lay
behind the depressed pre-tax profits. Mr Patrick Dowling, finance director,
said the Pounds 21.9m sale, plus the assumption by N&amp;P of Pounds 10.5m debt
was 'a heck of a good price.'
In another development Fitzwilton raised its stake in FA Wellworth from 43
to 97 per cent, concentrating group activities within Northern Ireland's
food retailing sector.
Some IPounds 50m of new equity raised in the period marked the third
development and helped finance the IPounds 41m purchase of the extra 54 per
cent of Wellworth. The retailer was bought with venture capital partners
from Isosceles for IPounds 120m, which Mr Dowling said looked very
favourable 'in the light of what Tesco paid for Wm Low.'
Wellworth is set to contribute 70 per cent of group profits this year. In
the 53 weeks to April 30, the 36-store retailer raised operating profits to
Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 16.3m in the previous 52 weeks.
The fourth influence in the period was the turnround at Waterford Wedgwood.
Fitzwilton's 9.4 per cent holding, worth some IPounds 40m, represents 40 per
cent of its capitalisation.
Total losses per share were 0.52p (0.31p), but, on continuing activities,
earnings were 0.84p (losses 0.18p). The interim dividend is reduced to 1p
(1.5p).

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe rises to Pounds 31.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group that
made a Pounds 64.4m rights issue last December, lifted interim pre-tax
profits 16 per cent from Pounds 27m to Pounds 31.2m. Turnover for the six
months to June 30 rose 24 per cent, from Pounds 163.6m to Pounds 202.2m.
Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said the results showed 'a satisfactory
improvement'. The group, which has 83 companies operating in 11 business
sectors, was continuing to look for acquisitions in niche businesses
following last month's Pounds 4.4m purchase of Bohlin Instruments.
The group, ungeared since the rights issue, generated Pounds 11.4m (Pounds
6.3m) from continuing operations. Net liquid funds at 30 June totalled
Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 23.6m at December 31 1993).
Acquisitions were behind the improvement in the US, which reported operating
profits of Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.2m) and accounted for 37 per cent of the
group total. Turnover rose from Pounds 51.6m to Pounds 80.6m.
A good exports performance was behind the Pounds 1.3m increase in UK
operating profits to Pounds 8.2m, 26 per cent of the group total. There were
signs of recovery in Europe, where operating profits edged ahead by Pounds
600,000 to Pounds 9.4m, or 30 per cent of the total.
The group said that, while outlook for the rest of the year was
satisfactory, there was evidence of a slower US growth rate and margins
continued to be under pressure in Europe. The group maintained first half
margins at 15.1 per cent. Earnings per share were ahead 3.7 per cent from
8.91p to 9.24p after dilution for the rights issue. The interim dividend
rises from 1.88p to 1.96p.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Barratt advances 72% to Pounds 35.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barratt Developments yesterday underlined the strength of the recovery in
the group's fortunes and the UK housing market with a 72 per cent rise from
Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 35.2m in full-year profits to June 30.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman, said the pace of recovery in the south-east
was one of the most significant factors in the continuing recovery. 'After
substantial losses over the previous four years, the return to profitable
trading of our southern region subsidiaries is a major achievement,' he
said.
Turnover increased 23 per cent to Pounds 498.9m (Pounds 405.3m). Earnings
per share rose 39 per cent to 12.9p (9.3p). The final dividend is 4p (3p)
for a total for the year of 6p (4p).
Sir Lawrie, 66, who came out of retirement three years ago after the group
began to incur heavy losses, took the opportunity yesterday to scotch press
speculation that he was about to step down. 'Rumours of my resignation have
been greatly exaggerated,' he said, adding that he intended to see out the
remaining two years of his agreed tenure.
Mr Frank Eaton, chief executive, said price rises nationwide for new houses
were ahead of inflation and running between 5 and 10 per cent ahead of a
year ago in the south-east.
However, older Barratt properties were proving harder to make price rises
stick and overall prices were stagnant. Mr Eaton forecast similar price
rises for the following 12 months, with volumes likely to be ahead 10 per
cent. The average price of a Barratt house last year was Pounds 74,900
against Pounds 74,800 the previous year.
Operating margins improved from 8 per cent to 10.4 per cent, which the
company put down to a general improvement in the housing market. Mr Eaton
said that the company had withstood pressure from suppliers to pass cost
increases on.
COMMENT
The miserly rise in Barratt's share price yesterday showed less attention to
the group's seemingly good results and more to the issue currently occupying
investors minds: interest rates. Profit forecasts have been raised some 8
per cent for next year to around the Pounds 50m mark. This would give 18.6p
of earnings and a prospective p/e of 9.6 - undemanding, particularly when
compared with the likes of Bryant and the construction sector as a whole.
But while expectations of interest rates remain upward, and given the
caution of some investors towards volume housebuilders after the severity of
the recession, the shares are unlikely to show any great improvement.

FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Innovative buy-back at Northern
Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric bought back 10 per cent of its shares yesterday after
announcing an innovative method of effecting the purchases which could
entitle sellers to significant tax credits.
Although six other regional electricity companies have bought back shares
none of them are near the 10 per cent level which most set as limits when
seeking shareholder approval.
Several have been considering programmes of the type launched by Northern
yesterday but have backed off because of uncertainty over the Inland
Revenue's stance.
Northern yesterday made clear that potential entitlements to tax credits
under its scheme would be a matter which shareholders would have to
negotiate individually with the Inland Revenue.
It could not give any assurance that the tax credit would ultimately be
realised. However the company would provide vouchers showing information
including the associated tax credit.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Northern's broker, said last night that it had
bought 12.4m shares yesterday at between 812p and 818p. Northern's shares
closed at 813p yesterday, a rise of 19p.
Through the Northern scheme, BZW acted as an agent to effect on-market
purchases rather than a market maker. The idea is that a shareholder who
sells shares to the company through an agent would be treated as receiving a
'qualifying distribution', or income similar to a dividend, for tax
purposes.
The amount treated as a distribution is the repurchase price of the shares
less their nominal value of 50p.
Analysts gave it a mixed welcome. Some praised the company and its advisers
for devising a scheme that gave investors the possibility of higher rewards
than they expected. Others believed the market may punish the company, by
downgrading its shares, if the Inland Revenue failed to give tax credits in
large quantities.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Arjo allays fears of large rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Arjo Wiggins Appleton rose by 12p to 263p yesterday after the
Anglo-French paper group denied that it would bid for SD Warren, owner of
four big US paper mills. Warren is being auctioned by Scott Paper Company.
Arjo said, however, it was 'investigating ways whereby it might participate
in a significantly smaller proportion of SD Warren's business in conjunction
with a partner.'
Analysts described the share price rise as a collective sigh of relief that
Arjo would not be launching a substantial rights issue to fund an
acquisition.
Mr Mike Brown of SG Warburg Securities said: 'The statement was overdue,
because the market was rife with these stories. It was emerging that there
were one or two favoured candidates at Warren and people were beginning to
put some numbers together.'
Arjo is likely to face stiff competition to buy the more attractive
operations at Warren, the world's largest maker of coated free-sheet paper.
The auction is due to close next week.
Arjo has been hit by wood pulp price increases of 45 per cent this year as
the recovery in the paper industry has led to a shortage of raw material.
With little pulp production of its own, it has been forced to pass on higher
costs.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Laporte up 14% to Pounds 58.6m - Strong
sales growth contributes to sharp rise in working capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the speciality chemicals group that acquired Evode for Pounds 129m
last January, increased pre-tax profits by 14 per cent from Pounds 51.3m to
Pounds 58.6m in the six months to July 3.
Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that the group had experienced 'modest'
improvements in trading conditions in many of its major markets, with the
trend accelerating in the second quarter.
But the strong sales growth at the end of the period contributed to a sharp
rise in working capital, about which Mr Minton said he was 'bloody angry'.
He added that some of the build up of debtors would reverse in the second
half.
Turnover rose 11.5 per cent to Pounds 490.8m. Laporte said that allowing for
disposals, sales increased by 16.8 per cent; however, this has not been
adjusted for acquisitions.
Earnings per share rose 9.5 per cent to 22p and the interim dividend is up 7
per cent to 7.9p (7.4p).
Stripping out disposals, operating margins slipped to 12.75 per cent (13 per
cent), but before depreciation - which rose Pounds 1.9m - and
rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 800,000) margins were ahead.
Mr Minton said he hoped to widen margins further helped by the
reorganisation of the group into 16 strategic business units. Started last
year the process is already yielding 'substantial' savings and is on track
to cut costs by 2 per cent after two years.
Laporte is also managing to push through some price rises helped by the
improving health of some of its customers, notably polymer manufacturers.
All five divisions reported higher profits with organics, construction
chemicals and engineering polymers/electronic chemicals showing strong
growth.
After a Pounds 30.7m jump in working capital, there was a cash outflow from
operations of Pounds 14.4m and net borrowings rose Pounds 4.7m to Pounds
139.9m during the period. However, the company stressed that this was partly
seasonal that net debt continued on a declining trend. Gearing was 41 per
cent, but interest cover 14.6 times.
COMMENT
The lingering worry with Laporte is that it tries too hard to impress. The
16.8 per cent figure for sales growth allowing for disposals was admirable,
but meaningless. Adjusting for the acquisition of Aztec and the extra month
from Evode, the underlying increase was nearer 10 per cent. That is
respectable enough though it is easy to see why Laporte might be tempted
into a bit of window dressing. Now that the main gains from Evode are in the
bank, it needs to show healthy organic growth to justify its premium share
rating. But on current forecasts its growth is lagging the rest of the
market. The solution might be another deal and after the success of Evode
the City would be likely to back a cash call. Another rights issue might
also push it back into the FT-SE 100.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spirax-Sarco achieves 24% expansion to
Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spirax-Sarco Engineering, the Cheltenham-based steam equipment specialist
which sells 85 per cent of its products overseas, reported a 24 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 14.1m, in the six
months to June 30.
Operating profit increased 23 per cent to Pounds 14.8m and operating margin
improved from 13.3 to 14.2 per cent.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said: 'The return to volume growth
which we achieved in the last quarter of 1993 has been maintained
consistently throughout the period, emphasising the international strength
of our business.'
He said the group was beginning to experience some increase in the price of
raw materials, but these were not a significant element in the final sales
price and would not have a material effect on margins.
Turnover increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 103.9m, of which 6 percentage
points were attributable to a full contribution from Spirax-Jucker, the
group's former Italian licensee which it bought for Pounds 13.4m last year.
The group said that while volume was unchanged in the UK, margins improved
and it was seeing the first signs of returning confidence.
Volumes grew in continental Europe in spite of continuing difficulties being
experienced in Germany and Italy. In particular, the group's sales
operations in France, Scandinavia and Spain achieved good improvements.
Mr Tappin said the main manufacturing activities in the UK, US and France
enjoyed higher levels of demand, in part following last year's inventory
reduction, and increased their shipments to its selling operations around
the world. Good productivity gains, coupled with tight cost control,
resulted in the improved manufacturing margins.
Group companies in the Americas increased volume and strong growth in Asian
markets helped subsidiaries in Korea, Singapore and Thailand to increase
their contribution to profits.
Gearing fell from 35 to 13 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 26 per cent
to 10.7p (8.5p). An interim dividend of 3.5p compares with 6.6p last time
when the payment was boosted to maximise the benefit from an enhanced scrip
dividend.

Kelvin Central, a Scottish bus company sold by Scottish Transport Group to a
management buy-out for Pounds 1 in 1990, is to be acquired by SBH, the
parent company of Strathclyde Buses Group, in a deal which values Kelvin at
Pounds 11.1m.
For each of their shares, SBH is offering Kelvin shareholders Pounds 10 in
cash or Pounds 10 nominal of loan notes or 10 new SBH shares. Over 53 per
cent of Kelvin's shareholders have agreed to accept the offer.
The management buy-out deal in 1990 included a Pounds 1m deferred
consideration, which Kelvin Central will now repay.
SBH reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m and turnover of Pounds 58.2m in
the year to March 31. At that date it had net assets of Pounds 21.5m. Kelvin
Central reported losses of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 27.3m in the
year to December 31. At that date it had net assets of Pounds 6.2m.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Jostling for position in German telecoms race: Christopher
Parkes sees RWE Energie join a stampede to the Infobahn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Convinced that they have heard the bell for the last lap, front-runners
among Germany's private telecommunications companies are dashing to qualify
for entry to Europe's 'information superhighway' stakes.
The mixed bunch of power suppliers, engineers and bankers have put on a
spurt since Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post office minister, announced 10 days ago
that he would allow free competition in the German telecoms network from
January 1, 1998 rather than the end of the decade.
RWE Energie attempted to nose ahead yesterday with an announcement that it
was in 'promising' negotiations to take over Preussag's communications
business, Mobilfunk.
But as Preussag was quick to point out, RWE was only one of several domestic
and international network operators discussing a possible tie-up. Mobilfunk,
which runs the Europe-wide AssCarfi/Talkline mobile telephone service, is
expected to show its first profit this year on sales of DM400m (Pounds
165m).
RWE's announcement was a response to Veba's tactical stroke earlier this
week when the energy-based conglomerate revealed that its network, of
5,600km of copper cable and optical links over its 2,000km of electricity
distribution lines, was to be augmented by access to the federal railways'
vast trackside and signalling system. Veba also agreed to invest Dollars
140m (Pounds 90m) in the Iridium communications satellite consortium in
return for rights to market its services.
The events sparked by Mr Botsch's statement on deregulation highlight the
speed at which Germany's private sector communications industry is
developing and its direction.
The industry started to take shape in 1990, when Mannesmann, heading a
consortium including Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless and Pacific Telesis of the
US, was awarded a licence to operate the country's first private mobile
telephone service, D2, in competition with Deutsche Telekom's D1.
Critics looked askance as Mannesmann, better known for its 'old technology'
products - steel pipes, car components and industrial plant - moved into
unknown territory. More questions were asked as set-up costs mounted and
delays set in. However, since the first hand-sets were delivered in
mid-1992, estimations have rocketed. Mannesmann's communications business,
which contributed 3 per cent to group sales last year, is now forecast to
yield up to half group profits in 1997.
Mannesmann's newly-established Eurokom subsidiary, which includes an
assortment of domestic and foreign stakes, owns half of a new joint venture
with RWE and Deutsche Bank. They are now preparing to open their lines to
corporate clients for data, voice and image transmission  - in a domestic
segment estimated to be worth DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) a year - and waiting to
offer services up to a wider international public.
RWE is involved in other ventures specialising in corporate services. It
made an important advance in May, when, as a leader of a data transmission
consortium it beat the Viag group in a bid for a licence allowing the first
private sector challenge to Telekom's Modacom.
Until yesterday, when it revealed its hand in its negotiations with
Preussag, its expectations of achieving DM500m sales in five years had been
conditioned by its highly-conservative assessments of prospects in the
corporate sector.
With its internal network, the second most extensive after Deutsche Bahn's,
it has now emerged as a clear contender for a place among the leaders.
Mr Ulrich Hartmann, chairman of Veba, outlined his claim to a pole position
in April when he declared telecoms was to be the group's fifth leg,
augmenting its solid activities such as power, oil, chemicals and trading.
The group started laying optical fibres along the power lines of its
PreussenElektra subsidiary in the late 1980s, but the pace has increased
steadily in the past two years with stakes which have taken it into the
mobile phone business in Germany and France, corporate networks and services
and Swiss cable television.
Veba has now revealed the scale of its ambition. According to Mr Hartmann,
the group will invest DM6bn in telecoms over the next decade. Turnover from
the sector will grow from DM140m this year to DM8bn by 2003.
Deutsche Telekom, facing private competitors who claim they can win 40 per
cent of its business, can be counted on to continue appealing for more time
to brace itself for the onslaught, but Mr Botsch has made his preferences
plain.
The sooner the nascent private telecoms industry is given scope to grow and
mature on its home ground, the greater its chances of building up muscle and
speed to compete effectively in the fast-track global market.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Cash flows out of BAe despite Rover disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underlying profits at British Aerospace trebled from Pounds 29m to Pounds
90m in the six months to June 30, but BAe shares fell 26p to 445p yesterday
when the market learned that the company saw a first-half cash outflow
despite the Pounds 800m sale of Rover to BMW.
Operating profits in defence of Pounds 221m, against Pounds 230m, were
offset by an increased loss of Pounds 79m (Pounds 75m) on commercial
aircraft.
The sale of Rover generated an exceptional profit of Pounds 299m. However,
exceptional losses of Pounds 16m on adjustment to the sale of BAe's
corporate jet division to Raytheon, Pounds 30m on the early repayment of
expensive debt, and Pounds 14m to top up the value of lease provisions cut
the total exceptional profit to Pounds 239m.
Total pre-tax profits were Pounds 329m, and the interim dividend was lifted
from 3.3p to 4p.
BAe's borrowings rose as working capital requirements increased and it
converted Pounds 220m of guarantees to associate company Hutchison Telecom
into a direct loan. Operating cash outflow was Pounds 115m in the first
half.
Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director, said the underlying trend in
cash flow was healthy. 'While the erratic timing of large cash payments can
distort the figures,' he added, 'over time cash flow from defence businesses
will more than offset any losses in commercial aircraft.'
Losses at the turbo-prop aircraft division, based in Prest-wick, Scotland
were particularly heavy. BAe chief executive, Mr Dick Evans, said conditions
in the regional aircraft market remained extremely difficult.
He said BAe had almost halved its cost base in these areas to remain
competitive, and that losses at the RJ regional jet business were much
lower, while work on Airbus moved further into profit in the first half.
BAe is continuing to negotiate with potential joint venture partners over
the future of the regional jet and turboprop businesses. Despite the losses,
Mr Mike Turner, the director responsible for the division, said BAe was 'in
no hurry to do a deal'.
The order book in the central defence business is now Pounds 8.5bn, only
slightly lower than the record figure of Pounds 8.8bn last year. With
substantial additional work on the final production phase of the Eurofighter
2000 due to be agreed in a year's time, one analyst said: 'BAe has the
strongest defence order book of any company in the world.'
Production of the 48 Tornado aircraft for Saudi Arabia has already started
and first deliveries are due at the end of 1995. Prospects for Hawk advanced
trainer/light fighter sales are also good, with South Africa, India and
Australia all having significant requirements.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Growth forecast for company earnings cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant banking and securities house,
has sharply reduced its forecast for UK company earnings growth next year,
and says City analysts are suffering from 'money illusion' in their profit
forecasts.
The firm is cutting 1995 earnings forecasts from 10 per cent to 8 per cent -
the lowest target in the market and barely half the consensus among UK
market analysts. Kleinwort is trimming forecasts for this year for UK
non-financial company profits from 17 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Edmond Warner of Kleinwort points to the turn in the interest rate cycle,
and to the likely impact on British companies of cost pressures and pricing
difficulties. Disappointment in company earnings could impact across the
range of a UK stock market which has focused on profits and dividends as the
driving force now that the interest rate outlook has become uncertain. Mr
Warner expects profit forecasts by City analysts to turn increasingly
towards downgrading of expectations following an interim reporting season
less robust than hoped.
He urges clients to target the UK bond markets for investment ahead of UK
equities, commenting that domestic conditions favour a rally in gilts.

FT  22 SEP 94 / US bankers step up their challenge to City's local heroes:
Nicholas Denton assesses the battle for M&amp;A clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston has broken new ground for US investment banks by acting as
sole adviser to Browning-Ferris Industries on its Pounds 364m hostile bid
for UK waste company Attwoods. BFI, itself a US company, may be a
longstanding international client but CSFB's role is an unusual one.
UK merchant banks, like their counterparts elsewhere, have tended to
dominate public deals in their home market. The Attwoods takeover battle is
one of the first, and certainly the largest on which a US investment bank
has been lead adviser to an aggressor in the UK.
'You no longer need a City firm like Warburgs or Schroders to go hostile,'
said one international mergers and acquisitions investment banker.
The large 'bulge bracket' US firms have already moved to the top of the
league tables for cross-border mergers and acquisitions in Europe. Morgan
Stanley acted as financial adviser on 13 deals worth a total of Pounds
4.95bn in the first half of this year, according to the magazine
Acquisitions Monthly. The figures were for a short period and influenced by
one particularly large deal but Morgan Stanley topped the table with Goldman
Sachs, another US firm, placed a close second.
But US firms now claim they are encroaching not just in the pan-European
market, but also on the home territory of their local competitors. 'I feel
that we have already met the cross-border challenge,' says Mr John
Studzinski, head of European M&amp;A for Morgan Stanley. 'Now we are competing
head-to-head domestically too.'
Morgan Stanley points to its mandate on a purely UK transaction, advising
the UK-based international marketing group Inchcape in its bid for insurance
broker Hogg Group earlier this year, as a landmark deal.
Goldman Sachs has been established in London since 1980 and as far back as
1987 advised British Caledonian on its sale to British Airways. But it too
has made recent advances. Goldman this year won the mandate to be exclusive
adviser to the National Grid Company in direct competition with UK banks. A
spokesman said it had completed three deals worth more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) each this year where the transaction was 'UK oriented' and the
firm's position compared 'more than favourably' with any of its UK
competitors.
Large US firms have also pioneered many techniques of modern investment
banking, from valuation models to having specialised groups of advisers for
particular industries. This advantage has been eroded as UK firms have
adopted similar techniques.
US firms with a long presence in London appear to be gaining the confidence
of the market. One rival concedes: 'Goldman Sachs are part of the furniture
now.' Hiring of UK bankers has also helped US firms. A BFI executive at
CSFB's offices for the takeover bid said: 'Looking around they seem to have
a lot of British.'
One natural advantage of UK firms is a history of contacts with UK
institutional investors that can make or break a share issue. However, the
US firms claim to have caught up. 'Our access to UK investors is as good as
anyone's,' says Mr Steven Berger, head of European investment banking for
Lehman Brothers.
Some UK firms accept that the US banks are making advances, but claim not to
be worried. 'This has been going on for a long time,' says the head of one
merchant bank. 'We work alongside US firms and get on fine.' Even CSFB says
the Attwoods bid is not a revolution, as it looks at all advisory work in an
international context.
Other UK firms say that US banks are making exaggerated claims. 'The list is
actually pretty thin,' says an investment banker at a UK firm. Indeed, only
one US firm - Goldman - figures in the top 10 M&amp;A advisers on purely UK
deals announced in the first half of 1994.
The British critics point to some reverses. Goldman conducted its first
initial public offering (IPO) for a UK company when it helped float the
Nottingham Group earlier this year. The company's share price slipped well
below the issue price when trading began.
US firms' advisory work in the UK market is also criticised by rivals. One
UK firm quoted an example of when it had to step in and bail out a bidder
which had relied exclusively on a US investment bank's advice.
Yet US investment bankers are still convinced that UK banks are giving
ground, but through 'erosion' of market share rather than a dramatic
breakthrough.
This could spur larger UK firms to expand in other European countries. A
Schroders executive points out that it has more domestic business in Italy
than any US firm.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Scotland wins battle for Pounds 530m NEC chip plant:
Semiconductor project expected to create 430 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE, WILLIAM DAWKINS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO, EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, yesterday announced that it intended to
spend Y80bn (Pounds 530m) to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant in
Livingston near Edinburgh in Scotland.
The factory, an addition to NEC's existing Livingston facilities, is
expected to create 430 jobs on top of the existing 940. Scotland won the
decision in competition with NEC's largest semiconductor plant in Roseville,
California.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the plant was the largest single
inward investment project attracted to Scotland and one of the largest
secured by the UK. He said that development grants to NEC for the project
were small compared with the overall investment.
However, less than half the funds are likely to be spent in the UK. NEC says
Y20bn will be spent on construction while Y60bn will go on manufacturing
equipment. The Japanese company will be working at the limits of
semiconductor technology and the equipment to make this possible is not
available from UK or continental European manufacturers.
Mr Andrew Norwood, a semiconductor specialist with the technology
consultancy Dataquest, said Japanese companies such as Nikon and Canon were
the likeliest candidates.
NEC intends to manufacture at Livingston the latest generation of memory
chips and eventually microprocessors and special circuits. It is expanding
capacity because of a worldwide shortfall in memory chip production, now
estimated at 20 per cent. Construction of the plant will start next April
and production is expected to begin in October 1996.
The decision may lead to further extensive investment in NEC's plant at
Ballivor in the Irish Republic which already tests and assembles
semiconductors from Livingston.
NEC has invested Pounds 230m on chip manufacture at Livingston since 1987
and spent Pounds 28m to increase production capacity a few months ago. Mr
Toshio Nakamura, managing director of NEC's UK semiconductor operations,
said: 'Production is currently running at full capacity but we are unable to
meet the needs of our European customers and so must expand.'
With global production last year valued at Dollars 8.1bn, NEC is Japan's
largest semiconductor manufacturer and second worldwide only to Intel of the
US.
It chose Scotland for several reasons: it balanced its production operations
in the US and Japan; NEC in the UK is its most productive plant; European
demand is high; the workforce is well educated and there are ample supplies
of water.

FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: AWA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arjo Wiggins Appleton's French minority shareholders clearly rule the roost
at the Franco-British paper company. The succession of Anglo-American
resignations among board directors and line managers in recent years
indicates how disagreeable the AWA nest has become. The question is whether,
now they have have gained control, the financial weakness of St Louis and
Worms &amp; Cie is holding back AWA's industrial progress.
At first glance, yesterday's announcement that AWA would not make a full bid
for Scott's SD Warren subsidiary supports that thesis. AWA has made no
secret of its intention to add to the highly successful North American
Appleton businesses. Much of Warren's operations are in the high margin fine
paper that AWA professes to like. The price tag - unlikely to be more than
Dollars 1.5bn - was within AWA's range. Debt could have been easily
increased and the remaining cash raised through a rights issue. The concern
is that such a strategy was blocked by the French who did not have the
necessary cash but did not want to dilute their shareholding.
However, the considerations behind the decision were probably more
industrial than financial. Two of Warren's mills fit perfectly. But two
others manufacture low-margin paper grades of little interest to AWA.
Although the French shareholders' financial weakness does not appear to have
held back AWA this time, it continues to be a cause for concern.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's German money supply figures appeared to offer some comfort to
the diminishing band of economists hoping for one more official rate cut.
But though the deceleration in M3 growth was eye-catching, it owed much to
special factors like the outflow of funds abroad and the tendency among
investors to move out along the yield curve. The underlying picture is very
much what one would expect of an economy in recovery. Private sector
borrowing continues to grow. That gives the Bundesbank no incentive at all
to cut rates.
Indeed nervousness in the bond markets mean the bank cannot afford to take
risks. The authorities have already betrayed a degree of concern about the
backlog of funding with their decision to borrow at floating rates this
week. While the looming election adds to the uncertainty, it will be
followed by a fresh wage round. Last year the unions were modest in their
demands in the erroneous belief that the economy would remain in deep
recession. This year they may be more aggressive, especially given the sharp
improvement in corporate earnings.
Stability is unlikely finally to return to the bond market until investors
are convinced that policy is credible. The Bundesbank has even less room to
overlook the growth in credit demand while inflation remains close to 3 per
cent. Yesterday's money supply figures may have afforded some relief, but
the relevant question remains how long the bank will wait before raising
rates rather than whether it will allow one last cut.

FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's new standard on acquisition accounting will do away with one of the
most egregious abuses in UK financial reporting, namely the freedom which
acquisitive companies have had to offset many of the costs associated with
takeovers against reserves. This practice distorted profit and loss
accounts, giving managements the scope to present financial performance
after a takeover in an unrealistically rosy light. An extreme case such as
Coloroll, the home furnishings group which collapsed in 1990 after years of
apparently profitable expansion, demonstrated the extent to which reported
earnings could become divorced from true economic performance. If the worst
abuses belong to another era, the continuing scope to flatter
post-acquisition profits by writing down stocks, or setting up provisions
against future losses or reorganisation costs, has cast doubt about the
quality of profits generated by companies making takeovers. The latest
measure will benefit users of accounts by forcing companies to present a
clearer picture of the economics of acquisitions.
Reported earnings will drop as a result of the new standard's requirement
that provisions be taken against profits, not reserves. But the underlying
cash flow will not change, however a transaction is accounted for, and
companies should not be deterred from doing deals that make strategic sense.
It will be no bad thing if, by contrast, the new rules deter companies from
making acquisitions which do not make strategic sense.

FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Angst over Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace always finds a way of disappointing the market. Yesterday
the problem was cash flow. During the half year to end-June, there was a net
cash outflow of Pounds 202m, despite the fact that BAe sold Rover for Pounds
800m during the period. There were reasonable explanations: bank guarantees
to associate Hutchison Telecom were replaced by a Pounds 220m loan; and
Pounds 250m of cash relating to work done in the half year actually arrived
at the end of 1993. But the fact is that most analysts were surprised by the
outflow, so some mark-down in the shares was in order. Yesterday's drop of
over 5 per cent, though, looks excessive: the sharpest profit downgrades are
hard to square with the board's decision to raise dividends by 21 per cent.
Moreover, the medium-term outlook is encouraging. Profits at BAe's defence
business will be spurred on by lower costs and higher volumes. This week's
promise by King Fahd to Mr John Major, the prime minister, that Saudi Arabia
would turn to the UK for 'all our defence needs' could also point to further
lucrative contracts from that source.
Meanwhile, Airbus's profits are taking off and there may even be good news
on turboprops, a source of much red ink. Negotiations to merge the
operations of several European suppliers and cut capacity are making
progress. If the right deal can be concluded, BAe's losses from the business
 -estimated to be around Pounds 150m annually - could shrink rapidly. BAe
has caused investors much anxiety in recent years, so yesterday's jitters
are hardly surprising. But the underlying business is in relatively good
shape.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Women's trouser ban out of style in City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the last bastions of male sartorial exclusivity in the City of London
has fallen with a decision by Linklaters &amp; Paines, the law firm, to allow
women employees to wear trousers.
Linklaters, one of the five biggest City solicitors' firms, has joined other
institutions in dropping a rule that all female staff must wear dresses or
skirts. It had thought that clients would regard trousers as too informal.
The firm, two thirds of whose 1,200 employees in London are female, changed
its policy after some employees protested that it was archaic. None of the
other big law firms has a formal policy on how women dress.
'An awful lot of women have been wearing trousers around here in the past
two weeks (since the ban was lifted), so it must have been causing some
discontent,' said one female lawyer at Linklaters yesterday.
An informal survey by the Financial Times found no large City firm that
still had a formal ban on women wearing trousers, although some said there
was still pressure for women to dress traditionally.
Large investment banks such as SG Warburg and Schroders allow women to wear
dresses or trousers. But one banker said that he had 'heard senior people
say that if our women bankers dress like secretaries, they will be taken for
secretaries'.
Mr Stephen Edlmann, a Linklaters partner, said that the firm had been
updating its staff handbook, and had taken the opportunity to change the
rules.
He said Linklaters had become 'progressively more female' and that 37 per
cent of its lawyers were women. The rule had applied because clients often
visited the firm for meetings.
Other law firms said they had no formal rules. 'I think it has probably
become more acceptable in the City for women to wear trousers. After all,
nobody wears bowler hats any more,' said Mr Melvyn Hughes, a partner at
Slaughter and May.
The union MSF, which represents employees in finance companies, said it was
aware of one insurance company that encouraged women to avoid trousers.

FT  22 SEP 94 / SIB chief seeks to avert row over pensions with life groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City's chief regulator has begun a series of meetings with top life
insurance executives in an attempt to head off a damaging public split
between the industry and its watchdog over the sale of personal pensions.
The move, by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, comes ahead of the planned publication by the regulator late next
month of a report on compensating people who have suffered from poor advice
over transferring out of occupational pension schemes.
The SIB will face public criticism if its plans do not provide full redress
for everyone who may have lost out. But life companies want to focus only on
cases where customers have clearly suffered, and do not want to give others
a chance to change their earlier decisions.
Mr Large is warning chief executives of some large life insurance companies
that a high-profile clash between life insurers and the SIB about
compensating victims of mis-selling would further damage the reputation of
the industry.
Figures from the Association of British Insurers have shown that sales of
some products have already fallen this year and that public concern about
pension sales is one of the causes.
He is also pointing out that the launch this summer of the Personal
Investment Authority, the watchdog set up to protect the retail investor,
offers life companies the chance to make a fresh start in making customers
feel confident about taking out policies.
Among executives already seen by Mr Large is Mr Allan Bridgewater, group
chief executive of Norwich Union, the mutual insurer, and currently chairman
of the ABI.
At the same time, Mr Large is seeking to reassure life companies that the
SIB has taken into account the practicalities of carrying out a review of
thousands of pension cases.
One of the most serious concerns expressed by life companies has been about
the many tens of thousands of pension cases they may have to review to
identify customers who should be compensated.
One possibility for addressing this is that if - as some life companies
insist - the scale of mis-selling revealed by looking at the priority cases
is relatively small, then the process for deciding which other cases are
re-examined might be streamlined to cut down on administrative costs.
As a way of dealing with compensation arrangements where the independent
financial adviser who carried out the sale is no longer in business, the PIA
is expected to set up a specialist pensions unit to identify cases where
customers should be recompensed.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Confusion in Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US troops are on the ground in Haiti, and to the relief of all concerned, so
far hardly a shot has been fired in anger. Welcome too was yesterday's
endorsement by exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide of the
weekend accord brokered by former President Jimmy Carter that allowed the
peaceful entry of US forces. Following a visit to the Pentagon, Mr Aristide
now appears confident that he will return to his country within 24 days and
is setting about forming a government.
But Mr Aristide's endorsement of the Carter accord does not silence the many
questions that remain. As Mr Aristide indicated yesterday, its ultimate
success will depend on the successful disarmament of Haiti's armed forces.
That task has only just begun.
Mr Aristide needs to be sure that the US does not abandon what would have
been one of its objectives had it invaded: to purge and professionalise the
police and armed forces. Unless the apparatus of intimidation and terror
that was responsible for his exile is dismantled, Mr Aristide would not be
able to govern even if he returns. Once US troops were back home, he would
again be under threat of a military coup.
The deal brokered by Mr Carter specifies that 'certain military officers'
would enter 'an early and honourable retirement when a general amnesty is
voted into law by the Haitian parliament, or October 15 1994, whichever is
earlier'. That is too vague for complete comfort. It was Lt Gen Raoul Cedras
and his fellow generals who reneged on a deal signed under UN auspices that
would have returned Mr Aristide to Haiti last October. Until the weekend,
his junta was held responsible for such dreadful human rights abuses that Mr
Clinton came to the brink of ordering an invasion.
Days later, they were described by members of Mr Carter's negotiating team
as honourable men and patriots. US troops were also, to the frustration of
some, ordered to stand by while policemen attacked pro-Aristide
demonstrators in Port-au-Prince. Furthermore, the Haitian police are
apparently now expected to disarm the Haitian army. And the army - the
ostensible target of an American invasion - is guiding the US forces to
their positions around the country.
All this may be the consequence of tactical decisions based on the changing
circumstances. Whether this is the case, or there has been a shift in US
strategy, will only be clear in time. Last night the US armed forces were
permitted to intervene to prevent human rights abuses and Mr Aristide has,
it seems, accepted the need to be patient. In avoiding an invasion, Mr
Clinton has bought relief from his congressional critics. But to resolve the
problems that last week made an invasion seem inevitable, he must act
decisively, in particular to ensure the armed forces will be unable to
prevent Mr Aristide from exercising his democratic mandate. That will mean
the US military adopting a more active, and therefore more risky, role than
they have assumed so far.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Hot air on Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In Cape Town in 1960 Harold Macmillan warned white South Africans of the
'wind of change' sweeping through Africa. His words captured the mood of the
continent at a critical moment.
Three disastrous decades later, ravaged by mismanagement and misfortune,
Africa is once again at a watershed, beset by problems which can only be
overcome with external help. Once again this week a British prime minister,
leader of a nation with unrivalled historical and commercial links
throughout the continent, stood before the South African parliament, now at
last multiracial. He was marvellously placed to launch the fresh
international initiative Africa so badly needs. Instead he delivered little
more than hot air.
Had he risen to the occasion, John Major would have begun by making clear
the depth of Africa's crisis. Instead, he neglected the fact that most
Africans are getting poorer, and took comfort from economic and political
reforms under way which have yet to launch a sustained recovery.
Having spelt out the gravity of the situation, the prime minister could then
have set out an agenda for action. Instead of contenting himself with a
brief self-congratulatory reference to the Trinidad terms on
government-to-government debt, he could have acknowledged the need for
radical action in this area, including relief for countries such as Uganda
which are hobbled with debt service payments to multilateral institutions.
Also on his agenda should have been the need for better co-ordinated aid
programmes, with a lower proportion of tied aid, a higher proportion
allocated to social services, and new conditionalities including ceilings on
military spending. He might also have done more to spell out the
circumstances in which humanitarian obligations to avert genocide and
relieve starvation must take precedence over state sovereignty, and should
not have avoided addressing the damaging dispute between the World Bank and
other development agencies over the merits of structural adjustment.
As it was, Mr Major's only substantial proposal was a call for 'preventive
diplomacy' with regional peacekeeping units, which will be pursued at the
UN. As Mr Major said, energies have been consumed in trying to limit trouble
after it has started. It would be far better and less costly to pre-empt it.
Would that Britain were prepared to apply this precept in Nigeria. Africa's
most populous nation, and second biggest economy, is heading for disaster.
Yet despite close ties, no foreign office minister has visited Nigeria this
year, whereas Baroness Chalker has been twice to Rwanda. And while refusing
visas to members of the Nigerian regime, the UK has not suspended a contract
to equip its army with British tanks.
Mr Macmillan's words resonated around the world and have entered the history
books. Mr Major's are unlikely to make even a footnote.

Why would an outfit as canny as the Royal Bank of Scotland effectively give
away its Capital House investment management operation gratis, and then
shell out Pounds 25m for a one-third stake in a new organisation? Out of a
sense of relief, it would seem.
The beneficiary of this recent largesse, Newton Management, is one of the
best in the business. Its average pension fund client last year earned a
total return of 37.4 per cent, 8.2 percentage points above the industry
average. Contrast Capital House, whose sole institutional client is the RBS
pension scheme, and which languishes in the bottom 10 per cent of all
pension fund managers on the basis of its performance over the past three
years.
In June of last year, trustees to the Charterhouse pension schemes -
Charterhouse then still being in the RBS stable before the September sale of
90 per cent of the bank to a Franco-German consortium - quietly sacked
Capital House and transferred its loyalties to Mercury Asset Management.

A price can be placed on more or less anything in this cost-conscious age.
Not to be outdone is the Met Office, which has proudly come up with the fact
that its weather forecasts save the UK nearly Pounds 1bn a year. Chief
beneficiaries are apparently transport (Pounds 251m) and construction
(Pounds 107m).
Sadly, the method by which the Met-sponsored survey managed to arrive at
such accurate numbers has not been disclosed. Nor is there any mention of
the cost of inaccurate predictions.
The Met's own service costs Pounds 38m per year to run, by the way, which
either means it is a bargain - or that officials are massively undercharging
for this immensely valuable service.

Watch out for John Prescott, who may shortly be enjoying a bit of extra
influence in Tony Blair's new-look Labour party.
Derek Foster, the opposition party's current chief whip, has been in situ
for nine years, during which time he has seen off some tough contenders for
his post. But he could finally have met his match in Richard Caborn, one of
the pugnacious deputy leader's closest political allies who has emerged as a
challenger for what is the party's most important Mr Fixit job.
Caborn, who ran Prescott's successful campaign for the deputy leadership
earlier this year, belongs to Labour's 'traditionalist' faction. He has made
a considerable impression in the past two years as a strong chairman of the
Commons trade and industry committee, presiding over inquiries into
political hot potatoes such as the coal industry and the future of the Post
Office.
Blair, whose Sedgefield constituency is in Foster's neck of the woods, has
in effect backed the incumbent by indicating that he does not favour a
contest. But, with at least two more runners expected to surface before
nominations close next month, the race is shaping into a far more
interesting contest than the tepid campaign leading to Blair's runaway
victory in July.

Calling all insomniacs. Michael Portillo, who as UK employment secretary is
widely regarded as the rightwing pretender to John Major's crown, is
bringing out a booklet of his speeches and interviews.
The aim is to establish clear blue water between the Tories and Labour. As
such it must be judged a qualified success, for what the work principally
seems to highlight is a veritable ocean between Portillo and Major - with
the cabinet minister ruling out the single European currency and so on.
We are promised that 'these are by no means the last words from Michael
Portillo'. No wonder John Major prefers a game of cricket in South Africa
when his own cabinet is still bowling him such googlies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gresham Club, tucked away in Abchurch Lane in the heart of the City,
used to be an excellent place for an afternoon nap. But the price of
sardines-on-toast was raised to 6d, and things slid relentlessly downhill
thereafter.
Today, after a Pounds 5m-odd makeover, the seven-story Grade II listed
building reopens as the London Capital Club - a very different sort of
establishment indeed. It admits women and foreigners; it allows, nay
encourages, the conduct of business within its hallowed portals; and
promises to serve upmarket grub. It even has a boardroom members can hire
out - marked Boardroom in big gold letters on the door.
Owned by the affable German-born Dieter Klostermann, it is the first
European addition to his network of Asian clubs. The Pounds 1,250 'entrance'
fee is a snip, compared at least with the affiliated City Club in Tokyo,
which will set you back some Y4m (Pounds 25,000) to join. So far 500 souls
have signed up.
The unstuffy but recognisably 'British' club is a formula that has worked
well in the Far East. Klostermann's CCA Group is currently pulling in Pounds
70m in annual revenues from its 32,000 members.
Klostermann's tilt at Clubland in its own backyard, meanwhile, will probably
be admired and scorned in equal measure. What he principally needs is for
his joint to be patronised.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Pay and jobs in a global economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If problems could be cured by conferences, unemployment in the older
industrialised countries would be well on the way to solution.
At one recent gathering, organised by the Kansas Federal Reserve at Jackson
Hole, Paul Krugman of Harvard university set out to extract a core consensus
on the subject. He starts from the well-known phenomenon that, while US
unemployment has been rising and falling with the business cycle, there has
been no change of trend since the mid-1970s. European unemployment has, on
the other hand, soared and remained at 8 per cent even in buoyant periods
when the economic brakes had to be put on to prevent inflation accelerating.
The US has, alas, had its own problem: a widening of pay differentials
associated not with any kind of 'trickle down' but with an absolute drop in
remuneration at the bottom of the pay scale. The Krugman diagnosis is that
the same process which has expressed itself in high unemployment in Europe
has emerged in poverty at work in the US.
The demand for unskilled or less favoured workers has fallen everywhere in
relation to better trained or more fortunate workers. In the US the strain
has been taken by pay rates. In Europe the welfare state has prevented a
similar widening of differentials and, instead, the strain is taken by
unemployment.
The resulting non-idyllic nature of the US labour market was vividly
described by the noted US specialist Richard Freeman, at another symposium
in Salzburg organised by the Egon Sohmen Foundation. He would link it with
the fact that the proportion of young US males in jail, on parole or on
probation, rose from 4 per cent to 11 per cent in only 13 years (1980-93);
among young blacks the rise was from 11 per cent to 25 per cent.
In Europe there are two ways in which prevailing institutions can worsen
unemployment. There is the effect on incentives. High social security taxes
add to the cost of employing workers or subtract from their take-home pay;
while 'social' benefits provide a floor or reservation wage below which
actual wages cannot be dragged without people being better off not working.
The other way concerns not so much the welfare state itself as collectivist
institutions which price workers out of jobs. There are, for instance,
minimum pay provisions and restrictions on the extent to which employers can
differentiate between workers of different age and experience according to
the value of their skill.
Then there are collective agreements between employers and unions which
price the unlucky out of jobs. Indeed it is difficult in Germany for
employers and workers to opt out of such agreements even if both are willing
to do so in high unemployment regions. There are also restrictions on the
hours and flexibility of work which have a similar effect in raising the
effective costs of hiring labour.
These two kinds of influences shade into each other. But it does make a
difference where one puts the emphasis. If the main part of the problem is
the lack of work incentives, then unemployment is to some extent voluntary
and the need to reduce the jobless percentage is a matter of easing the tax
and transfer burden on those at work, or of reducing the adverse social
effects of idleness. If, on the other hand, pricing-out-of-work laws and
practices are the main culprits, then the unemployed are themselves the
principal 'outside' victims of the 'insiders' who have made the agreements
and the rules.
In continental Europe the emphasis should be at least as much on
collectivism as on incentives. I would also put more emphasis than is
fashionable among economists on the role played by moralistic or traditional
objections to undercutting. I am sometimes asked what would happen if
another journalist offered to join the staff to write Economic Viewpoint for
much less pay. It would be an interesting experiment.
The central theme, however, is that neither the welfare state nor collective
procedures for setting pay would on their own have been enough to generate
the European unemployment explosion. The welfare state is probably not on
average more generous than 20 years ago. Nor are pricing-out-of-work
arrangements more strict. The important point has been the interaction of
European practices with a sharp widening of the pay relativities which would
prevail if the labour market were left to itself.
Is it possible to square the circle and combine the benefits of a European
welfare state with an American-style flexible labour market? The upbeat
answer is to call for more education and training, so that workers near the
bottom of the income scale acquire more of the capacities of the ones at the
top.
It is to Krugman's credit that he steers clear of this industrial
correctness. He rightly queries how much of the wider spread in equilibrium
pay rates is due to formal education. Differentials among people of similar
educational qualifications have increased at least as much as differentials
between people of different qualifications. He also adds that Americans who
hold up the superior performance of France and Germany in teaching basic
literacy and numeracy fail to notice that the results have not translated
into lower unemployment.
Shrinking the welfare state is at the other extreme - the hard-nosed
approach. This would have many very harsh effects. Not only would benefits
be less for those still unemployed; but there would be a shakedown in pay
rates for those who have always had jobs near the bottom of the scale.
One approach, which has been powerfully argued by Edmund Phelps of Columbia
is that of an employer subsidy to take on unskilled workers. This would be
expensive and would have to be very tightly policed to prevent abuse; there
would, for instance, have to be a sliding scale for borderline workers.
Moreover, because of differing family circumstances the net redistribution
of income implicit in such a scheme would be badly targeted.
The still distant ideal would be of a basic income paid to everyone to
provide a floor, on top of which market earnings would be added. To say that
this would be prohibitively expensive is partly a matter of tax illusion.
The real drawbacks are that there could be a large incentive to voluntary
unemployment or underemployment for those prepared to make do with the basic
income; and much of the benefits would spill over to those higher up the
income scale needing it least.
The best present compromise would be a negative income tax which would
differ from a basic income in being conditional on work search attempts and
in being withdrawn at a much higher rate than the basic rate of income tax.
Indeed an embryonic British system of this kind exists in the form of family
credits for households with breadwinners on low incomes. This could be built
on, for instance by extending it to workers without children and making some
of the conditions less irksome. But on neither side of the Atlantic is it
easy to interest people in British experiments; and there is a preference
for a priori proposals.
Just for once, however, I want to move off remedies and discuss the
diagnosis further. For the main problem of the Krugman consensus is that the
reason labour market relativities should have changed so much is left
hanging in mid-air.
The conventional explanation - of technology driving out unskilled workers -
is unconvincing. For pay differentials within every skill and educational
category have risen quite as much as differentials between them. And as
Krugman remarks: 'The time could well come when most tax lawyers are
replaced with expert systems, but human beings are still needed for such
truly difficult occupations as gardening and house cleaning.'
The most controversial explanation centres on competition from low-wage
workers in the developing - and more recently the former communist -
countries in a liberalised global economy. This was suggested by Douglas
McWilliams of the London Centre for Economics and Business Research in a
couple of lectures last year. It has since been most fully developed in a
book by Adrian Wood, North South Trade, Employment and Inequality (Clarendon
Press, Oxford).
The respectable form of this thesis must be sharply distinguished from that
of populist opponents of the Gatt accord, who do not understand that
countries of very different income levels can profitably trade with each
other. If trade is freed between two groups, North and South, the
presumption is that both sides benefit, although not necessarily everyone in
both groups. The suggestion, rather, is that in the North unskilled or
semi-skilled workers, whose tasks can be equally well carried out by workers
elsewhere at much lower wages, will lose out. The problem then becomes one
not of 'unfair' trade, as the Clinton administration seems to think, but of
income distribution within the North.
Many orthodox trade experts reject this diagnosis, although a new analysis
by Jeffrey Sachs and H J Shatzin in the latest Brookings Papers gives it
partial support. But the real point is that the globalisation of the world
economy (a term to which Krugman strongly objects) could easily throw up
such problems in the future even if it has not done so already.
Indeed, it is possible to bypass the complexities of international trade
theory by looking at the world as a single economy. In such an economy not
only goods but capital is mobile - physical as well as financial capital. It
only takes a few years to put up a new plant anywhere where the local
political environment is favourable.
In such a world, as Patrick Minford eloquently maintained at Salzburg, pay
differences among workers of comparable skill will tend to be reduced, if
not eliminated, by owners of capital seeking the best return, and able to
introduce best-practice technology wherever they go. This will be so even if
labour itself remains relatively immobile between countries or areas. If
this were to happen, the conditions of the workers of the world would indeed
tend to be equalised - at least among those of comparable skills - but by
means very different from those that the early socialists envisaged.
What are the main snags in this equalisation scenario? Why did nothing like
this happen before 1914 when there was, indeed, a single world economy and
many such fears were expressed by European and American protectionists? The
big difference is that literacy has become very widespread in the third
world in the last 40 years - which it was not in Queen Victoria's time.
Looking ahead, the most under-discussed problem is: what will happen to wage
rates in the emerging countries? On productivity grounds they should rise
towards those of the west, thus tackling the problem in the best possible
way. This is a reasonable hope for a country like the Czech Republic, where
the skills, capital and entrepreneurship for near full employment already
exist and where people have agreed to a sharp, but they hope temporary,
sacrifice to repair the ravages of totalitarian rule. Matters are very
different in China, where there are said to be 200m workers surplus to farm
needs who could presumably be enticed into the cities at wage rates only
marginally above subsistence.
But the final ray of hope which I would like to point to takes us back to
the more prosperous north. If the liberalisation of the world economy is
going to make northern countries richer, but make many industrial or
clerical workers within them worse off, then who will gain the difference?
For a time it may be the owners of capital - a foretaste is visible in the
worldwide rise in long-term real interest rates. But capital will be
eventually affected by the tendency of funds available for investment to
increase to meet new opportunities.
One is then left with the conclusion that much of the gain will go to owners
of land, who outside the rural shires are hard to distinguish from owners of
capital. Classical economists, right down to supposedly extreme free
marketeers like Friedrich Hayek, have always accepted that land in the shape
of pure space is a suitable object for redistributive taxation. But they
despaired about being able to separate in practice the return from owning
land, on the one hand, from the yield to the capital and ingenuity spent on
improving it, on the other. The effort to distinguish it may still have to
be made.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Creating profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene is familiar. A chief executive, standing at a podium in a hushed,
darkened hall, gestures at the slide projections behind him showing the
expected rise in profits from the company's latest takeover. Of course,
reorganisation costs will be high, he warns.
The balance sheet in the next set of accounts does indeed show hefty
writedowns, but as these costs bypass the profit and loss account, profits
leap. In the never-never land of UK accounting, those techniques have given
a company active on the acquisition trail an effortlessly rising stream of
earnings. Until, as Coloroll and other corporate stars of the 1980s bear
witness, reality intrudes. Typically, the acquisitions perform badly and
cashflow collapses.
Today's publication of new rules on treatment of acquisitions and mergers by
the Accounting Standards Board aims to reduce the room for such creativity
in accounting. The rules, which greatly curb the use of provisions and
writedowns, among other detailed measures, are likely to be successful in
that aim.
In doing so, they will prevent some deals which could have occurred under
past rules. Shareholders may well welcome this, as some of the grossest
abuses of acquisition accounting have been highly expensive for them.
Directors may not, where their pay is linked to earnings growth. It is
harder to say, though, whether discouraging corporate enthusiasm for
takeovers is economically beneficial or not. The 1980s takeover scramble
attracted much opprobrium, and many of those deals have so far proved
disappointing. But that is partly due to recession: the longer-term returns
remain unclear.
But while the revisions are welcome, it is worth sounding a note of concern.
The rules have the virtues of consistency, but may make an unhelpfully crude
distinction between capital and current spending.
The problem surfaces most clearly in the proposed new treatment of
reorganisation costs, to which leading companies have strongly objected.
Such costs, previously treated as part of the capital cost of the deal, must
now be treated as an expense. The idea is to remove subjective
considerations, such as whether these costs were foreseeable before the
deal. Yet such factors are frequently relevant to the valuation of assets:
directors assess the value of a target in the light of the 'refurbishment'
which needs to be done to realise its potential.
Those in pursuit of better accounting standards need to bear in mind how
accounts are intended to be used, and by whom. The Accounting Standards
Board has sometimes appeared to see itself on a quest for absolute truth.
Its new rules are likely to succeed in making company accounts reflect more
fairly the full cost of acquisitions. Shareholders and lenders may, however,
find it as hard as in the past to use the values in the accounts to estimate
future profits.

FT  22 SEP 94 / The mega-deal is back on Wall St: Is the flurry of takeovers
in the US good for shareholders and customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So General Electric is going to buy Time Warner for more than Dollars 15bn.
That is, if it doesn't sell half of NBC to Time Warner instead - though of
course Disney wants to buy the whole television network for Dollars 5bn.
Whatever.
Then again, GE is also thinking of using that spare Dollars 15bn to buy
American Express. Or perhaps it will be content with ITT's financial
services businesses. Or ITT might hand over these businesses to GE in part
exchange for NBC . . .
These are just some of the rumours that have swirled around Wall Street in
the past week (forcing GE, for one, into the unusual position of denying any
interest in either Time Warner or American Express). And when the rumour
mill is working flat out, it is a sure sign that the US takeover business is
back in full swing.
It has been five years since this sort of takeover mania hit the US
financial markets. This year, with more than Dollars 220bn worth of deals
announced in the first eight months, the tally could match even the record
Dollars 335bn of 1988. Why is it happening? And is it a Good Thing for
companies' shareholders, workers and customers?
The pattern of takeover activity provides one answer to the question 'why'.
Nearly two-thirds of the deals consummated since the beginning of last year
have come in a handful of industries: pharmaceuticals and healthcare,
entertainment and the media, defence, telecommunications and financial
services.
There are specific reasons why each of these sectors faces upheaval. The
defence industry has been forced to consolidate by a halving of the US
defence procurement budget since 1986. The healthcare sector is facing
pressure from employers, who are resisting the continuing rise in insurance
premiums for their workers. Producers and distributors of television
programmes are being drawn together by the promise of new technology and by
deregulation.
So is the outburst of multi-billion dollar deals across a number of
industries just coincidence? Hardly. There are three underlying reasons why
it is happening now.
First, all the financial planets are in alignment. Put simply, companies are
in a better position to pay for acquisitions than they have been for some
time. US corporate debt levels are down after the leveraged 1980s, and
cashflow is stronger.
According to the Commerce Department's census bureau, the average pre-tax
return on equity for US manufacturing companies was an annualised 23 per
cent in the second quarter, a level it had not reached since the middle of
the 1980s. Also, borrowing is easy and cheap: US bond yields, though up
sharply this year, are still as low as at any time in the 1980s, and banks
are falling over themselves to lend.
At the same time, the stock market continues to bump along close to its
all-time high. This gives companies a valuable takeover currency in the form
of their own shares, which can be used in full or part consideration. Last
year, just a third of takeover deals were all-cash, half the level of the
late 1980s.
The second underlying factor is that, with the recession well behind them,
company bosses have more time to consider expansion - and the takeover, once
seen as the weapon of the asset stripper, greenmailer or corporate raider,
has become respectable again.
Third, the political backdrop remains conducive to mergers and acquisitions.
Despite some fears in business circles at the outset of the Clinton
administration, the Justice Department has made little attempt to stem the
flow of deals. In sectors such as defence and healthcare, mergers which
reduce overall industry costs fit neatly with administration policy. And
this week, after a long review, the anti-trust authorities cleared the
Dollars 11.5bn takeover of McCaw Cellular by AT&amp;T, despite claims by rival
telecommunication companies that the deal would turn AT&amp;T back into the
dominant industry giant it was before the enforced break-up.
But are the latest takeovers beneficial? For many US workers, the answer
seems to be no. A large number of recent deals has been justified on the
grounds of cost saving. In banking, for instance, the general rule of thumb
for an acquirer is to cut the costs of its acquisition by 40 per cent.
Service industries, in particular finance and healthcare, are experiencing
some of the biggest job cuts. One effect has been for some companies to make
cuts before becoming takeover fodder themselves.
For shareholders, this suggests that the picture is a healthy one. When
making acquisitions, promises of lower costs are generally easier for
managers to fulfil than promises of higher revenues from entering new
markets.
'In most cases, these mergers make economic sense. It is good for us in
general,' says Mr Jose Arau, an investment analyst with the California
Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which has Dollars 27bn
invested in US equities.
Like others, he draws a distinction between the 1980s - 'the takeover
artists, buying companies for a quick buck' - and the deals of the 1990s.
Some buyers are paying too much for their acquisitions, says Arau: Calpers
voted during the summer against Mellon Bank's takeover of the Dreyfus mutual
funds group, although the deal did ultimately succeed last month. But in
general he insists the prices being paid are good for the shareholders of
acquiring companies.
Companies are not just using economies of scale to justify acquisitions.
Many are also arguing that takeovers will enhance their growth prospects,
though such claims tend to arouse a degree of scepticism in the market.
In the media and entertainment industries, the flurry of activity is driven
in part by the belief that more powerful transmission mechanisms fostered by
digital technology will lead to a sharp increase in the services available
from television screens. But how much more will consumers be prepared to pay
for such services - and will it justify the valuations now being put on
media and entertainment properties?
For customers, meanwhile, the takeover wave poses an important long-term
question: will the emergence of a smaller number of bigger companies in
certain industries lead to higher prices or less choice?
Few of the current mergers or acquisitions are being justified on the
grounds that they make the companies involved more competitive in world
markets: instead, they are all about increasing market power in the US.
To the extent that unit costs come down (and productivity rises) in
industries such as healthcare or banking, it will be good for consumers. But
at what point are the benefits of scale outweighed by the oligopolistic
tendencies that can result from the dominance of the few? To judge by the
Justice Department's lack of intervention so far, it does not yet fear the
line is being crossed.
A related concern for consumers and anti-trust authorities arises from the
fact that a number of recent deals in the pharmaceuticals and entertainment
industries have been 'vertical mergers' - that is, between producers and
distributors. In the past year, three of the four biggest US drug
distribution companies (known as pharmacy benefit managers) have been bought
out by producers. The prospective deals between television production
companies and broadcast or cable television networks follow a similar
pattern.
One explanation is that technology is everywhere changing the relationship
between producers and distributors. In financial services, for instance,
banks and insurance companies are looking forward to the day when they can
scrap many of their branches and rely on the information superhighway to
plug them directly into their customers' television sets. Who will then
control the distribution mechanism?
In the years ahead the Justice Department will need to review closely the
questions about consumer choice raised by such developments. In the
meantime, though, its relaxed attitude suggests that the Wall Street
takeover party has a while left to run.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Powers for an effective Euro
parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your excellent editorial, 'Agenda for Euro-reform' (September 20),
you quite rightly questioned whether the 1996 intergovernmental (Maastricht
revision) conference is the right occasion for an increase in the powers of
the European parliament. The 1987 Single European Act increased the
parliament's powers to amend Commission proposals - a power which on the
whole has been sensibly used to improve a host of Single Market Directives.
As you point out, it is too early to say whether the parliament will use its
powers of veto under the Maastricht co-decision procedure equally sensibly.
We and some other European MPs have long argued that before the parliament
is given more power it must demonstrate that it is using its existing powers
constructively. Too many colleagues seem to believe that the parliament
should be in alliance with the Commission 'against' the Council of
Ministers. It should not. Too many colleagues fail to put in an appearance
at committees in Brussels or plenaries in Strasbourg. Absenteeism is an
embarrassment. Too many colleagues (more than 50 per cent) are new to the
parliament, so there is a lack of experience and continuity in the
parliament's work. Only in the UK was it the will of the electorate which
decided the changes. Elsewhere, it is the people who draw up party lists in
smoke-filled rooms.
The debate on Europe has so far been generalised. It is time for specifics.
Here are two:
The unelected Commission can adopt or reject the European parliament's
amendments. This is a legislative power which it should not have. A second,
however, is that the parliament could be more effective if granted the power
to dismiss individual Commissioners who do not perform adequately. The
present power to dismiss the whole Commission is like the nuclear deterrent
 -never to be used.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: India's economic progress merits
support and praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SRICHAND P HINDUJA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Not nearly radical enough' (September 19) misses the
point by a mile. Stefan Wagstyl's conclusion that prime minister Narasimha
Rao 'seems to have lost his sense of urgency' is unfair and unhelpful:
unfair because Mr Rao of all people has been responsible for positive and
dramatic changes in the Indian economy; unhelpful because the changes that
are being effected need understanding and support, not sly criticism.
One of the main problems that 'Commerce India' faces is a dearth of a
constant power supply. For example, five years ago in West Bengal it was
impossible to count on more than two consecutive hours of electricity, so
poor was the system. Now, in Calcutta, if there is a power cut it is met
with genuine annoyance rather than simple resignation. This improvement is
due to the deregulation that has allowed the privately controlled R P Goenka
company to run the utility properly - a deregulation promulgated by Mr Rao.
Earlier this month we, through our Ashok Leyland subsidiary, together with
National Power of the UK, started laying the foundations of a Pounds 1.2bn,
1,000 megawatt coal-fired power station in Andhra Pradesh. Again, the
support of the prime minister for this - and six other large power plant
developments throughout India - is crucial in the country's progress towards
a consistent and reliable supply of energy to run the shipyards, steel
mills, refineries and fertiliser plants of the present and the future on an
economic basis. And it is the country's response to a recent World Bank
report that saw Indian industry working at only 50 per cent capacity because
of ludicrously poor energy creation and supply.
The political and economic movement away from crushing and overweening state
involvement based heavily on the 'licence-raj' will take time. I believe
that Mr Rao and the people of India should be applauded and encouraged for
their progress and not, dare I say, damned with faint praise.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: NGOs - working to meet demands of the
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICK DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For a newspaper which one expects to be championing the role of markets
it is surprising to read Edward Mortimer's article, 'NGOs rule OK'
(September 21), criticising the role of non-governmental organisations in
international affairs on the basis that their role as 'do-gooders' is an
unelected one.
NGOs get their funds from two sources. First, from public fundraising
activities. People in the UK and elsewhere are buying NGO services of their
own free will. No need for elections, markets can operate in this area just
as they can for other services.
However, like all markets, advertising may not always be honest or accurate.
If there is concern about the role of NGOs then this is where investigative
attention should focus.
The other source of funds, increasingly so, is from governments, as well as
bilateral and multilateral institutions. The international proliferation of
NGOs over the last decade or so has given these institutions more and more
choice as to which NGOs they fund - which, other things being equal, is
surely a good thing.
Again, the main issue to focus on is the extent to which these institutions
are buying quality services. Of course, quality is not always a simple
matter to assess, with either business products or the services of NGOs.
Capitalism is without doubt an extremely creative process, but one not
without its problems. It is perhaps a pleasant paradox that capitalism
allows the emergence of organisational forms that can meet a market demand
to address some of those problems.

HANSON: A BIOGRAPHY By Alex Brummer and Roger Cowe Fourth Estate, Pounds 20,
315 pages
The building of a Pounds 12bn empire, without a strategy, a sense of
direction or even very much financial information, is a feat to which few
people can lay claim. James Hanson can, according to Guardian financial
journalists Brummer and Cowe.
Knighted by Harold Wilson and given a peerage by Margaret Thatcher, Hanson
has been the archetypal conglomerateur: an aggressive predator with an eye
for a badly managed target.
Disappointingly, in seeking to reveal both Lord Hanson's strengths and those
of his Hanson group, Brummer and Cowe have produced a tale that is neither
biography nor corporate history. The drama and personalities behind the bid
battles are too often drowned out by numbers, while Lord Hanson's character
and his relationship with Gordon White, the group's co-founder, remain
under-explored.
The reader is left in little doubt, however, that one of the most surprising
things about Lord Hanson is that he put so much distance between himself and
his father's Huddersfield haulage business.
The record of his opportunistic ambushes has been hit and miss. He may have
swallowed some big fish, in the form of London Brick, SCM and Imperial
Group, but he has failed in his efforts to bag easier targets, such as
Rolls-Royce Motors and Powell Duffryn.
His means of gathering corporate information have been crude - Lord Hanson
is even said to have been attracted to companies by the photographic quality
of their annual reports. He has shown no continuing interest in his
acquisitions, save returns on capital and cash flow. The only value he has
placed on a company is its price on disposal. And he has taken to extremes
the concept of letting managers manage - asked recently how his 80,000
employees saw him, he replied: 'They don't'
But Lord Hanson has been an excellent administrator, with a fearsome grasp
of essentials. He has exploited every accountancy and tax advantage, and
always known when to buy and when to sell companies to keep earnings per
share and dividend income rising.
In addition, he has cultivated political friends, oiling relationships with
generous party political donations. And in everything, the charismatic boss
of the group which bears his name has employed his famous charm and temper.
In his 30-year rise from playboy to cut-throat capitalist, Lord Hanson has
always been colourful. As an eligible bachelor, he enjoyed romances with
Jean Simmons and Audrey Hepburn. In 1965, he teamed up with the flamboyant
White to begin their great, transatlantic takeover adventure.
The 1970s was a period of meandering disappointment. But with the 1980s and
the arrival of Mrs Thatcher, Lord Hanson was delivered of 'a government made
for Hanson Trust just as Hanson Trust was made for the government'.
The first doubts about Hanson's formula for success set in only after some
ugly takeover tussles and the launch of a near-disastrous rights issue.
As the group expanded, the financial information needed to assess its real
performance dwindled. A row over the pension fund at newly acquired Imperial
Group was followed by a warning from the governor of the Bank of England to
take its eyes off Midland Bank. Undaunted, Hanson paid more than Pounds 3bn
for Consolidated Gold Fields and in 1990 considered buying PowerGen, the
electricity generator, by private treaty.
Though Lord Hanson could have then departed with his reputation intact, his
ambition to win bids and the respect of the establishment was not yet
satisfied. With Pounds 7bn in the war chest, the group grabbed a share stake
in ICI. But the arch wheeler-dealer, having initially failed to mention the
deal to his board, had bitten off more than he could chew.
ICI outmanoeuvred him by targeting the company-financed lifestyle of Lord
White, who had always declined to sit on the UK main board, and his
anomalous position as the chairman of the group's US business. Racehorses
and Beverly Hills mansions grabbed the headlines and Hanson looked like a
personal fiefdom. Its boss took consolation from a Pounds 42m share dealing
profit.
Come the 1990s, the Hanson group was slow to appreciate the new disciplines
expected of it in an age of good corporate governance. Efforts by Lord
Hanson to restrict shareholders' powers at annual meetings ended in defeat,
and in 1992 a former Hanson protege, Greg Hutchings, chief executive of
industrial conglomerate Tomkins, saw off Hanson's bid for food group RHM.
With Lords Hanson and White playing a less prominent role and the next
generation of managers, such as David Clarke and Derek Bonham, in place,
Hanson has been changing tack, presenting itself as a diverse industrial
group dedicated to its core businesses.
The authors inevitably challenge the legacy of Hanson, which they paint as
the sort of mega-business that is itself ripe for Hanson takeover treatment.
They cite Hanson's already well scrutinised tax and accounting skills as the
principal keys to its progress and question claims of consistently excellent
shareholder returns. Lords Hanson and White, they conclude, must have done
some good but this was outweighed by allegiance to the cult of
short-termism.
The alternative view is that Hanson has shaken up many of the complacent,
corpulent companies in which it has shown an interest. They bucked up their
ideas or they succumbed to a new management which made them efficient and
profitable, either way helping UK plc improve its performance.
Whoever is right, few contemporary capitalists have had so much fun. The
grammar school boy from Huddersfield, now 72 and due to step down in 1997,
reckons no one will realise when he has retired: 'I will be gone and nobody
will notice.' About as likely as Lord Hanson voting Labour.

Sir, I enjoyed Giles MacDonogh's article, 'Vegetarian food terrorism'
(September 17/18).
Not long ago I was introduced to a couple of ladies who promptly informed me
they were vegetarians. Their faces conveyed self-righteousness and even
seemed to challenge me.
My comment was that they were very lucky to have a choice. Having lived most
of my life in what is known as the third world, I ate what was available or
what I could afford.
There followed a dead silence and the subject was then dropped]

FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Cumbre Flamenca - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cumbre Flamenca troupe is back, and that news is probably all the
inducement dance-lovers need to hasten to Rosebery Avenue. The evening is
real, gutsy, life-enhancing. No one will claim that there is much variety
about Flamenco: you watch it for the sake of bodies twisting, stamping; for
flaring emotions; for arabesques of yowling and prodigies of rhythm from
hands and feet. But at its best - and thus it is with Cumbre Flamenca - it
is heady stuff.
What I love especially is the sense in which the performers commune with
themselves. On certain terms, Flamenco is introspective, the performers - be
it singers, guitarists, dancers - dragging their art from their psyches. The
three women, Juana Amaya, Mariquilla, Angela Granados, are wonderfully
contrasted dancers, each a priestess of her own rite. Amaya comes on looking
rather put out - you would hoist storm cones if wife, mother, beloved,
appeared looking like this at breakfast, and duck behind the marmalade. She
seems to sulk her way through the first moments, as singer and guitars urge
her on. Then gradually, she is possessed by her daemon, and the movement
becomes urgent, vicious in its accents, more elemental. Her art is laid bare
for us - nuanced but fierce, uncompromising, stunning. At the end of her
solo, hair everywhere, eyes staring, she seems drained of the wonderful
identity the dance has given her. She is an extraordinary, fascinating
artist.
So, too, is Mariquilla, a darling of the last Cumbre visit. She hurries on
stage fully charged, in 'Now I'll show you' mood, and proceeds to do so. She
is, I must ungallantly observe, no longer in the first flush of girlhood,
but her power and charm are the more tremendous because of that. She marks
out the stage with a first sketch of pose and step: this is her domain. She
broods over some movements. She has lit the blue touch-paper, and we had
better watch out, the fireworks are about to begin. She smiles. She shouts.
The dance takes hold: the wonderful drumming of her feet, the flash of her
torso, her sated look as the movement builds up in speed and her audience
responds to her - these are the marks of great flamenco art. She is
generous, joyous, glorious.
Very different is Angela Granados, whose dancing springs from the
cobra-coils of her dress's train - yards of amber ruffles - and is framed by
her white shawl. It is sensuous, splendidly mannered, iconic. Her movement
is luscious, her style alluring, but it is also hieratic, reduced to a
fascinating essence. Where Juana Amaya and Mariquilla seem driven by the
dance, Granados is always, and beautifully, its mistress.
The two men, Juan Fernandez (who is new to us) and Cristobal Reyes, are no
less well contrasted. Fernandez is an elegant, stylish artist, at his most
compelling when confronting or partnering another dancer. Reyes is a
rhythmic virtuoso, and is phenomenal in a dialogue with the handclaps of
Pedro Montoya, where the rattle and purr of his feet embroider and respond
to rhythms stated by Montoya - it is a bravura display from both men.
The staging remains absolutely simple. The musicians and singers are very
fine - and Jose Luis Monton is superb in a guitar fantasia. The dancers
offer the true raw spirit of flamenco - and as with any slug of raw spirit,
you knock it back and enjoy the intoxicating kick.
At Sadler's Wells until October 8.

<TEXT>
CITY SLICKERS 2 (12) Paul Weiland
ABRAHAM VALLEY (PG) Manoel De Oliveira
GETTYSBURG (PG) Roland F. Maxwell
FAUST (15) Jan Svankmajer
The curse of movie sequels is the tyranny of plot. Part one of a cine-saga
is enriched by the process of introducing characters and developing their
foibles and interplay. In part two that groundwork is done - so the
film-makers must throw down their spades and take up their scaffolding
tools. Build that narrative adventure-playground] Make the characters Do
Something] The higher the climbing-frame the better; and never mind how
silly the design, so long as there are enough 'What next?' rungs to grab the
attention.
City Slickers was a comedy about a band of urban males surrendering to
Nature on a dude cowboy holiday. No plot in particular: just a funny tale of
culture shock in cactusland. CS2 has a different feel from the start. The
humanist honeymoon is over; the Hollywood hokum is about to begin. We
imagine the opening salvoes at the story conference. 'Guys, we gotta have a
story this time round]' And then, 'Guys, we gotta bring Jack Palance back
into this pic even though he died in the first one. He won us an Oscar]'
Well, there are only two ways to bring a dead character back: as a ghost or
a twin. Slickers 2 opts for the second. Grizzled Jack plays his fraternal
double while star/screenwriter Billy Crystal re-plays Mr Menopausal of
Manhattan, whom wild horses would not drag back into the wilderness but whom
a Compelling Plot Device just might. 'Try buried treasure,' an excited
executive must have said. So they do.
Off to wildest Utah go Mitch (Crystal), Phil (Daniel Stern) and a token new
character in Mitch's brother (John Lovitz). And soon Palance is pouncing off
a rock at them. He is after the treasure as well, since it is his Pop's. He
growls; he hisses through that gargoyle mail-slit of a mouth; he generally
behaves like a great character actor required to ham it up.
Not all is lost, even though Palance is squandered. Crystal can still
deliver a mean one-liner, whether discussing brotherhood with Phil - 'I
can't believe you two are from the same gene pool,' says Phil; 'He's from
the shallow end' answers Mitch.
But mostly everyone seems dazed by the piling on of plot and of irrelevant
action sequences, including a silly stampede. Director Paul Weiland, out of
British TV commercials by one disastrous previous feature outing (Leonard
Part VI), brings little flair to the visuals and not much more to the jokes.
For true comedy you should try Abraham Valley. This purports to be a film by
Portuguese director Manoel De Oliveira, maker of those magisterial lost-love
epics Francesca and Amor Di Perdicao. But we wonder at times if it is not a
lost episode of Monty Python.
To escape the life of deranged formality she has been born into - the
sun-lanced salons, the starched dinners - our heroine Ema leads the life of
a woman inspired, as the film and the novel it is drawn from (by Agustina
Bessa-Luis) make clear, by her Flaubertian namesake.
Bovaryish, she marries a medico: 'a clever doctor, expert in phlegm' says
the voice-over narrator. Bovaryish, she has affairs, reads a lot and gets
bored amid the lovely, yawning scenery. The press-show audience gave a
sympathetic chortle when the narrator told us, after two hours of this
near-catatonic three-hour tragedy/social satire/romance, 'Ema was intent on
stepping up the pace of her life, in any way she could think of'.
Yes indeed. If only. Instead, 60 minutes later, she steps on the rotten
plank of a boat jetty and drowns in what appears to be all of three feet of
water.
Like any seraphically bad film, Abraham Valley has its seraphically good
moments. Oliveira can place a human profile against a painterly blur of
autumn colours and make it an image of searing, hieratic beauty. And he can
freeze the film for moments of meditation, when a poised landscape or
character-grouping define not just a moment but a milieu, even an epoch.
But then the film reverts to its crazed story of passion - this woman causes
cars to crash merely by standing on a terrace - and to its Loony Tunes
one-liners from the narrator. 'Ema put on a boiler suit to go mad in a motor
boat,' he intones at one point; and we are almost too dazed to savour the
line's battiness. But how else to bombard a little life into a woman who is
not so much a human being, more a carbon copy of literary heroines past: a
Flaubert parrot, shall we say, mimicking the cries of a superior creation.
Gettysburg is four and a half hours of the magnificent in hand-to-hand
combat with the mundane. It was made for American TV, so we have no big
stars: just big beards and big battles. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen sport
the devouring face-fungus as Confederate Generals Longstreet and Lee and
Jeff Daniels is concealed under a walrus moustache as Colonel Chamberlain.
He held the yankees' flank in round one of the Civil War's bloodiest battle,
leading the bayonet charge from the hill known as Little Round Top.
Daniels shows how it should be done. Not impaling Southerners, we mean, but
holding the high acting ground. He delivers the speeches about democracy
with fearless passion; he delivers the tears as comrades die. Daniels'
piercing simplicity as an actor ends up 'holding the line' for the entire
film.
Nothing matches him. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell spends the first half
rooting for the North, the second hobnobbing in the Southern camp as Sheen,
Berenger and company get ready for the suicidal assault known as Pickett's
March. Hundreds of extras; serial cannons spitting smoke; and an aerial
camera weaving like a conductor's baton to Randy Edelmann's remorselessly
'stirring' music.
We are stirred. But should we not also have been shaken? The deaths are lost
in the grim abundance of clutched stomachs, unhorsed cavalrymen and
blast-catapulted bodies. We tell ourselves to be appalled. But we wait,
vainly, for the one true moment of felt and intimate horror.
Jan Svankmajer's Faust treads the city of Prague like a lost tourist in
Kafkaland. The film begins with live action, as our clerkish, woebegone hero
(Petr Cepek) threads the city's alleys and labyrinths as if they were the
mazes of his own minds. Then on dance menacing puppets, the writhing clay
creatures, the bald, hog-toothed Mephistopheles and the giant wooden mask
that disgorges mini-marionettes like Gulliver throwing up Lilliputians.
Kafka? Make that Kafka with a dash of Swift, Spitting Image and Hieronymous
Bosch. Much of Faust is appallingly funny; most of it is inspirationally
surreal; and some of it is a touch laborious, as we would expect when a
short-film genius goes to feature length. Wit and vision, though, are rare
enough in the movie world: we are not about to send them back even when they
are thinly spread.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Joking Apart - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching Alan Ayckbourn's plays today prompts an increasingly two-pronged
reaction. On the one hand, as soon as the curtain rises, you still feel that
you have been watching this kind of play all your life. The middle-class
English milieux that Ayckbourn puts onstage feel so normal, the kinds of
remarks his characters make sound so ordinary, and the social satire
involved is so classic. On the other hand, there is the peculiar fact that
virtually no one else has been writing plays of this ilk for years.
Ayckbourn today is becoming as isolated as Coward did in the 1950s: a
virtuoso of an old but no longer fashionable school.
Well, fashion be damned: the Greenwich Theatre has launched its new season
with an old Ayckbourn play, Joking Apart, and the main emotion I felt on the
opening night, returning to Ayckbourn, was blessed relief. A real play] -
with characters and dialogue crafted from the first moment to the last; and
without being reinterpreted by latterday concepts. A good Ayckbourn is
sheerest tonic.
Joking Apart (1979) is about a genuinely happy and fortunate couple, Richard
and Anthea; but they themselves are not funny. All around them, however, are
old friends who are increasingly unhappy and unfortunate, and who
increasingly realise how unhappy and unfortunate they are. There are the
useless new vicar Hugh (who falls in love with Anthea) and his nervous wife
Louise (who winds up between stimulants and tranquillisers); and Sven (one
of those people who is never wrong, until he is grimly forced to learn that
he is usually wrong) and his wife Olive (who lives vicariously through him,
though by the end she is learning that it is not worth it); and Brian (who
fell in love with Anthea years ago, and can conceal this fact neither from
her nor from his succession of subsequent girlfriends). And it is the
disasters of their lives, as contrasted against the generous serenity of
Richard's and Anthea's, which Ayckbourn makes so dreadfully funny.
Yes, dreadfully funny. By the last scene I repeatedly found that no sooner
did I guffaw with laughter that I had to clap my hand over my mouth in
appalled embarrassment. A little of Sven's old self-assurance surfaces, as
he watches Richard fixing some lights, and he tells him 'You'll never do it
if you do it that way', at which point Richard proclaims: 'That's done it]'
 -and, lo and behold, the lights work. Sven, crushed again, looks away in
silence; he has grown resigned to defeat. Finally he makes an address to
Anthea's daughter Debbie, 'on behalf of life's losers'. The pain through
which you laugh at all this is Ayckbourn's special feat.
It is a tribute to Ayckbourn's mastery that, even though I always remembered
what would happen next, I still followed everything with wholly fresh
delight. It is also a tribute to this Greenwich revival, directed by Robin
Herford. All the players are good, and two are outstanding. John Arthur
completely catches the difficult Sven, smouldering with barely hidden
aggression; and has the brilliant timing whereby the simple repetition of
'Yes' (pause) 'Yes' (longer pause) 'Yes' sums up all his dawning sense of
perpetual defeat. And Liz Crowther is uncannily fine as Louise, awkward and
tense and brittle with her husband and everyone else. Looking someone in the
eye and talking to them at the same time is too much for her; so she does
one or the other.
Greenwich Theatre, until October 29.

It is a good evening for 'pastime' programmes. At 8.00 BBC2 starts a new
six-part series of The Edge looking at the history of Scottish
mountaineering. At the same time C4 begins a repeat of Wildshots, a
five-part series in which photographer Chris Packham gives hints on wildlife
photography. That is followed by a new series of Screaming Reels, which is
not about horror movies but fishing (8.30). At the same moment BBC2 begins
another series of Top Gear, the highly successful series for motoring
freaks. In its Brando season C4 shows the 1952 movie Viva Zapata] in which
Marlon smoulders and snarls behind lots of face fungus. It is not a great
film, but Kazan directed from Steinbeck's script, and Anthony Quinn won an
Oscar in the role of Zapata's brother (10.00). Inside Story tells of the
lives of twins June and Jennifer Gibbons. As children they spoke only to one
another, though they seemed to have a love-hate relationship. Sent to
Broadmoor after a series of arson attacks, they were released in 1993
whereupon Jennifer stopped living, though she took no active steps to end
her life (10.00 BBC1).

FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Toshiba support for the ICA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Contemporary Arts, London's guardian of the avant-garde, is
to change its name, and, ideally, its home. In future it will be known the
ICA (Sponsored by Toshiba), and by the millennium hopes to be in new, more
flexible, premises, with Blackfriars Bridge its preferred site.
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, is giving the ICA Pounds
500,000 over three years and in return will have its name attached to every
piece of publicity material and event at the ICA. It also gets the
opportunity to display its newest hardware in the foyer of the ICA's Mall
galleries.
The money will enable the ICA to mount more adventurous art shows, cinema
seasons and plays. The deal also involves support in kind. Toshiba was
looking for an arts sponsorship which conveyed cutting edge innovation and
the ICA certainly provides that. There will be no interference in
programming policy.
Although a Nash terrace in the Mall is an unusual and prestigious site for
an ikon of the new, the building is the wrong shape. The hunt is on for a
new home and architects will be appointed by the end of the year. There is
an interesting jetty near Blackfriars Bridge, close to the Tate's proposed
Bankside site for its new Gallery of Modern Art, which looks ideal.
The cost of the new ICA will be over Pounds 20m and it joins the long queue
for lottery money, ideally from the Millennium Fund, perhaps from the Arts
Council Lottery cash bank. The council is a good friend of the ICA and
raised its grant by 7 per cent this year. But the ICA still manages to earn
two thirds of its Pounds 2.4m annual turnover.

series on IT innovation in the financial services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the depths of Midland Global Market's blue glass offices by the River
Thames, a phalanx of computers is engaged in a battle of man against
machine. These systems, which have the collective power of a supercomputer,
are attempting to find ways to beat the financial markets more consistently
than human traders.
Between five and 25 times a day, the basement's rarefied atmosphere is
disturbed by a few bars of Deutschland uber Alles or the Star Spangled
Banner. These tunes are emitted by a computer signalling a recommendation to
buy or sell futures - the right or obligation to buy or sell a bond or other
financial instrument at a certain date - in one of five markets: the bund
(German bonds), FT-SE, US Treasury Bond, Swiss Franc or S&amp;P500.
This is an example of a new phenomenon in the banking world. Midland's
16-month-old experiment with computer-based predictive models is one of
numerous attempts in the City of London and Wall Street to find reliable
ways of making money from advances in computing and mathematical theory.
Over the past few years, the financial institutions have recruited
mathematicians and physicists - known in the City as 'rocket scientists' -
on an unprecedented scale. The Midland team, for example, includes two
people who really are rocket scientists; the others have degrees and
doctorates in physics, mathematics and engineering.
Computerised trading models have aroused intense controversy. Their
champions argue that 'intelligent' computer software will soon oust
highly-paid traders; detractors argue that they are a pointless sideline,
based on inherently flawed assumptions about the way that markets work.
Some aspects of this debate are not new. Fascination with methods of
predicting the market goes back centuries. For example, one system which
gained popularity in the 1870s advised the investor to buy on the stock
exchange when it had moved up by 10 per cent and sell when it had moved down
by 10 per cent.
The difficulty of manipulating data by hand put tight constraints on the
number and complexity of trading rules that could be tested against the
market. It was only when powerful computers and detailed historical market
data became available that the creation of models could be pushed into a
different league.
The Midland system, for example, involves about 60 personal computers and a
16 gigabyte database, which holds up to 20 years of market data. It receives
250,000 prices daily, each of which is time-stamped with a radio signal from
an atomic clock.
But can computer models really predict the ways markets move? Classical
economic theory suggests there is no systematic way to beat the market other
than by receiving sensitive information faster. The markets are inherently
unpredictable because they are only moved by unexpected news; old news is
already assimilated in the market.
This theory is seen by some as an over-simplification. Markets are driven by
many different players, such as market makers, speculators, portfolio
managers and central bankers. Since they have different investment horizons
and different attitudes to risk, they may react to the same information in
different ways.
Many theorists believe that although most market movements are random, a
sizeable proportion is not. Paul Refenes, head of non-linear applications
and financial engineering at the London Business School, believes that
sophisticated mathematical models based on non-linear dynamics are, in
principle, capable of predicting 30 per cent of market movements.
Although Nick Idelson, head of Midland's computer-based predictive models,
is convinced that non-linear dynamics apply to the financial markets, his
models are not based on any general theory. They have been derived by
testing a large number of intuitive ideas about rules governing the markets.
The models work by trying to make more money on successful trades than they
lose on unsuccessful trades. One of the Midland models makes money despite
getting the direction of the market wrong more often than it gets it right.
In general, the six portfolios make less money than the firm's traders but
they perform more consistently. Midland's S&amp;P500 models have beaten the
S&amp;P500 index three-fold over two years.
Their performance has by no means been faultless. For example, the model
made significant losses in March and April - triggered, Idelson believes, by
Japanese funds pulling large sums of money out of the bond markets. The
model could not cope with this because the market conditions were unlike any
encountered during testing.
This highlights an important dilemma for model builders, namely deciding the
exact circumstances when a trader should override the decisions made by the
model. Some traders believe that automated trading machines should be
switched off whenever market conditions differ from those in historical
simulations. But ultimately, the decision about when to switch the machine
on and off is a matter of subjective judgment.
The problem of judging when the machine will be unable to cope with
anomalous market conditions is made more acute by another possible
explanation for a poor performance by a model, known as 'over-fitting' -
when so many rules are incorporated in the model that it fits the historical
data on which it was tested but is a dismal failure in live trading. This is
a common pitfall for model builders who unwittingly take familiar data into
account when designing their model or choosing their parameters.
Another problem arises from changes in the pattern and behaviour of markets.
Models should be periodically monitored to discover if there is a 'slow
drift' in empirical parameters used to describe markets over time, according
to Idelson.
To some extent, it is inevitable that models may become obsolete. If enough
people discover and exploit the same anomalies and patterns in the market,
those anomalies and patterns will eventually disappear. 'It is a vicious
circle,' says Refenes. 'The more tools there are, the more efficient the
markets will become. Therefore they (traders) demand better tools and the
market becomes still more efficient.'
But this is seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat by Richard Olsen,
who heads Olsen &amp; Associates, a Zurich-based research institute. He argues
that the additional trading opportunities created by computer models will
lead to higher market volumes, which will reduce transaction costs. This
will increase opportunities for short-term trading, creating a more complex
market and new opportunities for profitable trading models.
To some, this vision of wealth-creating computers is an absurdity; others
believe it is already within their grasp. Depending on which view is
vindicated, the impact of new technology on the financial markets will
either be a passing phenomenon, or will have profound, long-term effects.
The next article in the series will focus on computing tools.

FT  22 SEP 94 / People: Richards to pep up Peptide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peptide Therapeutics, the biopharmaceutical development company which is
planning a flotation later this year, has appointed one of the UK's leading
bio-technology scientists, Brian Richards, as its non-executive chairman.
Richards, 62, has a string of academic qualifications starting with a first
class degree in agricultural sciences from the Aberystwyth branch of the
University of Wales in 1952. Ten years later he was Reader in biological
sciences at the University of London, assisting in the establishment of the
UK's first school of biological sciences.
In 1966 Richards helped set up a UK research laboratory for the US company
GD Searle &amp; Co, which pioneered research into immunology and genetic
engineering. Monsanto bought GD Searle in 1986, whereupon Richards, together
with Keith McCullagh and Geoffrey Eckersley, started British Bio-Technology
(BB), backed by Pounds 3.5m from UK and US investors; Richards remains
non-executive chairman.
Peptide's main areas of research focus on asthma, allergies and rheumatoid
arthritis, while BB is currently engaged in programmes for anti-cancer
treatments, though it too is engaged in research into treating side-effects
of asthma.
Besides his role at BB, Richards recently chaired a Stock Exchange committee
which considered the current listing rules for science-based companies.

Michael Sennott is marking his 30th year with McCann-Erickson with a new job
and a change of scenery. The advertising agency's 52-year-old vice-chairman
is about to move from New York to London to become director of its largest
regional operating arm, McCann-Erickson Europe.
Beginning at the new year, Sennott will take over from Max Cusnir, a
worldwide executive vice-president at the agency. Cusnir, a 62-year-old
Belgian, will remain in Europe to work on international business development
projects, reporting directly to John Dooner, president and chief executive
of McCann Worldwide.
The assignment is somewhat of a reprise for Sennott. In the early 1990s, the
executive shared responsibility with Cusnir for managing the European
operation, which currently manages Dollars 2.5bn in advertising accounts for
its clients. After completing that assignment, Sennott was appointed to his
current post, which carries the additional title of worldwide director of
multinational accounts. McCann has not named his successor.

David Hall has been appointed chief executive of Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the
specialist engineering group, in a move that follows the decision to sell
most of its light engineering division.
The appointment ends an arrangement under which JFB had two joint managing
directors, Hall and George Hardie. The portfolio of companies are being
bought by Clearbase, a consortium led by Hardie, who also ran the light
engineering division. Hardie has now resigned as a director of JFB.
Hardie was also finance director, and is replaced in this capacity by Neil
MacDonald, who was appointed a JFB director last month. Tony Edisbury has
resigned as company secretary, replaced by John Bergin.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Technology: Smoking out the truth - Sheila Jones and Frances
Williams on the statistics of tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Statistics can give imprecise truths, precise lies, but never facts. Yet
statistical studies of smoking habits and mortality rates in the developed
world have established in the minds of most that there is a strong link
between smoking and the incidence of lung cancer and other diseases.
Earlier this week, the World Health Organisation and the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund published their study, Mortality from Smoking in Developed
Countries 1950-2000*. It concludes that 3m people worldwide are dying each
year through diseases related to smoking. The tobacco 'epidemic' is killing
six people a minute.
The study, citing US data, found that the risk of lung cancer is 24 times
higher for a smoker than a non-smoker. For heart disease the risk is three
times greater.
The tobacco industry, as a whole, has fought hard against a growing mountain
of statistical evidence.
John Ashford, a consultant in statistics, dismissed the WHO/ICRF study this
week in a BBC radio tussle with Richard Peto, one of the co-authors.
According to Ashford, an adviser to several international tobacco companies,
the study is 'scaremongering - generating very large numbers and using them
to frighten people'.
Studies since the 1950s, when Sir Richard Doll first pointed to a causal
link between smoking and cancer, have all painted the same picture: that
tobacco kills. This is the point about statistics, says Peto. 'We are not
claiming precision, but we are getting the right picture,' he says. 'The
overall numbers might be too high or too low, but using the same methods in
different years and in different countries, you can see how the epidemic is
evolving.'
The WHO/ICRF report bases its conclusions and forecasts in large part on
data collected in the US and the UK. It examines smoking habits and
mortality rates over four decades. Forecasts are based on the proportion of
smokers in the population, and on the assumed risk based on US and UK data.
The main point is to examine smokers and death rates over prolonged periods,
according to the authors. The current epidemic is among males in the
developed world who started smoking as young men in the mid-1940s. The
increase in male deaths is slowing, as smokers in the developed world
respond to health warnings, but it is speeding up among female smokers, and
among men in developing countries, where smoking has been taken up later.
In the US, researchers asked 1m Americans in the early 1980s how much they
smoked and monitored their death rates over the next few years. The US is a
'mature epidemic population' - that is, the risks of smoking have had the
chance to work through a lifetime.
A UK study of 40,000 doctors, which asked the same sort of questions in
1951, came to broadly similar conclusions. Both studies found that smokers
faced a much greater risk than non-smokers of premature death from lung
cancer or from vascular and respiratory diseases.
The WHO/ICRF study goes on to predict that the worst is yet to come,
especially in developing countries, where smoking is rising among men. There
is no evidence the trend applies to women yet, but it could come with
economic modernisation and changing lifestyles, according to Alan Lopez,
another co-author.
The quality of the data in the developing world is mixed, says Lopez. 'But
for some countries, such as China, we have very precise information . . . we
know a lot of men are smoking in developing countries. We don't know for
sure what the risk of death from smoking is in these countries because the
full impact is yet to come.'
The WHO/ICRF authors say their next task is to gather yet more statistics.
'They won't change the big picture,' says Peto. 'But they're bound to change
the fine detail. The question with statistics is not 'is this exactly
right?' No, it isn't. But, if you ask: 'is this the order of the epidemic?'
Yes it is.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / People: Downing emerges at Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has bolstered its European business
with the appointment of James Downing as head of strategic advisory services
for Europe.
The new head of Lehman's European M&amp;A is another high-level departure from
Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A boutique involved in many of the most prominent
transactions of the late 1980s.
Joseph Perella, one of its founders, parted company in 1993, and altogether
at least six senior figures have left in the past 12 months.
Two of them have gone to Lehman Brothers. Francois Faure made a similar move
to Downing's in June. Formerly head of M&amp;A for Wasserstein Perella in Paris,
he moved to join Lehman's team covering French M&amp;A.
Downing says he is moving to Lehman Brothers because of its diversity of
products which he contrasts with the focused approach of Wasserstein
Perella. 'It is important to broaden out,' he says.
Downing joined Wasserstein Perella from CS First Boston, where he worked
from 1985. He has been involved in M&amp;A since 1982 in both New York and
London; he is a graduate of Yale school of management.

for acquisitions. He is unlikely to be disappointed.
In December 1993, after the publication of the financial reporting exposure
draft (Fred 7) on fair values in acquisition provisions, he let it be known
that he would be 'checking the wheel nuts on my car from now on'. The joke
was in character and this week, following the publication of the largely
unaltered financial reporting standard 7, he was typically robust in
anticipating vocal and organised opposition.
Criticism of FRS 7 amounts to more than a dispute over accounting
principles. Much of the opposition which has already surfaced is fighting a
different battle: that against what is seen as prescriptive regulation
overriding the professional judgment of the auditor.
Critics of FRS 7, or at least elements of it, include the Hundred Group of
the finance directors of companies in the FTSE-100 share index, and even one
member of the ASB itself. But Sir David says the ASB listened very carefully
to such objections during the consultation process before deciding to stand
by the general thrust of the exposure draft.
It is not difficult to see why Sir David has had his eye on acquisition
accounting right from the moment that the ASB came into being in 1990. The
treatment of provisions became a controversial issue during the wave of
takeovers of the late 1980s.
Provisions can be appropriate but the ASB believes that FRS 7 will
substantially reduce the scope for companies to manipulate profits by
creating generous pre-acquisition provisions in the balance sheet for items
such as stock writedowns and reorganisation charges. These costs by-pass the
profit and loss account of the acquirer, and the unused provisions can later
be released to bolster profits.
Sir David's objection is to what he calls 'big bath' accounting, by which
companies can throw in large provisions supposedly to cover a multitude of
future expenses. One of his main objections is to what might be called
'psychoanalytical' accounting: making a provision on the basis of a stated
intention to incur a future expense. He also objects to the effect
provisions can have on financial reporting: for two or three years after an
acquisition, he maintains, it has often been difficult to see where the
profits have been coming from.
Up till now, the scope for widespread use of pre-acquisition provisions has
been plentiful under SSAP 22, the existing accounting standard dealing with
goodwill - the difference between the net asset value and the purchase price
of an acquired business.
A classic example is provided by Terry Smith in his book Accounting for
Growth, in which he considers the acquisition of the textile company John
Crowther by Coloroll, the wallpaper manufacturer. Crowther was acquired for
Pounds 213m in shares and cash, with related goodwill in Coloroll's accounts
shown as Pounds 224m] Thus Coloroll wrote off Pounds 11m more than the total
cost of Crowther.
The Accounting Standards Committee, predecessor of the ASB, tried to tighten
down the screws in 1990 with non-mandatory guidance which called for a ban
on provisions for future earnings, and far tighter rules on reorganisation
expenses.
Despite such pressure, a survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
accounts monitoring service, showed that of companies with turnover above
Pounds 300m which made acquisitions during 1991 and 1992, provisions were an
average of 35 per cent of the purchase price.
'Accounting for acquisitions has long been seen as fertile ground for
manipulating figures,' Sir David said this week. 'This is in no one's
interests as it creates an atmosphere of suspicion and it puts unfair
pressure on many companies that try to present their results honestly.
'The new standards favour neither one side not the other but reflect an
objective and neutral approach, and I believe that they will restore much
needed credibility in the reporting of acquisitions.'
The ASB has the support of several leading investment institutions, several
big manufacturers, and a collection of 'think tanks'.
Mr David Porteous, head of technical compliance at the London Stock
Exchange, has also backed the ASB's stand: 'A financial reporting standard
based on the exposure draft will make a major contribution to ensuring that
there is consistent treatment of acquisitions which should lead to greater
comparability of the results reported by acquisitive companies.'
Opposition to FRS 7 focuses on two areas. One is a technical criticism that
the standard does not reflect commercial reality. The ASB acknowledges that
some preparers of accounts believe its approach 'ignored the commercial
reality of the transaction by treating as an expense the costs of
reorganisation that the acquirer regards as part of the capital cost of the
acquisition; and that within defined limits a provision for planned
post-acquisition expenditure should be permitted to be included in the net
asset acquired'.
The ASB has rejected this argument, with one dissenting vote, and insists:
'Acquisition accounting should reflect the business that is acquired as it
stands at the date of acquisition and ought not to take account of the
changes that an acquirer might intend to make subsequently.'
The Hundred Group is critical of FRS 7 while reiterating its support for
stamping out abuses in financial reporting and 'inappropriate flexibility'.
'We part company with the ASB, however, when they introduce a new standard
which does, in our view, destroy one of the basic principles of accounting
under which capital and revenue costs are kept separate.'
The group offers an example: 'If you buy a house for, say, Pounds 100,000
that you know needs Pounds 50,000 spent on it to bring it into good
condition and make it equivalent to a property that sells for Pounds
150,000, then you would treat the Pounds 50,000 renovation expense as part
of the cost of the house and not as part of ordinary outgoings.'
The group states that FRS 7 goes beyond standards set in other countries,
including the US. It also recommends that abuses in this area should be
dealt with by tightening existing accounting standards and through 'proper
policing' by external auditors and 'not by distorting accounting concepts'.
This reference to auditors underlines a second area of criticism: that the
standard undermines, to some extent, the professional judgment of the
auditor.
Mr Christopher Pearce, chairman of the technical committee of the group,
believes that despite laudable intentions, the ASB has over prescribed in an
area where the good judgment of auditors should have been considered
sufficient.
Mr Roger Davis, the head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that the
standard fails to reflect commercial reality and helps encourage the concept
that auditors are not to be trusted to use professional judgment. He sees
FRS 7 as part of the 'slide towards a legalistic profession'.
Writing recently in the FT, Mr Davis painted this rather sombre background
to the appearance of FRS 7: 'The British created accountancy as a real
profession in which experienced professional judgment counted for more than
theory. It led much of the world. It is time for my profession to wake up
and realise we now face the greatest challenge in our history to retain our
relevance to the business community.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Societies hang on to
homely image - Alison Smith finds that the traditional mortgage lenders have
retained the public's affection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in mortgage interest rates has created some unwelcome
publicity for lenders about the rates they will soon be charging their
customers.
Not for the first time commentators have highlighted the way the new rates
tend to be passed on more quickly to borrowers than to savers.
For the most part, however, the building societies that dominate the UK
mortgage market have a markedly better public reputation than the high
street banks, even though the financial services they offer increasingly
overlap.
Earlier this year, a survey by polling organisation BMRB for
the Building Societies Association suggested that societies were regarded
more positively than banks or insurance companies, scoring more strongly on
fair dealing, communicating with customers, taking complaints seriously and
being more understanding of those with financial problems.
It is perhaps striking, therefore, that more societies do not exploit this
apparent affection more vigorously in their advertising. Only the Nationwide
 -with its slogan 'The 'Building' Society', and its use of staff to devise
and appear in advertisements - has wholeheartedly cultivated this
traditional image.
'We want to put across that we are an honest, open, decent type of
organisation to do business with,' says Dennis Brockwell, Nationwide
marketing director.
'Using real people has given us credibility compared with some of our
competitors. Customers have asked local staff why they have not appeared in
the campaign.'
By contrast, the line in the Halifax campaign - 'The building society you
can bank on' - looks like an attempt to combine the warmth felt for
societies with a claim for competence in delivering services which may not
be so immediately associated with the sector.
Other recent campaigns - such as the one promoting the Alliance &amp;
Leicester's new Alliance current account - have concentrated on particular
products or services and made no feature of the type of organisation
offering them.
This lack of emphasis is particularly notable given the lengths to which
Abbey National, the former society turned bank, has gone to retain the
affection people apparently feel for societies.
The group decided not to include the word 'bank' in its name within the UK
to distance itself from the four largest clearing banks. It also kept its
logo - two people walking along with the roof of a house as an umbrella -
which has been used since 1944.
Whatever their differences there is a general consensus among societies that
seeking to differentiate themselves explicitly from banks is not the answer.
A&amp;L has a particular complication, as John Day, director of marketing,
admits. One of its subsidiaries is Girobank, which it bought from the Post
Office in 1990.
Day is wary of contrasting banks and societies in A&amp;L's marketing, though he
emphasises that the society does not want to be seen as 'bank-like' in terms
of the standards of services which customers expect.
'We feel you have to be careful how you take that stance - after all we are
moving more into banking products,' he says.
The Halifax is aware that the perceived virtues of societies can be seen as
weaknesses too. However 'nice' societies are thought to be, they are not
necessarily viewed as efficient, particularly in delivering services, where
the premium is on speed and accuracy rather than the personal touch.
Mike Lavender, marketing assistant general manager, says 'The building
society you can bank on' slogan, which suggests the best of both worlds, is
being used specifically to promote banking products such as current accounts
and motor insurance.
At the same time the Halifax aims to retain what Lavender calls the 'warm
and cuddly' image through its more general television advertising, which is
based on the idea of people coming together to build structures.
This theme was developed three years ago to prevent the erosion of support
for the society as it diversified into new activities which were further
away from societies' roots.
'You can't go into bank accounts or estate agency without perhaps some drag
on the brand,' Lavender says. He believes that as societies take more
advantage of the opportunities to diversify, other large societies will try
to 'get back to that warm feeling'.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Signs of the times -
Russia has become an advertiser's dream, but a nightmare for regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when the only advertisements on the roof-tops of Russian
cities were imposing slogans extolling the virtues of the proletariat and
the glories of the communist party. But since the collapse of Soviet power,
the cities' skylines have been transformed. Giant neon signs now light up
the night sky promoting Marlboro cigarettes or Sanyo stereo systems. They
are the most visible sign that Russia's consumer age has dawned.
Turn on the television and the change is just as startling. Commercials now
teem between Mexican soap operas and glitzy game shows. Elsewhere,
billboards have mushroomed, glossy magazines are eagerly devoured and
flysheets handed out at metro stops promise returns of 1,600 per cent a year
from various investment funds. 'The advertising market really only began
here two-and-a-half years ago but it has been growing at a phenomenal rate
ever since,' says Pallavi Sodhi, media director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather's Moscow
office.
But advertising's helter-skelter growth has occurred almost entirely
unchecked and there has been little debate about who should regulate these
new powers of persuasion. The threat from the unscrupulous is great because
of advertising's novelty. 'In the west most people instinctively distrust
what they see in commercials. Here that is still not the case,' one western
advertising executive says.
Russians' susceptibility to extravagant claims has been highlighted by the
rise and slide of the MMM pyramid scheme which sucked in investors' money
through an advertising campaign, estimated to have cost Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.5m). In spite of the government's warning that MMM investment
certificates were little more than 'pretty postcards', the company continued
advertising during many of Russia's most popular television shows. The
government has now banned MMM from advertising in state-run media but it has
simply switched to private media outlets. The humdrum star of its television
advertisements, Lyonya Golubkov, can still be seen most nights dancing with
a Mexican soap opera queen.
The lack of regulation has led Russian psychologists to warn of other
dangers such as subliminal advertising, in which images flashed up in the
middle of a commercial leave an impression on the subconscious mind. That
may be relatively harmless when ice cream is being sold but fears are
spreading that such techniques could be used for sinister political
purposes.
'What if someone wanted to make Lyonya Golubkov president?' the weekly
magazine New Times asked in a long examination of advertising's new power.
The effective use of television was one of the main reasons for the strong
showing of the extreme nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, in last year's
presidential elections, the magazine observed.
The government has finally responded to such concerns and is drafting a law
to regulate the industry. This promises to stop all advertising from
unlicensed companies, such as MMM. It would also ban subliminal advertising
and insist all material is 'trustworthy and conscientious'.
All cigarette and alcohol advertising would be banned and measures
introduced to protect the young from unscrupulous campaigns.
But the most critical test of the legislation will be its implementation. As
a scathing front-page article in Pravda observed, it is already supposedly
illegal to advertise potentially harmful products, such as alcohol and
cigarettes, under the government's existing health laws. The government
lacks effective powers of enforcement and Russian businesses have a proven
ability of staying one step ahead of officials. Completely new advertising
channels, such as the fast-growing unofficial cable television operators,
also threaten to become the regulators' nightmare.
The biggest battle, though, is likely to be fought on mainstream television,
which accounts for three-quarters of all estimated advertising expenditure.
About 99 per cent of the Russian population have access to television with
the main channel, Ostankino, reaching a potential 280m people in the former
Soviet Union and beyond. Despite recent sharp rises in the cost of
advertising, it remains extremely cheap compared with other countries and an
attractive means of promoting products.
'We like and use television advertising because of the sheer size of the
country,' says Michael Parsons, eastern Europe spokesman for Philip Morris,
which advertises many cigarette and food brands in Russia, such as Marlboro.
'There are 11 time zones and there is no other really effective means of
reaching consumers across such a large land mass.'
Most western multinational companies operating in Russia say they have their
own strict guidelines on what advertising material they use. The big western
agencies, such as DMB&amp;B, Young &amp; Rubicam, BBDO, and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which
were the first to develop the Russian market, also claim - somewhat piously
 -that they are bound by ethical considerations.
But there are few restrictions to stop any company, such as MMM, producing
its own advertisements and putting them on the air. Many Russian
entrepreneurs have also moved into creative advertising. One estimate
suggests there may be as many as 800 agencies in Moscow alone - many of them
of dubious reputation.
But the biggest and the best of them, such as Video International and
Premier SV, have rapidly evolved into formidable operations. They are
already making high-quality advertisements, including some for western
agencies and clients, and have strengthened their grip on the media market
by buying up big chunks of advertising time on the main television channels.
Alexei Gusev, director of Video International, says the private company now
employs 250 full-time staff and uses more than 100 free-lances. He forecasts
that its annual income will have jumped from Dollars 250,000 three years ago
to more than Dollars 10m by the end of this year. Video International has
secured its position by buying up more than half the advertising time
available on Ostankino.
Yegor Makhalov, production director of Premier SV, says the Russian
advertising industry is learning fast and will soon prove more than a match
for the western agencies. 'Technically the western agencies are better but
Russian agencies have good ideas and know a lot more about how the Russian
market works,' he says.
If the government's attempts at regulation prove fruitless, it may
ultimately have to rely on these new power brokers to win the nation's
hearts and minds. Significantly, perhaps, the ministry of finance has just
commissioned its own advertising campaign to fight the financial fraudsters.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Strike costs BR Pounds 200m in lost revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signal workers' strike has cost British Rail Pounds 200m in lost
revenues and is leading to the loss of 'core business' which may never be
regained, Mr John Nelson, managing director of BR's south-eastern train
operations, said yesterday.
The RMT transport union said last night the strike planned for tomorrow was
still on after talks aimed at resolving the three-month dispute adjourned
without result.
The conciliation service Acas said both sides recognised that wage
negotiations between the RMT and Railtrack would have to continue for
several days. The two sides last met for talks in mid July.
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, had earlier called on the RMT as a
gesture of goodwill to suspend its threat of strikes tomorrow and for next
Thursday and Friday.
Mr Nelson told a quarterly meeting of the Central Rail Users' Consultative
Committee, a national passenger watchdog, that the loss of revenue in London
and the south-east alone was Pounds 100m, which is nearly 10 per cent of the
region's annual turnover.
And in a separate presentation, Mr Horton told the committee that Railtrack,
which owns and operates BR's track and stations, had lost Pounds 100m in
access fees.
Mr Nelson said: 'The impact of the strike is being felt right across the
railway . . . even in the London area, which has been considered as a
'captive' market, we are beginning to see signs of erosion of our business.
'This is very damaging to the structure of the railway and our aspirations
for the business,' Mr Nelson said. The punctuality and reliability of
services was starting to deteriorate, which was a 'sickening' development
given the effort the railways had made to improve their performance.
The vulnerability of the railway to strike action could mean the government
would in future be less willing to provide funds, he suggested.
Mr Horton said that Railtrack would have to fund its strike losses by
cutting investment this year.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Cable TV service for City launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Videotron, the largest cable television operator in London, yesterday
launched what it described as the first public business multimedia service
in the UK.
The new television service will combine data, sound and pictures in as many
as 48 channels devoted to the business market and delivered to the personal
computers of subscribers in Westminster and the City.
The Westminster cable franchise is held by British Telecommunications but
the Department of Trade and Industry earlier this year awarded Videotron a
licence to offer competing telephony services to business and residential
customers in the area. The Canadian-owned cable group is now laying a Pounds
38m high-capacity fibre-optic network in Westminster and the City.
Videotron will compete for estimated average annual telecommunication
revenues within the City of Pounds 67.5m per sq km.
Unlike other telephone companies Videotron is also to offer television
services to the business market - although under its licence it cannot offer
general entertainment.
Early next year Reuters, the information and media group, will provide a
business news service for Videotron. There will probably be a two-hour
business programme and a similar programme towards the end of the business
day, plus a non-stop stream of prices and other data.

Delegates approved a motion condemning the government for 'prolonging the
rail strike'.
Mr Nick Harvey, MP for North Devon and industry spokesman, said the dispute
was close to being settled in June when ministers intervened. He maintained
that the government's intransigence would be responsible for the increase in
fares likely after a settlement.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Anti-nuclear policy survives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown was narrowly spared further embarrassment when a majority
of four votes prevented the party's consistent opposition to nuclear power
being overturned.
Divisions among the leadership as well as the rank and file emerged amid
repeated demands that the party adopt a less prejudiced stance pending the
outcome of the review of the nuclear industry ordered by the government.
The initial vote, on a show of hands, was judged to have carried a motion
refusing to reaffirm the existing policy. After protests from the floor a
count was held and the decision was reversed with the existing policy upheld
by 226 votes to 222.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader, voted to reaffirm the party's opposition to
the nuclear energy industry while other MPs abstained.

FT  22 SEP 94 / MP leads activist warning on Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Liz Lynne, the Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, yesterday put herself at
the head of a fringe group of the party which is unwilling to see any
rapprochement with Labour before the next election, James Blitz writes.
Amid deep divisions among Liberal Democrats over how they should approach Mr
Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, Ms Lynne told a fringe meeting at the
Brighton conference she was opposed to initiating talks between the parties.
Arguing that Labour remained dominated by old-style socialists, she said: 'I
don't think Tony Blair will be able to deliver. He hasn't put any flesh on
his policies.'
Her comments were warmly received by about 150 Liberal Democrat activists
attending a meeting of the Urban Campaign Network, which aims to co-ordinate
the Liberal Democrat campaign against Labour in inner-city areas.
The strong support shown for Ms Lynne will serve as a warning to Mr Paddy
Ashdown not to hint at a rapprochement with Labour in his keynote speech
today if he is to keep his party united.
The strong opposition towards Labour among Liberal Democrat councillors is
not shared by most of the parliamentary party.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Political Notebook: Dodging the political realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one, least of all Mr Tony Blair, will be surprised by the apparent fall
in Labour's lead in the opinion polls. In relative terms the opposition
always fares badly during parliament's summer break. The Blair bubble was
destined to burst.
The latest snapshots of public opinion should inject a dose of realism into
politics during the distinctly surreal world of the autumn conference
season. The next general election is at least two years off. Labour needed
reminding that the result is not pre-ordained.
The precise voting intention figures are unimportant. Take account of all
the technical adjustments the pollsters make these days and a Friday night
vox-pop in the local pub provides as accurate a picture.
In broad terms where we stand is as follows: the electorate is still
bitterly resentful about the pain inflicted on them by the recession. They
feel suspicious of the present and insecure about the future. Their anger
over tax increases is matched by concern over crime and dismay over the
state of the health and education services. Fewer than a third can bring
themselves to admit they will vote Conservative next time.
Labour is still way out in front. The late Mr John Smith offered solid
reassurance. Mr Blair promises excitement alongside the responsibility. Half
the electorate says today it would vote Labour if there were a general
election tomorrow.
But that judgment - as anyone in the pub will tell you - is only
half-formed. The voters like Mr Blair, but many are not at all sure about
the rest of the Labour party. The unions are down but not out. The left may
be biding its time. The new leader must prove in Blackpool next month that
he lives as comfortably with his own party as with the wider electorate.
This is not a static picture. The opinion polls will be volatile, but -
barring another bout of self-destructive panic in the Tory party (and that
can never be ruled out) - the government's underlying position should begin
to consolidate and then improve. The first economic recovery in living
memory which is not being driven by a housing boom will take a long time to
deliver political rewards. The government will discover that the punters
quite like a burst of the sort of inflation that puts Pounds 20,000 on the
value of the average semi.
But falling unemployment and modest improvements in living standards should
allow Mr John Major to start building on the core Tory vote. He understands
the urgency. If Mr Blair is still 20 points ahead a year from now the
Conservatives will be looking for another leader.
It is on this political landscape - a strong Labour party and a Tory
government that is patently battered but cannot yet be declared beaten -
that Mr Paddy Ashdown has been attempting to reposition the Liberal
Democrats.
His fear is the obvious one: that the two-party squeeze will leave the
Liberal Democrats as the 15-per-cent party. That need not be disastrous.
Stronger regional bases should mean it can use its votes more efficiently.
Party strategists plan to concentrate all its resources in perhaps 70 or 80
marginal seats at Westminster. The third party historically has prospered
from an anti-Conservative swing.
But to win the votes they need in Tory-held seats the Liberal Democrats need
to be credible and coherent. Mr Ashdown has probably overreacted to the
votes in Brighton this week to decriminalise cannabis and to back a minimum
wage. He is right to be deeply concerned about the party's failure to
present an intelligible economic strategy. His colleagues are dismayed at
the way Mr Malcolm Bruce mishandled his debut as Treasury spokesman. More
seriously, many in the party have not grasped the basic implication of the
new landscape. Mr Robert Maclennan's attack on Mr Blair won the newly
elected president easy applause in the conference hall. It revealed also a
preference in the party for comfortable expedience over hard-edged strategy.
Mr Ashdown knows his party can break into real politics only if it reaches
some form of accommodation with Mr Blair. He would prefer such an
arrangement before the election. He wants anyway to prepare enough ground to
ensure that a post-election deal is possible. Senior party figures have been
encouraged by the way Mr Blair has kept open informal channels of contact.
Mr Ashdown had hoped this week to respond in kind - sending a coded but
strong signal that if there is a bargain to be struck he is ready to talk.
But the message from Brighton is that his party is not ready yet to face
political realities.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Tax rise for high earners wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday approved the broad thrust of the
leadership's tax and benefit plans despite considerable uncertainty about
details of their fiscal proposals.
In the party's principal debate on economic policy, delegates approved plans
to increase the tax burden on high earners while increasing the amounts of a
number of social security payments including child benefit and income
support.
Senior Liberal Democrats were relieved that the conference had rejected the
introduction of a partial citizens' income. This would give all UK citizens
a tax credit, but would add another 10 per cent to the basic rate of tax.
However, the conference approved other measures that would lead to a drastic
increase in the tax burden on middle-income earners, despite the concerns of
some MPs.
The party approved proposals to integrate national insurance into the income
tax system. This would probably add 10 per cent to the tax burden for anyone
earning more than Pounds 25,000 a year.
Delegates also endorsed proposals to tax those earning more than Pounds
100,000 a year at a maximum of 60 per cent. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's
Treasury spokesman, again insisted he would press for a 50 per cent rate at
the party's federal policy committee.
In a radical redistribution of benefits, the party approved proposals to
abolish mortgage interest relief and the married couple's allowance.
In turn, the party would retain and increase universal child benefit. It
would also restore the full entitlement to income support for those between
the ages of 16 and 25.
Mr Bruce insisted yesterday that the full costings of all these proposals
would be worked out by the party's executive bodies in the run-up to the
next election.
He said the party leadership's hands had not been tied by the decisions.
'The new policy is detailed in its proposals, but the actual rates are not
determined.'
However, one MP admitted that he would have preferred to see the proposals
sent back to the federal policy committee, fearing that they will give the
Liberal Democrats the image of a 'high-tax party'.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Ashdown edges closer to Labour: Lib Dem leader sets PR as
price of any deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown will today seek to nudge the Liberal Democrats further in
the direction of co-operation with Mr Tony Blair's Labour party by
suggesting that the two parties could build a bipartisan consensus on issues
such as the future of the National Health Service.
But, in an attempt to narrow Liberal Democrat divisions over his push for an
accommodation with Labour, he will use his closing speech to the party
conference to set the price for any formal deal between the two parties as a
Labour commitment to proportional representation.
His speech, previewed yesterday by senior aides, will attempt to walk a
tightrope - holding the door of co-operation open to Mr Blair while
reassuring his own party that the Liberal Democrats will not be 'rolled
over' in any discussions.
Mr Blair's reaction to the idea of cross-party collaboration on the health
service will be seen as a test of his commitment to what Mr Ashdown refers
to as a new style of pluralist politics.
The speech will follow indications yesterday from senior party figures that
the Liberal Democrats plan to counter the electoral threat from Labour by
focusing all their resources at the next general election on 70 or 80 seats
 -most of them Tory held - where they have a chance of winning.
But Mr Ashdown's attempts during a difficult and unpredictable Brighton
conference to hold open the door to Mr Blair were clouded when the new
Liberal Democrat party president launched a strong attack on the new Labour
leader.
Mr Robert Maclennan accused Mr Blair of reducing Labour to 'a sort of
smiling anaemia'. Mr Maclennan subsequently told journalists that he was
determined there should be no 'behind-the-scenes bargaining with Labour'.
Mr Ashdown, who is expected to chide the party conference gently for its
defiance of the party leadership in two conference votes, plans to use his
speech to set a series of 'benchmarks' against which the Liberal Democrats
can judge the prospects for a closer relationship with Labour.
But with the substantial anti-Labour group within his party threatening open
revolt against any formal alliance, Mr Ashdown will stress that support for
proportional representation would be the price he would demand for
supporting a future Labour government.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Top civil servants attacked: Maclennan makes stormy debut as
president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Maclennan, president of the Liberal Democrats, was challenged last
night to name the senior civil servants he accused of lying to parliament.
In his first speech as party president, Mr Maclennan said civil servants had
lied to protect their political masters, abandoning their traditional
political neutrality.
Drawing on his experience as a member of the Commons public accounts
committee, Mr Maclennan said: 'I have seen it in response to direct
questioning - that long, nervous, intake of breath, followed by the telling
of a flat fib. I use the word 'fib' only because this is a family
conference.'
Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the FDA top civil servants' union,
challenged Mr Maclennan to 'put up or retract' his allegations. 'Mr
Maclennan's attack is unprecedented. He knows civil servants are unable to
answer back. He must now stand up this charge,' she said.
Mr Maclennan, a former Labour junior minister, said civil servants
occasionally told untruths 'for their political masters for all the world as
if they were members of the same political party'. As a result Britain had
regressed from standards of public service established for 140 years.
The next party in government would be 'entering Tombstone like Wyatt Earp.
It would have to go in with all guns blazing and hit every target first
time, every time.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / Fares discussion change rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A railway passengers' watchdog yesterday threw out a British Rail proposal
that up to 72 hours should be allowed for 'consultation' over fare changes.
The Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee rejected the BR plan at its
quarterly meeting on the grounds that 72 hours was not long enough for
genuine consultation. Its stand won the backing of the Office of the Rail
Regulator.
The committee, which brings together regional passenger committees, was
considering a draft proposal from BR on fares consultation.
Last year's legislation privatising BR gave the committee the right to be
consulted over fare changes.
Yesterday's move could force the train operating companies which take over
services from BR to involve local passenger committees at an earlier stage.
At present BR announces one set of fare changes a year, but monitoring fares
will become more complicated as the 25 train operators announce their own
tariffs.
Major-General Lennox Napier, committee chairman, said 72 hours 'amounts to
information, not consultation'.
Mr John Nelson, managing director of BR's south-eastern train operating
companies, said any proposal for a longer consultation period would have to
take into account the impact on the train operators' ability to manage their
businesses.
Maj-Gen Napier said the committee and BR needed to go 'back to the drawing
board' to look at the Railways Act in detail to produce a new proposal for
fares consultation.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Stakes raised in milk dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milk Marketing Board said yesterday it would call on the government to
postpone the November deregulation of the milk market if the dairy trade won
leave for a judicial review of the new arrangements.
Its threat raised the stakes on the eve of today's High Court hearing of the
Dairy Trade Federation's case.
The federation is challenging the government's approval of deregulation on
the grounds that the new system for selling milk to dairy companies will
push costs up sharply and lead to a flood of imports.
The board, due to be replaced on November 1 by Milk Marque, a dairy farmers'
co-operative, accused the dairy trade of causing 'maximum uncertainty' by
taking action so close to the planned liberalisation of the Pounds 3.3bn
market.
In the latest round of open hostility between the two sides of the industry,
the board said it would have to ask Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture
minister, to postpone introduction of the free market 'in order to protect
producers against the potential consequences of the DTF's disruptive
tactics'.
The federation's case was totally unjustified, the board said.
The dairy federation said the trade had delayed legal action until it was
clear how Milk Marque's selling procedures would affect prices. Mr
Waldegrave's refusal to refer the arrangements to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission had left judicial review as 'the only option open to us', it
said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Public school heads demand A-level reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The A-level exams taken by pupils aged 17 and 18 in England and Wales must
be reformed and the divide between academic and vocational qualifications
abandoned, independent school headteachers recommended yesterday.
Their proposal follows calls for a radical reform of sixth form studies from
organisations including the Labour party, the Confederation of British
Industry and the Industrial Society.
However, the government refers to A-levels as an 'academic gold standard',
and reform was ruled out last year by Mr John Patten, then education
secretary.
The Headmasters' Conference, which represents the heads of the most
prestigious independent mixed and boys' schools, meeting in Bournemouth,
said: 'We believe the terms academic and vocational as they are currently
used are misleading and damaging.'
A working party of headteachers, including representatives of several
schools which regularly reach the top of government national rankings of
A-level results, described the exams as 'educationally wasteful'.
It said 30 per cent of 18-year-olds were now attempting academic A-levels,
although they were designed to be taken by a significantly narrower
proportion of the age group. More than a quarter of those attempting them
abandoned them or failed.
Instead, the heads recommended there should be a 'structured progression'
from a broad national curriculum to 'something more differentiated', which
took account of differing aptitudes.
This system would give equal esteem to vocational courses by subsuming all
current qualifications under a general 'advanced certificate of secondary
education'.
One central authority would oversee the qualifications. Responsibility is
split at the moment between the education and employment departments.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Howard warns of fire pay reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is considering introducing
performance-related pay into the fire service for those at assistant
divisional officer level.
In a move that seems likely to provoke widespread resistance, Mr Howard also
said he was looking at fixed-term appointments and considering whether these
might be introduced for chief fire officers.
Speaking yesterday to the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers
Association conference, Mr Howard went on to say that he was concerned about
the growing cost of the firefighters' pension scheme.
He added that a review team would identify ways in which the benefits and
costs could be made more comparable to other public service schemes but gave
an assurance that existing pensioners would not be affected by any changes.
The home secretary's suggestions of change in pay determination is bound to
arouse widespread anxiety across the entire fire service.
Last year the Fire Brigades Union carried out a successful campaign in
defence of their national wage agreement. The agreement is based on a
17-year-old wage formula that links pay to the upper quartile of male manual
earnings.
Although most fire fighters would not be covered by what Mr Howard is
planning, union officials fear that any performance-related pay system and
fixed-term contracts would eventually have to be extended to their members.
The union has some members at assistant divisional officer level.
The home secretary told yesterday's conference that performance-related pay
could 'encourage greater efficiency in the public as well as the private
sector of the economy'. He added: 'It is an important element in the
results-oriented culture that is being developed in all our public
services.'
The planned shake-up of pay and working conditions in the fire service
follows the row that Mr Howard started when he suggested that police
officers should be covered by performance-related pay and fixed-term
contracts. Eventually the government backed down in the face of strong
opposition from the police force over the proposals, which were contained in
Sir Patrick Sheehy's report on police pay.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Unified accounts council proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the six leading bodies for accountants will today propose the
creation of a new supervisory and controlling council to govern the
profession.
Mr John Moore, president of the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, said: 'The General Accounting Council will provide a single,
prestigious and authoritative organisation to deal with those areas where
the profession has shared a responsibility to the public, and common
professional interests.'
The move follows a series of consultation meetings with chartered
association members to consider a merger plan put forward by the working
party of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies.
Only 19 per cent backed the CCAB scheme to create three institutes in
England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
Mr Moore said the chartered association plan would preserve the existing
bodies, but provide a new institution at the highest level to defend public
interest including that of the consumer.
Clark Whitehill, the 12th- largest accountancy firm in the UK, has announced
that it is to join the Horwath International network of accounting and
management consulting firms.
Clark Whitehill's move depends on Stoy Hayward moving from Horwath to BDO
Binder, the network currently represented in the UK by Binder Hamlyn. Binder
Hamlyn is expected to merge with Arthur Andersen.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Accountants scorn takeover standard: Principles 'destroyed',
says Hundred Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board was accused yesterday of 'destroying' one of
the basic principles of accounting after it issued two new standards
covering acquisitions and mergers.
The ASB, which decides how financial information is presented in the UK,
said the new rules 'call for a more objective, neutral and informative
approach' in accounting for business combinations.
The board said the new codes were designed to restrict the use of merger
accounting and outlaw abuses in the reporting of acquisitions which became
notorious during the climate of creative accounting in the late 1980s.
But the Hundred Group, which consists of the finance directors of companies
in the FT-SE 100 share index, described parts of the new standard on
acquisitions as 'completely illogical'.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer with Reed Elsevier and chairman
of the Hundred Group, said the standard 'destroys one of the basic
principles of accounting under which capital and revenue costs are kept
separate'.
The group calls for abuses to be dealt with by tightening existing
accounting standards and 'proper policing' by auditors 'not by distorting
basic accounting concepts'.
The dispute between the Hundred Group and the ASB marks the first open
disagreement between the standard-setters and industry since the board was
set up in 1990. In addition, the standard on acquisitions was passed by a
majority on the ASB of 7-1, marking only the second dissenting vote in its
history.
Mr Donald Main, a director of Forte, dissented from the majority view. He
said he agreed with many aspects of FRS 7 but hoped it would be reviewed
after a full debate on the general principles of accounting.
Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said: 'The new standards favour
neither one side nor the other . . . and I believe that they will restore
much needed credibility in the reporting of acquisitions.'
Sir David said most professional accountancy bodies, auditors and financial
institutions had backed the standard. Reaction from companies had been 3-1
against.
The ASB's new standards, known as FRS (financial reporting standard) 6 and
7, are designed to stop the improper use of merger accounting to enhance
earnings and to curb the abuse of pre-acquisition provisions.
FRS 7 is designed to limit the costs that a company can meet through setting
up a reserve on its balance sheet when it buys another company.
In the past such devices have been used to stop costs appearing on the
profit-and-loss account and so boost headline profits. The new standards
will start next year and would normally not be reviewed for two to three
years.

The Milk Marketing Board said yesterday it would call on the government to
postpone the November deregulation of the milk market if the dairy trade won

Its threat raised the stakes in the row over milk on the eve of today's High
Court hearing of the Dairy Trade Federation's case.
The federation is challenging the government's approval of deregulation on
the grounds that the new system for selling milk to dairy companies will

The board, due to be replaced on November 1 by Milk Marque, a dairy farmers'

taking legal action so close to the planned liberalisation of the Pounds
3.3bn market. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, warned: 'If the court gives
the Dairy Trade Federation leave to continue judicial review proceedings, it
would not be responsible of us to allow the new arrangements to start while
there was any conceivable doubt about their validity.'
In the latest round of open hostility between the two sides of the industry,
Mr Dare said he would have to ask Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture
minister, to postpone introduction of the free market 'in order to protect
producers against the potential consequences of the DTF's disruptive
tactics'.
The federation's case was totally unjustified, Mr Dare said. 'The scheme of
reorganisation was submitted after years of planning and extensive
discussions with the authorities and only approved after very detailed
consultation with affected parties.'
Mr John Price, director-general of the dairy federation, said the trade had
delayed legal action until it was clear how Milk Marque's selling procedures
would affect prices. Mr Waldegrave's refusal to refer the arrangements to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had left judicial review as 'the only
option open to us,' he said.
He argued that there was no need to postpone deregulation. 'We're not
complaining about the whole scheme, only the selling system, and changes to
that could be made retrospectively.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / Jews win right to 'eruv' in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North London Jews will soon be able to visit friends on a sabbath and will
not have to leave their homes unlocked.
The first London 'eruv' - an area within which aspects of Jewish law are
relaxed - is to be established in Barnet in north London.
This follows a decision by the Department of the Environment to overturn
Barnet Borough Council's refusal to allow the eruv on planning grounds. The
council felt the poles and wires used for boundaries would be an eyesore in
the area, which embraces Hampstead Garden Suburb. However, a department
inspector, Mr David Rushby, decided after a public hearing last year that
the proposals would not seriously harm the character and appearance of the
area.
Jewish sabbath laws forbid carrying anything out of doors, even keys carried
in pockets. Pushing prams or wheelchairs is also prohibited.
Strict adherence to the law can be severely limiting for disabled people and
families with small children, who cannot attend synagogue services or visit
relatives on what is traditionally a family day. The law is waived within an
eruv.
Many Jewish communities around the world already have eruvs, but this the
first substantial one the United Synagogue Eruv Committee has managed to
establish in Britain.
The London eruv covers 11 square miles in the Golders Green and Hendon
areas. Barnet Borough Council will not appeal against the decision.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Overall accounts watchdog proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the six leading bodies for accountants will today propose the
creation of a new supervisory and controlling council for the profession.
Mr John Moore, president of the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, said: 'The General Accounting Council will provide a single,
prestigious and authoritative organisation to deal with those areas where
the profession has shared a responsibility to the public, and common
professional interests.'
The move follows a series of consultation meetings with chartered
association members in the current talks on the future structure of the
profession. Only 19 per cent backed a merger plan put forward by the working
party of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the existing
supervisory body for the profession. That proposal was to create three
institutes splitting the UK into three geographical areas.
Mr Moore said the consultation programme showed that the committee plan had
'too many drawbacks to be taken any further'.
Problems identified by the chartered association included the need to find a
common 'designation' for all accountants, how to serve the needs of students
overseas, and how to represent effectively the 200,000 accountants affected
in England and Wales.
The chartered association said that the proposal would protect its own core
values of open access and flexible entry.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Portillo attacked for opposing paternity leave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday attacked Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, for
opposing European proposals to introduce unpaid paternity leave.
Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, warned that British fathers could
be left as the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with
their newborn children.
At a meeting with European ministers in Brussels today Mr Portillo will
oppose a plan to allow either parent three months off work without pay after
the birth or adoption of a child. His opposition could necessitate the use
of the UK veto.
Paternity leave was blocked by the UK in 1985, but it has now been taken up
by the Germans, holders of the European presidency.
Ms Clwyd condemned the government's opposition as 'a slap in the face for
British fathers and families'. She said: 'How can the Tory party call itself
the party of the family when Michael Portillo wants fathers in the UK to be
the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with their newborn
children?'
The employment department said: 'The government believes that the UK's
rights on maternity leave are good already and this directive is an
unnecessary intervention in matters between employers and employees.'
If the matter is pushed to a vote, Britain may be forced to use its veto to
block the directive.
The other 11 member states would then have to proceed under the Maastricht
social protocol, from which Britain has opted out.
Today's meeting will also consider plans to force ex-patriate workers on
short-term contracts to accept local pay and conditions while abroad.
Mr Portillo will insist the idea, proposed by Germany, is protectionist and
unfair, shielding employers in high-cost member states from competition from
abroad.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Chemicals and metals lead export growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports of processed chemicals, metals and some engineering goods to
non-European Union countries have been rising steadily in recent months,
contributing to an overall reduction in the UK trade deficit.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the UK trade deficit with
countries outside the European Union fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds
0.3bn last month, as the underlying trend in imports remained relatively
flat and exports continued to rise.
The value of exports to non-EU countries rose by 1 per cent while the volume
of exports rose by 2.6 per cent on the month - a trend that indicates
exporters are cutting their prices after raising them earlier this year.
Import values, by contrast, fell 1 per cent last month compared with July,
with a corresponding 1.1 per cent fall in volumes.
The export growth was spread across all categories, the CSO said, suggesting
that most business sectors in the UK were benefiting from the
faster-than-expected growth in the world economy. However, the fastest
growth excluding the energy sector occured in the semi-manufactures category
 -which includes the processed chemical, paper, rubber and metals sectors -
where export values rose by 9 per cent in the three months to August
compared with the previous three months, and volumes grew by 8 per cent.
Most of this growth, the CSO said, came from chemicals and metals producers.
Exports of organic chemicals, for example, were 14 per cent higher in the
three months to August compared with the previous three months, while
exports of non-ferrous metals, excluding silver, grew by 48 per cent.
The paper and textiles sector also showed steady export growth, while
plastics grew by 11 per cent in this period.
Exports in the basic materials category - which includes wood, metal ores
and other crude materials - grew by 7.5 per cent in the three months to
August compared with the previous three months.
Meanwhile exports of finished manufacturing products were 2.5 per cent
higher in the three months to August compared with the previous three
months, and 12 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Certain
engineering sectors such as electronic goods and plant showed particularly
fast growth, boosted by a broader pick-up in demand in the US and by growing
demand for plant and machinery in eastern Europe and in Far Eastern
countries including Thailand and Indonesia.
Exports of mechanical engineering capital goods grew by 5.5 per cent in the
three months to August compared with the previous three months, while
exports of intermediate electrical engineering goods grew by 9.5 per cent.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Reform of capital gains tax urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Venture Capital Association has called for a fundamental change
in capital gains tax, which it says is higher than in any leading competitor
country and discourages investment in growth businesses.
In a submission to the chancellor for the November Budget the association
calls for gains on assets to be taxed at a rate that would fall the longer
assets were held.
The top marginal tax rate for assets sold within three years of acquisition
would be 40 per cent and the rate would decline to 20 per cent if the assets
were held for more than six years.
Autif, the unit trust industry's trade association, says in its Budget
submission that it wants the overall annual limit on how much an individual
can invest in Personal Equity Plans to be kept at Pounds 9,000.

FT  22 SEP 94 / George shied away from July rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, nearly recommended a base
rate rise in late July, according to the minutes of his monetary meeting
that month with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, which were released
yesterday.
The minutes relate to the meeting of July 28 when Mr George and Mr Clarke
decided to leave base rates unchanged. Base rates were increased from 5.25
per cent to 5.75 per cent after their next meeting on September 7.
In July, after reviewing a number of inflationary indicators such as
Confederation of British Industry surveys and input prices, Mr George said:
'It was possible to make a case that, to be on the safe side, there should
be a modest move to tighten policy now.'
He added, however, that 'there was not much danger of either the economy or
the emerging cost pressures running away at present'.
He also said there was 'a danger that a small move now would confuse rather
than reassure, and provoke an exaggeratedly nervous market reaction'.
The governor argued that 'the earlier a move was made the smaller the
adjustment would need to be. But in the current circumstances, it was
preferable for any move upwards to be to a level which would be a plausible
stopping point for a reasonable period.'
Some analysts yesterday interpreted this statement as indicating there would
not be a further increase in base rates for some time. But Mr Adrian Cooper,
UK economist at James Capel, said it was not inconsistent with a further
rise this year. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets,
cautioned against putting too much reliance on the governor's statement
since the view of the authorities had obviously been affected by data
published after the July meeting.
The minutes also show that, as late as the end of July, the chancellor was
fairly sceptical about the need for a rise in base rates. Mr Clarke said it
was important that 'any change in policy should be based on a balanced
assessment of all the evidence. There was a danger of trying to set a game
plan too far in advance and not looking at the actual evidence as it
unfolded.
'The latest data - particularly M4 and earnings - suggested a rise was not
required immediately,' he continued. 'Furthermore, the forecasts suggested
inflation might be even lower in the next few months.'
Nevertheless, Mr Clarke said: 'It remained true that, sooner or later,
interest rates might need to be raised.'
The minutes also indicate that the pace of economic growth may have been the
main reason why base rates were raised this month. In general discussion, it
was argued that 'as well as the absolute size of the output gap (the
difference between actual and potential output), it was possible that the
speed at which the output gap closed was an important determinant of
inflationary pressures'.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Ruling on Fayeds gives comfort to investigators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In rejecting the Fayed brothers' contention that the Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors' report into the 1985 takeover of House of Fraser
violated their human rights, the Strasbourg Human Rights Court has provided
a much needed crumb of comfort to the UK's system of company investigations.
Earlier this week, the European Commission of Human Rights cast a shadow
over company investigations by ruling that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
Guinness chairman jailed for theft and false accounting after the company's
1986 takeover of Distillers, was denied a fair trial.
The commission said the use at his 1989 trial of answers given by Mr
Saunders under compulsion to DTI inspectors breached the European Convention
on Human Rights. If the full European Court of Human Rights eventually
upholds the commission's findings, the UK government may be forced to
rethink DTI investigations.
But yesterday the Strasbourg judges gave the company investigation procedure
a clean bill of health.
The Fayed brothers told the court in March there was no doubt that the
central conclusion of the DTI inspectors' report was that they were guilty
of dishonest misrepresentation.
The inspectors said the three brothers had misrepresented their origins,
wealth, business interests and resources to the trade and industry
secretary, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of Fraser board
and shareholders and their own advisers prior to the takeover; and that
during the investigation they had knowingly submitted false evidence to the
inspectors. The Fayeds had always disputed these conclusions.
They said that in the eyes of the world, the report, which had been
published by the government, had the force of a judgment delivered after a
lengthy trial at which they had been convicted - except there had been no
trial and criminal charges had never been brought. The government had even
decided not to seek to have them disqualified as company directors.
They told the court that their right to a good reputation had been
drastically interfered with. The procedures governing DTI company
investigations afforded no safeguards for the rights of those under
investigation and they had no effective remedy against publication of a
condemnatory report and the damage it caused.
In short, they submitted, the denial of effective access to a domestic court
to defend their right to honour and reputation, and the denial of effective
domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors' findings, amounted to a
breach of the convention.
The judges rejected the government's preliminary objection that the Fayeds
had failed to exhaust their domestic remedies. But they unanimously decided
there had been no violation of the Fayeds' human rights. The court said it
was satisfied the functions performed by the inspectors were essentially
investigative. The inspectors did not adjudicate. It could not therefore be
said the inspectors' inquiry had 'determined' the Fayeds' right to a good
reputation or had a decisive bearing on that right.
The right of access to a court to protect a civil right, guaranteed by the
convention, was not absolute, the judges said. It was subject to implied
limitations, which national authorities had a certain 'margin of
appreciation' in imposing, provided those limitations did not impair the
essence of the right, pursued a legitimate aim and were proportionate to the
achievement of that aim.
The judges said the underlying aim of the Companies Act investigation system
was the furtherance of the public interest in ensuring the proper conduct of
the affairs of public companies. The freedom of reporting enjoyed by DTI
inspectors as a result of being protected by privilege was also in the
public interest.
While the freedom to report was broad there were considerable safeguards
built into the procedure to ensure it was fair and that its findings were
reliable. Had it not been both fair and reliable the Fayeds would have had
the remedy of bringing a judicial review against the secretary of state or
the inspectors. But it was clear the Fayeds were informed of the information
required from them and were given every opportunity to respond to the
allegations against them and provide evidence.
The limits of acceptable criticism were wider for businessmen actively
involved in the affairs of large public companies than for private
individuals. The risk of some damage to reputation which could not be
compensated was inevitable if independent investigations were to have the
necessary freedom to report without fear, not only to the authorities but
also, in the final resort, to the public.

A Pounds 40m boost for the Northern Ireland peace process was announced
yesterday by the European Commission in a direct response to the IRA
ceasefire.
The money will go to the International Fund for Ireland over the next three
years and is one-third more than had been planned.
The commission said: 'This should be seen as a first, practical response
towards helping the peace process.' Officials have already started
consultations with the London and Dublin governments on how to tailor the
aid in the wake of the latest peace moves.
Northern Ireland in particular has qualified for huge payments from
Brussels. It is one of the poorest regions of the EU and has one of the
highest unemployment rates. Spending of about Pounds 1bn is already
earmarked for Northern Ireland over the next six years.

FT  22 SEP 94 / DTI outlines view of Archer material
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has opened up the
possibility of publishing the information disclosed to the inspectors in the
DTI report on Lord Archer's share orders in Anglia Television.
He said there was 'no legal barrier' to publishing the facts surrounding the
case given the consent of all those concerned.
Mr Alistair Darling, opposition City and financial services spokesman, said
all the information provided to the DTI inspectors about the affair should
now be made public.
But Mr Heseltine stressed that publication of the facts supplied to the
inspectors, without their judgment and assessment of these facts, would lead
to further media speculation as to why Lord Archer had bought the shares. He
added that he did not think that was a responsible exercise of his
functions.
In a letter to Mr Darling, Mr Heseltine wrote: 'Facts ascertained by
inspectors are inevitably the product of information provided by a variety
of witnesses, and of the inspectors' analysis, and judgment, on that
information.
'I recognise, however, that there would be no legal barrier, given the
consent of all concerned, to my publishing all the information provided to
the inspectors.'
After the DTI report Mr Heseltine decided that no action should be taken
against Lord Archer. His wife, Lady Archer, is a director of Anglia
Television.
Mr Darling said that now Lord Archer was back in the country there was
nothing to stop him making a full and frank statement.
He added: 'This matter is not going to go away. If there is no satisfactory
explanation I will raise the matter on the floor of the Commons when it
returns in October.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / IOD urges strike legislation in essential services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation to prevent strikes in essential services, rather than simply to
limit their duration, has been urged on Mr Michael Portillo, the employment
secretary, by the Institute of Directors, Lisa Wood writes.
Recently the Confederation of British Industry, which is composed generally
of larger companies, suggested that the unions should have to hold
'refresher ballots' of members during long disputes.
However, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director of the IoD, effectively rejected the
CBI's approach in a letter to Mr Portillo. 'In our view this would be
closing the stable door after the horse had bolted,' he said, adding: 'We
believe the situation requires more substantial measures.' He recommended
no-strike deals and binding arbitration as part of the rail sell-off
process.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Civil service union forced to cut spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The NUCPS civil service union is planning a 10 per cent cut in spending for
the rest of the year with similar cuts next year as it seeks to break even
by next autumn.
The cuts are required after the union failed to sign up all its members in
its check-off campaign - under new legislation, unions had to ensure this
year that members paying subscriptions by direct deductions from wages
renewed their authority for the deductions.
Union officials say that about 93 per cent of their 108,000 members have
signed up for check-off - more are expected to sign, but there will be a
shortfall.
The plan for cuts is expected to be approved by the union's executive today.
The union's latest financial report says: 'It is anticipated over the final
quarter our average monthly income will be nearly Pounds 112,000 less per
month than in the first eight months. The combined effect of developments
during the year is that nearly Pounds 400,000 still has to be saved from our
1994 expenditure in order to break even.' Membership income for next year is
estimated at just over Pounds 10m.
Mr Hugh Lanning, the union's assistant general secretary, said: 'The union
has overspent for the past five years and has used up all of its reserves.'
It had Pounds 4.4m in liquid reserves in 1988 but last year it was working
within a Pounds 101,303 overdraft.
Proposed budgets for next year are designed to eliminate the union's
overdraft with Unity Trust Bank, the trade union bank, by October next year
when the union hopes to merge with the financially strong Inland Revenue
Staff Federation.
The union's financial report - drawn up by Mr Lanning - says the union has
made progress in restoring its financial position but cannot contain its
expenditure within current income levels.
The union had a negative cashflow of Pounds 503,109 at the end of last year
and it projects a Pounds 210,465 positive cashflow in December if the agreed
cuts are implemented. Without them it will have a Pounds 348,535 negative
cashflow by the end of this year.
The report predicts a sharp fall in membership income receipts this month to
Pounds 550,000 from Pounds 905,000 in August, pushing the union's bank
balance into deficit.
The report says the union has 'managed not only to operate within the limits
set by Unity Trust Bank but also to reduce the overdraft significantly'. But
it warns: 'The last quarter of the year will be when cashflow will be most
affected by reduced membership.'
However the union will still require further bank help next year. 'The bank
are currently considering options for funding a redundancy package and
rescheduling outstanding mortgage payments,' the report says. 'It is not
envisaged any revised arrangements will be necessary this year.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / Autif calls for PEP investment limit to be held at Pounds
9,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unit trust industry wants the existing overall annual limit on how much
an individual can invest in Personal Equity Plans to be kept at Pounds
9,000, Alison Smith writes.
Autif, its trade association, made the call in its Budget submission to the
Treasury. Mr Philip Warland, Autif director-general, said the limit  -
Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep - did
not need raising but within it a saver should be able to put Pounds 3,000
into gilts and corporate bonds.
The tax treatment of Peps has come under attack from the Association of
British Insurers and the Building Societies Association. Both have called
for consistent tax treatment between different types of savings and have
suggested lower Pep limits.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Jordan set to quit as AEEU president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Jordan is likely to stand down as president of the AEEU engineering
union to take over as general secretary of the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions, the biggest international union organisation with 174
affiliates in 124 countries.
Mr Jordan, 58, is not certain to get the job, but with backing from the US,
Germany and Japan, he is the favourite.
His main rival will be Mr Luis Anderson from Panama, head of the
confederation's Latin American region, who will have substantial backing in
the developing world.
If Mr Jordan does move to Brussels to run the confederation the way could be
open for Mr Jimmy Airlie, a former leader of the left in the engineering
section of the union, to take over as president.
However, there will also be strong pressure not to replace Mr Jordan. Since
the engineering and electricians' unions merged to form the AEEU it has had
an executive of more than 20 people plus two presidents and two general
secretaries.
For financial and political reasons the dominant group on the AEEU executive
may prefer to allow Mr Ken Jackson, current president of the electricians'
section, to become president of the whole union.
Mr Jordan, a powerful spokesman for rightwing craft trade unionism and a
lobbyist for the manufacturing industry, is regarded as one of the most able
of the older generation of British trade union leaders. He said yesterday
that taking over the confederation after the collapse of communism would be
a 'massive challenge'.
The current general secretary of the confederation, Mr Enzo Friso, from
Italy, is likely to stand down at the end of the year.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Venture capitalists urge capital gains tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Venture Capital Association has called for a fundamental change
in capital gains tax, which it says is higher than in any leading competitor
country and discourages investment in growth businesses.
In a submission to the chancellor ahead of the November Budget the
association calls for 'tapering relief'.
The proposals call for gains on assets to be taxed at a rate that would fall
the longer assets were held. The top marginal tax rate for assets sold
within three years of acquisition would be 40 per cent and the rate would
decline to 20 per cent if the assets were held for more than six years.
The association says that if this relief were applied retrospectively it
would not increase the government's revenues as investors began to realise
capital gains. It would also encourage investment and make the distribution
of company profits as income relatively less attractive, the association
says.
Mr Gilbert Chalk, chairman of the association's taxation committee, said:
'It would encourage capital formation and accumulation. It would also
encourage people to come out of salaried employment and go into growth
situations.'
The association has also suggested that UK pension funds should be
encouraged to invest more in unquoted investments.
It adds that US pension funds invest more in UK venture capital than UK
pension funds. The British Chambers of Commerce in its Budget submission
yesterday called on the government to cut public spending rather than raise
taxes to reduce the public sector deficit.
It said: 'Any increase in the burden of taxation on individuals and
businesses will further inhibit enterprise and distort decision-making, and
should be strenuously avoided.'

FT  22 SEP 94 / Industrial injuries scheme under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some claimants to the industrial injuries scheme administered by the
Department of Social Security's Benefits Agency may be wrongly turned down,
a report from the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. .
The committee found that more than half of all appeals made on medical
grounds were decided in favour of the claimant, compared with one in three
of most other social security appeals. 'This higher proportion of successful
claims gives cause for concern that other claimants may not be getting their
due entitlement to industrial injuries benefit,' it said.
Employee sickness absence has fallen over three years in more than 60 per
cent of 75 organisations surveyed, says a report by Industrial Relations
Services, the independent research body.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Water company appeals to MMC on price caps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South West Water yesterday became the first privatised utility to appeal to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the 10-year price limits set by
the industry regulator in July.
The MMC's decision will affect only South West Water. This contrasts with
British Gas's appeal in 1992 over proposed rates of return on its pipeline
and storage business, as opposed to price caps. The company requested an
industry-wide review of the gas market.
South West last night wrote to Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office
of Water Services, asking him to refer his findings on price increases and
connection charges in two separate appeals. The process, which will begin
next month, is expected to take up to six months.
South West is believed to have prepared a detailed submission for the MMC,
arguing it has been singled out from the other nine UK water and sewerage
companies for particularly harsh treatment.
The regulator is widely thought to have taken a tougher approach with South
West, as it has had the highest charges and price increases since
privatisation in 1989.
A crucial element of South West's position is believed to be that three
years ago Ofwat promised the company price increases after 1995 similar to
its current 11.5 percentage points above inflation. This was necessary,
South West argues, to fund increased investment obligations agreed with
Ofwat.
In the event, Mr Byatt has said South West may raise prices by 1.5
percentage points above inflation next year - a ratio known as the K factor.
This falls sharply to an average K of 0.5 over 10 years.
It is estimated that each point increase in K adds roughly Pounds 2m to
South West's revenues. The company is likely to argue it must have a K of
between 3 and 5 to meet its obligations.
The price review has also reduced South West's charges for connecting
customers to water and sewerage networks from Pounds 1,189 to Pounds 400.
This could hit South West's revenues by up to Pounds 5m a year.
Mr Byatt has also allowed only about half the Pounds 1bn investment
requested by South West for the next 10 years. South West will press the
argument that it has been singled out by claiming that, unlike other
companies, Mr Byatt has not allowed a budget for issues such as foul
flooding and river discharges.
South West will also argue that Ofwat has not taken account of the unique
demands on its services which lead to higher costs. The company's network
must serve 1.5m residents and the 6m tourists who visit the region every
year.
The company is also likely to ask why Mr Byatt ranks it as average or below
on efficiency when an independent study that he commissioned shows the
utility performing on average or above.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Sun rises higher over Silicon Glen: James Buxton assesses
the rewards for the UK economy from NEC's Pounds 530m outlay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by NEC to locate its next-generation semiconductor plant in
Scotland was rightly described yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, as a 'tremendous vote of confidence by NEC, not only in its
existing Livingston facility but in Scotland and the UK.'
Even those in the Scottish electronics industry who believe inward
investment sometimes receives too much uncritical publicity and does little
to foster an indigenous electronics industry capable of spontaneous growth
were impressed.
'This is an extremely good investment for Scotland,' one figure in the
Scottish electronics industry said. 'These semiconductor plants have to
invest to survive.
'If NEC didn't invest here the Livingston plant would eventually run down.
Meanwhile the Japanese would have built their new plant somewhere else.'
Even so, the scale of the investment needs to be kept in proportion. Of the
Pounds 530m total cost of the investment - Japan's largest in Scotland -
three-quarters will be spent on equipment to manufacture the memory chips,
and almost all of this will come from Japan. That part which is actually
spent in the UK will go mainly on the construction of the high-specification
buildings on the 100-acre site.
The impact of the investment on local manufacturing may be less great than
that of electronics assembly plants which involve smaller capital outlays.
Semiconductor plants have only one principal input, crystalline silicon,
which NEC at Livingston obtains mostly from its fellow Japanese company
Shin-Etsu, which also has a plant in Livingston.
Unlike, for example, the assembly of personal computers, the making of
semiconductors does not involve collating inputs from a wide range of
suppliers, many of which could in theory be local. Thus the 'upstream
linkages' from a chip plant to the local economy are limited, and probably
involve mainly suppliers of gases, chemicals, clean-room services and
garments.
The new NEC plant will make an important contribution to the Scottish
economy by employing 430 staff in addition to the 900 it already employs.
'These are high-quality jobs,' said Mr Peter Timms, managing director of
Flexible Technology, a printed circuit board assembler.
NEC says the high productivity of its Scottish workforce was an important
factor in its decision to locate its new plant at Livingston. Earlier this
year an official at NEC said the Livingston workforce had produced better
yield figures than NEC's plants in Japan. 'The performance of the local
labour force has surprised us; they have won international inter-company
awards and training awards,' he said.
The Japanese company's investment not only confirms Scotland as a prime
location for multinational electronics manufacturers, but strengthens the
array of companies operating there. As Mr Timms says, 'It's a box builder's
(a personal computer assembler) dream to have an advanced chip manufacturer
located on their doorstep, even if the output initially goes somewhere else
to be assembled.'
Mr Lang pointed out yesterday that Scotland produces 11 per cent of Europe's
semiconductors, 35 per cent of its personal computers, over 50 per cent of
its automated banking machines and 60 per cent of its workstations. Silicon
Glen, as the Scottish electronics industry is often called, includes many of
the leading US and Japanese electronics companies and employs about 45,000.
After a pause in growth between 1989 and 1991, output from Scottish
electronics plants has expanded rapidly, with a crucial impact on the
Scottish economy. The Scottish Office's Economic Bulletin said recently that
growth in Scottish manufacturing output between 1987 and 1993 'may be
entirely attributed' to increased production from electronics plants.
Yet the plants are largely producing items designed in the US or Japan. And
though it is tricky to identify the exact source of material inputs, the
most recent survey suggested that only 10 per cent came from Scotland in
1993-94 in spite of a 16 per cent rise in the industry's turnover to Pounds
9bn.
Only a tiny number of Scottish-based companies is engaged in the large scale
supply of components and sub-assemblies to the multinationals.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Japanese race to meet global demand surge: William Dawkins
and Alan Cane explain why more investment has come to Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC's investment of Y80bn (Pounds 530m) in Livingston, while smaller than
expected, is the latest stage in a race by Japan's semiconductor industry to
increase capacity in line with a global explosion in demand.
Mr Hajime Sasaki, NEC executive vice-president responsible for
semiconductors, says there is a 20 per cent worldwide shortfall in memory
chips. It is affecting producers of telecommunications equipment, computer
systems and consumer electronic products, all of which have a prodigious
appetite for semiconductor memory.
NEC's move follows a decision a day earlier by Toshiba, the second-largest
Japanese chip producer after NEC, to invest Y100bn in semiconductor
production in Japan.
Japanese chip companies are eager not to slip behind their US competitors'
aggressive expansion in capacity - NEC last year lost its position as the
world's top semiconductor producer in dollar sales terms to Intel of the US,
a symbolic blow which it intends to redress.
The two countries excel in different areas of the semiconductor market - the
US leads in microprocessors, the heart of computer systems, which command
high added value; Japan in memory production, commodity products for which
margins are low.
Overall, Japan's six leading electronics companies plan to increase
investment in semiconductor-making capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined
Y461bn in the year to next March.
US semiconductor producers believe the world chip market will double from
its present Dollars 100bn (Pounds 64.5bn) by the end of the decade.
The Japanese are more cautious, however, believing that the market will grow
only 50 per cent by then, with most of the growth coming from Asia. Taiwan
and South Korea are now aggressive players in the global semiconductor
business.
Either way, chipmakers across the world agree that the sharp rise in demand
for semiconductors - 15 per cent worldwide this year - will continue well
after 1997, by which time plants announced this year will have started
production.
A rise in demand for personal computers is fuelling this year's growth, to
be taken over in the next few years by memory-hungry multi-media machines,
mobile telephones and the growing use of sophisticated software such as new
generations of Windows, the leading computer operating system from Microsoft
of the US.
The new plants announced by NEC and Toshiba will both make 64-megabit
dynamic random access memories (D-Rams), the next-generation chip after the
current 4-megabit and 16-megabit D-Rams used in most personal computers
today.
NEC's decision to expand its Livingston plant continues the growing Japanese
trend of shifting production to cheaper locations, stimulated by the yen's
sharp rise. As a result, NEC's overseas production will rise from 15 per
cent to 20 per cent of the total, said company officials.
NEC's UK factory is the most productive of its semiconductor plants, but
other factors were involved in making the finely balanced choice between
expanding capacity at Livingston or at another NEC plant in California,
explained Mr Sasaki.
California, with its plethora of computer and telecommunications companies,
had a clear advantage over Scotland in the size of the local market, said Mr
Sasaki. The sites were equal on the other main criteria, infrastructure and
the availability of skilled engineers. Financial incentives played a very
secondary part in the decision, said Mr Sasaki.
One factor that may have tipped the balance, he hinted, was the need to
manufacture inside the European Union to avoid tariffs on imported chips, a
problem which does not exist in the US.
Another was the political support offered by the UK government to defend the
interests in the EU of NEC and other Japanese investors.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Clinton loses Congress ally in primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday lost one of his few reliable allies in
Congress in a stunning primary defeat for Congressman Mike Synar of
Oklahoma.
Although Mr Synar had won 47 per cent of the vote in a first Democratic
primary ballot four weeks ago, he barely improved his score to 49 per cent
in losing to a 71-year-old retired school teacher in a run-off election on
Tuesday.
Mr Virgil Cooper had spent just Dollars 9,053 (Pounds 5,840) on his campaign
by the end of August, compared with Mr Synar's campaign spending of Dollars
227,543 so far this year. His campaign spokesman said the former head
teacher 'did nothing but drive his pick-up around and put business cards in
people's windows'.
He will now face Mr Tom Coburn, a Republican doctor from Muskogee, in the
November 8 general election.
Mr Synar is the most prominent incumbent to lose a bid for re-election so
far this year.
His defeat sounds a warning not only for members who have been close to Mr
Clinton but also for relatively left-wing members in the conservative south.
Besides backing Mr Clinton on issues such as raising taxes on tobacco and
raising grazing fees on government land, Mr Synar has a voting record which
is, according to the Almanac of American Politics, 'by far the most liberal
of any white member from the South, more liberal than most Democrats from
the North'.
Perhaps his most fatal political stance is his support for gun control,
wildly unpopular in Oklahoma. But Mr Synar is not the only prominent
incumbent to receive a setback in Tuesday's primary voting.
Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, won only 36
per cent of the vote in his district in Washington state, a weak showing
that could hint at a very tough campaign for November's general election.
Under Washington state's peculiar election rules, all candidates run in the
same primary, and the best-placed from each party advances to the general
election. Since no other Democrat was running, Mr Foley won his party's
nomination, but his score represents a sharp fall in popularity from 1992,
when he won 53 per cent in the primary.
Even then, Mr Foley's 55 per cent in the subsequent general election was the
lowest vote recorded for a sitting House Speaker in over a century, and
Republicans are licking their lips at the chance of claiming such an
illustrious scalp.
Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida, one of two members contending to be
the Republican whip next year when Congressman Newt Gingrich becomes the
party's leader in the House, spent Dollars 30,000 on television
advertisements in the district in an effort to embarrass the Speaker.
Republican leaders say they are expecting to win 20-30 seats from the
Democrats on November 8. They would need to win 40 to take control of the
435-member House, but even a smaller gain would put them in a strong
position to control the congressional agenda in alliance with right-wing
nominal Democrats from the South.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Parliament may prove to be stumbling block for Aristide

Police brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince over the last two days has
shown the truth of the Haitian proverb, 'Mennen koulev lekol pa anyen. Se
fe'l chita ki red' - It's nothing to lead the snake to school, making it sit
down is the hard part.
Training the Haitian militia to replace political violence with civilised
law enforcement has become a priority for Operation Restore Democracy. But
the police have not been the only unruly characters who could spoil a
peaceful transition. Haiti's parliament, which has evaded votes to restore
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, may yet prove a significant
obstacle to installing a functioning democracy.
The parliament and Mr Aristide, at loggerheads for the seven months of his
term in Haiti and hostile to him in exile, will have to find a new modus
vivendi. The first hurdle however, will be the passing of a law granting
amnesty to the existing military regime.
Under the deal struck by former US President Jimmy Carter and provisional
President Emile Jonassaint last Sunday, 'certain military officers' are
expected to enter 'an early and honourable retirement when a general amnesty
is voted into law by the Haitian parliament, or October 15 1994, whichever
is earlier'.
Although the deadline provides the US with a necessary get-out if the
parliament proves contrary, failure to enact an amnesty would cast a pall
over the future co-existence of an Aristide government and his former
military ousters. Most people agree there is little to be gained from
disrupting the progress of the US-Haiti programme to replace the military
leaders with Mr Aristide, but the assembly has been unpredictable in the
past.
The 1992 Washington Protocol was scuppered by the parliament, which had
complained that the agreement brokered by the Organisation of American
States to restore Mr Aristide was unconstitutional. Thanks to a disruption
by parliamentarians allied to the coup leaders, the assembly never managed
to achieve a quorum. The Governor's Island accord last year intended to
achieve similar goals met with a similar fate.
According to one political observer in the Haitian capital, if Gen Raoul
Cedras can find a purpose in holding up the restoration of Mr Aristide, the
pattern of breached agreements made possible by a parliament may repeat
itself; Gen Cedras may call on parliamentary appointees and allies to block
the amnesty vote.
US officials are optimistic but not taking ratification for granted. 'We
have a lot of faith in the parliament if it can be assembled,' said Mr
Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince.
However, Mr Benard Sansaricq, Senate president, did not foresee problems
with getting the law through the assembly.
He predicted the legislative process could be over in four days next week.
After passing the bill, the Upper House will send it to the Chamber of
Deputies, where it will be ratified unless the deputies see any need for
modification, in which case it returns to the Senate.
To avoid a time-consuming to and fro, Mr Sansaricq said yesterday he planned
to convene a bicameral commission to draw up the bill. He had no doubt the
Senate would pass the legislation, but would not speculate on the lower
house, which is thought to be divided and susceptible to persuasion from the
de facto executive.
The amnesty law is only one step on the difficult road of reconciliation
which Mr Aristide has advocated in Washington. Whether or not it passes, Mr
Sansaricq plans to obstruct an Aristide government.
'I do not support the return of Aristide - but it was a fait accompli. I
will work in opposition as an elected member of this parliament,' he said.
Gridlock, a snake US administrations know all too well, may be one of the
things restored along with democracy and President Aristide.

FT  22 SEP 94 / No early move on sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council is not planning any quick move to end
its economic sanctions against Haiti, despite a promise in the agreement
negotiated with the military junta last Sunday that the embargo would be
'lifted without delay in accordance with relevant UN resolutions'.
A senior US official said 'there is not a sentiment in the United Nations at
this point for lifting the UN sanctions,' particularly as previous Security
Council resolutions say clearly the embargo is not to be lifted until ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is restored to power.
But officials added that they had already begun discussions at the UN on how
and when the sanctions might be lifted.
It was possible, they said, that some measures such as the oil embargo and
the ban on travel to and from Haiti could be lifted before Mr Aristide's
return to the country.
Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said that discussions on
easing the embargo were 'on a somewhat different time line' because the deal
negotiated with Gen Raoul Cedras on Sunday does not require him and his
colleagues to step down until October 15, unless the Haitian parliament
passes a general amnesty before then.
An arms embargo is not expected to be lifted.
Targeted sanctions freezing the US assets of Gen Cedras and a number of
other prominent backers of the military regime remain in place, Mr McCurry
said. Their status will be evaluated as necessary.
The sanctions' main impact has been on the already impoverished Haitian
people, while the military junta and its wealthy supporters have until
recently been able to shake off its worst effects with weekend shopping
trips to Miami.
The Inter-American Development Bank said yesterday it would move swiftly to
resume operations in Haiti once the country's political crisis was settled,
Reuter reports.

FT  22 SEP 94 / US accepts Russia's move on freer emigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In preparation for his summit next week in Washington with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, President Bill Clinton issued a declaration that Russia
allows its citizens to emigrate freely, thus moving a step closer towards
normalising US trade with the former Soviet state, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
Under a US law called the Jackson-Vanik amendment, trade relations with
communist countries were linked to the governments' emigration policies.
With the law still in effect, Mr Clinton has been required to issue a yearly
waiver to allow Russian products to get Most Favoured Nation tariff
treatment. MFN gives them the same low tariffs as the members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Clinton's declaration ends the need for a yearly waiver, but falls short
of requesting a new law from Congress. It has been long argued that
Jackson-Vanik discouraged private investment in Russia because investors had
no certainty they could export into the US.
As long as the Jackson-Vanik amendment is still on the books - and the
president has not requested its removal - the administration must still
report to Congress every six months on the status of Russian emigration
policies.
Congress can also vote to disapprove the president's action, taken on
Tuesday, but there is no sentiment for a reversal.
A US trade official said the president was following the same procedure
established with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, as trade
relations were normalised. Ultimately Congress passed legislation altogether
removing them from the Jackson-Vanik requirements.
Although Mr Clinton has not yet requested similar legislation for Russia,
the trade official said the administration hoped it was sending a signal to
investors that 'things are more stable' in Russia.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Restoring US labour's voice: Robert Taylor on the chief of
Washington's industrial relations board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who is so closely watched, some would say Bill Gould is remarkably
misunderstood.
It took Congress more than seven months to ratify his appointment as
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, the five-man federal labour
agency that enforces the country's basic labour law.
Even after a deal had been cut with the Republicans, 38 voted against him,
the highest level of recorded opposition to any Clinton nominee.
Much of US business believes him to be too pro-union, a black New Deal
liberal who once worked for the United Autoworkers union and intends to
shift the power balance on the board against the interests of employers.
His prolific writings have been widely scrutinised for pro-labour bias. His
new book, Agenda for Reform, that calls for changes to help union
organisation and collective bargaining, 'was exhibit number one at the
hearings', he says.
Those who regard him as at least controversial are unlikely to be
disappointed during a four-year term that ends in 1998, two years after the
next presidential election.
At an industrial law conference in Oxford this week Mr Gould spoke up for a
more activist board that would in a 'fair and even-handed' way encourage the
spread of collective bargaining. After all, he says, that is what the
board's statute has required since it was established as an independent
federal agency in 1935 during Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. The board
employs 2,100 staff across 33 regions and has a modest Dollars 175m (Pounds
113m) annual budget.
The quietly-spoken Mr Gould, who holds a law chair at Stanford University in
California, does not come across as a partisan firebrand.
Nor is his record that of a radical. A graduate of the London School of
Economics, where he studied labour law, he advised the British Conservative
party nearly 25 years ago on their Industrial Relations Act designed to
regulate the unions. Lord Geoffrey Howe, former UK Chancellor of the
Exchequer, remains a friend from those days and he cannot understand why the
Republicans are so worried about him.
But during the Reagan-Bush years, Mr Gould says, the board was 'not
abolished but trashed'. One chairman of that time even admitted in public he
did not approve of collective bargaining.
'My opponents had it all their own way for 15 years. They don't like or want
impartiality,' he says. He wants to try to restore what he sees as the
board's lost authority and vigour.
Whether this can stem the remorseless decline of organised labour in the US,
which now covers little more than 11 per cent of the private sector
workforce, is another matter.
'It is possible we could play a role in enabling the unions to regain lost
ground by actively promoting collective bargaining,' says Mr Gould. But in
his book even he admits changes in the market economy have been 'far more
important than the law itself' in explaining the drop in union membership.
While he regrets the recent refusal by Congress to support President Bill
Clinton's bill to prevent employers replacing strikers with new workers, he
also argues 'the enactment of labour law reform will not necessarily reverse
the process of decline'.
He hopes that under his chairmanship the board can 'foster a more
co-operative environment between labour and management'. Mr Gould has
already established advisory panels from both sides of industry to help him
in that process.
Mr Gould stresses that he will administer the law without bias or favour.
'We will enforce the statutes against all wrong-doers,' he insists. In his
first six months in the job he secured 60 injunctions, mainly against
employers to stop them carrying on alleged unfair labour practices.
But he has shown he is no poodle of organised labour by initiating contempt
proceedings against the United Mine Workers union for violation of a board
decision.
Mr Gould has attracted criticism from employers for his executive decision
to hold only postal and not workplace secret ballots of workers in union
recognition cases. Some companies believe this shift will give an unfair
advantage to trade union organisers who will be able to visit the homes of
workers to influence them. But the board believes holding such ballots
inside the company can open them up to undue employer pressure.
Mr Gould has also speeded procedures to cut the back-log of cases and
prevent wasteful litigation. He points out that he alone cannot restore the
fortunes of the American labour movement. 'We cannot do it for them,' he
says.
Well aware of his precarious position, he also realises he could find
himself in a minority on his own board after the mid-term congressional
elections. At present he holds a three-to-two balance but if there is a
Republican triumph - as expected - a new nominee could shift the board once
more into conservative hands.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Frei reshuffles Chile cabinet after criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After only six months in office, President Eduardo Frei of Chile has
reshuffled his cabinet, promising a new 'urgency' to his government
programme and an 'accelerated implementation of our priorities'.
The move comes in response to criticism that the new administration has
succumbed to inertia, and to suggestions that the president has failed to
stamp his authority on government policy. The fresh appointments are,
however, unlikely to change the general thrust of the administration's
programme.
'My government has finished one phase and begun another,' said Mr Frei in
announcing the changes on Tuesday. 'In the first phase, we have established
our priorities. . . We now need to concentrate on the tasks of education,
infrastructure and increasing production.'
Prime casualty in the reshuffle was Mr German Correa, the Socialist interior
minister, whose removal weakens the position of the Socialist party within
the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition. Mr Correa was replaced by
Christian Democrat Mr Carlos Figueroa, previously foreign minister, who is
more closely aligned politically with the president.
The sacking of Mr Correa - although partly offset by the appointment of
fellow Socialist Jose Miguel Insulza - is likely to put some strain on party
relations within the Concertacion coalition. Socialists, the second biggest
force within the coalition, admitted they were 'very surprised' by a move
they considered 'unjustified'.
Another important casualty was Mr Ernesto Schiefelbein, minister of
education, who was regarded as lacking the political astuteness to engineer
much-needed reforms to the educational system. Mr Schiefelbein, an
independent academic, had already lost the good will of teachers by failing
to consult them over reform.
Mr Sergio Molina, a Christian Democrat, takes over what is likely to become
the high-profile education portfolio. President Frei has promised to devote
far greater resources to the sector.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Official prices return to China's markets: Beijing's
leadership, panicked by inflation, has brought back price controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market stallholders across China have begun to display signs showing
officially sanctioned prices. So it is that price controls on foodstuffs,
including grain, meat, fruit and vegetables, have been re-introduced by a
panicky leadership which has made fighting inflation its priority.
While market vendors might grumble about the restrictions there is not much
they can do about them since under the new anti-inflation drive food prices
are being monitored rigorously, especially in urban areas.
At the Yongan district food market in Beijing's eastern suburbs, bargaining
is out for the moment. Complaints about high prices, the normal pantomime of
shopping in China, are met with a shrug and nod towards a board on which are
displayed food prices per jin (about 500gm).
The clamp on food prices is the most visible sign of the new anti-inflation
campaign, though China's leaders must realise that these measures risk
creating shortages which would run counter to one of their chief aims - to
ensure abundant supplies in the market.
For the moment, however, it is clear that Beijing is launching a fairly
determined campaign against price rises in the hope that it can break the
inflation cycle, and perhaps, more important, dampen inflationary
expectations.
The leadership has not admitted it outright, but a 16-point economic
stabilisation programme unveiled in July 1993 to bring the economy under
control by so-called 'macro-economic' measures, including credit
restrictions, is being superseded.
The 'fight-inflation-first' campaign announced by prime minister Li Peng
last month may well mark the first stage of a new stabilisation programme.
This will place much heavier emphasis on government interference than last
year's measures which relied more on indirect restraint through curbs on
monetary growth, and restrictions on lending to ailing state enterprises.
Chinese officials will have expected much better results from their efforts
of the past year or so to maintain high levels of economic growth while
bringing inflation under control. That policy has, at best, fallen well
short of expectations and, at worst, failed.
Publication of a rash of bad economic news in the past month or so has
forced policymakers into an extensive review of options, none of which is
proving politically palatable. The bad inflation figures for July and
August, indications that monetary growth is defying efforts to restrain it,
and evidence of a new consumer spending binge will have provided a fairly
brutal reminder of the continuing difficulties of managing China's economic
transformation.
'I think it's probably a shock to them that things have gone back to where
they are now,' said a western economist. He predicted that the next 12
months would prove especially difficult, given the high underlying rate of
inflation, continuing heavy demand for subsidies from faltering state
enterprises and restlessness among a peasantry whose meagre incomes are
being squeezed by higher costs of such items as fertilisers.
But it is the inflation bogey that has really unnerved the leadership.
Indications that rather than slowing, the rate of price increases had begun
to accelerate raised the alarming spectre of inflation spiralling out of
control, fuelled partly by inflationary expectations.
Consumer prices in the China's 35 major cities were 27.1 per cent higher in
August than a year earlier. This was well up on the July figure of 24.2 per
cent which itself represented a sharp increase on the previous month.
National inflation statistics were hardly more encouraging. The CPI
countrywide was up 25.8 per cent in the 12 months to August.
While money supply figures for the first seven months of this year are not
available, anecdotal evidence indicates that the broader M2 measure of
monetary growth exceeded the 24 per cent target. Western economists believe
the figure could be closer to 34 per cent.
The government's inability to meet its monetary targets has been one of the
main causes of continuing inflationary pressures. Demands for sustenance
from state enterprises, many of which are virtually bankrupt, are
complicating the government's task. Policymakers are walking a tightrope
between the need to curb inflation and fears of social unrest caused by the
inability of state-owned factories to pay their workers.
Worries about unrest have prompted a 'stop-go' approach to monetary policy
in the past year or so with the authorities alternately tightening and
loosening credit in three-month cycles. An easing of credit restriction
since April is seen as one of the main causes of the latest inflationary
surge with capital spending by state-owned companies leaping by 73 per cent
in July compared with the same month last year.
Officials, who had boasted a year ago that 90 per cent of consumer prices
had been de-regulated, are sensitive to suggestions that the re-imposition
of price controls represents a step-back from economic liberalisation.
Hard-pressed Chinese officials seeking better news can point to falling
producer prices - prices of steel and other raw materials are down sharply -
and to an improving external sector. Exports have grown by more than 30 per
cent this year, foreign exchange reserves have rebounded and in light of
this current account forecasts are being revised.
But in the end the government's success in this latest phase will rest on
its ability to check inflation while maintaining high levels of economic
growth. The authorities are striving to bring growth down to manageable
levels from the unsustainable 13 per cent of the past two years, but at the
same time avoid a too rapid deceleration. This is a task that would be
considered daunting by those managing even the most sophisticated economies.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Japan sees economy shrink 0.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness of Japan's economic recovery was underlined yesterday by
figures showing a drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter. GDP
contracted by 0.4 per cent in the April-to-June period compared with the
previous quarter, according to a preliminary estimate by the government's
Economic Planning Agency (EPA).
But the figures have become erratic, producing seven consecutive alternate
increases and declines. The more reliable six-month trend shows that the
economy grew by 0.4 per cent between the second half of 1993 and the first
half of 1994.
Even this figure was well below expectation.
Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the vice minister of the agency, said the quarterly
setback 'reflected the period's economic conditions, which were broadly
sluggish with some bright spots'.
The Bank of Japan said the figure would not lead the bank to change its
judgment that the economy was still 'headed for recovery'.
The data showed the economy retreated on all fronts in the second quarter.
Private consumption, regarded as central to recovery, fell by 0.7 per cent.
In the first six months of the year it was 1.4 per cent higher than in the
previous six months, a figure that still suggests only gentle growth.
Capital expenditure fell by 2.5 per cent in the quarter, as companies
continued to deal with over-accumulation of capital in the late 1980s.
But the largest contribution to the fall in output came from the external
account. Exports rose by 1.4 per cent in the quarter, and imports by 3.8 per
cent. Net exports fell by an unprecedented 86.5 per cent on the year,
suggesting the sharp rise in the yen may have started to reduce the trade
surplus in the second quarter.
Most economists argued that growth was likely to have resumed in the current
quarter, as a result of the boost to consumption from the warm summer and an
increase in exports.
Mr Dick Beason, chief economist at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo, said: 'The
figures are discouraging. But improvements in the third and fourth quarters
should help to keep GDP growth for the year at around 0.8 per cent.'
Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming, warned of another
year of disappointing growth. 'The recovery is still very weak and shows
only faint signs of improving in the immediate future,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Ruling coalition agrees new taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Japan's three ruling coalition parties were said yesterday to
have agreed on the content of a package of tax measures, but not on its
form.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, and leader of the New
Harbinger party, the smallest coalition member, said the Social Democratic
party (SDP) had agreed in principle to an increase in the consumption tax to
5 per cent from 3 per cent, to take effect from 1997. The parties also
agreed on immediate income tax cuts worth around Y5,500bn (Pounds 36bn) a
year for the next three years.
The decision to accept an increase in the consumption tax represents a
policy retreat by the socialists, who had vehemently opposed any increase in
indirect taxation to pay for the income tax cuts.
However, the final sticking-point for the party appears to be the timing of
the changes.
The Liberal Democratic party and New Harbinger party want to introduce both
measures as part of a single package.
However, many SDP members are anxious to separate the two proposals in the
thinly disguised hope that parliament may reject or delay the consumption
tax increase.

Unemployment will fall to 6.4 per cent by the end of 1995 from the current
rate of 8.4 per cent according to a New Zealand research group, AP-DJ
reports from Wellington.
The projection by Business &amp; Economic Research is more optimistic than the
most recent economic forecasts issued by New Zealand's central bank in
September.
The Reserve Bank expects unemployment to decline to just 7.6 per cent by
March 1996.
The research group also expects gross domestic product to grow 3.6 per cent
for the 12 months ending March 1996, greater than the 3.1 per cent predicted
by the country's central bank.

The arrival in Pakistan of Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, at the
head of a business delegation, is being regarded by both countries as adding
further warmth to a recent thaw in relations.
For Pakistan, a country that was on the verge of being declared a terrorist
state by Washington less than two years ago, the visit presents an
opportunity to leave behind the crisis in its relations with the US,
triggered by the US aid cut-off in 1990.
Although the aid suspension continues because of US objections to Pakistan's
nuclear programme, both sides are trying to broaden their contacts.
Earlier this month, the Clinton administration announced a Dollars 10m grant
for Pakistan's social welfare programmes. Officials from both sides are also
examining prospects for US soyabean oil sales of up to Dollars 20m. The
president of the US Eximbank is expected to visit Pakistan before the end of
the year to consider other investment proposals by US investors.
The amounts involved are small compared to the more than Dollars 7bn
committed by the US to Pakistan in military and economic assistance at the
height of the cold war in the 1980s. But Pakistani officials consider that
these developments take the two countries into a new era, ending the sense
of conflict.
'It's always foolish to say a tough item does not exist,' said Mr John
Monjo, the US ambassador to Pakistan, who conceded that the nuclear issue
has presented difficulties for the two countries.
'The fact that now the two sides are engaged in looking for ways in which we
can have a meaningful relationship in the post-cold war period, shows that
we are out of the crisis mould,' said Ms Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's
ambassador to the US.
Western diplomats and Pakistani officials, examining recent trends in
relations said at least three factors have induced a thaw.
First, Islamabad's secret nuclear programme has not progressed at a pace
which could cause any distress, in spite of a recent claim by Mr Nawaz
Sharif, the opposition leader, that Pakistan had produced nuclear weapons.
'The fact that Pakistan still has a nuclear programme which is not open to
international inspection raises immense fears,' said one senior diplomat.
'But . . . there is very little conclusive evidence that there is a need to
ring the alarm bells over a step-up in its pace.'
Secondly, fears of Islamic fundamentalism spreading across the country have
been put to rest after the Islamic parties received poor support in last
October's elections.
Finally, the aid suspension has been partly unsuccessful because Pakistan
refused to ratify the non-proliferation treaty or accept any other
international safeguards on its nuclear facilities, unless India would
accept the same.
Officials from both sides hope that US investments in Pakistan will help to
strengthen diplomatic relations. Over the past 46 years, US businesses have
invested Dollars 450m in Pakistan.
Mr Monjo says Pakistan's recent economic reforms as well as this year's
liberal energy policy, have together set the stage for attracting foreign
investors.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Major impresses all round the wicket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has been batting on a sticky
wicket for much of the four years since he succeeded Baroness Thatcher. But
on a dusty matting strip in South Africa yesterday the luck of the British
prime minister - pictured left - finally turned.
UK officials, mindful of his fragile image, watched anxiously as he accepted
a challenge from township leaders in Alexandra, outside Johannesburg, to
open a cricket net by batting against local bowling.
Their worries were misplaced. Mr Major, who had earlier described himself as
a 'sports nut', turned out to be a spin doctor's dream. Taking guard like a
professional, Mr Major put up a creditable show against 14-year-old Elite
Matsitso, whose penetrating medium pace drew only one false shot.
Surrey and England batsman Alec Stewart, one of several British sports stars
brought to Alexandra to coach youngsters, advised Elite: 'Give him a
googly.'
Handing over the bat to Mr Steve Tshwete, South Africa's sports minister, Mr
Major then strode to the bowling end and with his first ball knocked over
middle and leg stumps. 'I think I'll stop there,' he told onlookers.

FT  22 SEP 94 / South Africa opts for state assets sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African government yesterday formally reversed its long-standing
opposition to privatisation and said proceeds from the sale of state assets,
as well as a soon-to-be introduced national lottery, would be used to fund
its centrepiece reconstruction and development programme (RDP).
In presenting its White Paper on the RDP to parliament, the government said
it 'recognises that the location and composition of state assets may not be
optimal, and has begun an audit to dispose of those assets not relevant to
the RDP'.
The document also notes that it will use revenue generated from 'lotteries
and gambling', expected soon to be legalised, as well as all directly
received international and domestic grant aid, to help fund development
projects.
According to the document, this revenue will be added to funds raised from
budgetary reallocations and the government will not seek to raise money for
the RDP through extra borrowing. The government spending portion of the
programme is budgeted at R37.5bn over five years.
Although neither move was unexpected, together with other recent policy
statements by the government on reducing the government deficit and lowering
trade barriers, they confirm the African National Congress-led
administration's formal adoption of a broadly free-market approach to
economic policy.
When the RDP was originally drawn up by the ANC before the April elections,
it emphasised the importance of a highly interventionist state to redress
the imbalances of apartheid, and left open the possibility of
nationalisation of major enterprises.
In successive drafts, however, the statist policies have been whittled down
and, while the wording on some issues remains ambiguous, the central thrust
of the government's commitment to private-sector led growth is clear.
Speaking at a press conference, Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister without
portfolio who has responsibility for the RDP, said it was important that
most of the initiatives for the programme came from outside government.
'We don't have the resources in our country to do everything overnight,' he
said. 'We are not giving handouts, we are reallocating resources.'
Testifying to this point, the White Paper emphasises that it regards the
reduction of government spending as essential to economic growth, and makes
a commitment to start cutting the size of the Public Service from next year
while improving its efficiency.
'There has been a struggle between market-oriented government economists and
more interventionist ANC ones and, although there have been some sops thrown
to the latter, the former appear to have triumphed,' noted one policy
analyst.
The document strongly reaffirms the government's commitment to workers'
rights and the principle of labour involvement in strategic decisions,
calling for 'greater worker participation' and endorsing the use of
collective bargaining to negotiate affirmative action.
The government plans to introduce strict anti-trust legislation to try to
create 'a more competitive and dynamic business environment'.
'The central objectives of such legislation are to discourage systematically
the system of pyramids where it leads to over-concentration of economic
power and interlocking directorships to abolish numerous anti-competitive
practices such as market domination and abuse ..'

A long-standing tribal rival to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday
declared himself Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's traditional premier, a
position formerly claimed by the Chief, Mark Suzman writes.
Prince Mcawayezeni Zulu, a member of the royal family and former regent of
the Zulu kingdom, said he was assuming the duties of the honorary post with
immediate effect. This will deepen the rift between the two most important
Zulu politicians in the country. On Tuesday King Goodwill broke relations
with the Chief raising fears of inter-Zulu clashes.
The South African army, at the request of the ANC-led central government,
yesterday dispatched troops to guard the king.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Action against two BCCI directors is dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of five Abu Dhabi directors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International have had litigation against them in the French courts dropped
in exchange for a payment of FFr12m (Pounds 1.4m).
Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, head of the private department of the ruler of
Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Khalifa Nasr Al Mansoori, a director of BCCI's French
subsidiary, made the offer earlier this year to the Commercial Court of
Paris.
The deal, which has been accepted by the courts but is subject to appeal,
still leaves charges outstanding against three other BCCI directors, who
face a renewed hearing at the end of this month.
Lawyers had originally made the offer in exchange for the release of all
five directors from the action which had been brought by the French
liquidators to BCCI, but reversed their position after the other three
started legal action against Abu Dhabi.
Mr Alfred Hartmann, Mr Yves Lamarche and Mr Johan Van Oenen sued Abu Dhabi,
BCCI's majority shareholder, at the end of June in what they said was an
attempt to restore the damage which had been done to their reputations by
the bank's collapse.
After BCCI was closed by banking regulators in July 1991, lawyers were
appointed to advise the board members of the different companies within the
group.
The three directors have been sued by the bank's liquidators in Luxembourg
and this action continues alongside the litigation in France.
Simmons &amp; Simmons, the law firm which acts for the government of Abu Dhabi,
confirmed last week that Abu Dhabi had paid the legal bills until the time
of the directors' action against it.
The three non-Abu Dhabi directors switched in advance of their action to a
US law firm.
The correspondent firm in the UK, Warner Cranston, launched legal action
earlier this month in an attempt to gain access to papers it claims relate
to its clients.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Mexican investors to help restart Cuban
refinery - Joint venture to operate Soviet-built facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Mexican state and private investors has formed a joint venture
with Cuba that will spend Dollars 200m to restart and operate a Cuban oil
refinery built by the former Soviet Union. Since the 1990 collapse of Cuba's
trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc, the Cuban government had
been seeking a foreign partner to help run the refinery at the south-central
port of Cienfuegos.
The installation, completed at the end of the last decade, was practically
unused and is currently idle.
Announcing the deal in Havana yesterday, Mexico's secretary for foreign
relations (foreign minister), Mr Manuel Tello, said the Mexpetrol group
would have a 49 per cent stake in the refining joint venture. The group is
formed by state institutions Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Banco Nacional de
Comercio Exterior (Bancomex), and Mexico's Instituto de Petroleo, and by
four private companies, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, Bufete Industrial,
Protexa and Empresa de Transportaciones Maritimas Mexicanas. Cuba's state
oil company, Cubapetroleo, will control 51 per cent of the venture.
Mr Tello said the latest investment by Mexican entrepreneurs in Cuba
completed the liquidation of Cuba's remaining Dollars 340m debt with Mexico.
Cuba, seeking foreign capital to revitalise its recession-hit economy, has
already opened up offshore and onshore exploration blocks to oil companies
from Canada, France and Britain.
Once operating fully again, the Cienfuegos refinery, which has a capacity of
75,000 barrels a day, will refine crude oil from both Mexico and other
countries. The resulting oil products could be sold in Cuba, Mexico or to
third-party buyers on a commercial basis, Mr Tello said. Besides earning
hard currency, the refining deal is also expected to help Cuba alleviate the
chronic shortages of oil and oil products since oil supplies from the former
Soviet Union fell precipitously.
Mr Tello said Mexican investments in Cuba to date totalled more than Dollars
1bn and included joint ventures in tourism, textiles and cement. Another
joint production agreement in glass manufacture will be finalised in two or
three weeks, Mr Tello said.
Mexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is one
of Cuba's biggest trading partners in Latin America and has maintained
strong diplomatic and trade links with the island despite continuing US
sanctions against the Cuban government.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Jail threat to Indian 'shoddy goods'
exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian exporters were yesterday warned that they face jail if they
deliberately shipped shoddy goods or otherwise 'created the impression that
Indian exporters are not trustworthy'.
Mr Tejinder Khanna, the commerce secretary, said the government planned
changes in the law covering foreign trade to penalise exporters who wilfully
damaged India's commercial reputation. Such businessmen would face losing
their import and export licences or going to jail 'because they tarnished
the Indian flag'.
Speaking at a conference of economic journalists, Mr Khanna urged industry
to treat foreign trade seriously. He was commenting on recent trade
statistics, which showed that export growth in the first four months of the
1994-95 financial year, starting in April, slowed markedly to 8.3 per cent,
from 20 per cent for the 1993-94 year.
An important reason for the slow-down has been a revival in domestic demand
which has persuaded some companies to divert goods from exports to local
markets.
The Commerce Ministry has received reports of companies cancelling or
unilaterally amending export contracts in order to supply goods to domestic
buyers.
Mr Khanna said long-term export growth required a commitment to export, not
a tendency to turn to the domestic market for short-term benefits. A change
in approach was needed, he said. 'I believe the whole country depends on
this change.'
Mr Khanna said he was beginning to see change among younger businessmen who
were establishing new ventures and planning to export 35-40 per cent of
output.
But the transformation had to go much further, he said.
Gone were the days of 'suitcase exporting', when a businessmen would take a
few saris and some handicrafts overseas, sell them from his hotel bedroom
and then buy a few foreign goods for importing into India, said Mr Khanna.
India had to develop the image of a high-technology modern exporting nation.
Mr Khanna also warned executives travelling on trade delegations against
mixing business and tourism. He indicated that it was unacceptable for
delegations to pull out of meetings or receptions at the last minute, as, he
said, had recently happened with an Indian delegation in Kenya.
Reviewing the recent performance of exports, Mr Khanna said that in
textiles, the biggest contributor to India's exports, sales had suffered
from competition from China and from quota restrictions. Compared with an
original target of 25 per cent export growth in 1994-95, officials now
expected only about 10 per cent.
In engineering goods, including car parts, which saw exports grow 36 per
cent last year, the rate of growth is expected to fall to 14 per cent,
because of the diversion of goods to the domestic market. Exports of
diamonds are also expected to slow because of weakness in the world diamond
market.
However, in agriculture, where the government has recently lifted important
export controls, Mr Khanna expected rapid growth of about 20 per cent. 'This
sector holds the key and may bail us out,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Hyundai's car sale hopes fuel Europe's
fears - S Korean company's expansion plans raise prospects of trade friction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hyundai hopes to join the world's top 10 vehicle makers by the turn of the
century.
South Korea's biggest vehicle maker is to invest heavily in producing cars
for virtually every sector of the market, including minicars, sports coupes
and multi-purpose vehicles.
Its plans include greater penetration of the European market, thus raising
the prospect of trade conflict. European car makers are already alarmed by
the Korean industry's expansionism and angered by restricted access to
Korea's markets.
Late last year Hyundai, which has interests ranging from shipbuilding to
electronics and a turnover of more than Dollars 60bn, announced that it
planned to more than double its 1993 vehicle output of 900,000 units to 2m
by the year 2000. Well on course to produce 1.16m this year, Hyundai intends
to be producing a further 300,000 vehicles outside Korea by the end of the
decade.
Hyundai executives say this would give Hyundai 2 per cent of the global
market. Added to the expansion plans of Daewoo, Kia and Ssangyong, Korea's
other car makers, this would give Korea a capacity of 4m cars a year, which
would take the country from sixth to fourth place behind the US, Japan and
Germany.
None of these forecasts take into account the declared intention of Samsung,
Hyundai's industrial rival, to invest Dollars 5bn in starting up car
production and which has already produced its first prototype. Thus they
considerably understate the capacity Korea is likely to have by the end of
the decade, according to Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief executive of Fiat and
president of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
Mr Garuzzo, in Seoul recently to urge the Korean government and industry to
take further steps to open Korea's vehicle markets, maintains that between
now and 2000 Korea will spend nearly Dollars 10bn on creating capacity of
more than 5.3m vehicles a year.
Last year imports accounted for only 0.19 per cent of Korea's car market.
Only 307 cars came from Europe.
Although in the past few months Korea has introduced a number of market
liberalisation measures, Europe's industry says they are not enough. Veiled
warnings are already being issued about Europe being able and willing to
work within the parameters of the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) to
protect the European vehicle industry from unfair competition.
'Anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action will become more reliable
tools for legitimate self-defence within an open trading system,' Mr Garuzzo
warned Korean industry leaders.
Hyundai, helped by the Accent, a new small car soon to go on sale in Europe,
plans to nearly double its European sales from less than 100,000 last year
to 189,000 by the end of the decade.
Hyundai executives expect the Accent, in which the company has invested
Dollars 438m and which is Hyundai's first car to be developed without the
aid of Mitsubishi of Japan, to achieve 25,900 European sales this year,
rising to 62,000 in 1995. On sale in Korea since April, the Accent replaces
the similarly-sized Excel model.
Hyundai hopes that a replacement for the Elantra medium saloon and a new
coupe to be launched in the next year or so will increase its export appeal.
It will follow with a minicar and multi-purpose vehicle.
They will be assisted by an increase in research and development spending
scheduled to rise from the current 4 per cent of sales to 7 per cent by the
end of the decade.
Hyundai projects exports from 350,000 cars and commercial vehicles last year
to 972,000 by the end of the decade. It maintains that most of this growth
will be in developing markets elsewhere in Asia.
According to Mr J H Kim, Hyundai's general manager for vehicle exports,
sales to regions outside Europe and North America will almost quadruple from
150,000 this year to 562,000 by the end of the decade.
Hyundai's president, Mr Chon Sung Won, and senior colleagues insist that
projected sales growth in Europe should not be so high as to be a source of
trade friction.
However, aggressive export expansion is also planned by Daewoo, Kia and
Ssangyong. Daewoo has also said it wants to be a world 'top ten'
manufacturer by early next century and its Cielo and Aspera models - based
on General Motors' European mainstays, the Astra and Cavalier - will go on
sale in Europe early next year.
Kia, already selling in Europe, will also soon be expanding its model
ranges. And both it and Daewoo are having research and development work done
in Europe to tailor vehicles more closely to European tastes. Also early
next year Ssangyong's four-wheel-drive vehicles will make their European
debut.
Thus, while Hyundai insists it is more concerned to establish a production
presence in China and other fast-growing Asian markets (it already has
assembly operations for kits in Thailand), it is already preparing to avoid
trade confrontation by following Japan's Nissan, Toyota and Honda in setting
up production capacity in Europe. Daewoo has already set out modest plans
for assembly in eastern Europe, while Kia's four-wheel-drive vehicles from
next year will be produced for European markets by Karmann of Germany.
Hyundai has begun looking into where its European base might be located -
but says it will be the end of the decade, at least, before one might be
needed.
As a stepping stone, however, it is in the final stages of a feasibility
study to set up a European research and development centre.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Congress nearer to ratifying Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress moved closer to passing legislation implementing the Uruguay
Round yesterday when the Clinton administration and congressional
negotiators agreed on most of the outstanding issues.
The administration has pushed hard for passage of the legislation making US
trade laws and regulations compatible with the 120-nation Marrakesh accord
signed last March. The EU, Japan and other main trading nations have yet to
ratify the agreement but the administration has argued that the US must pass
the legislation this year to maintain its leadership on trade.
Under the fast-track procedure agreed by Congress, the legislation now goes
to the White House, which will tackle the few issues before sending it back
to Congress, presumably next week, for a Yes or No vote by the end of the
term.
The legislation has been written jointly by US trade officials and by
members of the Senate finance and House ways and means committee. To win
passage, the administration has been forced to agree to provisions not
envisaged by US trading partners, such as anti-dumping procedures which
would make the imposition of high dumping duties more likely.
Business lobbyists believe they have garnered enough votes for passage, but
the vote it will be close in the Senate where 60 of 100 senators must
approve the bill.
Lobbyists have been alarmed by the 'capricious' antics of Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, who last Sunday
warned that the deal would not pass if US troops invaded Haiti.
Senator Bob Packwood, a leading Republican on trade matters, said at least
30 of the 100 senators would vote against the round and others might fall on
the No side because passage would require a waiver of budget rules. Others
might vote against it unless the administration adds a restrictive rule of
origin provision to satisfy textile and apparel manufacturers.

FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Start is made on the long road to rebuild
Beirut - The first contracts will soon be awarded to transform the shattered
city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's president, yesterday cemented in place a symbolic
foundation stone to mark the formal start to the reconstruction of Beirut, a
25-year, multi-billion-dollar project which bills itself as 'the major urban
redevelopment project of the 1990s'.
Mr Hrawi laid the stone near the foot of the bullet-ridden statue of the
Lebanese martyrs in Place des Martyrs, where Lebanon's civil war began
almost two decades ago.
But as the recent transformation of that square amply demonstrates - more
than 150 adjacent buildings have been razed in the last two months  - the
work of rebuilding Beirut's core has, in fact, begun. According to Mr Nasser
Chammaa, chairman and general manager of Solidere, the property company
which owns and is to develop central Beirut, the first big contract in the
redevelopment will be awarded within weeks.
Mr Chammaa said the initial package was likely to be awarded to a joint
venture between the local Moawad Group and Consorzio Co-operative
Construzioni, the Italian construction company, which submitted the lowest
of 13 bids for the first stage of the infrastructure work on the 1.8m square
metres of central Beirut to be developed by Solidere.
This first Dollars 63.7m contract will cover construction of ring roads
around the central district, tunnels, bridges, internal roads, water and
waste systems and all power and telecommunications infrastructure. Mr
Chammaa said the eventual cost of the work, to be completed in two and a
half years, could rise to Dollars 80m.
He said demolition work in the centre was six months ahead of schedule and
should be completed by February. A further 150 buildings are to be
demolished and renovation work on 266 others will begin next month. He said
eight contracts for restoration and some rebuilding worth more than Dollars
100m in total had already been let. 'You'll see buildings start rising in
about six months, and these should be finished in the next 2 1/2 years,' he
said.
Mr Chammaa expects a total of Dollars 55m further to be spent on
infrastructure within the Beirut central district, but an additional Dollars
350m on reclaiming a total of 608,000 square metres of landfill to extend
the present corniche north of the city centre. This work, which will require
at least 10 years for some of the organic waste presently making up the
landfill already in place to settle, will open up land both for 290,000
square metres of development plots for Solidere and a recreational and
marina complex. Bid qualification for the initial contract to provide sea
protection is in progress, and the award will be made in the next two
months.
The Lebanese government recently agreed to extend the landfill by 150,000
square metres to the present total as a means of reimbursing Solidere in
kind for the cost of infrastructure work it is undertaking in the city
centre. Solidere's working capital was raised in a Dollars 1.8bn share issue
to establish the company earlier this year.
Meanwhile CDR, the main contracting agent responsible for redeveloping the
rest of Lebanon, said more than 400 contracts were under way for power,
housing, telecommunications, transport infrastructure, schools, water and
waste systems, and claimed to be on course to bring total investment to more
than Dollars 4.5bn in the next three years.
According to Mr Boutros Labaki, CDR's vice-president, just under Dollars 2bn
of this sum has already been pledged by international donors, chiefly Gulf
Arab countries and the World Bank. The remainder is to come from public
funds and financing packages arranged by contractors.
Three of the biggest projects, a Dollars 400m airport redevelopment, more
than Dollars 600m worth of work restoring and expanding existing telephone
links and creating a GSM cell mobile telephone system along with a Dollars
180m project to build a new sports city have already been awarded - all to
European countries. US groups remain handicapped by a state department ban
on Americans visiting Lebanon.
The next big project will be for the construction of two 450MW power
stations in north and south Lebanon, which together will provide 40 per cent
of the country's expected power needs.
Mr Labaki said seven groups, including GEC Alsthom, ABB Asea Brown Boveri,
the Italian group Ansaldo and a partnership of John Brown Engineering of the
UK and General Electric Company of the US, have entered bids for a contract
likely to top Dollars 700m in total.
The awards should be made later this autumn, with the first units expected
to come on stream within a year and a half. Later will come the construction
of a toll highway between Beirut and Damascus, a Dollars 600m
build-operate-transfer project for which bids will be invited next month. A
further Dollars 450m project to revive Lebanon's coastal railway line has
been put on hold.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan will seek a bigger quota for car and light commercial vehicle exports
to the European Union because of higher than expected demand in Eur-ope,
writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
Talks between officials of the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry
of International Trade and Industry are to be held in Brussels on September
29 and 30 to review demand forecasts for 1994, according to Miti. In March,
Tokyo and Brussels set a guideline allowing Japanese vehicle exports to the
EU to rise by 0.4 per cent to 984,000 in the whole of 1994.
The agreement was based on a forecast that overall EU demand for cars and
light commercial vehicles would grow by two per cent to 11.97m. In the first
eight months of the year new car sales in the EU rose by an estimated 5.9
per cent to 7.911m according to recent figures from Acea, the European
Automobile Manufacturers Association.

France, China and Sweden. The government gave no details on the financing of
the deal but said, the credit terms were favourable and repayments
long-term. Delivery will be in the next four years and three submarines will

FT  22 SEP 94 / German recovery 'to gather pace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German economic growth was forecast yesterday to speed up next year after
this year's faster than expected recovery from recession.
The optimistic predictions by the government, just ahead of the October 16
federal elections, coincided with the release of data showing a
slower-than-expected growth in August money supply.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, told parliament the government
expected the economy to grow by 3 per cent in 1995. For this year he
estimated that expansion would reach 2.5 per cent instead of a previously
projected 2.25 per cent.
His comments came in a strongly political speech ahead of the election, in
which he set the government's economic record against the policies of the
Social Democrat opposition. The minister also forecast that unemployment
would fall by 200,000 next year. The Bundesbank announced a much slower
annualised growth rate for M3 money supply of 8.2 per cent in August. It
reaffirmed its intention to keep a firm hand on monetary policy to secure
steady economic growth and lower inflation.
With the economy recovering speedily, the Bundesbank is concerned to prevent
consumer prices from accelerating.
Before the Bundesbank's announcement, financial markets were concerned that
the expansion rate of money supply might again have exceeded 9 per cent. In
July, the annualised growth rate for M3 was 9.8 per cent; in May, it reached
15.4 per cent.
In spite of the success of the central bank in bringing down money supply
growth, Mr Johan Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank deputy president, said it was
still concerned about inflation.
In August, west German inflation was 3 per cent, compared with the
Bundesbank's eventual goal of 2 per cent. Mr Gaddum said the price outlook
had improved now that fiscal and wage trends were moving in a more moderate
direction. 'Yet the progress towards stability still does not mean it is
time to sound the all clear.'
That reaffirmation of the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary stance, and the
emphasis on its continued commitment to money supply targets, has led some
economists to conclude that it is unlikely to cut interest rates further.
Others, however, expect a further cut after the election. The last reduction
was in May, when the discount and Lombard rates were cut to 4.5 per cent and
6 per cent respectively.
Mr Gaddum indicated last week that there was no reason to cut rates now. The
May cuts were aimed at shifting funds from short-term deposits, which show
up in M3, to longer-term investments, which do not. Mr Gaddum added
yesterday that the Bundesbank was confident the M3 rate would continue
falling towards the 1994 target range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent.

A liquidator is to be appointed to loss-making state-owned Irish Steel after
directors recommended the closure of its Cork-based steel plant - Ireland's

for enterprise and employment, accepted the board's advice to call in the
liquidator after meeting Mr Pat Dineen, Irish Steel chairman, and Mr Leslie
Buckley, acting chief executive, last night. The closure follows the failure
of the company to win agreement from its craft unions on a survival plan
which has been backed by the board, the government, the Irish Congress of

Hungary's new Socialist-led government has launched an inquiry into
corruption in the privatisation of state companies under the previous
conservative administration. State auditors said recently only Ft78bn
(Pounds 466m) of the Ft120bn in privatisation revenue projected for 1993 had
been collected. The government has set up a committee, which met for the
first time yesterday, to examine in particular the 320 companies whose
privatisation was rushed through between April and June, just before the
change of government. The Interior Ministry, which is overseeing the
inquiry, said 70-80 companies were already under investigation following
complaints from the public and deputies but that the number was likely to
rise. Privatisation officials said typical cases of corruption involved
misuse of public funds, tax fraud, under-valuation and sales to preferred
purchasers.

<TEXT>
Hungary's new Socialist-dominated coalition government yesterday presented
an austerity mini-budget whose cuts in spending and tax increases will
disappoint an electorate which voted in the hope of easing the pain of
economic transformation. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, warned that
despite an upturn in industrial production and in exports, the country's
trade and budget deficits were worsening and its net national debt was
increasing rapidly. The mini-budget, the government's first important piece
of legislation since taking office in July, aims to keep this year's budget
deficit to Ft331.9bn - 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product - by
increasing revenues by Ft5.5bn and cutting expenditure by Ft4.5bn. The
Finance Ministry said that without the corrective measures the deficit could
soar to more than Ft385bn. Further cuts in public expenditure and in the
bloated welfare system are essential if Hungary is to secure a three-year
International Monetary Fund loan package.

The directive - which affects large companies operating in more than one EU

<TEXT>
The Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior liberal partner in Germany's
coalition government, may not be wiped out in next month's parliamentary
election as a series of opinion polls have forecast. The Allensbach
Institute forecasts that the FDP will not manage to cross the 5 per cent
threshold of first preferences but will enter the parliament by scoring
between 7 and 9 per cent of the second votes which voters give to the
candidates of their personal, rather than party, preference. The same poll
suggests that ratings for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) may have peaked at 41.4 per cent, having picked up steadily from
33 per cent earlier this year. Last week the party was on 42.3 per cent. If,
for the first time since it was founded in 1948, the FDP fails to get into
the Bundestag, the CDU seems most likely to enter a grand coalition with the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), which is now on 34.3 per cent, up
from 33 per cent a week ago. The poll suggests that the CDU-FDP coalition
will together pick up 49.9 per cent of the vote while the SPD-Green
opposition is forecast to score 43.8 per cent.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Nato extends Bosnia air cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato ambassadors yesterday decided to extend air cover by alliance aircraft
beyond Bosnia to a small part of Croatia near the Bihac enclave. This means
that in principle alliance aircraft could carry out bombing raids against
Serb positions in Croatia if the Serbs were attacking UN forces around the
Bihac enclave in Bosnia.
The alliance ambassadors agreed that air cover could be extended to the
whole of Croatia, but that would require a more complex operation involving
the UN authorities in Zagreb. Yesterday's decision falls short of the
imposition of a draconian 'exclusion zone' - where all heavy weapons are
subject to air strikes. Any move in that direction would require a fresh UN
resolution. However, diplomats said that even limited Nato air raids on Serb
positions in Croatia could mark an important twist in the conflict.
Yesterday's meeting in Brussels was the latest in a series of moves towards
a tougher Bosnian policy that has been taken at alliance headquarters, where
frustration is growing over the cautious tactics of UN commanders on the
ground. The meeting took place amid pressure from US officials for a
toughening of the application of existing policies in Bosnia, including the
commitment to maintain six enclaves or 'safe areas' for the government side.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said last night he expected to
return to power at the head of a new minority government despite a
significant setback to his centre-left coalition in yesterday's general
election.
A surge in support for the Liberal party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
gave the combined forces of three right-wing parties 80 seats in the
179-seat Folketing (parliament). This was five seats more than the total
achieved by Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's coalition.
Two government partners - the Social Democrats led by Mr Nyrup Rasmussen -
and the Centre Democrats - lost ground, while the Christian Democrats failed
to reach the 2 per cent threshold needed to re-enter parliament.
The fourth government member, the Radical Liberals, added one seat.
The Social Democrats, the country's biggest single party, lost seven of the
69 seats they won at the last election in 1990.
However, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen can stay in power thanks to the certain support
of the Socialist People's party, which won 13 seats, and the Unity List, a
far-left, anti-European Union party which entered the Folketing with six
seats. The prime minister said the government would resign today to make way
for negotiations on a new coalition. But he said he fully expected to lead
the new government, and Mr Ellemann-Jensen conceded he would not be able to
form an administration.
The biggest gains were achieved by the right-wing Liberal party, which
increased its representation by 13 seats to 42, thanks to the aggressive
campaigning of the popular Mr Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign minister. He
had hoped to lead a coalition with the Conservative party, backed by the
populist right-wing Progress party. But the Conservative party slipped to 27
seats, a loss of three, and Progress dropped one seat to hold 11.
For the first time in many years, an independent was elected - Mr Jacob
Havgaard, a professional comedian. His Workshy party campaigned with
promises of shorter supermarket queues and a following wind on cycle paths.
Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's reliance on the left caused a slight weakening of the
Danish krona in out-of-hours trading in Copenhagen last night.
The Social Democrats came to power without an election in January 1993 when
a Conservative-led government resigned in a scandal over government
treatment of Tamil refugees.

'too great' damage to some clothes. Unilever rejected the report but has

first negative reports appeared. Rival detergent maker Procter &amp; Gamble of

Directors of loss-making state-owned Irish Steel have recommended the
closure of its Cork-based steel plant - Ireland's only steel mill - which
would involve the loss of 520 jobs. The decision, taken at a board meeting
yesterday, follows the failure of the company to win agreement from its
craft unions on a survival plan which has been backed by the board, the
government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other Irish Steel
workers. The survival plan was aimed at increasing flexibility among the
workforce but Irish Steel said yesterday that 'despite public statements it
is now clear that there is no basis for any agreement forthcoming' from the
craft unions. Mr Pat Dineen, Irish Steel chairman, and Mr Leslie Buckley,
acting chief executive, were due to meet Mr Ruairi Quinn, minister for
enterprise and employment, last night. If Mr Quinn accepts the
recommendation, a liquidator will be appointed.

The Spanish motor industry claimed yesterday that new car sales had been
increased by 85,000 in the five months from April to August this year thanks
to government financial incentives for the scrapping of old cars. Anfac, the
Spanish motor industry federation, called for the scheme, which runs for six
months to mid-October, to be extended to run for at least 12 months.
According to figures produced by Anfac, the scheme helped new car sales to
jump by 23.1 per cent year-on-year to 419,736 during the five-month period.
The Spanish government began offering cash incentives in mid-April to
persuade owners of old cars to trade in their vehicles for new ones, in an
attempt to revive flagging car sales. The launch of the scheme followed
similar moves in France and Denmark. Under the terms of the Spanish scheme,
the government is offering Pta100,000 (Pounds 490) each time a car which is
more than 10 years old is scrapped in exchange for a new car.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Austerity budget for Hungary
</HEADLINE>

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's new socialist-dominated coalition government yesterday presented
an austerity mini-budget whose cuts in spending and tax increases will
disappoint an electorate which voted in the hope of easing the pain of
economic transformation. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, warned that
despite an upturn in industrial production and in exports, the country's
trade and budget deficits were worsening and its net national debt was
increasing rapidly. The mini-budget, the government's first important piece
of legislation since taking office in July, aims to keep this year's budget
deficit to Ft331.9bn (Pounds 2bn) - 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product -
by increasing revenues by Ft5.5bn and cutting expenditure by Ft4.5bn. The
Finance Ministry said that without the corrective measures the deficit could
soar to more than Ft385bn. Further cuts in public expenditure and reform of
the bloated welfare system are essential if Hungary is to secure the
three-year International Monetary Fund loan package which Mr Bekesi hopes to
discuss with a fund mission to Budapest next month.

FT  22 SEP 94 / US and EU remain split on OECD chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The process of filling the job of secretary-general of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development began as a routine, humdrum affair.
But a transatlantic tussle for the top job at the Paris-based OECD is
rapidly becoming the cause of new economic policy tensions between European
Union countries and the US.
The race between Mr Jean-Claude Paye, a French civil servant who has held
the post for 10 years, and Mr Donald Johnston, the former Canadian minister
who is his main challenger, has resulted in deadlock.
Although the OECD exists as a forum for international understanding,
ambassadors of the 25 member states failed on Tuesday for the second time in
six days to reach consensus on a candidate.
The ambassadors have postponed further consideration until September 28,
when they meet informally.
The OECD council, the organisation's decision-making body, is due to
consider the succession on September 29, the day before Mr Paye's contract
expires.
According to diplomats following the tussle, Mr Paye, who is supported by
most EU countries, now has a small overall majority in the 25 member
organisation. Mr Johnston, who three months ago was the front-runner, is
thought to have fewer than 10 countries supporting him.
Under the OECD system of decisions by consensus, Mr Paye's present backing
could normally be expected to cause a shift of support in his favour by the
deadline. But the US, its officials confirmed yesterday, has no intention of
budging in its determination to veto a third five-year term for Mr Paye.
Some European diplomats are furious. The US stance, they say, threatens to
undermine the whole system of decision-making by consensus in the OECD. They
claim that the US has not provided any clear reason for opposing the man who
is now supported by a majority of OECD members and stress that there is
nothing in the rules of the organisation to prevent Mr Paye seeking a third
term.
Supporters of the US, however, say that the Clinton administration made
clear over a year ago that Mr Paye would not be acceptable to Washington and
that the Europeans should have produced a more suitable candidate. Officials
backing Mr Johnston say that the countries opposing the Canadian contribute
only 40 per cent to the OECD's budget. They also say that France has put
very heavy pressure on smaller European countries and the EU states to
support Mr Paye.
The US wants Mr Johnston to give the OECD a higher profile and direct the
organisation to serve the Group of Seven leading industrial countries which
do not have a secretariat of their own.
The deadlock means that the issue will now be taken up in national capitals.
It is possible that member governments will now start looking at other
compromise candidates for the post. For this reason, Britain is keeping the
name of Lord Lawson in play as a candidate even though the UK ambassador
abstained at Tuesday's meeting.
A week ago, Lord Lawson was supported by one solitary British vote.
If the OECD council is deadlocked at the end of this month, one of the
OECD's three deputy secretary-generals may be asked to administer the
organisation on a temporary basis.
Ambassadors discussed this possibility on Tuesday. It is thought that the
choice would be between Mr Robert Cornell, a US citizen, or Mr Pierre Vinde,
a Swede. Mr Matoko Taniguchi, a Japanese, is thought not to be in the
running as acting secretary-general.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Polish PM accused over sell-off delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A political row over the future of Poland's long-delayed mass privatisation
programme erupted yesterday, revealing mounting frustration at months of
inaction by the Polish prime minister, Mr Waldemar Pawlak.
Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the privatisation minister, accused Mr Pawlak of
blocking the scheme, which was launched four years ago and has limped
through five successive governments.
The delays have angered potential foreign participants in the scheme and
alarmed the international financial institutions which view privatisation as
a test of Poland's reform intentions. Poland's letter of intent for its last
Dollars 800m (Pounds 516m) IMF standby agreement promised enactment of the
privatisations.
This promise will soon be tested when Poland asks the IMF for Dollars 400m
to help fund the Dollars 1.9bn initial costs of the commercial debt
reduction agreement which comes into force at the end of next month. The
release of IMF funds will only follow a review of the letter of intent.
Mr Kaczmarek is from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the largest party
in a coalition with the Peasants' party (PSL) led by Mr Pawlak. He told a
meeting of the privatisation council, an official advisory body, yesterday
that it was no longer a question of 'mere delays' but that 'brakes had been
put on the scheme'.
Up to 450 state companies are due to be handed over to 'National Investment
Funds' (NIFs) run by foreign and local management groups, with shares in the
funds distributed to Poles at a nominal fee. The previous Solidarity
government approved 350 companies over a year ago and short-listed 19
management groups. Most are alliances between Polish institutions and
western banks.
Mr Kaczmarek has been waiting since July for Mr Pawlak to approve 100 more
companies for the scheme. He also expected his signature on a list of
members and chairmen of the supervisory boards to oversee the funds before
Mr Pawlak left on Tuesday for a visit to China. Mr Pawlak departed without
signing either.
Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD chairman, was in London this
week complaining that the delay over signing the privatisations into law was
part of a pattern of delay and obstruction from a stubborn coalition
partner. Mr Pawlak, for his part, has criticised the sell-off for giving too
great a role to foreigners in the management of the funds.
Mr Pawlak's failure to approve the last tranche leaves potential fund
managers increasingly restive. Mr David Glasgow of Kleinwort Benson warned
that further delay could adversely affect the bank's participation in other
Polish projects. Several foreign bidders have spent up to Dollars 1.5m
preparing for the scheme and have been waiting for two years in the hope of
what could be significant rewards.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Brussels setback for media owners
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday backed away from proposals to harmonise
rules on media ownership, frightened that action to make it easier for media
companies to invest across borders could prompt an outcry from member
states.
The decision represents a setback for Commission plans to prepare the single
market for the so-called 'information society' and the revolution that will
come from new communications technologies. Commission officials argue that
the current patchwork of national rules hampers investment, while member
states see Brussels venturing into areas best left to national governments.
Harmonisation of rules on media ownership was one of four areas identified
in the report by Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, on global
communications, where Union action was essential to establish a common
regulatory framework for the community. Other fields included privacy,
protection of intellectual property rights and encryption.
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single
market, said yesterday the Commission was preparing a further round of
consultation with industry before deciding next year whether media ownership
legislation at European level was necessary.
Media companies complain that existing rules are unfair. For instance there
is no limit on the number of satellite television stations that can be owned
by one company in the UK, while in Italy no one company can own more than
three satellite or terrestrial stations. In France and Spain the limit is
one. In the Netherlands, newspaper publishers with a market share of more
than 25 per cent are not allowed to own TV channels.
Single market officials yesterday insisted that initial suggestions put
forward on media ownership had been misunderstood. They argued that the
Commission did not intend to produce rules that interfered with national
policy on media ownership, but ones that would facilitate transnational
investments.
'We have defined a middle course which will safeguard a number of interests.
The Commission is not seeking to be invasive in this field.' said Mr Vanni
D'Archirafi.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Modest rise in Italian inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian prices rose 0.3 per cent in August, giving an annualised inflation
rate of 3.9 per cent, according to preliminary figures from the Italian
National Statistics Institute. The previous government projected an
annualised rate of 3.5 per cent at the end of the year. and Confindustria,
the industrialists' confederation, had forecast a rise of 4 per cent on the
basis that manufacturers usually wait until October to be sure of demand
patterns before passing on price rises to consumers. However, this year
industrialists were sufficiently confident of the recovery - both export-led
and now domestic - that this process had begun in late August. Robert
Graham, Rome
Denmark's current account surplus fell during the second quarter to DKr2.6bn
(Pounds 260m) from DKr8.8bn during the same period in 1993.
The European Union's annual rate of inflation rose slightly in August but
still remained well below the level of a year ago. The rate of inflation
last month rose to 3.1 per cent from 3 per cent in July, compared with 3.5
per cent in August 1993.
Swedish retail sales declined 4.7 per cent in July compared with July 1993,
mainly because of a 13.7 per cent decline in sales of durable goods after
unusually warm weather during the month.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Russia's secrets chief warns west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The head of Russia's foreign intelligence service yesterday warned the west
that it must accept the re-integration of most of the former Soviet Union -
or face the danger of a return to cold war postures fed by false fears.
Mr Yevgeny Primakov, in a rare public appearance, said: 'Integration (of the
Commonwealth of Independent States) is an undoubted fact. If a negative
attitude towards this becomes accepted in western capitals, then it could
very adversely affect relations between them and Moscow.'
Mr Primakov also took the unprecedented step of releasing a report -
'Russia-CIS: Does the West Need to Change its Position?' - which says an
economic union of the CIS states is inevitable and a defence and political
union desirable, and that such unions would safeguard the independent and
democratic development of these states.
The report appears only a few days before President Boris Yeltsin leaves for
the UK and the US for meetings with Prime Minister John Major and President
Bill Clinton. Mr Primakov denied any link between the two events, saying
that the report had not yet been shown to the president and that he doubted
it would form part of his talks with the other two leaders.
The report says that leading politicians and analysts in the west see the
continued disintegration of the former Soviet Union as being in their
interests - while believing that a re-integration is against these
interests.
It calls for a recognition that a re-integrated union, shorn of communist
ideology and guaranteeing independence to each state, 'will lead to
stabilisation and democratisation, promote reform and encourage some CIS
countries to opt for a federal structure, all of which will diminish the
threat of ethnic and inter-state conflicts within the CIS'.
The alternative was a rapid worsening of the economic position in CIS
countries, with a 'lurch towards nationalism accompanied by growing
authoritarian and anti-democratic tendencies'.
The report says that Russia has been grievously misunderstood in western
'circles' - though only two westerners are named Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski,the
former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a consistent
opponent of what he sees as Russian expansionism; and the US secretary of
state, Mr Warren Christopher, who is quoted as opposing Russian troops
operating abroad.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, said yesterday he would
form a minority government following the victory of his Social Democratic
party in Sunday's elections. His announcement, after talks with other party
leaders, disappointed financial markets and business leaders who had hoped
for a majority coalition with the Liberal party.
However, the news was not unexpected and markets responded calmly. Bond
yields edged up and both the krona and share prices weakened slightly.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, reaffirmed its rating on Sweden's
long-term senior foreign currency debt at AA+.
Mr Carlsson said a minority government would be able to deal more
effectively with the country's large budget deficit and better assure the
country's accession to the European Union than a coalition. He stressed he
was confident of being able to work across party boundaries and gain support
for spending cuts and increased revenue worth SKr61bn (Pounds 5bn) to the
budget.
'The government which has the best chance to create broad agreement in the
Riksdag (parliament) is a Social Democratic government,' he said.
The Social Democrats hold 162 seats in the Riksdag, 13 short of a majority.
They are likely to rely on the former communist Left party or the Green
party on some issues and the Liberals or the Centre party, both members of
the outgoing centre-right government, on others. Any one party could provide
the necessary support for a majority.
Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal party leader, resigned immediately after Mr
Carlsson's statement, criticising the Social Democratic leader for not
trying to build a coalition. He indicated during the election he would step
down if his party lost support - which it did - but it was clear he would
have been prepared to stay on to discuss a possible coalition.
Financial markets wanted a Social Democratic coalition with the Liberals
because they believed it would lead to tougher action to curb Sweden's
fast-growing debt and its budget deficit, which last year amounted to 13 per
cent of gross domestic product.
The yield on five-year Swedish bonds rose 6 basis points to 10.86
immediately after Mr Carlsson's statement.

FT  22 SEP 94 / French budget freezes spending and raises taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday unveiled an austerity budget for 1995 which
effectively freezes public spending and depends heavily on receipts from
higher economic growth and privatisation to slash another FFr25bn (Pounds
3bn) off the budget deficit.
The conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, and his budget
minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, described their own handiwork as 'courageous'
in view of the looming presidential election. However, the opposition
Socialist party criticised as 'unjust' the tax breaks for middle-class
employers of domestic servants, while the Patronat employers' federation
said the government's intention to prune a tax rebate to companies could
render economic recovery 'fragile'.
The government plans to reduce the budget deficit from FFr301.4bn this year,
or 4.1 pe cent of gross domestic product, to FFr 274.6bn next year or, 3.5
per cent of GDP. It is banking on a 4.7 per cent rise in tax revenue,
bolstered by raising indirect taxes on petrol and gas and electricity. as
While making companies foot more of their local tax bills, central
government spending will rise to no more than the 1.9 per cent anticipated
inflation rate next year.
Shaking off months of caution about over-stating the economic recovery, Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, forecast real growth next year of
3.1 per cent, mid-way in a forecasting range of 2.7-3.5 per cent and
commented that the final result might be 'closer to 3.5 per cent'. He based
his confidence largely on resurgent household consumption and capital
investment, which he forecast would raise internal demand in France to 3.2
per cent, the highest in Europe.
The government's twin sales-pitch is that the 1995 budget will significantly
rein in the deficit and debt servicing - stabilising for the first time the
share of tax revenue devoted to interest payments - while significantly
shortening France's record dole queue of 3.3m. Mr Alphandery also forecast
that next year would see the creation of 260,000-300,000 jobs.
Underlining the employment priority, Mr Sarkozy said of the FFr55bn in
privatisation receipts planned for next year, FFr8bn would go to help other
state companies, FFr27bn would be used to reduce the budget deficit, while
FFr20bn would help finance job creation measures. Foremost among these would
be a further FFr17.5bn reduction of welfare charges for lower-paid workers.
Mr Alphandery said that despite the fact many prize assets of the French
public sector have already been sold off, he was confident that the
government would meet next year's asset sales target just as it had already
fulfilled its plan to sell some FFr95bn in state assets in 1993-94.
Reflecting the sensitivity inevitably surrounding the last budget before
next May's presidential elections, the budget had been heavily leaked
beforehand.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Growth of German money slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's money supply grew at a much lower than expected annual rate of 8.2
per cent in August, but the Bundesbank made clear yesterday it would keep a
firm hand on monetary policy to secure steady economic growth and lower
inflation.
With the economy recovering speedily, the Bundesbank is concerned to prevent
consumer prices from accelerating. In a speech made with next month's
general election strongly in mind, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics
minister, forecast an economic growth rate for 1995 of 3 per cent after 2.5
per cent this year. He also said unemployment would fall by 200,000 jobs
next year.
Before the Bundesbank's M3 announcement, financial markets had been nervous
that the expansion rate of money supply might again have exceeded 9 per
cent. German bond prices fell sharply on Tuesday on such concerns. In July,
the annualised growth rate for M3 was 9.8 per cent; in May, it was still as
high as 15.4 per cent.
Despite the success in bringing down money supply growth, however, Mr Johan
Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank's deputy president, said it was still
concerned about inflation. 'We cannot be satisfied with the present rate of
price increase.'
In August, the west German inflation rate was 3 per cent compared with the
Bundesbank's goal of 2 per cent. Mr Gaddum said the price outlook had
improved now that fiscal and wage trends were moving in a more moderate
direction. 'Yet the progress towards stability still does not mean it is
time to sound the all clear in the battle against inflation.'
This reaffirmation of the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary stance, and the
stressing of its continued commitment to money supply targets, has led some
economists to conclude it is unlikely to cut interest rates further. Others,
though, expect one more cut after the election. The last reduction was in
May when the discount and Lombard rates were cut to 4.5 and 6 per cent
respectively.
Mr Gaddum indicated last week there was no reason to cut rates now. The May
cuts were aimed at shifting funds from short-term deposits, which show up in
M3, to longer-term investments, which do not. This move helped reduce money
supply growth and Mr Gaddum added yesterday that the Bundesbank was
confident the M3 rate would continue falling towards the 1994 target range
of between 4 and 6 per cent.
The Bundesbank said one reason for lower M3 growth in August was a switch of
funds from short-term deposits to Luxembourg-based money market funds
offering slightly higher yields. Money market funds, allowed in Germany
since August, are not part of M3; about 20 such funds, registered in both
Luxembourg and Germany, have either been set up or are awaiting approval.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Fayeds fail to clear names over DTI report: European rights
court rejects challenge to Harrods takeover allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fayed brothers failed yesterday in a final bid to clear their names over
their 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser stores group, which included
Harrods.
Claims that their human rights had been violated by the system of company
investigations in the UK were rejected by the European Court of Human Rights
in Strasbourg. Mr Mohamed, Mr Ali and Mr Salah al-Fayed had challenged a
Department of Trade and Industry report that branded their conduct during
the takeover battle as dishonest. They said they had been denied the right
to contest the report's damning conclusions.
Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, chairman of Harrods, remained adamant last night that
the UK practice of company investigations was 'dictatorial and
unacceptable'.
He said: 'I'm disappointed, but this is the way you show people that you
don't just sit and take insults just like that. If you can't get justice in
this country, you have to go somewhere.'
The government welcomed the decision. The DTI said it was glad the court had
ruled that there had been no violation of the European Convention on Human
Rights. Yesterday's judgment added a final footnote to the long-running
dispute between the Fayeds and Lonrho, the international trading
conglomerate defeated by the brothers in its own attempt to take over House
of Fraser in 1985.
Lonrho declined to comment on the Strasbourg decision. Mr Colin Matthews,
group chief accountant, said Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho joint chairman, and Mr
Fayed had settled their dispute at the end of last year and the matter was
history.
The DTI inspectors' report on the House of Fraser takeover, published in
March 1990, concluded that the Fayeds had dishonestly misrepresented their
origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources prior to
the takeover.
They had also knowingly submitted false evidence to the DTI inspectors
during their investigation. The Fayeds have steadfastly disputed the
conclusions.
The brothers claimed that in the eyes of the world the report had the force
of a judgment delivered after a trial at which they had been convicted. But
criminal charges were never brought. The government had not even sought to
have them disqualified as company directors. The denial of effective access
to an English court to defend their right to honour and reputation and the
denial of effective domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors'
findings amounted to a breach of the convention, they argued.
The Strasbourg judges rejected their claim. The court said the company
investigations system and the freedom of reporting enjoyed by inspectors
were both in the public interest.
The system also contained safeguards to ensure that the procedure was fair
and the findings of fact were reliable. The brothers had been given every
opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them.
Lord Lester, QC, the Fayeds' counsel, said the court had given a
'restrictive and technical interpretation' of the convention's 'due
process', or fair trial, provision. The judgment underlined the need for a
Bill of Rights in the UK with a due process clause in it, he said. The
judgment came just two days after the European Commission of Human Rights,
which takes a preliminary look at claims, decided that Mr Ernest Saunders,
the former Guinness chairman who was jailed for his part in the company's
takeover of Distillers, had been denied a fair trial.

FT  22 SEP 94 / US clamps down on violence by Haitian police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US signalled a sharp switch of policy in its mission to restore
democracy to Haiti when it authorised its troops to use force last night to
halt violence by Haitian police.
The change in its rules of operations came a day after US troops had been
forced to look on without intervening as police clubbed to death a man
taking part in a demonstration against Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, leader of the
republic's military junta. Further cases of violence, including the shooting
of a child by a Haitian paramilitary, were reported yesterday.
President Bill Clinton condemned police brutality yesterday, saying 'such
violence cannot and will not be tolerated'.
He added: 'Our armed forces cannot and will not become Haiti's police force.
But they can work to see that the Haitian military and police operate in a
responsible and professional manner.'
Mr Clinton said more than 1,000 military police had arrived on the island
yesterday.
Meanwhile, US troops began dismantling the Haitian military's heavy weapons
unit. The Camp D'Application military base outside Port-au-Prince is to be
jointly occupied by an American Special Forces battalion and by Haitian
soldiers, and the US forces will train Haiti's police in riot and crowd
control. Haitian radio reported that the so-called attaches, or militia,
would be disarmed, starting today.
Earlier, Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed for calm
and announced the formation of a transition team to pave the way for his
return before October 15.
In a striking reversal from the frosty tone of his statement on Tuesday, Mr
Aristide also thanked the US for its actions.
He urged the people of Haiti to 'be vigilant and guard against provocation',
and called on Haitian elected officials to resume their offices in
preparation for his return to power.
After being briefed by top US military officials on the progress of the US
occupation, Mr Aristide told his supporters at home: 'In less than 24 days I
will join you in Haiti. Then we will continue working as peacemakers,
peacekeepers and peace lovers.'
He warned that the success of the US mission was 'directly tied to the
process of disarmament' of the Haitian military and paramilitary forces.
Gen Hugh Shelton, the US commander, said 'the co-operation, the teamwork
(between US and Haitian soldiers) has just been splendid'.

FT  22 SEP 94 / UK export boost cuts trade deficit with non-EU states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British exports to countries outside the European Union rose to record
levels last month, with manufacturers reaping the benefits of strong growth
in the US and Far Eastern economies.
The firm export growth, coupled with falling levels of imports, helped to
reduce the UK trade deficit with non-EU countries to its lowest level for
more than six years.
Exports to non-EU countries, which represent almost half of all British
trade, were a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.47bn last month, up from Pounds
5.41bn in July, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Imports from these countries were Pounds 5.72bn, down from last month's
level of Pounds 5.8bn, but roughly in line with the levels seen during most
of this year.
The resulting deficit of Pounds 0.26bn was considerably better than the City
had expected, and the government welcomed the data as further evidence that
the UK recovery was becoming less driven by consumer demand and more by
exports and investment.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'These figures are
excellent news. The deficit has been halved over the last year.'
The most striking part of the data, economists said, was that the recovery
did not appear to be bringing in large quantities of imports to meet the
recent growth in UK industrial and consumer demand.
Although some economists said this might suggest a slowdown in levels of
consumer demand, others argued that it might indicate that UK companies were
finally responding to the effect of the 1992 sterling devaluation by
starting to substitute domestic products for imports.
Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, said:
'At first sight these figures do suggest that there is some import
substitution . . . in the home markets.'
The growth in exports covered most industrial categories. Although strong
oil exports boosted the overall trade balance, manufacturing also performed
well, with exports of manufacturing components 9 per cent higher in the
three months to August than the previous three months.
Exports of processed chemicals and metals showed particularly strong growth.
Electronic and engineering goods also did well.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, welcomed the figures as evidence that 'British exporters are
succeeding overseas'.
However, City economists pointed out that Germany and other European
countries were also seeing strong export growth. Mr Chris Dillow, UK
economist at Nomura, the Japanese securities house, said: 'It is difficult
to say whether the UK is increasing market share or whether it is just that
the world economy is booming - but I suspect it is more that world demand is
strong.'

<TEXT>
Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed for calm in his
country yesterday and announced the formation of a transition team to pave
the way for his return before October 15.
Mr Aristide urged the people of Haiti to 'be vigilant and guard against
provocation', and called on Haitian elected officials to resume their
offices in preparation for his return to power.
'In less than 24 days I will join you in Haiti. Then we will continue
working as peacemakers, peacekeepers and peace lovers,' Mr Aristide told
reporters on the steps of the Pentagon after being briefed by top US
military officials on the progress of the US occupation of Haiti.
In a striking reversal from the frosty tone of his statement on Tuesday, Mr
Aristide also thanked the US for its actions.
But Mr Aristide warned that the success of the US mission was 'directly tied
to the process of disarmament' of the Haitian military and paramilitary
forces.
The US military command reaffirmed its commitment yesterday to co-operating
with the Haitian military and leaving law enforcement to local police, in
spite of incidents of political violence.
As Washington insisted that US personnel should not intervene in domestic
policing, the implication was that the US forces serving in Operation
Restore Democracy could not guarantee Haitians free political expression.
General Hugh Shelton, the US commander of the joint task force in Haiti,
said the Haitian police intervention on Tuesday, which left one man dead and
many injured, constituted a 'human rights issue'. However, he concluded that
'the co-operation, the teamwork (between US and Haitian soldiers) has just
been splendid'.
At a meeting yesterday morning between the US and Haiti's commanders, Gen
Shelton promised to call on Gen Raoul Cedras, leader of the Haitian junta,
to 'pull the chains back' on his militia. However, he went on to say that
the police were made up of 'various factions . . . some of these General
Cedras does not have control of'.
Some members of the US 10th Mountain Division in Port-au-Prince confessed to
feeling 'helpless' and 'frustrated' at not being allowed to intervene on
behalf of innocent citizens.
Some said their rules of engagement remained loosely defined, which allowed
one group of servicemen to arrest three Haitian soldiers found near a small
US ammunitions stockpile.
There were reports of another scuffle near the airport yesterday morning.

FT  22 SEP 94 / Thatcher backs down in S Africa row with Major: Prime
minister speaks of optimism for country's economic future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, won a victory over Baroness Thatcher last
night when the former prime minister backed down after a long-distance row
over South Africa's economic prospects.
The row, which threatened to overshadow a three-day official visit to South
Africa by Mr Major, erupted after Lady Thatcher during a trip to India
dismissed South Africa's hopes of attracting international investment.
She told businessmen at an official British gathering in Bombay that
investors were afraid of violence and social unrest in South Africa, in
spite of the formation of a government of national unity after the country's
first all-race elections in April.
'What you are getting is people who look at the rest of Africa. They say
'Look at Rwanda, look at Somalia'. Are we going to have the same thing
happening in South Africa?' she said.
Lady Thatcher, who also described Nigeria as 'a terrible mess', pointed to
tensions between Zulu leaders as evidence of continuing friction in South
Africa. 'There will be a certain amount of trouble there. This is why people
are holding back,' she said.
However, after a vigorous rejection of her views by Mr Major and British
business leaders, Lady Thatcher issued a statement saying that she 'fully
supports the new democratic government of South Africa and feels that the
country will attract the inward investment it so much needs'.
In a clear attempt to repair the diplomatic damage in South Africa, the
statement said that Lady Thatcher 'further hopes that the prime minister's
present mission to that country will be highly successful'.
Her views contrasted with the tone of Mr Major's visit, during which he has
expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to achieve
economic prosperity. British officials are also aware that Lady Thatcher is
a controversial figure among black leaders, many of whom were angered by her
reluctance to endorse sanctions against the former all-white government.
Without responding directly, Mr Major went as far as he could to rebuke Lady
Thatcher without naming her, suggesting that she was out of touch with

'I do not think there is a shred of doubt about the confident future South
Africa can look forward to,' he said. 'You don't have to sit back in your
armchair abroad and wonder what is happening. People should come here. It

Mr Major told businessmen that optimism about South Africa's future was well

<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer, yesterday
announced it would sell part of its US and international services activities
to Wang of the US for Dollars 160m in cash, bonds and shares.
The French group will take a 5 per cent stake in the US company and a seat
on Wang's board.
The US company will also become a distributor of Bull products, including
its Unix open systems and its Data Zenith Systems personal computers.
The companies described the deal as a strategic alliance. Mr Axel le Blois,
chief executive of Bull Information Systems, said the agreement would give
Bull critical mass in servicing clients and provide financial resources for
its other US activities, including ZDS and its enterprise server business.
Mr Joe Tucci, chief executive of Wang, said the accord would expand the
company's customer services, solutions integration, and software activities.
He said the effect of the various acquisitions would increase earnings and
cash flow per share.
Bull will sell a number of service activities of Bull HN, its US subsidiary.
These include Bull HN's field maintenance services, which provide repairs
and maintenance to customers across the US, and its operations in Canada,
New Zealand and Mexico.
Wang will acquire Bull's HFSI federal systems integration business, which
operates exclusively with the US government.
The businesses to be transferred to Wang have annual sales of about Dollars
450m, of which about Dollars 320m is in the US.
Afterwards, Bull's US sales should fall to about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 220m)
annually, from an expected FFr1.5bn for 1995 before the deal.
Both companies are in the middle of strategic reorganisations.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Technip investors to cut stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principal shareholders in Technip, the French engineering group, are
planning to reduce their stakes in the company, possibly through a flotation
on the Paris stock exchange, Technip said yesterday.
Elf Aquitaine and Total, France's two big oil groups, Gaz de France, the
state-owned utility group, and ISIS, which is part of the state's Institute
Francais de Petrole, hold the shares in the company. The largest stakes are
held by Elf and ISIS, which each own 35.9 per cent of the shares.
Technip, which has annual sales of FFr7.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn), is mainly
involved in engineering and construction work for the oil, energy and
petrochemicals sectors. Last year it achieved net profits of about FFr285m,
an increase of 25 per cent.
The company is active in all of the world's main geographical markets, and
derives 92 per cent of its turnover from exports. It has a workforce of
5,500.
The proposed sale, which could take place by the end of the year, depending
on market conditions, would involve a French and international offering.
Banque Nationale de Paris and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as advisers
and lead managers of the issue, while Schelcher Prince has been selected as
sponsoring broker.
The sale of shares in Technip, which has been under consideration for
several months, would assist its international development, according to
industry analysts in Paris.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank to buy 20% of Polish
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank yesterday announced a further move into eastern Europe with the
planned purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Bank Rozwoju Eksportu (Export
Development Bank), a privately-owned Polish bank specialising in export and
corporate finance.
The German bank said its interest in the bank, founded in 1986 and now with
10 branches, was strategic. The stake requires the approval of NBP, the
Polish central bank. The central bank said it would only consider the
application after Bank Rozwoju Eksportu has held its next shareholders'
meeting in mid-October.
NBP is about to grant an application from Dresdner Bank of Germany and
Banque Nationale de Paris to open a jointly-owned subsidiary in Poland.
Deutsche Bank, also keen to open up in Poland, has bid for a majority stake
in Interbank of Warsaw.
Commerzbank already has a representative office in Warsaw. Elsewhere in
eastern Europe, it has a branch in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and a subsidiary
in Budapest, Hungary. The German bank also said it had just opened a
representative office in Novosibirsk, , giving it more outlets in former
Soviet countries than any other German bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Bank of Ireland is to take over regulation of the country's
stock market after the splitting of the Irish stock exchange from the London
stock exchange, scheduled for next April, the government announced
yesterday.
Under the Stock Exchange Act due to become law by the end of this year, the
newly independent Irish stock exchange and its 10-member firms will have to
apply to the Central Bank for permission to trade. However during the
transition period they will be considered as approved while their
applications are being dealt with.
Under the new Act, which fulfils Ireland's EU obligation to regulate its own
stock market, firms authorised in other EU states will be able to operate in
Ireland and firms authorised in Ireland will have the right to operate in
other EU states.
In order to be approved the Irish stock exchange will have to become a
limited company and its current council, made up of representatives of
member firms will be replaced by a new board.
The board will have to 'represent a balance between the interests of member
firms and stock exchange users and public interests and must include enough
independent members to promote the protection of investors and the
maintenance of proper standards,' according to the Irish minister for
finance, Mr Bertie Ahern, who launched the bill yesterday.
The Central Bank will be able to block appointments to the new board, said
Mr Ahern. The rules of the Irish stock exchange will have to be approved by
the Central Bank and the bank will be able to investigate breaches of them.
The Irish stock exchange has indicated that it intends to adhere to the
rules of the London stock exchange following the split. Breaches of these
rules are currently dealt with under the disciplinary procedures of the
London stock exchange.
The Central Bank will also be able to impose its own conditions and
regulations on the exchange and investigate breaches of them. Fines of up to
IR500,000 (Dollars 780,000) may be imposed for breaches of Central Bank
conditions and regulations while fines of IR1m and prison sentences of up to
10 years may be imposed of breaches of the Stock Exchange Act itself.
The bank will also have the power to object to the acquisition or disposal
of significant shareholdings in the Stock Exchange or member firms.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Naples politicians accused of Mafia link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Gava, a former Christian Democrat interior minister and a big
political figure in Naples, was yesterday arrested on charges of alleged
association with the Camorra, the Neapolitan Mafia.
The arrest was one of 76 ordered by Naples magistrates on charges of
association with the Camorra. Those arrested included two other former
prominent local politicians. A further 22 arrest warrants were issued in the
same inquiry for various types of corruption.
Naples magistrates first sought to implicate Mr Gava on similar charges in
March 1993. Parliament subsequently agreed that his immunity should be
waived. However, the magistrates have waited a good six months before moving
to arrest Mr Gava who was widely known as the most powerful Christian
Democrat figure in the Naples region for much of the past two decades.
He now becomes the second former minister from Naples to be arrested. But
his colleague - former health minister Francesco Di Lorenzo - only faced
corruption charges. But the Gava case is the most serious accusation linking
the world of organised crime with politics since that of former prime
minister Giulio Andreotti.
As interior minister from 1988-92, he had direct control over the fight
against the Mafia. Earlier in 1987 as finance minister he had responsibility
for the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police.
Mr Gava is alleged to have been part of the clan of Carmine Alfieri, the
leading figure in the Camorra, who was captured in September 1992 after
having been on the police wanted list for ten years. Naples magistrates
claim that at the time of his capture Alfieri was running an empire which
spanned illicit construction and investment activities alongside drug
dealing, extorsion and racketeering with a combined annual turnover of
L1,500bn (Dollars 965m).
Extensive information on the Alfieri empire has been supplied by Pasquale
Galasso, a former close associate who has been under police witness
protection since December 1992. Galasso's evidence has already led to
hundreds of arrests and has been the principal means of implicating the bulk
of the former ruling elite on the Naples city council as well as leading
business figures and national politicians.
Mr Gava is alleged to have developed his Camorra links in the early
eighties.
This was in the wake of the transfer of vast funds to Naples and the
surrounding region to make good the damage caused by the devastating Irpinia
earthquake. These funds were diverted for political use and business
investment which required Mafia protection, the magistrates allege.
In return for such protection the politicians headed by Mr Gava agreed to
provide political cover for the Camorra.
The majority of journalists in RAI, Italy's state-run broadcasting
corporation, yesterday staged a 24-hour stoppage in protest at
government-imposed changes in the editorial control of the three television
channels and national radio network, writes Robert Graham.
The changes were agreed over the weekend and reflected efforts by the
Berlusconi government appointed management board to shake up the existing
editorial structure. The RAI main union claimed the new board had failed to
observe proper procedures and was determined to place government-friendly
journalists in key positions of editorial control.

Economic recession and structural changes in central and eastern Europe have
led to more unemployment, increased part-time work and lower wages for
women, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. A
report prepared for a UN conference next month in Vienna on the situation of
women in Europe says that women account for a growing share of the labour
force. However, particularly in the service sector, women's jobs are still
segregated at the lower end of the labour market, upward mobility and career
prospects are limited and many women are left outside the full-time jobs
market. A new employment pattern is emerging which is 'highly feminised',
the report says. This comprises highly skilled full-time workers and a large
'periphery', usually lower skilled, and employed 'when needed'. The report
notes that in western Europe unemployment hits women consistently harder
than men, while in central and eastern Europe women have been most affected
by the rise in poverty.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (15): From paper
casinos to reliable yardsticks - A look at eastern Europe's stock markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most remarkable thing about eastern Europe's stock markets is that they
exist at all. What generations of bankers and traders slowly and sometimes
haphazardly constructed in the City of London and on Wall Street, eastern
Europeans began building from scratch in 1990. But, by 1993, the volume of
trading, though not the value, on the Warsaw bourse was almost equal to that
of London, and the exchanges of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest are now well on
their way to becoming a standard, if modest, shopping stop for European
investment portfolios.
The switch from five-year plans to five-year government bonds has not always
been either smooth or seemly. 'This is like Wall Street in the 1870s,' says
Mr Andrew Reicher, head of investment for CS First Boston in Prague. 'I
haven't a clue and neither has anyone else. They've only ever read about
markets in books.'
Of the three exchanges, the Prague bourse is most closely linked to the
broader economic reforms in the country. After their nation's 'velvet
revolution', Czech leaders decided that the only answer to their country's
unfortunate inheritance of one of the most centrally planned economies in
eastern Europe was a fast-paced, mass privatisation programme. The 'velvet
divorce', which liberated the Czech republic from the loss-making heavy
industry and defence factories in Slovakia, made this process easier.
As Mr Richard Wood, founder of Wood and Co Securities, one of the biggest
investors in the Prague bourse, puts it: 'When it comes to privatisation and
capital markets, the Poles behave like Czechs and the Czechs behave like
Poles.'
The Czech policy of mass privatisation, which transferred 943 companies to
its citizens for negligible fees in the first wave of privatisation and will
transfer 861 more in a second wave that is already under way, has made the
Prague exchange the broadest in eastern Europe with over 900 shares publicly
traded.
But western investors warn that the Czech republic's international image as
eastern Europe's free market zealot obscures a club world still run by the
old elites. Western observers complain that insider trading, abetted by the
loosest regulatory environment in eastern Europe and the multitude of
channels outside the stock exchange through which shares can be bought and
sold, is rampant.
'Often we have no idea that large blocks of shares have been traded for
months afterwards,' complains one western banker based in Prague. 'There is
a tremendous cynicism about the rule of law. The factory directors think
they are very smart, but often they wind up screwing the shareholders.'
The Budapest bourse is at the other end of the spectrum, although it is by
no means free of insider trading. It is smaller, better regulated and often
peripheral to the economic transformation in the country. Saddled with a
gross foreign debt of Dollars 2,500 per head, which, unlike their Polish
counterparts, the Hungarians chose not to negotiate away, Budapest has been
reluctant to give its state enterprises to its citizens for free. The
Hungarian government has preferred to sell its patrimony to strategic
foreign investors for real money and in the rare cases when state companies
have been floated on the exchange has broken the east European pattern and
over-valued rather than undervalued share prices.
In Hungary and Poland, enthusiasm for the stock market has been conditioned
by its infancy, which was traumatic for investors in Hungary but wildly
lucrative in Poland. 'In Warsaw it had a snowball effect,' says Mr Andras
Simor, managing director of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest. 'But here
people got the impression that the stock exchange is not where you make
money.'
As a result, only 29 shares are traded on the Budapest exchange, with half a
dozen more expected to be floated over the next few months, and average
daily turnover, in the first four months of this year, was Dollars 11.9m.
Uniquely, the Hungarian bourse is dominated by companies which were private
from the start and, from the outset, its main role has been to raise capital
rather than to serve as an outlet for speculative instincts repressed by
four decades of communism.
The Warsaw exchange, with only 24 shares listed and a dozen more expected in
the next few months, is structurally similar to its puny Hungarian cousin
rather than its swollen Czech neighbour.
However, propelled by the national speculative frenzy of 400,000 registered
domestic investors and a lack of other outlets for domestic capital, last
year the Warsaw bourse experienced a 820 per cent rise in real terms with
the average prices-to-earnings ratio hitting the dizzy level of 40. Poland's
strong economic growth last year at 4 per cent was the second highest in
Europe, but the speculative fever soon outstripped real economic gains.
'Poles are the Chinese of Eastern Europe, we are traders in our souls,' Mr
Krzysztof Stupnicki, chief representative of CS First Boston in Warsaw,
offers as an explanation for his compatriots' stock market fever.
The Polish entrepreneurial instinct has been sorely tested over the past few
months, as the Warsaw bourse has dropped more than 50 per cent. But western
institutional investors - who got out in time, creating an ironic situation
in which bankers estimate that between Dollars 50m and Dollars 150m of
Polish domestic capital has flown into the coffers of western merchant banks
 -describe the fall as a 'correction' rather than a collapse.
Indeed, despite their recent declines, no one seriously doubts the staying
power of any of the three main eastern European bourses. The bigger question
is what real role the stock markets are playing in the radical economic
transformations under way in the former Warsaw pact states.
As an engine for economic transformation, the exchanges have played a modest
role. The central challenge that post-communist economies face is opening
the economy to the entry of new, private businesses and transferring state
enterprises into private hands.
Insiders suggest that, even in the Czech republic, where the stock market
has played the most central role in privatisation, it is a facade behind
which the old elites are manipulating the economy much as before.
By contrast, Hungary, which has favoured direct foreign investment over
public flotations, has been at least as successful as its eastern European
neighbours. Many Hungarians argue that a takeover by a strategic foreign
investor, such as General Electric, which, after a shaky start is
successfully transforming Hungary's Tungsram factory, is the most effective
way to push an enterprise into the market economy.
Furthermore, the bourses have also been slow to take on one of their central
functions in established market economies: offering companies a venue for
raising capital. Investors in all three capitals complain of the
'irrationality' of domestic players and describe their countries' stock
markets as 'paper casinos.' As the bourses mature, that is beginning to
change, but only gradually.
Finally, as investment vehicles for domestic savers, the eastern European
stock markets have been indifferent performers. Their volatility has made
them immensely profitable for some western investors and a few sophisticated
locals. But, as the Warsaw bourse demonstrated earlier this year, the gains
of a few smart speculators, many of them outsiders, have been at the expense
of naive, over-zealous domestic investors, who would have done better
putting their money into reliable, high-yielding Treasury bills.
Yet, while stock markets have not served as a magic carpet which has swiftly
and efficiently whisked eastern Europe into capitalism, using exchanges to
transform communist economies has had two great virtues. First, it is fast.
Hungarians can argue that strategic foreign investors produce more
fundamental management changes, but it is only by trusting an unruly and
often unfair stock market that the Czech republic has managed to jump from
being one of the most state-controlled economies in eastern Europe to the
leading market reformer.
Perhaps more importantly, stock markets can play a crucial political role.
More than any nation in eastern Europe, the Czech republic has transformed
itself from a country of comrades into a land of small shareholders. That
could be the reason why, while the disgruntled Poles and Hungarians have
turned to ex-communist leaders, the Czechs are still ruled by an
aggressively right-wing government.
Moreover, as Poland, the Czech republic and Hungary move from economic
transition to growth, all three countries' bourses are settling down as
mature, relatively stable exchanges. Like their western counterparts, they
are becoming reliable yardsticks of their nations' economic growth and a
small, but standard, element in European investment portfolios.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (16): Authorities
look for quality - Tougher listing restrictions in the Asia-Pacific region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasingly restrictive mood has kept the cap on new issues in parts of
the Asia-Pacific region, as stock exchange authorities have looked for
quality, not quantity. However, business has been booming in Australia.
'In Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, the regulations governing new
flotations have been tightened through tougher listing requirements,' says
Mr Michael Franklin at James Capel. 'Typically, however, support for
secondary issues has not generally been required, as new issue prices
usually have been pitched below market levels so that a good market in the
shares is established immediately.'
Earlier this month in Seoul, an advisory group to the finance ministry urged
wide-ranging financial reforms, paving the way for the country to modernise
and internationalise its finance industry.
The recommendations included removal of the current 10 per cent ceiling on
foreign shareholdings in 1996 or 1997 and called on the ministry to allow
foreigners to list shares and to issue depository receipts from next year.
The group added that it would be desirable to give domestic companies more
freedom in raising overseas funds, so that these could be obtained more
easily, and proposed that South Korean companies should be able to list
stocks on overseas bourses from next year.
Kuala Lumpur saw some restraints on listing requirements introduced last
year to inhibit back-door listing and reverse takeovers. More recently, the
Malaysian securities and exchange commission has begun to reject
applications for new listings if applicants are considered to be operating
in the 'wrong' industry. For example, while a technology company might
obtain listing approval quickly, a textile company may have to wait.
The Bangkok authorities have also been making a concerted effort to raise
the standard of companies listed on the exchange by taking a tougher
attitude to screening new applicants for public offerings, particularly in
the property sector where it used to be relatively easy for companies to be
listed.
In July, the SEC announced new rules governing initial public offerings in
an attempt to broaden share ownership and end corrupt deals involving
underpriced shares in newly listed companies.
Major new equity issues have been mostly well-received and oversubscribed
over the last year with Telecom Asia taking Bangkok to a high for the year
when it made its debut last December, and the shares trading at Bt116
against an initial offer price of Bt55.
In Singapore, the last major issue, the partial privatisation of Singapore
Telecom in October last year, received official encouragement when local
investors were allowed to tap into their Central Provident Fund accounts to
finance applications for the issue. However, the terms of the issue were not
attractive enough to appeal to foreign investors who judged that the
prospective price-earnings ration was too high. The flotation, which raised
about SDollars 4.4bn, saw 1.4m Singaporean investors acquiring shares, which
more than tripled the number of shareholders in the country.
A more recent successful issue was that of Petron in Manila earlier this
month . The oil refiner surged 136 per cent above its offer price on the
first day of trading, but the broad market fell as investors switched from
other blue chips.
In Taipei, which has rigid listing requirements, the chairman of the SEC,
Tai Lih-ning has stressed that any increase in the number of listed
companies would be permitted only as a last resort to narrow the imbalance
between supply and demand for shares.
However, Hung-Lung Yuan at Wardley James Capel in Taipei says that as a
result of the rigid regulations, only 29 new listings were permitted during
the whole of 1993 and another eight during the first seven months of this
year, taking the total number of companies listed on the exchange to 293.
'Although the government is likely to push to expand market capitalisation
through new listings and privatisation, it does act as a protector to the
retail investor by scrutinising the companies which seek to float their
shares on the market,' he says.
Sydney, by contrast, has been enjoying a boom in new equity supply, as
companies have taken advantage of rising markets to raise cash. Estimates
from Macquarie Equities, the stockbroking division of Macquarie Bank, show
that equity raisings by private enterprise and the federal and state
governments were at an all-time high of ADollars 23.3bn in the year to the
end of June this year, almost double the total of the previous 12 months. Of
the 1993-94 total, rights issues and placements, totalling ADollars 8bn, and
non-government floats at ADollars 6.3bn, were the dominant source of equity
raised.
However, Macquarie forecasts a 25 per cent fall in total equity raisings in
the 12 months to next June, with federal and state government issues
increasing to 31 per cent of the total from 12 per cent in the previous
period.
The broker adds that a sharp increase in the contribution from offshore
funds marked a clear change of flows in 1993-94 with a stronger funds flow
within Australia's wholesale investment institutions the other major
contributor lifting demand for equities.
Direct household investment has also increased, spurred by the increased
number of government privatisations, such as State Insurance Offices,
Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (12): The grey
suits you see in every capital - A look at the growing international
interest in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American companies are continuing to raise large amounts of capital on
international equity markets - despite turbulence in world markets and big
blips in investor confidence earlier this year.
Over the last few weeks, greater stability in the US financial markets and
positive political developments in Latin America - in particular in both
Mexico and Brazil - have boosted confidence. There are hopes in some
quarters that the total volume of new issues could come near to last year's
record Dollars 6bn and certainly match the Dollars 4.6bn raised in 1992.
In addition, there are some signs that international interest in Latin
American companies is widening - with sectors such as retailing and
electricity distribution attracting attention. Investors are also prepared
to consider deals in countries such as Peru that would have been considered
marginal until very recently.
'There is just unbelievable competition,' says one US banker. 'There are 200
investment bankers in Mexico City today but you will see grey suits and blue
suits in every Latin American capital.'
Even so, bankers acknowledge that the pace of new issuance has slowed
significantly earlier this year, following successive increases in
short-term interest rates. Investors were also troubled by signs of
political instability, especially in Mexico, where a presidential candidate
for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party was assassinated in
March.
Indeed, during the second quarter, a number of deals were withdrawn because
of a lack of investor interest.
For example in June, the Argentine government had to drop a planned Dollars
150m IPO of its remaining 25 per cent stake in TGN, a privatised gas
pipeline company, because of insufficient demand.
Even so, interest picked up during July and by the beginning of August,
Latin American companies had raised a total of Dollars 3.27bn in 47 separate
issues, only five less than for the whole of last year, according to figures
collated by International Financing Review.
And last year, the total figure was boosted by the launch of a very large
share offering from YPF, the Argentine oil and gas company. The Argentine
government sold a 45 per cent stake in YPF in June 1993, raising a total of
Dollars 3bn which included an international tranche of some Dollars 2.3bn.
Sentiment has been buoyed by signs of stability in the US bond market but
also by developments on the political front. In Mexico - which saw some of
the greatest activity last year with 26 new issues raising a total of
Dollars 2.71bn - the apparently clean victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the
presidential candidate of the governing PRI, has revived confidence.
Even though the local markets had discounted a PRI victory, stock prices
have risen, and a number of new issues - including the sale of the
government's remaining stakes in two of the country's largest banks,
Bancomer and Banamex - are again on the agenda. Grupo Elektra, a retailing
group which pulled an international offering earlier this year, is also said
to be looking at the international markets.
In Brazil, the continent's largest economy, markets have been encouraged by
the success to date of the Real plan, an economic stabilisation package
introduced in July, and the lead in the opinion polls built up by Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the plan's architect and former finance minister,
ahead of presidential elections next month.
Among Brazilian issues expected - ahead of October's elections - is
Usiminas, the steel company, which is said to be seeking some Dollars 500m.
Elsewhere, investors are increasingly positive about economic prospects in
Peru. Several new Peruvian issues - including an issue for some Dollars 45m
to Dollars 50m for Banco Wiese, the country's second largest bank, are
expected in the autumn.
There is also optimism about the prospects for some smaller economies.
Fieldstone Private Capital Group, for example, a merchant bank which
specialises in energy-related business, is seeking to raise some Dollars 32m
to Dollars 33m for a Bolivian electricity distribution company, the
Cochabamba Light and Power Company (ELFEC), by selling a 70 per cent
government shareholding to private investors in November.
Some of the money will be raised locally - incidentally creating one of the
La Paz stock exchange's first equity issues - but Fieldstone is also
applying to have the stock listed in London, and aims to raise money from
both retail and institutional investors through an offer for sale.
'Until now, there has been no possibility of buying Bolivian stocks so there
is considerable pent-up demand with large sums already deposited for this
purpose in New York and London,' explains Mr Peter Earl, a consultant with
Fieldstone in London.
The interest is leading to increasing competition for Latin American
mandates, say bankers. 'The markets are still growing. The hard part is
winning the mandates, not getting the deal done,' suggests one New
York-based Latin American financier.
Mr Francis Coles, head of Latin American corporate finance at Baring
Brothers in New York, says 1994 has been much tougher than 1993 but concedes
that more recently 'political factors have had a positive influence. There
are quite good conditions for getting deals done. There is a lot of
potential supply. I think there are some quite good companies out there,' he
adds.
Referring to two successful recent deals, Mr Coles says: 'The pricing wasn't
over-aggressive. It is a clear demonstration to us that it is possible to do
deals successfully if they are in a sector where the investor wants to be.'
Certainly, the interest is leading to greater competition among investment
and merchant bankers involved in the deals, with fees under pressure,
especially in deals involving privatisation in the bigger economies. 'At the
end of 1992 lead underwriters were generally collecting a commission fee of
between 3.75 and 5.25 per cent,' points out one New York banker. 'But in
several deals this year the commission has fallen below 3 per cent of the
amount raised,' he adds.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (13): The multiples
take a tumble - Chinese shares in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Qingling Motors, a light duty truck maker, was listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange last month, it set a new pricing low for H shares, the China
enterprises listed in the colony.
The HKDollars 2.07 price tag put the shares on a price-earnings ratio of
nine times 1994 earnings - a far cry from the 17.89 multiple commanded by
Tsingtao Brewery, the pioneering H share which came to market a year and a
month before Qingling.
Slashed p/e multiples are a function of three broad changes to and in the
embryonic market: a downturn in general market conditions across the globe;
growing choice in the H share market; and enhanced sophistication among the
former state owned enterprises themselves, which has led to what bankers dub
'more realistic' pricing.
While the move towards more aggressive pricing has prevented a mass shelving
of listings during the lull in market sentiment that has marked trading
activity since the beginning of the year, it has not been without its
casualties.
The listing of putative H share Shanghai Haixing Shipping Company has been
put on the back burner after directors and sponsors fell out over pricing:
it is understood the company, whose listing was to have pre-empted that of
Qingling, could not bring itself to accept a single-digit p/e.
Peregrine Capital, the Hong Kong merchant bank which played a leading role
in 15 fund-raising transactions in Hong Kong and three in China in the first
half of the year, involving total funds of HKDollars 8.9bn, admitted at the
time of its interim results earlier this month that a number of big mandates
had been shelved 'until market conditions improve'.
However, Mr Alex Ko, a director of the company, believes interest in China
companies has persisted during the downturn even though the responses to
listings have not been as consistently overwhelming as last year. He
attributes this to more selective investors who are looking more closely at
the structure of the company on offer and the merits yielded by it and the
industry sector in which it operates.
'Pricing is subject to market conditions. With a good market and good
company you can get a high price. But if the market is down and selling on a
p/e of 10 times and you are raising capital at 12 or 15 times, of course the
market will have less interest in the company.
'Proper pricing of initial public offerings depends very much on several
factors: prospects of the company, management, industry sector, general
market conditions and sentiment and even political stability,' he says.
All H shares to date have been fully subscribed - if only by a whisper, as
in the case of Tianjin Bohai Chemical - but some of this year's offerings
have performed poorly on their debut. Luoyang Float Glass, which kicked off
the 1994 batch of H shares on July 8, saw its share price slide 20 per cent
to HKDollars 3.65 on the first day of trading.
For the companies which went to New York - of which Shandong Huaneng Power
Company is the pioneering example of a Chinese company selected by the
mainland authorities to opt for a single listing (as opposed to a dual or
secondary listing) - performances have been even worse. Trading volumes are
very thin - Shanghai Petrochemical, which is traded in both New York and
Hong Kong, sees the bulk of activity in the colony.
Mr Andrew Liu, managing director at Morgan Stanley Asia - sponsor of the
impending China Eastern Airlines issue on Wall Street - says that while
shares have been placed on a global basis for a number of issues, the
trading patterns invariably show that the dominant activity takes place in
Hong Kong.
'I think that is probably the most significant point we have observed in the
past year: the natural trading market for all these China companies is going
to be Hong Kong or China,' he says.
This pattern has prompted the Chinese government to push for dual listings
to twin New York with active 'home' markets, where interest, news and
analyst research helps galvanise trading momentum.
Certain mechanical problems - not least the disparity between listing
requirements and procedures on the two exchanges - mean that dual listings
are unlikely to be offered to all the remaining New York-bound China
companies, although Morgan Stanley reckons those that are tided over until
next year will have a stronger chance to benefit.
The Chinese government has been playing a pro-active role in the securities
markets all round. In recent months the focus has been on the domestic
markets, which have since provided a total turnabout in fortunes for
investors who were previously faced with falling prices, tight liquidity and
poor sentiment.
The government announced plans to list USDollars 1bn worth of B shares -
stock designated for foreigners, but which will now be available to
mainlanders too - this year, in effect trebling the size of the market.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (14): Bombay shrugs
off VSNL fiasco - Indian equities have hit all-time highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The postponement of a planned USDollars 1bn issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam
(VSNL), the Indian state-controlled international telecommunications
carrier, earlier this year cast a cloud over the country's overseas equity
offerings.
But business has recovered markedly since the issue was taken off the market
in April when fund managers baulked at the pricing of the deal, the largest
offering ever made by an Indian company.
Today, Indian groups are queueing to tap the market. Buyers are more careful
about pricing than they were before the VSNL debacle but still have a strong
appetite for Indian equities, which have recently hit new all-time highs.
The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares has risen by about 35
per cent since early May to reach a new all-time peak last week of 4628.
That compares with a record high of 4546 set in April 1992, during a rally
which collapsed when it emerged that the market was being fuelled by
suspected illegal share-financing operations organised by Mr Harshad Mehta,
a stockbroker.
The market is now being driven up by hopes of good prospects for the Indian
economy, which is emerging from three years of reform and restructuring. The
most bullish stockbrokers believe the index is now in sight of 5000. The
more cautious point out that the market has already risen 80 per cent since
its low of 2633 in the middle of last year and is riding for a fall, with
too many investors chasing too few stocks to unsustainably high levels.
According to the bulls, increases in corporate profits, which rose 75 per
cent at the net level in 1993-94 and are forecast by stockbrokers to rise a
further 40-50 per cent in this year, justify current price/earnings
multiples for leading shares which trade at about 53 times their net
earnings for 1993-94 and 35 times likely earnings for 1994-95.
The bears concede the economic outlook is better than at any time in the
past three years. But they believe that in their rush to buy, investors have
pushed share prices far beyond levels justified by economic logic. They
suggest that prices are being pushed to unsustainable levels by the
availability of low cost funds, including money raised from equity and bond
issues which is being recycled into the stock market.
The flow of new issues in the domestic market has been somewhat slower than
in the 1993-94 financial year, which ended in April, when Rs322bn was
raised. In the first four months of 1994-95, companies raised Rs62bn in
domestic issues. However, on the international markets, companies are
raising more than ever before, despite the VSNL fiasco. Since April, they
have raised about Dollars 1.5bn in equities and bonds, compared with Dollars
2.5bn in 1993-94.
The finance ministry introduced controls on international issues in May to
try to prevent companies raising money for what it regards as unimportant
purposes. Issuers must seek prior approval from the ministry, which attempts
to ensure funds raised are to be applied to economically-productive
investments and not, for example, for injecting into the stock market.
Officials operate an informal queue and give priority to favoured
industries, such as power and transport.
Even though the total market capitalisation of the Bombay market is now
nearly Dollars 150bn, daily turnover is quite low at below Dollars 100m
because so little stock is freely traded. The families which control most
listed companies typically hold 25 per cent to 75 per cent of the issued
capital. Other long-term holders such as development banks are also
infrequent sellers. Very little is left for foreign fund managers and other
new investors to buy.
The difficulties in acquiring shares are accentuated by the cumbersome
trading, settlement and transfer procedures, which mean it can take six
weeks for sellers to receive payment and three months for buyers to secure
full ownership of their stock.
Although stockbrokers and bankers are trying to improve the process, they
expect dramatic changes only after Bombay Stock Exchange and the
newly-formed National Stock Exchange launch computerised on-screen trading
and a computerised share depositary is established to handle share transfers
smoothly. On-screen trading on the NSE could start this year for top stocks
and on the Bombay exchange next summer, but a fully-fledged depositary is
two or three years away.
These difficulties have already persuaded some foreign fund managers to slow
their purchases of Indian stock or to switch to the Euroequity issues of
Indian companies. After averaging Dollars 251m a month in the first half of
1994, net foreign buying of Indian equity fell to Dollars 89m in July and
Dollars 80m in August. Given that many investment funds dedicated to India
have yet to invest, this slowdown is likely to be temporary, but it shows
fund managers are paying heed to price levels.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (8): Rise in
interest rates stems flow - US corporate issuers have been taking a break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After feasting for more than two years on some of the lowest US interest
rates since the 1960s, corporate issuers have been taking a break this year
from the US equity market.
The break, however, has been enforced upon them primarily by circumstances:
namely, the rise in US interest rates since February, which has unsettled
the stock market and steered many investors away from equities towards cash.
Yet the decline in equity offerings has not been as dramatic as some
investment bankers on Wall Street may have feared earlier this year, when
interest rates were first rising and equities appeared to be heading into a
prolonged bear market phase.
According to statistics supplied by Securities Data, the New Jersey
financial information group, between the start of the year and September 7,
just over Dollars 20bn was raised by companies through IPOs in the US
market. That compared with Dollars 24.2bn in the same period of 1993.
There has been a bigger decline in secondary share offerings, however. Stock
worth almost Dollars 22bn was issued up to September 7 this year, compared
to almost Dollars 30bn over the same stretch a year ago. Yet the decline in
IPOs and secondary offerings is not that worrying if the fact that 1993 was
a record year for equity deals is taken into consideration.
Taking the IPO and secondary issuance together, the volume of equity sales
in the US declined only 22 per cent from its all-time peak last year, a
solid performance against the background of a significant reversal in the
direction of interest rates and share prices.
A lot of the credit for restricting the decline in equity issues this year
should go to foreign companies, which have continued in large numbers to tap
the US markets for capital in spite of the deterioration in the interest
rate climate.
In the year to September 7, foreign companies sold Dollars 3.5bn of stock in
the US market via IPOs, up from Dollars 3.4bn during the same period of
1993. Secondary offerings by foreign companies, meanwhile, have raised
Dollars 4.7bn so far this year, compared to Dollars 2.8bn a year ago.
Activity in the non-US sector of the market has been even more buoyant if
stock issued in the private placement market under Rule 144a of securities
law - which makes it easier for foreign companies to sell their stock to US
investors - is considered. According to Securities Data, Dollars 3bn was
raised by foreign companies on the 144a market in the first half of this
year, up sharply from the Dollars 970m raised in the first six months of
1993.
With foreign IPOs, secondary offerings and 144a issues, 'this is a more
non-US issuance oriented market than it ever has been before,' says Mr Bob
Nau, head of equity capital markets and syndication at Salomon Brothers.
The strength of foreign stock offerings has been driven by a variety of
factors, including the growing willingness of US investors to diversify into
non-US assets, the rush to privatise nationalised industries in Latin
America and the former Soviet bloc countries, and a trend toward more
private companies from overseas going public.
In addition, US investors are becoming increasingly eager to buy stock
issued by foreign companies because they believe that the potential for
achieving solid returns on their equity holdings is greater overseas than at
home. 'There is a perception that you have stronger fundamental growth rates
in certain overseas markets,' says Mr Nau.
Although some observers say that the heavy volume of non-US equity issues is
all the more remarkable because of the weakness of the dollar, the
currency's travails did not really have that great an impact upon foreign
issuers' plans. This is primarily because the dollar has fallen sharply this
year against the Japanese yen and German mark, but held up well against most
other currencies. Foreign companies selling their shares in the US have not
emanated from Japan or Germany, but principally from Latin America, where
local currencies are tied closely to the dollar.
While the non-US sector of the equity market has thrived, domestic issuance
has clearly taken a knock from rising interest rates and poorly performing
share prices. Yet the fact that the past few years have seen such a big rush
of companies to the equity market means that some sort of slowdown was
inevitable. As one investment banker puts it: 'A lot of companies needing
equity got their plates filled in 1992 and 1993.'
Investors have also become more choosy. Until this year, the big cash-rich
institutions such as mutual and pension funds were snapping up anything that
came their way. Now the the climate is less benign, investors are looking
for quality. Asked which deals are the easiest to sell today, Mr Nau
responds: 'Stocks with a clear cyclical participation, ie where investors
can point to factors that indicate they are going to be direct participants
in the economic recovery. Also, telecommunications and information company
stocks, and, now that the bond market seems to have stabilised, stocks with
high yields, such as real estate stocks.'
This flight to quality is likely to be a feature of the new issues market
for the rest of the year, but Wall Street is cautiously optimistic that
activity will pick up steadily in the months to come. One possible source of
new business could be the booming mergers and acquisitions market: 'For
those companies using cash to make acquisitions, there will be companion but
lagging equity deals,' says Mr Nau.
Above all, the recent rebound in share prices should instil confidence in
those companies considering issuing new equity, and especially those which
postponed offerings earlier this year because of unfavourable market
conditions. The market's rally has also attracted new money into mutual
funds, which will have to invest it somewhere.
With the Federal Reserve looking as if it will now put monetary policy on
hold and bond prices stabilising, stocks recovering and mutual fund coffers
filling, the outlook is brightening almost daily. And if foreign companies
continue to raise equity financing the way they have done recently, 1994
could turn out to be a surprisingly good year for the US capital markets.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (9): Not a year for
breaking records - UK rights issues are unlikely to match the 1993 total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>

A new wave of rights issues seems likely if the UK equity market regains its
strength this autumn.
Institutions and dealers were kept busy in the first half of this year as
the market digested substantial cash calls from companies such as industrial
conglomerate Williams Holdings; Lasmo, the oil exploration and production
company which later fought off a bid by Enterprise Oil; GKN, the engineering
and industrial services group which won control of Westland in a takeover
that was partly funded by a rights issue; and Eurotunnel. The total for the
first six months was just over Pounds 5bn.
However, as was the case with a number of new issues, plans for several
rights issues are believed to have been aborted as the London stock market
slipped back.
Despite some signs of subsequent market recovery, analysts say that total
funds raised through rights issues this year are unlikely to match last
year's record total of Pounds 11.5bn. Expectations for the end of this year
hover around Pounds 9bn.
Among the reasons given for the decline, the main one is the improved health
of many companies as the UK economic recovery has started to take hold. In
addition, better cash flow in the past two years has reduced pressure on
companies to seek funds from investors to help 'straighten' the balance
sheet.
Mr Trevor Laugharne, UK strategist at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The 10 to 20
per cent improvement in cash flows we have seen in recent months, especially
in the smaller and medium companies, has certainly been a factor in reducing
the need for a rights issue.'
This has left the way clear for issues made to fund an acquisition. But even
here, analysts say companies have been slower than usual in taking this path
to expansion because many have instead chosen to reduce high debt levels
incurred during the recession before considering future expansion plans.
Another reason for the possible reduction of the flow of issues is
'indigestion' resulting from a glut which has used up the markets' capacity
to underwrite further issues.
There are fears in some quarters that with major flotations, such as the
third and final payment for the sale of BT shares in the next month,
companies that wish to make rights issues may meet a less than enthusiastic
response. New issues that were pulled at the height of the downturn could
also add to the costs for institutions.
Mr Laugharne also highlights other demands on institutions which may prevent
them from taking on rights issues from UK companies. These include the
favourable yields now on offer from bonds and UK gilts returns that can
outweigh those that would be received from equities.
He also believes institutions continue to want to spread their risks by
investing in other markets. Thus, 'emerging markets will also be a draw on
investors' funds'.
Other strategists point out that the queue of big privatisations in the
pipeline in other markets such as that of Lufthansa in Germany or Renault
and AGF in France may provide stiff competition for investors' funds.
But Mr Philip Wolstencroft, UK strategist at Smith New Court, remains
confident about the UK market. 'I think finance directors will take
advantage of a strong market with a lot of value to urge their companies to
go to the market for funds. But I don't think that of itself would put
pressure on the equity market.'
Another strategist simply explains: 'Those rights issues that could have
been questionable anyway have already been done. The plain fact is that, if
it is priced right, then the market will take it.'
Researchers at Smith New Court point out that companies emerging from a
recession may see another advantage in calling on the market for cash. Mr
Wolstencroft says: 'Companies are still more likely to go for a rights issue
because corporations do not want to be exposed to short-term debt. For many
it is a sentimental thing after the interest rate rises of the late 1980s.'
Liquidity in the market remains the key issue, says Mr Wolstencroft.
'Overseas funds were largely absent from the UK in the first half of this
year thus and could not help in providing liquidity. Things should change as
they return.'
According to one analyst, who declined to be named: 'Those with a good
reason for a rights issue should have no problem over the next month, but
many will await the market's reaction to the next budget before assessing if
there is an opportunity for a rights issue.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (10): Overseas
investors wooed - A look at problems in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Japan's large institutional investors show increasing reluctance to take
on new equity, the country's leading companies have started to look to
overseas investors for funding. Hence, it was no surprise when Japan
Telecom, which was listed earlier this month along with an offering of
34,000 shares, or 10 per cent in the company, wooed international investors
by offering 5,000 shares for the international market.
The issue was the first initial public offering ever to involve a separate
international tranche. Japan Telecom officials say they want more
acknowledgement among international investors to make future fundraising on
global financial markets easier.
But some analysts fear that the decline in Telecom's share price since its
listing, leaving investors sitting on losses, may hurt such prospects.
Foreign investors have become increasingly wary of buying new Japanese
equity.
Some analysts say Japan Telecom's listing has highlighted problems in
Japan's pricing system for public offerings. Established after the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal in the late 1980s, the current system attempts to
prevent corruption by determining the offering price through an auction.
The difference between the Japanese system and the bookbuilding process used
in most international equity issues is that the price is set near the start
of the offering period rather than towards the end. The wider the gap
between pricing and trading, the more the share price is vulnerable to wider
market movements.
The issue needs to be resolved soon, especially since foreign investors have
become more important to Japanese companies than ever before. According to
the Ministry of Finance, net purchases of Japanese stocks by overseas
investors totalled a record Dollars 46.7bn during the year ended March, an
eight-fold rise over the previous year.
An increasingly number of Japanese companies have already taken advantage of
demand among international investors. In June, Amway Japan, the Japanese arm
of the US home care products group, offered its shares through the first
global offering in two years. Other companies have set up internal investor
relations groups in order to enhance their images as investor-friendly
organisations.
Meanwhile, large companies have started to list on overseas markets so as to
raise their profiles in the international financial community. Although such
moves were common during the late 1980s when the Japanese stock market
showed few signs of rising, since the stock market plunge in 1990, listings
on overseas markets have been restrained because of the fall in profits
among Japanese companies and the negative image of falling stock prices.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the leading telecommunications operator,
announced in July that it would list on the London and New York stock
exchanges to raise its profile among the global financial community. 'By
listing in the US, where disclosure rules are stricter than in Japan, we
hope to win trust from investors,' say company officials.
Smaller Japanese companies are also trying to increase their appeal to
international investors. Small ventures in Japan have had a hard time
raising funds through the domestic equity market due to stringent listing
requirements. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which
overlooks start-up companies, is now encouraging companies to look overseas
to diversify their funding options.
For instance, Biomaterial, a bio-technology company based in western Japan,
recently announced plans to apply for the US Nasdaq exchange. If it lists on
the exchange in 1996 as planned, it will be the first Japanese company to
bypass the domestic stock markets for a listing on an overseas stock
exchange.
To list on the Japanese over-the-counter exchange, a company is required to
post Y10 or more in earnings per share and to have net assets of Y200m or
more. It is a chicken-and-egg situation for many start-up companies since
without strong earnings they cannot apply for a listing, but without a
listing they cannot raise funds to expand their operations.
The prospect of the equity offerings business in Japanese companies
increasingly flowing outside the country is causing anxiety among Japanese
brokers, who fear they may lose business to foreign investment houses which
have stronger ties with overseas investors.
In Japan, the media have dubbed the phenomenon 'part of the financial
hollowing out process', whereby fundraising and secondary trading in the
Japanese financial markets flow out to overseas markets due to Tokyo's
numerous regulations, high costs and business practices which are not in
line with international standards.
The sentiment that the Tokyo stock market is not the place to be is shared
by many foreign companies, which have withdrawn their listings from the
Tokyo stock exchange's foreign division. This year, 13 foreign companies,
including Eastman Kodak, the US photo film maker, have delisted from the
TSE, reducing the number of companies listed on the foreign section to 96
companies, sharply lower than the 127 at the peak in 1991.
The high costs of maintaining a listing and the lack of trading volume in
the secondary market have been cited by companies which have moved out.
Officials at foreign companies claim the promotional value as well as fund
procurement benefits of the exchange's foreign section are virtually
non-existent.
In spite of worries over 'hollowing out' aired by the local financial
community, including domestic brokers, the country's finance ministry
officials remain complacent over the threat that the Japanese financial
markets might decline into oblivion. They maintain that backed by Japan's
high savings ratio and large current account surplus, the country's
institutional investors retain as much financial power as ever.
The reality is, however, that domestic institutional investors have not
recovered from the shock of the stock market plunge in the early 1990s and
remain cautious about equity investments. Unless they overcome fears of
taking risks, Japanese companies will continue to turn to overseas markets
and investors for funds.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (11): The price has
to be right - A look at the world's emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The doomed Dollars 1bn offering last May by Videsh Sanchar Nigam, India's
international telecommunications carrier, marked a turning point in
relations between international investors and companies in the emerging
markets of Latin America and south-east Asia.
During 1993 and the start of 1994, international investors were willing to
pay demanding prices in order to get exposure to emerging markets, India in
particular. But they drew the line at VSNL's offering because in their view
the pricing was excessively high.
The backdrop to the event was also inauspicious. Uncertainty over the
direction of interest rates in the US and other leading industrialised
nations caused profound volatility in financial markets and discouraged
investors from making fresh investments.
The buyers' strike inevitably led to an oversupply of equity issuance from
emerging markets which has taken several months to clear. Mr Harry Hampson,
head of the equity syndicate at JP Morgan in London, says sentiment has been
much improved now that the market has digested the backlog of issues.
'People have come back to their desks after the summer holiday with a more
positive outlook,' he says, noting that stock markets in south-east Asia had
also strengthened over the summer.
Some fairly large deals are expected from the region in the autumn, such as
offerings from telecommunications companies in Malaysia and Indonesia, he
adds.
Nevertheless, investors are expected to be far more selective about
offerings than in the past. 'I will be looking at each issue individually,'
says Mr John Legat, senior emerging markets portfolio manager at GT
Management. He is more optimistic about prospects for Latin America,
especially Brazil. However, he is cautious about Asia, which in his view
offers less value. 'Malaysia is looking expensive, it's at the end of its
interest rate cycle and the next move is up,' he argues.
Companies from the more-established emerging markets
will also have to be more realistic about pricing because of the increased
competition for funds. Political events in the Middle East and South Africa
have turned the attention of international investors to markets in those
regions.
Mr Hampson says there is a growing interest in what he describes as
'near-emerging markets', such as Israel and South Africa, where investors
have very low portfolio weightings in relation to the developed nature of
their economies.
After years of obscurity, Israel is emerging as a serious candidate for
international investment now that the Arab boycott has been lifted. Mr Ron
Lubasch, the head of Lehman Brothers' recently-opened Tel Aviv office, says
investors are attracted by Israel's highly-developed infrastructure and
fast-growing economy. It is possible that Israel's credit rating will be
upgraded to A minus from triple-B plus in the near future, he suggests.
Bankers expect a series of international equity offerings from Israel over
the next year as the government seeks greater foreign participation in the
sale of its stakes in the country's leading companies. At present, only 2
per cent of the Israeli stock market is estimated to be owned by foreigners,
a significant proportion of which is made up of BZW Investment Management's
Israel Fund.
The Israeli government has appointed Wertheim Schroder, part of the UK
merchant bank and fund management group Schroders, to advise it on the sale
of shares in Israel Chemicals (ICL). The government plans to sell 32 per
cent of ICL, currently valued at around Dollars 850m, through an
international public offering and 15 per cent to a single investor or group
of private investors.
Morgan Stanley has been selected to advise on the international offering of
shares in Bezek, the telecommunications company. The government hopes to
sell 25 per cent of Bezek, which would lower its stake to 51 per cent. The
sale, which is likely to go ahead by May next year, could raise between
Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m.
Another candidate for privatisation is El Al, the state-owned airline. The
government, which intends to sell 51 per cent of the company through the Tel
Aviv stock exchange and through an international offering, has appointed BZW
to conduct a valuation of the airline.
El Al's privatisation is being held up by three problems: namely, the
government's desire to keep a golden stake to protect state interests; the
issue of the airline's Dollars 55m annual security costs, 80 per cent of
which are currently met by the government; and the fact that El Al is not
allowed to fly its aeroplanes on the Jewish Sabbath. Nevertheless, officials
say these issues should be resolved in time for El Al to be floated by
mid-1995.
In the meantime, bankers involved in these offerings are busy hiring staff
to provide much-needed research on Israeli equities. Although Israel has a
sophisticated broking community, the majority of the research is in Hebrew
and the stock market is still perceived to be driven by sentiment rather
than by fundamentals.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (7): Flags of inconvenience -
Competition flares in Europe's sea-lanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most international cargoes make part of their journey by sea but, unless
there is a dramatic sinking of a ferry or an oil tanker, seaborne shipping
suffers from a very low profile.
In recent months, however, a dispute over a rate and capacity sharing
agreement or 'conference' across the north Atlantic has focused attention on
the financial pressures afflicting parts of the shipping industry. The
controversy surrounding the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) has drawn the
European Commission, the shipping industry and large shippers into a bitter
dispute.
The TAA raises questions about the viability of long-distance, deep-sea
routes but the problems confronting short-sea shipping have also come under
serious consideration recently. The opportunities for taking consignments
off road and rail and transferring them to coastal and canal shipping are
being reviewed by the European commission.
Shipping owes its low profile in large measure to the shift of the industry
away from the traditional but now high-cost European seafaring nations to
the Third World and the Far East. With a few notable exceptions ownership
has moved to small one or-two vessel companies which sail under 'flags of
convenience' and employ non-European crews.
Despite these cost-saving measures, competition in many areas of the
shipping market has put fierce pressure on the operating margins of
shipowners. The traditional method of regulating competition has been the
shipping conference, an agreement between competing shipping companies to
set prices on a particular route.
The TAA was just such an agreement, put in place in September 1992 to stem
rising losses on the Europe-North America routes. It united 15 large
shipping lines accounting for 85 per cent of sailings on these routes and
included companies such as P&amp;O, Nedlloyd and Maersk.
The TAA succeeded in pushing up freight rates by as much as 100 per cent.
But it enraged many of the companies shipping their products across the
Atlantic and prompted the intervention of the European commission.
The commission took particular exception to the TAA extending its influence
over the land-based section of journeys - to and from the port - and to the
fact that it sought to control capacity as well as freight rates.
In July the members of the TAA put revised proposals to the commission aimed
at making the agreement more flexible and more acceptable to shippers but
there is no guarantee that these concessions go far enough. A response from
the commission is still awaited.
In its role as a defender of free trade and open competition the commission
has taken a tough line with the companies involved in the TAA. But within
the framework of its transport policies the commission is doing its best to
promote the shipping sector.
This reflects the importance of shipping to the international movement of
goods. More than 90 per cent of the European Union's trade with the rest of
the world uses sea transport. This amounts to 600m tonnes of the world's
total seaborne trade of 3.6bn tonnes.
The EU's international maritime trade is split roughly equally between
distant, deep-sea destinations and more 'local' ports of call in
Scandinavia, eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
Maritime transport also accounts for a large share - 35 per cent - of total
trade between the EU member states. Island nations such as the UK and
Ireland are understandably very dependent on seaborne transport but other
countries on the EU periphery such as Greece, Portugal and even Denmark move
many of their imports and exports by ship.
As part of its efforts to revitalise the European shipping fleet, the
commission is working on proposals for a European shipping register, Euros.
Under an early draft Euros would have still required officers and half the
crew to be European nationals but would have given income tax concessions to
the crews of Euros-flagged vessels.
The tax proposals ran into objections from the national finance ministries,
however, and a modified version of this plan is now under consideration.
A second strand in the commission's efforts to boost shipping can be found
in its proposals to improve the efficiency of ports within the EU. This
ports initiative forms part of a broader strategy to create strategic
networks of road, rail and air links.
Growing pressures on the road network have led to rising levels of
congestion and there is little likelihood that investment in roads alone can
solve the problem. The inability of road investment to keep up with demand
has led to higher energy consumption, more pollution and a greater number of
accidents, a commission report concluded.
Ports and maritime transport cause less damage to the environment and are
more energy efficient. New port infrastructure is normally less intrusive
than new road building while the energy consumption of a coastal tanker is
four times less per tonne/kilometre than road freight.
Under the commission's proposals, financial support would be available for
projects defined as being 'of common interest'. An initial trawl has thrown
up more than 110 possible projects including the deepening of the approach
channel to Esbjerg in Denmark, the construction of quays for a new container
terminal in Oslo and improved road connections for ports such as Ramsgate
and Southampton.
But for all the apparent financial and environmental advantages of ship
transport, it will still have a tough task in competing with road and rail
shipments. The de-regulation of the road haulage sector to allow cabotage,
the carriage of goods between destinations in another country, and the
construction of transport links such as the Channel tunnel and Oresund
tunnel/bridge between Denmark and Sweden increase the competitiveness of
land transport
'The critical success factors such as transit time, frequency of departure,
cost of transport and quality of service often do not measure up in
comparison with road and sometimes also rail transport,' according to a
recent study* by Niko Wijnolst, a Dutch academic.
The turnaround time of ships must be reduced dramatically and port and
stevedoring costs must be cut if shipborne transport is to become more
attractive. Wijnolst calls for the creation of port hopper services, fast
and frequent shipping links between European ports, to make maritime
transport more attractive.
Vessels would need to be equipped to load and unload their own cargoes,
dispensing with the delays and cost of shore-based systems. They would also
need flexible propulsion units and mooring systems to make them independent
of tugs and harbour pilots.
Such proposals would require a revolution in working practices in many
European ports and a rethink on the level of port dues levied, Wijnolst
concedes. Hopper services would also require government assistance.
But if these admittedly considerable obstacles could be overcome, maritime
transport could play an even greater role in moving goods.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (6): Warehouse revolution - A look at
the power of the supermarket chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The demands of the retail sector have done much to force the distribution
industry to become more sophisticated, and those demands are continuing to
dictate the pace of change in the industry in the 1990s.
Retailers, and especially UK food retailers, have realised that highly
efficient distribution systems are crucial to gaining a competitive edge,
and that they were paying too much for distribution in the past.
Distribution costs in the UK have come down from more than 10 per cent of
sales to about 4 per cent over the last 10 years.
Two important trends have dominated retail distribution, and facilitated
that improvement in cost ratios: centralisation, and contracting out of
distribution to third parties.
Retailers have largely abandoned deliveries by suppliers directly to stores,
in favour of deliveries to retailers' own regional warehouses, where goods
are sorted and loaded on to trucks for distribution to stores.
The shift has been dramatic. The Institute of Grocery Distribution found
that by 1992, on average, 83 per cent of goods were distributed centrally by
retail multiples.
The tendency towards centralisation continues, and within it other trends
can be discerned. One is a move away from different warehouses for different
categories of goods, towards composite centres handling all categories -
including ambient, chilled and frozen goods in food retailing.
Another is a move away from large networks of small warehouses to smaller
networks of ever larger depots.
Hillier Parker, the commercial property agent, predicts that demand for new,
larger warehouse facilities will increase. It says the average size of
retailers' warehouses is 304,000 square feet - twice that of manufacturers'.
The possibility of reducing costs through economies of scale is also
prompting smaller companies to look at sharing distribution facilities,
staff and transport fleets.
This is linked to the second important tendency, contracting out
distribution.
Sainsbury and Tesco, the UK's largest food retailers, now contract over half
their distribution, and Asda, the fourth-largest, more than 70 per cent.
Contracting out offers a number of advantages. It means contractors, rather
than retailers themselves, shoulder much of the considerable investment
burden. It also gives retailers access to specialist knowledge and
expertise, in a field where technological advances continue apace,
permitting - indeed necessitating - constant changes in operating methods.
The conventional wisdom has been that few companies would want to contract
out all their distribution. Few have so far done so, a notable exception
being Laura Ashley, the UK-based fashion and fabrics group which has brought
in Federal Express Business Logistics on a 10-year contract.
Most retailers were thought likely to want to retain control of at least
some of their distribution, and to be able to compare costs between in-house
and contractors' operations.
But Mr Robert Blyth, senior consultant with Kurt Salmon Associates, the
management consultants specialising in the soft goods industries, says
retailers are growing more comfortable with the idea of contracting out. He
suggests three key elements to success in third-party distribution
partnerships:
Retailers must retain internal, highly-competent personnel to direct their
supply chain strategy, even if operations are largely contracted out.
The third party must have highly professional people and adequate systems.
The correct balance between keeping costs down and achieving high standards
of service must be kept. Retailers are realising that the costs of daily
deliveries from regional warehouses may be high, but may be more than
outweighed by the benefits of achieving lower levels of goods out of stock,
and hence lower markdowns.
Mr Blyth suggests that to derive the maximum benefits from such
relationships requires a change in attitudes:
'The third party contractor must be seen as an important service supplier,
and treated that way. Close relationships between all three parties are the
key.'
Only through developing closer relationships can ways be found to lessen
stockholding, and so reduce costs, at all points of the supply chain. This
is the essence of efficient customer response, and quick response, the
buzzwords of retail logistics in the 1990s.
Quick response means retailers ordering precise quantities of product from
suppliers, based on the sales that have occurred within a specific time -
frequently, a single day. This allows stocks to be maintained at a
considerably lower level.
Spectrum Planning, the supply chain consultants, says retailers who have
embraced a quick response strategy have halved stock levels in the product
groups concerned. It says that extrapolating this to the whole fast-moving
consumer goods sector suggests the industry could achieve savings of about
Pounds 1bn a year.
However, quick response places great demands on distribution services and
product suppliers. To ensure product is always available, orders must be
fulfilled with 100 per cent accuracy in terms of quantity and timing.
In practical terms, this means retailers must share sales information with
their suppliers and logistics contractors, through electronic data
interchange (EDI). This is being hampered by at least two factors: the lack
of common international standards for EDI, making it difficult to link
together all elements of the supply chain, and the traditionally
'adversarial' relationship between retailers and suppliers.
However, some encouraging evidence was found in a recent survey of food
manufacturers by Food Industry News, sponsored by BRS and Exel Logistics,
and analysed by the University of Westminster's transport studies group.
Among food manufacturers, 80 per cent believed the quality of information
flows with their customers had improved over the past two years.
Some 40 per cent of respondents felt their operations were already highly
integrated with customers', and 67 per cent believed they would be by 1995;
more than half already had EDI links with customers, the figure rising to 90
per cent among larger companies.
A final trend for distribution specialists is likely to be towards a single
distribution company handling the entire supply chain from the raw materials
stage through to the retail outlet. This might entail, for example, one
logistics company transporting fabric from, say, China, to a factory, and
then transporting finished garments to the retailer's distribution centre,
and on to the stores.
Increasingly, logistics specialists will be expected to have international,
even global, reach - likely to lead to more international partnerships,
joint ventures and takeovers among logistics companies.
Distributors that are international, and offer most flexibility, are those
that will win the contracts as retailers themselves become more
international.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (6): Waiting for
better luck - Spain and Portugal have had recent setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hesitations over public offerings by the governments of Spain and Portugal
are understandable. When Endesa, Spain's big electrical utility, tapped the
markets in June and when Cimpor, Portugal's largest cement producer,
followed suit a month later, the results left much to be desired.
Both Spain and Portugal have lacked momentum over recent months and
certainly neither, though they have comparatively cheap markets in common,
seems set for an early recovery and turnaround.
'Spain has not got a stand-alone story,' says Ms Anna MacDonald of London's
Smith New Court. Much the same can be said for Portugal.
'Potential underwriters are telling companies thinking about offerings:
wait,' says Mr Juan Cueto of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. 'There have been
unhappy experiences recently.'
The Endesa offering, which was affected in subsequent months by the
sustained volatility of the Madrid market, is likely to delay a public
offering of Repsol, Spain's state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group,
until next year. Before the electrical utility came on offer, INH, the state
energy holding company, had planned to reduce its 41 per cent stake in
Repsol to around 20 per cent.
A final decision on the Repsol timing is expected by the end of this month.
The energy company is talking to the team that handled previous offerings -
Lazards, Goldman Sachs and Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - and the shared
view at present is that little is to be gained from an 'uphill' move on the
markets.
A second privatisation phase of Cimpor, ranging from 20 to 25 per cent of
the company and aimed at foreign investors, which had also been scheduled
for the coming months, is also likely to be pushed back until 1995. 'We'll
probably see the government going for controlled auctions because it won't
be able to rely on the market,' said a London-based merchant banker close to
the cement company.
Should there be an offering, it can be taken for granted that Cimpor will
seek to avoid the mistakes in July that led to a lukewarm response from
foreign investors. Chief among the errors was the failure to appoint a
global co-ordinator and the absence of any meaningful book building.
The lesson for the Portuguese authorities was that going to the
international markets without the appropriate technology is akin to shooting
oneself in the foot.
Applying these lessons will, nevertheless, require legis- lative changes as
well as an overhaul in the financial culture of those who take decisions in
Portugal's public companies.
Cimpor, which raised Es39.6bn (Dollars 241bn) in its disposal of 20 per cent
of the state-held equity, was in particular penalised by the legal rulings
that caused the Lisbon government to fix the offer price at a cabinet
meeting held a full two months before the cement company was on the market.
Between the price fixing and the subscription period, the Portuguese market
fell 15 per cent.
In this respect any legislative change will, at the very least, have to
reduce the government's role in an offer to that of establishing a price
range instead of a fixed figure. It would also help, as one aggrieved
underwriter in the Cimpor offering put it, 'if it were publicly announced
that there is a real interest in the foreign markets and in having foreign
institutions aboard.'
The Cimpor experience will probably be a salutary one as Lisbon prepares for
future privatisations and there will undoubtedly be global co-ordinators in
place should Portugal's telecommunications group and its electricity
generating company take the plunge and make offerings next year.
In Spain the problem is not one of expertise. Global offerings in partial
privatisation programmes have become very familiar, and profitable, to the
likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg. Nor is there any
difficulty about what is on offer; companies such as Endesa and Repsol can,
all things being equal, sell themselves without difficulty.
Nonetheless, the prospects are blurred by the overall market performance.
The Endesa offering in June, which reduced the state equity in the utility
by 9 per cent to 65 per cent, ended up raising only Pta 144bn (Dollars 106m)
against the Pta200bn that had been confidently expected when the disposal
was planned in February.
'We've had really bad luck with the markets over the past three months and
our subscription period closed on a particularly bad day for equities,' a
member of Endesa's treasury team said ruefully at the time.
Everything that has happened in the intervening months leads Repsol's
finance experts to fear the worst should they tap the markets before
Christmas. But Repsol does not need that risk factor, particularly as the
Spanish treasury, though concerned about the government deficit, is not
under such great pressure that it cannot afford to wait.
Instead, financial analysts are turning their attention to Telefonica,
Spain's 32 per cent government-owned telecommunications group, and in
particular to Tisa, the group's profitable international subsidiary which
has grown into the biggest foreign operator in the fast-growing Latin
American market.
The parent company is at present locked in negotiations with AT&amp;T and GTE,
which could lead to both US companies becoming Tisa shareholders as part of
an ever-growing expansion programme in the Hispanic world. To judge by
Tisa's expressed ambitions, once such a shareholding venture is sealed and
delivered, the next move will be to seek fresh capital on the international
markets.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (5): Germany starts
to open up - The international investor is at last being courted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest stage in the privatisation of Lufthansa, the German national
airline, is being welcomed by international bankers and investors as
evidence that they are finally being allowed to participate fully in one of
the world's richest but hitherto closed markets.
Germany's relatively small stock market and the intricate cross-holdings
between the country's companies have long prevented foreigners from building
up significant investments. As a result, the weighting of German equities in
many international portfolios is very low relative to the size of the German
economy.
But the ever-stronger need for capital by the German corporate sector as it
emerges from recession can no longer be met exclusively by the German state
and the country's powerful banks. In addition, domestic institutional
investors show no signs of making a radical departure from their traditional
preference to hold bonds, even in the wake of the poor performance of the
German government bond market this year which has seen yields on 10-year
paper rise to 7 1/2 per cent, the highest level since September 1992.
This scenario has prompted German companies and the government belatedly to
court the international investment community. The government is believed to
be keen to make the sale of its shares in Lufthansa an international event
and Dresdner Bank, which is co-ordinating the domestic and international
offerings, has appointed a large group of international banks to ensure a
wide placement of the shares.
The government intends to reduce its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent
to about 41 per cent by not participating in a forthcoming rights issue. The
3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to
investors in Germany and abroad, excluding the US.
Some foreign bankers have criticised the decision to exclude US investors
this time round, because their absence will dilute the international
importance of the transaction.
Lufthansa has decided not to place shares in the US under Rule 144A of the
US Securities Act, in order to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership
which could jeopardise its flag carrier status. US investors, however, are
likely to be included when the government disposes of the rest of its
shareholding, which is scheduled to take place before the end of 1995.
If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to
sell a further 2.1m existing shares which would reduce its stake in
Lufthansa to 36 per cent. Since Dresdner will be using the so-called
'book-building' process, the scale of the demand will be far easier to
judge.
Bookbuilding involves collecting investors' bids for the shares, thus
helping to establish the most appropriate selling price. By matching the
demand for and the supply of the shares on offer, bankers hope to avoid
excessive volatility in the shares when they start trading in the secondary
market. Bookbuilding also provides greater shareholder transparency which
Lufthansa currently lacks because its shares are in bearer rather than
registered form.
The timing of the sale coincides with a sharp turnaround in Lufthansa's
fortunes. This has been reflected in a doubling in its share price over the
past year. That has prompted some concern among investors that they will be
buying the shares at the top of the market and at a time when global
competition among airlines is becoming increasingly fierce.
The government is no doubt aware of these concerns but bankers believe that
the new shares will be priced at only a marginal discount to the prevailing
market price. However, since the government is keen for the Lufthansa sale
to be an international success, it may scale back the sale of its existing
shares in order not to flood the market.
Although the Lufthansa sale is only likely to raise just over DM1bn, it is
an important event because it is in effect the dry run for the long-awaited
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, Germany's telecommunications company.
Market valuations of the company range from DM60bn to DM100bn which suggest
that the sale of the first tranche of the shares could yield between DM15bn
and DM20bn. But investors are likely to have to wait until late 1995 or even
1996 before the shares come up for sale.
In the meantime, Germany's small, privately-owned companies are jumping on
the international bandwagon with enthusiasm. In September, Fliemann, a
fast-growing manufacturer and retailer of spectacles, raised just over
DM200m through the sale of non-voting preference shares to domestic and
international investors.
Around one-third of the shares went to international investors and BZW,
which was involved in arranging the offering with lead manager WestLB,
reported heavy demand as foreigners sought to gain an exposure to Germany's
buoyant retail sector.
Bankers believe that German companies have become far more comfortable with
the concept of making their shareholder base more international. Indeed,
some believe that foreigners are more likely to be long-term shareholders
than their domestic counterparts who are seen to be more speculative. This
more open attitude should lead to a greater volume of international equity
issuance from Germany.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (7): Nordic profile
raised - A look at the global impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several big privatisations and corporate share issues have been launched in
the Nordic region this year, many of them targeted not just at domestic
investors but at the global investment community. The process has helped to
raise the international profile of a number of the region's big companies -
some have used it as an opportunity to gain a listing overseas - and it has
further increased the levels of foreign ownership in Nordic stocks.
The relatively small size of the Nordic region's domestic markets is one
reason why most of the large share offerings involve a sizeable
international element. A good example was the Danish government's sale of
nearly 50 per cent of Tele Danmark for DKr19.5bn in April - the biggest
share offering in the region this year. Of the 63m shares on offer, only 18
per cent were sold in Denmark, while 41 per cent were placed in the US and
41 per cent in the rest of the world. Tele Danmark gained a simultaneous
listing in Copenhagen and New York in April and is now the second largest
group on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
Most of the region's big share issues in 1994 have been prompted by
government privatisation programmes, with Sweden, the region's largest
economy, proving the most active. In June the Swedish government sold a 45.8
per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals
companies with annual sales of SKr27bn. The issue, directed at both the
domestic and international markets, raised more than SKr9bn, leaving the
state with just 14 per cent of the capital and 11.7 per cent of the votes in
the company.
Pharmacia was the single largest sale in a privatisation programme which has
raised SKr23bn (Pounds 2bn) for the Swedish state since it was unveiled by
the centre-right government in 1991. Another big disposal came earlier this
year when the government raised SKr7.6bn from the sale of a 49 per cent
stake in AssiDoman, one of Europe's 10 largest forestry groups. The
government also sold a 24 per cent holding in OK Petroleum, the Nordic
region's biggest oil refiner, to a Saudi Arabian buyer in March.
Whether the Swedish privatisation process goes much further is unclear after
this week's general election, which returned the Social Democrats to power,
but as a minority government. The Social Democrats have in effect ruled out
a privatisation of Vattenfall, the power group, and have been ambiguous
about whether they will sell off Telia, the telecommunications concern. Both
these companies would have been on the centre-right government's
privatisation list.
However, there is a broad consensus behind plans to return Nordbanken to the
private sector in a sell-off which will probably take place next year.
Nordbanken collapsed into state arms under the weight of huge loan losses in
1992 and has since been merged with Gota Bank, which was also taken over by
the state, in preparation for the sale. The country's largest bank in terms
of market share, Nordbanken has made a controversial return to profit after
many of its problem loans were siphoned off into a separate entity.
In Norway, too, the process of returning state-owned banks to the private
sector has begun. Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two largest
banks, have carried out NKr2bn international share offerings in recent
months, reducing state ownership to 72.5 and 69 per cent respectively. The
government intends to reduce the state's holding in both banks to 50 per
cent by the end of 1997.
Finland also has a privatisation programme but has proceeded cautiously,
gradually widening ownership in companies rather than moving dramatically
below 51 per cent control. This year the state reduced its stake in
Outokumpu (mining), Valmet (paper machinery) and Rautaruukki (steel), and it
is lining up an initial public offering for Kemira, the state-owned
chemicals group, for the autumn or early 1995. Unusually, the proceeds from
the disposals are not being garnered by the state, but are being used to
strengthen the companies' own balance sheets.
Outside the privatisation sphere, there have also been some hefty share
offerings. Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, raised FM2.5bn
during the summer in the country's largest-ever international share issue.
The move, to support the group's fast-growing mobile phones business, was
accompanied by a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile in
Norway, Norsk Hydro, the energy and fertilisers group, raised NKr4.7bn
through a rights issue. Proceeds are to be used to reduce debt, finance
expansion and invest in new North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
The autumn agenda looks relatively quiet, possibly because of uncertainties
linked to EU referendums in Finland, Sweden and Norway. However, ISS, the
Danish industrial cleaning group, has announced plans to issue 3m shares on
the New York Stock Exchange, while in Sweden, Stadshypotek, the country's
largest mortgage credit institute, is to demutualise and issue SKr3bn worth
of new shares.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (5): UK security tightened -
Airfreighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New UK airfreight security measures are proving a headache for shippers,
forwarders and airlines, making their operations more complex and
potentially more expensive.
This is happening at a time when airfreight service operators are handling
higher cargo volumes as trade recovers from world-wide recession and when
the industry is meeting customers' demands for better quality services.
Under the UK security regulations introduced in June, forwarders have to
obtain a Department of Transport listing as a security-approved air cargo
agent. They also have to vet regular exporting customers for classification
as a 'known shipper'.
Shippers and forwarders who do not qualify on those counts are likely to
find their cargo subjected to much stricter security checks by the airlines,
with resulting delays.
So far, the regulations appear to have caused few serious problems. One
difficulty, though, centres on the apparent requirement for shippers to
enter separate security agreements with each forwarder used.
At the time of writing, forwarders were seeking a meeting with the
Department of Transport to clarify that issue. Companies freighting goods by
air are also still keeping a close watch on airline security screening
surcharges for cargo not originating from 'known' shippers.
Some airlines have already introduced such charges, typically involving a
minimum fee of Pounds 4 plus 2p per kilo above that minimum level, to cover
the cost of implementing new security systems and checks. Others, though,
are holding back until they see how the system settles down.
Meanwhile, the volume of freight is continuing to increase. The
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) says air cargo traffic
worldwide rose by around six per cent last year compared with a one per cent
growth in the number of passengers. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing is
predicting an average 6.5 per cent a year growth in world airfreight over
the next 20 years.
As a result of the present upturn, individual airlines are this year
hurriedly adding capacity on particularly busy cargo routes and adding new
cargo-handling facilities.
British Airways, for example, is considering further expansion of its
chartered freighter operations. Worldwide, BA currently operates freighter
flights on nearly 20 sectors a week, despite not actually owning any
all-cargo aircraft. Those services are in addition to the carrier's
large-scale global airfreight operations involving the use of bellyhold
space on its passenger aircraft.
BA is also planning to start main construction work on a new Pounds 150m
world cargocentre at London Heathrow in the first half of 1995. The facility
will be designed to handle up to 1m tonnes of cargo a year, twice the
capacity of the carrier's existing centre.
BA's annual cargo revenues for the year ending March 31, 1994, rose by over
16 per cent to Pounds 461m and volumes were up by 14 per cent to 607,000
tonnes. The improvement continued in the current year's first quarter: cargo
revenue for the three months to end-June was up 18 per cent to Pounds 130m,
with volumes up to 171,000 tonnes, 20 per cent more than the same period
last year.
The cargo business is also growing fast at British Midland, the UK-based
domestic and European regional airline, with volumes up 45 per cent so far
this year.
Nevertheless, shippers are still pressing for improved service levels. In
particular, they want more time-definite movements.
One of the big long-running complaints from shippers and their agents, the
forwarders, against the airlines is that cargo is often not flown as booked.
That occurs mainly because much of the world's airfreight is flown in the
bellyholds of scheduled airline passenger aircraft - a recent air cargo
industry survey commissioned by the Reed Travel Group found that 82 per cent
of airfreight is carried that way. Such cargo is sometimes offloaded from
the aircraft to accommodate unexpectedly high passenger loads and resulting
increased baggage. With shippers and their customers often running very
tight production/delivery schedules, the resulting delays can cause serious
problems.
This has helped international express companies or integrators such as DHL,
Federal Express, United Parcel Service (UPS) and TNT Express Worldwide, some
of which run their own aircraft and therefore have greater control of the
freight, to capture a lot of traditional airfreight traffic over the last
decade.
More recently, some of the leading forwarders have begin to think of
developing more time-definite services of their own. Danzas, the
Switzerland-based international forwarding and transport organisation, is
currently developing scheduled, door-to-door delivery services between
Europe, the Far East and North America under the product name Starconnect.
Like many other leading international airfreight/air forwarding companies it
is also focusing on the development of much more wide-ranging logistics
services.
Last year, for example, Air Express International bought an oceanfreight
service business called Votainer and is now planning to develop its
intra-European express system Pandalink into a global operation. It claims
its customers are increasingly demanding a broad range of logistics services
from one supplier and will take their business elsewhere if they do not get
it.
Mr David Beatson, president and chief executive officer of Emery Worldwide,
another leading international airfreight company, also makes the point that
simply moving freight is no longer good enough to meet shipper demands.
'Today, carriers like Emery must demonstrate how they can adapt and deploy
their resources to help customers shorten supply cycles and streamline
distribution networks so that costs are reduced and products arrive at the
ultimate customer faster and more efficiently than ever before,' he says.
In that context, the airfreight industry as a whole is stressing the further
development of electronic data interchange (EDI) and other computerised
information technology systems. Increasingly, the emphasis is on systems
which can communicate with a wide range of parties for functions such as the
booking of cargo and consignment tracking.
There is also an increasing tendency for airfreight service suppliers to
work openly with other operators, sometimes even potential rivals, to
produce the overall solution demanded by their customers.
UK-based forwarder MSAS Cargo International claims to be an example of that
trend. Says Mr Douglas Ash, chief executive: 'If the customer wants a
service which we can provide more easily by utilising one of the
integrators, then we will do that. And we won't hide the fact from the
customer - we will tell them it is the better way to service that particular
part of their business.'

Customers press for faster parcels delivery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parcels service operators initially made their mark during the 1980s by
developing a range of 'off the shelf' express delivery products.
In the UK, they introduced branded services providing delivery times ranging
from overnight to two or three days.
However, customers are now demanding greater flexibility from the operators.
Typical of this is the way Honda, the car, motor cycle and power equipment
manufacturer, uses NFC express delivery company Lynx to distribute parts
overnight to its 1,200 UK dealers.
The operation guarantees that 99 per cent of dealers' orders placed by 3.30
pm will be delivered by 10 o'clock the next morning. It entails collecting
parts by road from Honda's UK logistics centre in Swindon and using a
combination of road and air transport to bring in other parts from the
company's European centre at Ghent, Belgium.
Parts from both sources are then routed through the Lynx UK branch depot
network for final delivery to the dealers.
Flexibility is even more important on the international front where the
users are often large multinational corporations and the service operators
tend to be large express companies, or integrators as they are often known.
That point was highlighted at this year's World Express and Mail conference
in London by Mr John Parsons, director of logistics for Sony UK.
He said that when integrators talked about providing bespoke solutions, they
were relatively successful within very narrow confines. 'But if you, as a
customer, go along to an integrator and ask for a really flexible system you
basically get a situation where they really ask you to shoe-horn your system
into theirs rather than the other way round.'
Mr Parsons said the challenge for the integrators was to understand the
trade-off between costs and service and to be able to provide a menu of
tailored services at a cost which could be understood by the customer.
Mr Tony Walford, European logistics manager for United Parcel Service,
replied that in the last few years the integrated transport industry has
become very much more flexible in its core services. The difficulty, though,
was to reconcile the customer requirement for flexibility with the need to
keep down costs by using standardised systems.
Customers of the parcels service operators now increasingly regard next day
delivery as a standard service, certainly within the UK and Europe, and are
no longer prepared to pay premium prices for it.
At the same time, tough competition is continually forcing down parcel
service prices. Mr Paul Jackson, chief executive of freight and express
industry consultants Triangle Management Services, says that parcel volumes
are continuing to grow but that average yields in the market are down by an
average 25 per cent over the last three years. In that situation, 'the
low-cost operators are going to be the winners,' he says.
Another UK logistics industry consultancy, Davies &amp; Robson, says the rates
discount practices of many UK parcels carriers now 'often defy commercial
logic' and that this probably signals a further big shakeout in the
industry.
Mr Andrew Callaghan, managing director of Staffordshire-based UK domestic
parcels carrier ANC, says that an over-supply of service capacity during the
last couple of years has led to a number of key operators leaving the
industry. 'But while over-capacity still exists, such casualties have made
other parcel carriers more conscious of profit margins. This, combined with
the economic upturn, has led to a hardening of prices which have in some
cases risen during the last quarter.'
Other distributors believe that this could be avoided if general economic
conditions keep improving. ANC, for example, claims its parcels volumes are
currently 15 per cent up on last year.
However, other big changes are on the horizon - the privatisation of two
leading operators, Parcelforce and Red Star. News of the proposed
privatisation of Post Office parcels division Parcelforce has renewed
concern among rival private sector operators over possible increased
competition from the currently loss-making operation - for the year to March
31, Parcelforce recorded a loss of Pounds 19m. Private sector rival TNT
Express (UK) claims that Parcelforce enjoys a number of 'unfair' operational
and financial advantages 'merely because it is part of an organisation which
has a monopoly in the letter delivery market'.
To counter that advantage, TNT has renewed its earlier call for a duopoly
licence which would allow a private company to compete with existing postal
services.
Meanwhile, the much-delayed sale of British Rail parcels division Red Star
is scheduled to be completed by the end of September. The sameday/nextday
delivery business was first put up for sale last year but was withdrawn
after failing to attract any acceptable bids. Red Star then underwent a
substantial restructuring before being put back on the market.
In the international parcels service market, operators are increasingly
likely to work together to provide the wide-ranging global coverage demanded
by customers, particularly big multinational organisations.
Leading operators still like to talk about 'one stop shopping' - providing
every service their customers need - but in reality most are looking at
alliances and partnerships with other companies to achieve that coverage.
Internationally, for example, TNT Express Worldwide has a now
well-established joint venture with the five post offices belonging to GD
Net; DHL International has German airline Lufthansa and Japan Air Lines as
major shareholders; and Federal Express works with national express
companies as collection/delivery agents in Europe, for example, Securicor
Omega Express in the UK.
Similar trends are apparent among many European and domestic parcel service
operators. Securicor Omega Express has an alliance/partnership with German
operator Trans-o-flex covering most of the European Union, and Mayne
Nickless group company Parceline is in partnership with several leading
Continental parcels companies through an operation called Euroline.
Parceline has also just launched a new European overnight delivery service
called Skyline Next Day in conjunction with its parent company's worldwide
DPE (Document and Parcel Express) network. Elaborating on the reasons for
such moves, Triangle's Mr Jackson said that in the UK, for example, a recent
survey showed that 50-60 per cent of domestic parcels market customers had
European traffic.
So domestic operators needed to be able to offer European services - and the
answer for many was to work with overseas partners.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (2): It's still early days - A look at
the attractions of the Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel offers the prospect of much improved distribution links
between Britain and the Continent.
But delays to the build-up of full tunnel services and this summer's lengthy
strike of UK railway signalmen have done nothing to increase confidence in
the Pounds 11bn venture.
These two events have created doubts about the tunnel and reinforced more
general suspicions about the reliability of rail freight. They have set back
hopes of a speedy shift from road to rail.
In theory the opening of the 32-mile-long tunnel provides an unprecedented
opportunity for Britain's railway network. The 10,000 miles of UK track will
be directly joined to the mainland European network of 150,000 miles.
This transforms the economics of making rail shipments. With few freight
journeys financially viable over distances of less than 300 miles British
Rail has in the past been unable to compete with road transport.
Railfreight Distribution, the British Railways freight subsidiary
responsible for container shipments to the Continent, calculates that the
opening of the tunnel will increase freight volumes from 2m tonnes a year to
6.5m tonnes within two years. It expects freight shipments to reach 9m
tonnes by about 2000.
Railborne freight currently accounts for just 7 per cent of cross-Channel
shipments by container, closed rail waggon or lorry. At present cargoes go
by train ferry from Dover to Dunkirk or by lift-on lift-off container ship
between Harwich and Zeebrugge.
The Channel tunnel creates opportunities for the development of intermodal
services with consignments travelling much of the journey by rail, and road
used solely for delivery and collection from a rail terminal. The
environmental attractions of a shift to rail are attractive to politicians
and the general public. In addition to the long-distance freight services
which will use the tunnel, road hauliers will also be able to put their
trucks on Eurotunnel's freight shuttles running between Folkestone and
Calais. The freight shuttles should provide a marginal saving on the
ferries, though at times of bad weather or during the summer holiday peak
when passenger cars displace lorries on the ferries considerable savings may
be achieved.
But opinions within the distribution industry about the railways are mixed.
Rail has not endeared itself to hauliers and freight forwarders over the
years. Sudden price increases, unreliable deliveries and a cavalier attitude
to customers have made potential users wary of rail.
There are even doubts about the railways' ability to match the delivery
times provided by road transport. One survey showed that European intermodal
shipments travelled at an average of just 23 miles an hour while road
shipments moved at 43 miles an hour.
'Significant weaknesses exist in the organisation and marketing of rail
freight services through the tunnel,' said Mr Jim White, director general of
the British International Freight Association.
Mr White believes that the number of organisations involved in providing
services and marketing the tunnel has led to confusion among potential
users.
The tunnel is being promoted by Eurotunnel, which owns and provides services
through the tunnel; by Railfreight Distribution and by 'retailers' of cargo
space like ACI and CTL.
The tight security regime imposed on freight users of the tunnel is also a
concern to some. Groupage traffic, the combination of shipments from
different customers into one consignment, is of particular concern to
security officials. Registering shippers and agents on the model recently
adopted for air freight should be possible, Mr White said.
The faltering start to freight and passenger services through the tunnel has
damaged the credibility of its operations. The well-publicised breakdown of
a small number of the early freight trains in the tunnel - despite being
inevitable on a new service of this kind  - has increased concerns.
And while the tunnel's operations have not been directly affected by the
signalmen's strike, the dispute has emphasised the vulnerability of the
railway to industrial action.
Despite these fears, considerable sums of money are being invested in rail
freight terminals and in rolling stock to provide through links.
Railfreight Distribution will operate a network of seven freight terminals
including London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow while private investors
are creating terminals in Daventry, Doncaster and elsewhere.
These terminals will act as collection points for containers and swapbodies
 -truck trailers without the wheels. Plans are also afoot to create a
'piggyback' service which would transport complete lorry trailers, including
wheels, on special flat-bed rail waggons.
The Piggyback Consortium, grouping rail companies, local authorities and
transport organisations, has calculated that raising bridges and tunnels to
take the higher waggon loads on a route to the north west of England and to
Scotland would cost just Pounds 70m, much less than previous estimates.
In August the consortium invited rolling stock manufacturers to quote for
the supply of a fleet of flat-bed waggons.
It is on the long distance routes, from the north of England and Scotland to
northern Italy and Germany that big time savings can be made, according to
the supporters of intermodal transport.
London to Milan should take 31 hours and Glasgow to Basle 34 hours.
Birmingham to Vienna should be a 37 hour journey and Manchester to Mannheim
24 hours. Delivery and collection times, by road, will need to be added to
these terminal-to-terminal times, however.
If the tunnel can provide a regular, reliable service, guaranteed delivery
times could prove invaluable to companies supplying customers or field
engineers with components from a central European warehouse.
Companies could push back the cut-off point for orders for next-day delivery
of spare parts from, say, 4pm to 5pm and still get the order there on time.
Food retailers shipping chilled foods through the tunnel by a combination of
road and rail could gain an extra 12 to 48 hours longer on the supermarket
shelf, said Mr Pat Lee, development director of Wincanton, a food
distribution specialist.
'The speed of movement will allow an honest claim that the fruit, say, was
only picked the day before,' he added. Intermodal transport through the
tunnel should avoid traffic jams, ferry cancellations in rough weather and
continental bans on long distance lorry journeys at weekends and on public
holidays.
The tunnel will be judged on whether it can save the distribution industry
and its customers time and money. But four months after its official opening
the tunnel still has a long way to go to demonstrate that it can do either.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (3): Road-ways to the future - Europe
aims at a vast integrated network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the huge sums which have been invested in Europe's roads and
railways, the continent's transport networks remain fragmented.
This, at least, is the view of the European Commission, which has been
refining its transport policy over the past four years.
It is now working on ambitious plans to upgrade the continent's transport
infrastructure. Its programme of trans-European networks envisages the
spending of Ecu220bn over the next 15 years though it is not yet clear where
much of this money will come from.
The commission's plans involve nothing less than the creation of an
integrated transport system including road, rail, air and inland and coastal
shipping. A parallel programme, costing a further Ecu180bn, is intended to
improve telecommunications and energy networks.
Even governments such as the British, which do not hold with integrated
transport planning on a national basis, are joining in. The spur is the
prospect of community funds to help finance domestic programmes.
It remains to be seen whether the funds can be found to carry out the
improvements planned. But if the commission's programme is pushed through it
should produce considerable benefits for the distribution industry.
The aim of the transport programme is to make Europe more competitive and
provide the physical means for the free movement of goods, services and
people promised by the creation of the single European market in 1993.
Transport networks have in the past been designed largely to meet national
needs, leaving gaps and bottlenecks between countries.
Rail transport is made unnecessarily complicated by differing track and
loading gauges and by incompatible power and signalling systems. The
Eurostar trains which will carry passengers through the Channel tunnel have
been designed to take account of three different electricity networks and
four signalling systems (including the one in the tunnel itself).
Governments set different rules for combined transport operations while the
inland waterway system lacks cohesion. In the air, traffic management and
control systems are splintered and Europe has no fewer than 42 air traffic
control centres.
At the same time, transport systems differ in quality and availability
within the 12 European Union members, according to Mr Jurgen Erdmenger, a
director of the commission's transport directorate, DG7.
Poorer countries on the periphery such as Greece and Portugal are further
isolated by a shortage of good transport links.
Closer to the geographical centre of Europe, transport routes such as the
Rhine-Rhone corridor, rail transit across London and Paris, and air traffic
paths in north-west Europe are congested.
Although large sums have been spent on transport projects over the years,
transport's share of national budgets has been falling. Transport accounted
for 1.5 per cent of the European Union's combined gross domestic product in
1975 but is now down to about 0.8 per cent.
The picture is further complicated by the imbalance between the different
means of transport. The rapid growth of road transport, in particular, has
led to a decline in the use of other networks, notably rail, increasing
congestion and damage to the environment.
Freight shipments have increased by half over the past 20 years and road
transport now accounts for 70 per cent of goods transported. Rail and barge
traffic has declined in relative terms. Passenger travel, meanwhile, has
increased by 85 per cent, mostly in the form of private car journeys, which
account for 79 per cent of all travel.
At present European governments spend 66 per cent of their transport budgets
on roads, 23 per cent on rail, 6 per cent on airports and 5 per cent on
canals and ports.
The trans-European network programme, in contrast, envisages spending 30 per
cent of its money on roads, 60 per cent on rail and 5 per cent on inland
waterways.
In detail, the programme involves:
the designation of a rail network of 70,000 kilometres including 23,000 km
of extensions and new lines for high-speed trains and 23,000 kms largely
devoted to freight/combined transport.
the creation of a 58,000 km road network including 15,000 km of new or
improved roads. Roads would be of a minimum twin two-lane standard but would
not have to be motorways.
improvements to trans-shipment terminals for combined road-rail transport
and agreement on a uniform loading gauge for intermodal rail shipments.
filling in gaps in the canal network and improving seaports to increase
waterborne traffic.
improvements to airports and their connections with other forms of
transport. The establishment of an integrated air traffic management system.
Many of these improvements will have to be funded from the transport budgets
of individual countries. But the European Commission believes community
funds, European Investment Bank money and private sector finance can also be
employed.
A progress report on the trans-European networks programme is to be made to
the European Council when it meets in Essen, Germany in December.
The Commission's prime concern is links within the EU but it has also given
thought to connections with the countries of central and eastern Europe.
East-west transport links were neglected during the Cold War but must now be
improved.
Several projects are currently under way in eastern Europe with the help of
funds from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
They include a new motorway linking Budapest in Hungary with Vienna, Austria
and Bratislava in the Slovak Republic and the upgrading of nearly 600 kms of
the Belarus section of the Berlin-Moscow highway. The Slovenian railway
network is also being improved.
Important though the physical links between the countries of Europe are
there are other equally powerful though less visible barriers. The
complexity of trade documentation puts a considerable cost on business. A
development team is currently working on a project codenamed Bolero to
create an electronic bill of lading. This should create a faster, more
secure way of sending shipping documents.
Projects such as these are drawing the countries of Europe closer together.
At the same time transport demand from both the private and commercial
sectors is increasing inexorably.
It will not be easy to develop transport networks which can meet this demand
without imposing considerable strains on the environment.
But the European Union is convinced that unplanned growth would prove even
more damaging.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (4): Slowdown after
hectic pace - A look at changing market fortunes in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when Paris brokers were wont to grumble and groan about the
dearth of equity coming on the French stock market: in fact, it was regarded
as one of the main reasons for the relatively immature state of equity
trading in France.
Times change. The French market has been positively saturated with new
issues for most of this year, thanks to the combination of the govern-
ment's privatisation prog- ramme with a series of private sector flotations
and a stream of capital raising exercises from existing publicly-quoted
companies.
'This year will go down in French market history as by far and away the
biggest for new issues of all kinds,' says Mr David Harrington, French
market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'The market has been absolutely
sozzled with new equity.'
However, most of the new issues were concentrated in the opening months of
the year. The pace of activity declined during the seasonal lull of the
summer holiday and has picked up slowly this autumn. There has been a
significant reduction in the volume of new equity coming on to the market in
the second half of 1994 compared with the first. Does this mean that the
Paris brokers will soon be grumbling about a shortage of new issues again?
The reasons for the slow- down are easy to see. The frenetic pace of
activity during the first half was triggered primarily by the extremely
buoyant state of the stock market in the opening weeks of the year. The
CAC-40 Index raced ahead at the beginning of 1994 to reach an historic peak
of 2360.98 on February 2.
The index then fell steadily until early June when it dipped below the
psychologically important 2000. It has hovered around that level ever since.
The French economy is certainly not to blame for the market's bearish mood.
Insee, the state statistics institute, has since early spring been churning
out some remarkably reassuring monthly statistics on almost every area of
the economy, from industrial production to employment.
But the brighter economic outlook has failed to counter the negative impact
of the weak bond market. Concern about the volatility of the US economy,
fears of rising interest rates and nervousness about Germany's money sup-
ply figures have all taken a toll on bonds and then on equities.
However the downward trend in the stock market in February encouraged,
rather than discouraged, the influx of new equity, at least for a while. The
big issues of the early months of the year - notably the sale of the state's
FFr35bn stake in the Elf Aquitaine oil group - were fuelled by the rising
market. The next wave of issues, such as March's FFr3.96bn offer from the
Peugeot motor group and FFr1.9bn issue from the Axa insurance concern, were
characterised by concern that, if the market was turning bearish, these
companies should raise money sooner rather than later.
Some FFr108bn of new equity arrived on the French stock market in the first
six months of this year. 'It's a massive amount of new stock,' says James
Capel's Mr Harrington.
'The typical value of new issues over the past few years has been FFr35bn to
FFr40bn. You only realise how extraordinary the level of activity has been
in 1994 if you think that more money was raised in the first half than in
the whole of 1993, which was itself a record with FFr89.5bn.'
The pace of new issues has since slowed down. The economic outlook is still
improving. Even the recent increase in bank base rates (at a time when the
Bank of France has refused to raise rates to stay in line with Germany's
Bundesbank) did little to dampen spirits. Mr Paul O'Brien, chief French
economist at JP Morgan in Paris, concluded that recovery was 'well-enough
established' for the base rate rise to have no more than a 'small' impact on
the economy.
However, the forthcoming presidential elections, officially set for next
spring unless the ill-health of the incumbent, Mr Francois Mitterrand,
neces- sitates an earlier vote, have cast a cloud of uncertainty over both
currency and equity markets. Societe Generale recently concluded that
political uncertainty was likely to counter any imminent improvement in the
bond market.
Analysts suspect that, at best, there will only be a modest rally in the
French stock market during the closing months of the year. The consensus is
that the CAC-40 index will be around 2150 at the end of the year.
The rate of new issues is starting to perk up again. M6, the television
station, is about to commence its flotation. Christian Dior, the fashion
house, recently launched a convertible issue. Moreover, the government is
about to begin the next phase of its privatisation programme, which was
temporarily put on ice after the Elf issue and the subsequent sale of the
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group.
Mr Balladur and his ministers spent the summer deciding whether the
candidate for the next sale would be the Renault motor group or the
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance concern. Renault has won and
the Paris market is now preparing for the flotation of a large minority
stake by the government.
Yet AGF is still waiting in the wings as a future privatisation prospect,
with a possible sale pencilled in for early next year, as are the Usinor
Sacilor steel group and Bull, the computer company.
Unless the Paris stock market takes a turn for the worse, the flow of new
equity in France seems set to be fairly high in 1995, if not quite as high
as in this record year.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (3): The strange
effect of elections in Italy - First a surge, then the market slips back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elections do strange things to equity markets, and Italy in 1994 has proved
no exception to this rule.
Immediately after the victory of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance
in March, the Italian stock market surged ahead on the strength of bold
campaign promises to re-energise the Italian economy and press forward with
the privatisation programme launched by previous technocratic governments.
The Comit index of principal stocks rose from just under 700 to more than
800 by the beginning of May. But concern about the implementation of those
promises and the coherence of the Berlusconi coalition has taken its toll on
financial markets. By mid- September the Comit index was back below 670.
Companies and the government initially hurried to take advantage of the
favourable conditions to raise capital. Since January this year, rights
issues and privatisations in Italy have raised nearly L25,000bn, of which
nearly L10,000bn is represented by state sell-offs.
Unfortunately for those planning equity offerings, there was a vertiginous
gap between inspiration and execution, and certain companies and their
advisers found themselves in the painful position of having to straddle that
gap. Even as company executives were tiring themselves out on international
road shows to promote their offers, the market was undermining their best
hopes about pricing.
Two of the biggest international issues planned this year - a L1,500bn offer
of shares and warrants by Medio- banca, the merchant bank, and the L1,650bn
share issue by Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank - were postponed at the
last minute when market cond- itions turned against them.
Those which went ahead were also punished. The privatisation of Ina, the
state-owned insurer, raised more than L4,800bn for the Italian Treasury in
June, but when its shares began trading they rarely rose above the issue
price of L2,400, and were less than L2,250 by mid-September.
Iri, the state holding company, successfully sold its remaining 54 per cent
stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) in March with a L2,900bn
international offer, but the bank disappointed the market less than three
months later when it announced plans to raise more than L2,300bn of extra
capital through a discounted rights issue. The first L1,575bn tranche of
this issue has been successfully completed, judging from indications as this
survey was going to press, but the shares were trading this month at around
L3,600 compared with L5,341 before the intention to raise capital was
revealed.
Analysts are careful to point out, however, that companies such as
Mediobanca and Cariplo did not need to raise capital. Mediobanca's issue of
shares, for example, was partly aimed at diluting the 50 per cent holding of
the bank's traditional shareholders to about 40.6 per cent, thus widening
the ownership of its shares.
In addition, a distinction should be made between international and
institutional demand for these issues, and domestic public demand. In recent
months, there have been definite signs of issue fatigue among the Italian
public, but international investors - some of whom wanted to boost their
exposure to Italian equities - remain broadly receptive to big issues.
Mr Vittorio Pignatti- Morano of Lehman Brothers in Milan - joint global
co-ordinator of the BCI issue - says there is always the option of lowering
the price or scaling down the amount of shares to entice the institutional
investor to buy. 'The real problem is the public offer for sale,' he says.
'They either buy or they don't buy, and the retail banks (which help market
the public share offer) are still learning.'
Mr Pignatti-Morano points out, for example, that when public demand turned
out to be lower than expected for another issue co-ordinated by Lehman - the
L130bn international offer of shares in Finanza &amp; Futuro, a financial
services company - the company simply asked Consob, Italy's stock market
watchdog, if it could restructure the deal so that more shares went to
international institutions.
However, the Berlusconi government is still cautious about forthcoming priv-
atisations, which should include the sale of shares in Enel, the electricity
generator; Stet, the telecommunications holding company; and Eni, the oil,
gas and chemicals holding company. Not only are these the largest of the
state-owned companies being considered for sale, they are also among the
most complex and politically the most sensitive.
For example, recent ministerial statements have clearly pushed Enel to the
front of the queue for privatisation.
But before such a move can be made, Mr Vito Gnutti, the industry minister,
and his colleagues must win political consensus about how to execute such a
sale (for example, whether the different functions of the company should be
split up to be sold separately) and what sort of regulatory authority should
supervise the electricity sector.
In the meantime, the government may learn from some of the setbacks of the
past few months. Mr Berlus- coni is acutely sensitive to the international
judgment of his administration, particularly in economic matters. Analysts
hope and believe that he will think twice before attempting to foist
privatised equity on foreign institutions at inflated prices.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (2): The birds that
are worth shooting - New issues in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European governments and companies hoping to tap the international equity
market this autumn would do well to take a crash course in grouse-shooting
to come to grips with the current mood among potential buyers of their
shares.
Whereas last year, the bullish background of falling interest rates enabled
investors to make money by subscribing to issues on a fairly indiscriminate
basis, the more difficult investment climate this year and the heavy supply
of equity issuance which is likely to emerge in the coming months have made
them far more selective.
'The shooting season has started, but this time the strategy is not to shoot
into the covey of grouse but to target one particular bird,' says Mr
Ludovico del Balzo, head of international equity capital markets at Lehman
Brothers.
His advice to issuers is to focus on tactics and strategy when it comes to
preparing their offering. 'Issues need to be well-priced and
well-conceived,' Mr del Balzo says.
In general, bankers are confident that realistically-priced issues will meet
strong demand from international investors who, they say, have returned from
their summer holidays with a positive outlook on the markets. As a result,
they will be looking for the right investment opportunities to help reduce
the high cash portions in their portfolios which are believed to be running
at close to or above their limits.
Mr Jerker Johansson, head of European equity capital markets at Morgan
Stanley, detects a desire among investors to increase their exposure to
cyclical companies which they believe are most likely to benefit from
economic recovery. 'Cyclical companies are a large component in Europe,' he
says. He adds that there is also a strong interest in telecom stocks,
providing the pricing is reasonable.
With supply likely to outweigh demand, pricing and the company itself are
set to be the key issues this autumn and early next year, not the fact that
a privatisation programme is under way.
Ms Lorna Harnby, a European fund manager at Fleming Investment Management,
says that her strategy will be to look at each issue on its individual
merits.
'Just because it's a privatisation issue is not a good enough justification
for investment,' she points out. In her view, investors are suffering from
'privatisation malaise. These issues are not a one-way ticket to make money
and, if says. you look at the history of continental privatisation, that
view has been vindicated.'
Another reason for what she describes as her 'healthy scepticism' is that
the forthcoming flood of privatisation issues across Europe is not
accompanied by a strong equity culture or a strong ideological reason.
'There is less incentive to make sure that the small investor does well . .
. one reason is that the governments need money to fund their huge budget
deficits,' she says.
Evidence of a strong economic recovery in Germany has provided the
government with a favourable backdrop to the latest stage of its
privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline. Although the company has
seen a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes over the last two years as a
result of extensive restructuring, some analysts believe that its earnings
will receive a further boost from a buoyant domestic market.
By not participating in Lufthansa's capital increase which is currently
under way, the government will reduce its stake from 51.4 per cent to about
41 per cent by offering 3.9m shares to investors. The government also hopes
to sell a further 2.1m existing shares, thereby reducing its stake further
to around 36 per cent.
The government has placed considerable importance on involving international
investors in the Lufthansa offering so as to gain their support for the
planned privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the country's telephone monopoly.
The initial privatisation should raise DM10bn to DM20bn, which could not be
absorbed by domestic investors alone.
Bankers have criticised Lufthansa's decision to exclude US investors from
its offering, since by so doing it has cut out the single most important
source of equity capital in the world. However, US investors are expected to
be invited to next year's sale of shares in Lufthansa and the Deutsche
Telekom offering.
The Deutsche Telekom share sale is unlikely to occur before 1996 but
investors wanting exposure to the sector will be able to choose from a
variety of issues before then. The Greek government is seeking to raise
Dollars 1bn from the sale of 25 per cent of shares in OTE, the Greek
telecoms monopoly. It hopes to sell 75 per cent of the shares abroad. The
offer should take place before the end of the year.
The Portuguese government also plans to sell off 25 per cent of the
country's telecom company early next year. The transaction could run into
several hundred million dollars, bankers say. This offering could well
coincide with the next stage in the privatisation of Italy's telecoms
holding company, Stet.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (1): Relentless drive to reduce costs -
Big retailers are increasingly contracting out their supply operations. But
most manufacturers prefer to move their own goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Logistics is the currently fashionable term for an industry which started
out as haulage and warehousing, moved on briefly to become 'distribution',
and then settled on a title borrowed from the field of military science.
In practice, logistics is a delivery truck calling every 15 to 20 minutes at
Marks &amp; Spencer's London Marble Arch store to top up the racks of clothing.
It is a Leicester warehouse geared up to overnight delivery of Land-Rover
spares and to a two-hour turnaround time for emergency orders for tractor
parts for Massey Ferguson.
But this is only the most visible part of the logistics industry, the
contracted-out part of the business when manufacturers hand over their
delivery problems to an outside professional.
In-house logistics still dwarfs the contracted-out sector despite the move
by a growing number of multinational companies to using outside suppliers.
For many companies bringing in components and making deliveries to customers
is still too crucial a part of their business to entrust to others.
The challenge to the logistics professionals is to persuade manufacturing
industry that this is a business which it can, with profit, hand over to
somebody else. Retailers and parts of the consumer sectors have already been
convinced but broad swathes of industry still remain to be converted.
'The industrial market is growing but it is not as advanced as the retail
sector,' commented Mr Chris Masters, chief executive of Christian Salvesen,
a UK logistics company and provider of distribution services for M&amp;S.
The logistics sector also faces an enormous problem in bridging the gap
between industry best practice and the average performer. Many companies are
poor at measuring the efficiency of their internal logistics operations. Yet
they are also frequently disappointed by their experience of contracting
them out to a third party, a number of recent surveys have shown.
Less than half of large UK companies have a logistics strategy or know their
logistics costs, according to a study carried out by Andersen Consulting and
the Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
Forty per cent of UK companies which had contracted out their logistics were
dissatisfied with the way their affairs were handled and felt there were
insufficient controls, a survey by PE Consulting and the Institute of
Logistics found.
'Companies do not do enough to analyse their logistics,' said Mr David
Ecklund, European commercial director of Caterpillar Logistics Services
(CLS), an offshoot of the US manufacturer of earth-moving equipment and
owner of the Leicester warehouse. 'For something with so much importance for
customer satisfaction that is worrying.'
Why do so many companies which contract out their logistics feel
dissatisfied? They often fail to appreciate that they must still work
closely with their logistics supplier, sharing management information and
even integrating staff, said Mr John Brinkhurst, CLS business development
manager.
The scope of the contract and the services to be provided must be defined in
detail and performance standards should be set, he warns.
Modern commercial logistics is a combination of three elements. Its
traditional components are haulage and warehousing allied to a more recent
arrival, information technology.
Computers allow a company to locate a product in its warehouse, to devise a
delivery schedule which makes the most efficient use of its vehicle fleet,
and to track a consignment on its way to its final destination. Managing the
supply chain can lead to considerable reductions in the amounts of stock
which have to be held.
'We have been recruiting large numbers of information systems people to
develop bespoke systems for our clients,' said Mr Martyn Pellew, marketing
director for Exel Logistics, a UK-based company.
Logistics professionals believe that the commercial pressure of increasingly
competitive international markets is working in their favour.
In Europe, the creation of the single European market is drawing in Japanese
and US companies keen to exploit the reduction of trade barriers and forcing
local companies to rethink their strategies. Globally, the shortening of
product life-cycles and increasing consumer pressure for quality and low
prices is forcing manufacturers and retailers to redouble their efforts to
cut costs.
Companies are being forced to concentrate on what they do best and farm out
the non-essentials to outside suppliers. Employing a third party logistics
company removes the need to operate a vehicle fleet, to acquire and maintain
warehouse space, and to manage the intricacies of world-wide distribution.
The sums which industry spends on logistics-related activities are
staggering, though only a small percentage is currently handled by outside
suppliers. A survey by the Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation
estimated the size of the UK market at just over Pounds 100bn, the European
market at Pounds 570bn and the world market at Pounds 2,500bn.
It arrived at these figures by combining the present spend of businesses on
warehousing, holding stock, transport, administration and packaging.
Statistics on the size of the market which might realistically be available
to the logistics professionals are not readily available, however.
One of the main concerns facing European companies in particular is how to
handle their distribution activities throughout the continent.
Companies are realising that they hold too much inventory at too many
locations across Europe and are moving from, say, 15 distribution points to
just four or five regional centres, according to Prof. James Cooper,
director of the Cranfield logistics centre.
'Yet this transition is easier said than done. Sales and marketing managers
may be uncomfortable with the prospect of sourcing products from different
countries and having to make delivery arrangements with associates who speak
another language.'
Companies which overcome these hurdles are able to make significant savings.
Nike, the US manufacturer of trainers and sportswear, is replacing more than
20 national and local warehouses with a new European distribution centre in
Belgium following a similar move to centralise its US activities at a single
'hub' in Memphis a few years ago.
Concentrating all of a company's delivery activities in one centre not only
reduces the levels of stock which have to be held. It means that a wider
range of stock is available to customers and allows the distribution centre
to add extra services.
Electronic products such as computers can be customised at the last moment
depending on the national market for which they are destined or the demands
of the individual customer. Exel says its book distribution arm selects and
packs books for customers, sends out invoices and collects payments for
publishers.
Suppliers to the automotive industry add value to the service they provide
by collecting components from suppliers and delivering them on to the final
assembly plant according to a schedule which meets the needs of the assembly
line.
Not satisfied with the progress which has already been made to reduce stocks
and squeeze waste out of the supply chain, the logistics companies and their
clients are seeking even further savings. The most ambitious attempts are by
some Japanese automobile manufacturers to create an international stock-free
delivery chain.
Being willing to agree to deliveries of essential components from another
country straight into the assembly linewithout the comfort of a buffer stock
requires cool nerves. But this is the way that industry is moving, said Mr
Pellew.
On a more local basis the logistics industry is looking hard at the concept
of 'cross-docking'. This requires manufacturers to supply yoghurt, washing
powder or motor components to the distribution warehouse just in time for
them to be combined - 'consolidated' - with other products destined for the
same customer and shipped out immediately. The aim is to reduce inventory at
the distribution centre.
This pushes responsibility for matching production runs to customer demand
back to the manufacturer. A survey by Food Industry News showed that in the
food sector at least, manufacturers appeared confident they could handle
these pressures without any increase in the size of their own stocks.
But companies cannot afford to relax. 'There is a massive drive to take
costs out of the system,' said Mr Masters. 'The whole logistics market place
is becoming more complex and more demanding.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (1): It's no longer
a seller's market - Though equity prices have weakened this year, the flow
of global issues has held up. But is the heavy autumn schedule too much?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in the international equities market has held up surprisingly well
this year, given the adverse market conditions which have undermined share
offerings.
Despite the reversal of sentiment in the world's financial markets triggered
by the rise in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate in February,
international syndicated equity offerings launched in the first half of 1994
totalled Dollars 32bn, according to Euromoney, compared with Dollars 38bn
for the whole of 1993. (Figures include all international tranches of equity
offerings but exclude funds, preference shares, convertible bonds and bonds
with equity warrants).
However, the raw numbers do not fully reflect the reality of the
international equities market this year. The fact is that offerings have
become much harder to place, and a large number of deals have had to be
postponed, cancelled, cut in size, or have their pricings adjusted to make
them more attractive to investors.
The heavy flow of new issues in the first half of the year, despite the poor
performance of underlying stock markets, created severe indigestion in the
new issues market. A lull in activity during the summer months, and a
recovery in some stock markets, has helped the new issues market regain some
of its composure, but there are still concerns that the heavy schedule of
offerings for the autumn will be hard to absorb.
'The buyers are coming back and some deals are going well, but there is
nervousness about the volume that is waiting to come crashing down,' says Mr
Amir Eilon, a managing director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Investors have become more choosy about companies and pricing levels they
will accept. In the bull market of the early 1990s, it was a seller's
market. Fund managers had only recently woken to the attractions of
diversifying their assets and were hungry for stocks from new markets to
which they had little exposure. The partial removal of restrictions on share
ownership in emerging markets encouraged a feeding frenzy, often with little
heed to the fundamentals of the companies involved.
The hardening of attitudes this year was partly spurred by the poor
performance of some deals such as Ina, the Italian insurance company, and
Austria's Mayr-Melnhof. However, the change of sentiment has been felt
across a range of markets and sectors and cannot be pinned to any one deal,
according to investment bankers.
'Investors are still there for good specialist stories, but they are staying
away from overpriced deals,' says Mr John St John, a director of Kleinwort
Benson.
Those issuers unwilling to cut pricings to suit investors have in some cases
had to shelve offerings. Among notable deals indefinitely postponed this
year were Italian savings bank Cariplo's L1,650bn offering and a planned
Dollars 1bn issue for Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the telecommunications monopoly,
by the Indian government, which would not cut a price thought too high by
fund managers.
Other ambitious offerings have had to be scaled back. For example, Liberty
Life, the South African insurance group, had to cut its planned Dollars 500m
global convertible bond offering to Dollars 300m, partly because of jitters
caused by the resignation of the finance minister shortly after the
elections.
Smaller deals have also suffered. For example, Ayala Land of the Philippines
recently pulled a planned Dollars 100m offering of convertible bonds via
Morgan Stanley. It was the company's second attempt to tap the market,
having previously failed to bring an offering of global depositary receipts
(GDRs).
Although the nature of the international equities market is that offerings
are distributed among a wide range of investors, two groups of investors -
in the US and the UK - have played a pivotal role in the market's
development. The appetite of investors in the US market has given US houses
with an international presence and domestic distribution a particularly
strong platform for international equities business in recent years.
However, as the turn in sentiment hit the US market first, US investors have
proved particularly selective. Arguably, domestic US deals have suffered
most. But there has also been a sharp decline in US demand for international
offerings. For example, the French privatisation issue for UAP, the
insurance company, suffered from poor US take-up.
The UK market has also been an important source of funds for the
international equities market. According to estimates by Kleinwort Benson,
the broking house, about Pounds 9bn of the Pounds 52bn of cash flow
generated by UK institutions this year is likely to be dedicated to foreign
equities - a decline from last year's level of Pounds 10bn or 20 per cent.
That percentage, after rising steadily for a number of years, appears to
have plateaued out.
There has also been a shift of focus from the regional to the sectoral,
which originated among US institutional investors. Historically, fund
managers made decisions on asset allocation on a country-by-country, or
region-by-region basis. But, as the understanding of the differences between
regions has become more sophisticated - and as differences in countries'
practices have started to be ironed out - more fund managers have looked at
industry sectors, such as telecommunications, on a global basis. The result
is a keener focus on the value offered by particular companies within their
industry.
This year, investment bankers have been spending a lot of time on the phone
to finance directors, explaining why deals they have been mandated to
arrange should be put on hold. However, some underwriters have been
criticised for promising more than they can deliver to win mandates. But for
most companies the fear of a failed issue, or the unwillingness to sell
assets cheaply, overrides the need for financing.
The exceptions are the sizeable number of European governments which need to
raise funds through privatisations to finance deficits, and cannot afford to
wait. These governments are more likely than companies to accept reduced
profits from the sale of shares.
However, the privatisation free-for-all has exacerbated the problems caused
by market conditions. In the early years of privatisations, governments
operated an unofficial queueing system, whereby they timed their large
offerings to avoid a surplus of deals at any one time. Governments may react
by skewing placement of privatisation deals towards their domestic markets,
as is likely to be the case with Renault, the French carmaker.
For investors, the positive side of the situation is that they are more
likely to find bargains. For example, global depositary receipts are now
being offered by Indian companies at substantial discounts.
The lull during the summer has 'taken the froth off the market,' according
to one investment banker. 'Those companies which are coming to the market
are being much more pragmatic.'
Despite this year's more difficult market conditions, competition for
business remains fierce. For the year to date, Goldman Sachs leads
Euromoney's league table of bookrunners. However, the weakening of appetite
among US investors has led to a slight decline in the dominance of US
institutions, with only four US houses in the top 10 for the year to date,
compared with seven in 1993.
The main gainers have been Paribas, which has jumped to second place, with
only eight mandates, and Deutsche Bank, which has reached sixth place with
only three deals. Among the losers, Salomon Brothers has dropped from
seventh to 12th place and JP Morgan slid from ninth to 19th position.
Away fom the ebbs and flows in the fortunes of individual underwriters, it
is clear that new business has developed in the international capital
markets over the past five years.
The vogue for privatisation which has swept the world has been part of a
broader opening up of equity capital markets.
Fund managers and financial analysts are no longer stock pickers within a
single market, but have to get to grips with a wide span of companies and
markets. That is illustrated by this week's European Federation of Financial
Analysts' Societies congress in Edinburgh, where subjects range from China
to South Africa.
Companies in small or underdeveloped economies can now raise funds from a
potentially vast base of investors. Even companies in developed economies
find they have striking new opportunities: German companies, for example,
are starting to access the international equities market, signalling a
loosening of the ties with their bank shareholders.

FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Airways were heavily traded yesterday following a a
profits downgrade from Merrill Lynch in the wake of mounting US-led price
competition on trans-Atlantic routes. Turnover ran to some 4m trades with
the shares sliding 7 to 373p. Merrill cut its profits forecast quite
savagely from Pounds 480m pre-tax to Pounds 400, although the former figure
was always at the top end of market expectations.
What looked to have mostly worried dealers was the fact the the profits
reappraisal came from a US house said to have its ear close to the inner
workings of the US airways business.
Enterprise Oil was the best performer among oil shares, as the market
welcomed news of a promising oil discovery in the Norwegian sector of the
North Sea. Enterprise and Esso Norge each have a 50 per cent stake in the
discovery.
Oil analysts were enthusiastic about the discovery, but said further
drilling, to determine the extent of the discovery, would have to be made
before they could appraise their net asset values for Enterprise.
Enterprise shares settled marginally higher at 399p on turnover of 2m.
The regional electricity stocks staged a strong rally after initial weakness
with dealers talking of further actual and rumoured share buy-backs taking
place. South Wales announced it had bought in a further 500,000 shares at
810p a share, while there were suggestions that Midlands was about to embark
on a buy-in programme. South Wales shares eased 3 to 809p while Midlands
climbed 11 to 787p. Northern Electricity's restructuring programme saw its
stock price move up 8 to 794p.
BT gave ground after negative comments from Kleinwort Benson, the shares
sliding 5 1/2 to 374 1/2 p and the partly-paids 6 off at 254 1/2 p.
Compel Group, the computer systems and services group, put on a creditable
performance on its market debut, the shares, placed at 125p opened at 130p
and eventually settled at 126p.
There was no real disappointment across the market with Tesco's interim
results which came out at the top end of analysts' forecasts; the dividend
was in line with expectations.
There were, however, some reservations about gross margins and sales, but
these were not translated into big selling of Tesco shares which settled
only 3 lower at 248p. Some dealers reported switching out of Sainsbury and
into Tesco after the figures were released. Sainsbury shares dropped 9 to
427p, albeit in thin trade of 3.5m.
William Morrison retreated 6 to 139p ahead of interims expected tomorrow.
T &amp; N were resilient, closing unchanged at 224p ahead of a presentation by
brokers Henderson Crosthwaite to investors in Frankfurt.
The company has an option to acquire up to 52.5 per cent of the
Kolbenschmidt pistons business. The brokers said a rights issue to fund the
purchase had been discounted by the market and pointed to T &amp; N's 'track
record of effectively managing acquisitions.'
The retailing sector included a handful of good performers despite the
overall market weakness and persistent worries about possible further rises
in UK interest rates in the short and medium term.
Storehouse advanced 4 to 206p after Kleinwort Benson Securities gave the
stock a push on the view that the shares were undervalued.
Next edged up 2 1/2 to 246p on heavy turnover of 3.2m following a
reappraisal of the company's prospects in the wake of the recent interim
figures.
Williams de Broe, the stockbroker was one of the company's strongest
supporters, labelling the shares a buy and insisting 'the stock's discount
rating is unjustified.'
Sears, on the other hand, suffered from a sizeable overhang caused by the
stock's inclusion in a big programme executed in mid-session, in which a
block of 3.9m shares were traded at 113p.
Reg Vardy stood out among motor distributors, rising 2 to 170p on the back
of a bullish chairman's statement pointing to a 10 per cent jump in August
car sales and trading results well ahead of last year.
BAA shed 12 to 473p with some 4m shares changing hands on modest
profit-taking after the recent good run.
Eurotunnel lost 6 to 273p, hit by the general market weakness and further
reflection of Monday's announcement of the late start-up for the Shuttle
service.
Marked down as an interest rate sensitive stock - from the viewpoint of both
its debt and the possible adverse impact on consumer spending - P&amp;O fell 10
to 645p.
Inspec Group moved through the market although the price held steady at
223p.

Talk of a merger between Zeneca and Wellcome kept the fire burning for the
two stocks which defied the black mood of yesterday's market and improved
their prices. Shares of both companies have traded actively in recent
sessions with both being held up as potential bid targets. Zeneca gained 8
to 841p and Wellcome improved 14 to 699p.
The merger story excited market-making desks which continued to anticipate
some significant move in the sector.

FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror alerts TV stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of a 14.9 per cent stake in Scottish Television by Mirror
Group Newspapers sent a buzz through television stocks as investors moved
swiftly to show their support of the move.
The stock was secured for the Mirror at a significant premium to the share
price - 520p - after a series of agency crosses. Three blocks of shares
moved - of 2m, 4.9m, and 50,500.
Scottish soared on the Mirror's move, pushing up 58 to 501 with 14m shares
changing hands while Mirror Group shares bounced 11 to 139p.
The City warmed to the Mirror's effort to broaden its base amid the vicious
newspaper price competition and the good premium paid for Scottish fuelled
interest in other television stocks.
Ms Chris Munroe at Hoare Govett said: 'It is no surprise that the Mirror
should take such action. Geographically too it is a very good fit
considering the Mirror's interest in Scotland.'
In the backwash of the Mirror move in the television sector, Yorkshire
jumped 29 to 392p; Ulster added 37 to 720p and Grampian gained 29 to 354p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed setback as trading volume
increases - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market suffered a renewed setback yesterday following losses in
bond markets in Germany and the US. Most of the damage was done in the
morning when bond markets turned nervous ahead of the announcement, expected
this week, of the German money supply data. UK shares extended their losses
later after Wall Street, the US dollar and Federal bonds opened lower on
news of an unexpected widening in the US trade deficit in July.
The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 41.8 points down at 3,037.3. Trading volume
increased, swollen by a substantial sell programme from a leading London
securities house. The programme, estimated at a worth of around Pounds 100m,
took in sizeable deals in shares of such blue chips as GEC, Prudential
Assurance, Sears, Barclays Bank and Lloyds Abbey.
The markets focus on the heavy fall yesterday morning in German bond futures
appeared to bear out increasing concern that continental European funds have
been sellers of UK stocks. But weakness in British government bonds pointed
to worries over the outlook for domestic interest rates and inflation.
Weakness in bond markets inevitably reflect fears that last week's half
point rise in UK base rates may soon be followed by a further rise if
inflation fears continue to increase.
At the same time, trading statements from leading UK companies have been
casting doubts over confident forecasts for a strong equity market
performance in the final quarter of this year. Shares in Tesco, the
supermarket group, made a cautious response to an interim trading report
which drew attention again to margin pressures in the industry.
Stock index futures trading played a less direct role in yesterday's
shakeout, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index closing fairly close
to the cash market, after allowing for a large fair value premium. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index fell 23.5 points to 3,584.5.
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that genuine investment activity was low
on Monday, when the market bounced from its recent weakness; retail business
was worth only Pounds 950.9m, one of the first genuine daily totals below
Pounds 1bn for many months. Seaq volume of 602.7m shares yesterday compared
with 469.1m on Monday, with non-Footsie business making up around 60 per
cent of the total.
Until the sell programme hit the market, trading appeared to be relatively
slack. But it was difficult to identify the timing of the programme, which,
in accordance with Exchange rulings on large deals, did not appear on the
trading screens until late in the day.
Market strategists admitted to some disappointment that the UK stock market
appeared to be proving more vulnerable to interest rate concerns that
expected. Some have argued that the pace of economic recovery and in
corporate profits and dividends would enable the market to shrug off the
rises in interest rates which are associated with this stage of the economic
cycle.
Analysts' estimates are still looking for a strong advance in the FT-SE 100
Share Index before the end of the year. On this basis, some market traders
have urged clients to buy stocks during the present shakeout.
There was a muted response to the estimated annualised growth of 4.7 per
cent in domestic M4 money supply in August. UBS commented to clients that
the trend in net lending appeared to be broadly flat and that companies had
been reducing gearing by borrowing from equity and bond markets in place of
bank borrowing.
The market is expected to continue focusing on the prospects for interest
rates in the US and in Germany, where the M3 money supply figures could
present the next challenge to markets across Europe.

FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved sharply lower in heavier trading volume than on
Monday but once again there was little real attempt at driving the cash
market.
The FT-SE December contract closed at 3,046 for a near 10-point premium to
the cash market. The fair value premium stands at around 17 points.
Trading volume rose substantially on Monday's depressed levels, jumping to
17,553 lots in what traders yesterday described as 'steady business
throughout the trading day'.
Activity was said to be fairly evenly divided among locals - independent
traders - and the big brokers with the latter producing most of the
throughput when the FT-SE December contract hit its high for the day of
3,073 just before 3:30pm.
Opinions among traders on the immediate direction were mixed but if there
was any sort of consensus it suggested that London equities could soon be
ripe for a rebound. 'We'll either go through 3,000 or bounce back above
3,100,' said one big trader yesterday.
Activity in traded options also improved, rising to 39,646 contracts,
against 22,605 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE accounted for more than half
of total activity.
The most actively traded individual stock options were BP (2,689 lots),
Hanson (1,418) and Shell (1,066).

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Caracas at new high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caracas stocks closed stronger for the fourth successive session on optimism
over the direction of Venezuela's economy.
The Merinvest composite index rose 1.87 per cent to 155.38 on 5.3m shares
worth 326m bolivars (Dollars 1.9m).
"There is a perception that the country's economic problems are being
resolved and that the government wants to attack the deficit, inflation and
the financial crisis with its macroeconomic plan," one broker said.
Brazil
Concerns over possible restrictions to foreign investments in the country
combined with lingering jitters over Brazil's presidential race pushed stock
prices down 2.1 per cent.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended off 1,144 at 51,774
points.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Widening trade deficit pushes
Dow down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equity investors reacted badly yesterday morning to news of widening US
trade deficit, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 67.63 lower at 3,869.09, in worst
single-day performance since March. The sell-off was not confined to the
blue chips. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 7.49 at 463.36, reflecting
the broad base of the retreat. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped
advances by more than a four-to-one margin on heavy volume of 325m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 2.98 to 458.15,
while the Nasdaq composite was down 9.98 at 766.74.
The Commerce Department's trade report carried negative implications in two
respects. First, the overall deficit was reported to have increased to
Dollars 11bn in July, against expectations of Dollars 9.5bn. Investors
feared the yawning gap could complicate forthcoming US-Japanese trade talks,
putting more pressure on the dollar and the bond market.
Second, the July increase came in spite of a downturn in exports, which
suggested the possibility that overseas markets were becoming less fertile
ground for US companies. Unfortunately, the bond market chose to ignore this
aspect of the trade report, which may have buoyed sentiment among fixed-rate
traders looking for any signs of economic weakness. Government securities
were down sharply in the morning, but managed to whittle down their losses
during the afternoon.
The depressed mood in both stocks and bonds probably had less to do with
trade than with the growing belief that another move to tighter credit
conditions was imminent. Yesterday's data served to draw the underlying
pessimism to the surface. It was certainly evident in the performance of the
blue chips.
The Dow industrials plunged 23 points at the opening. From there, the
session only deteriorated. By the close, 28 of the 30 Dow components were
showing declines, with two issues unchanged.
The erosion touched nearly every sector. Caterpillar, a big cyclical, was
off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 55 3/8 , rate-sensitive American Express shed
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 29 3/4 and Sears, a leading retailer, slumped
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 7/8 .
In semiconductors, Micron Technology lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 in
heavy volume of 4m shares. Goldman Sachs removed the issue from its
recommended list. In computers, Digital was a rare bright spot, adding
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 28 on expectations of a return to profitability.
There was a shred of takeover news to flavour the session. Shares in
National Medical Enterprises, a leading hospital group, fell Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 17 7/8 on a report that it was close to acquiring American Medical
and Healthtrust to create the second biggest US hospital chain.
However, American, up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 , said it was also in
talks with other possible partners. Healthtrust climbed Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 30 7/8 on the news.
On the Nasdaq, Chiron, the biotechnology concern, plunged Dollars 43 1/16 to
Dollars 69 1/4 and Advanced Materials Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 48.
Canada
Toronto prices tumbled in moderate trading, as Canadian bonds slumped amid
mixed economic signals.
The TSE 300 composite index fell 59.09 points, or 1.33 per cent, to close at
4.376.87. Declining issues outnumbered advances 467 to 305.
Volume was 65.58m shares, up from Monday's 60.77m, and trading value was
CDollars 973.1m compared with CDollars 919.7m.
Canada's benchmark 30-year bond slumped 0.70 amid continued inflation
concerns.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion gains lift golds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The breakthrogh of the bullion price through key resistance levels took gold
stocks and mining shares higher, while the gold index rose more than 3 per
cent or 79 to 2,435 by the close.
Shrugging off a firm financial rand, gold shares rose in early trade in line
with the gold price through Dollars 392 an ounce, levelling off as the metal
consolidated for a few hours, and then continued upwards as gold made a late
break through Dollars 395 before slipping back to around Dollars 393/94 by
the close.
Traders said that they expected gold to regroup at the new higher level of
above Dollars 392 or Dollars 395, and said they did not expect it to advance
on Dollars 400 in the short term.
The overall index made 36 to 5,801 and the industrial index shed 15 to
6,438.
De Beers added R1.25 to R106.50, and Anglos R4.50 to R242.50.
Golds made large gains with Loraine adding R2.25 to R25.50 , Oryx rising 50
cents to R6.10 and Kloof R2.75 to R70. Gold Fields was R5 higher at R130.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises for
the first time in four days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broad based buying by public funds supported share prices and the Nikkei
index gained 1.4 per cent, rising for the first time in four trading days,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 283.16 to 19,837.27 after a low of 19,601.72 and a
high of 19,842.17. Public postal and pension funds supported prices in early
trading followed by late afternoon arbitrage buying which countered selling
by corporate investors looking to boost earnings ahead of the interim book
closing. Foreign investors were also seen purchasing car stocks.
Volume totaled 342m shares against 257m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 19.43 to 1,581.11 while the Nikkei 300 gained 3.69 to
288.96. Gainers led declines by 821 to 227, with 126 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 fell 3.47 to 1,289.11.
In spite of the rise, traders said that concerns over the currency market
still affected investor confidence. 'A possible breakdown in US-Japan trade
talks and higher inflationary data out of the US could push the yen higher,'
said a Japanese brokerage. The Bank of Japan was seen heavily intervening on
the Tokyo foreign exchange market yesterday.
Telecommunication stocks, recently battered by heavy selling, gained -
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone recovered Y10,000 to Y898,000 and Japan
Telecom, a second section stock and the direct trigger of the recent decline
in investor confidence, gained Y40,000 to Y4.17m.
Banks, which had fallen sharply on Monday on profit-taking ahead of the
September end book closing, regained some ground. Industrial Bank of Japan
added Y30 to Y3,030 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y2,080.
Car stocks were bought by overseas investors. Nissan Motor added Y33 to Y818
on buying by a Hong Kong based fund. Toyota Motor rose Y20 to Y1,980 and
Honda Motor added Y60 to Y1,670.
Steel makers were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of
the day, rose Y7 to Y385 and Kawasaki Steel Y11 to Y433.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 166.08 to 21,981.61 in volume of 246.5m
shares. Gains in the retail and drug sectors supported the index.
Roundup
The region showed a lack of opportunities yesterday. Seoul and Taiwan were
closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG finished slightly firmer after a day of featureless trade as
investors held back ahead of today's the mid-autumn festival.
The Hang Seng index added 23.32 to 9,824.75, having fallen below 9,800
briefly in the afternoon. Turnover was a thin HKDollars 3.1bn against
Monday's HKDollars 3.05bn.
Continued selling of Jardine Matheson pushed it down HKDollars 3.00 to
HKDollars 69 while Hongkong Land fell 35 cents to HKDollars 19.50.
Speculative buying was seen, however, in shares that might join the Hang
Seng index next year when the Jardine companies delist from the Hong Kong
market. Amoy Properties was up 30 cents to HKDollars 10.75 and Henderson
Investment advanced 17.50 cents to HKDollars 7.475.
KUALA LUMPUR was supported by speculative demand, fuelled by revived hopes
of an early election and various corporate rumours, and the composite index
rose 4.99 to 1,185.65.
MBf Capital jumped 56 cents to MDollars 3.98 in very heavy volume of 45m
shares amid rumours that a prominent businessman was about to begin
negotiations to take over the company. Its holding company, MBf Holdings,
rose 40 cents to MDollars 2.51.
SINGAPORE saw index-linked stocks put in a strong performance with gains in
several key stocks sending the Straits Times Industrials index up 24.36 to a
day's high of 2,296.21.
Most of the other Singapore shares were neglected while trading in over the
counter Malaysian shares took the larger slice of the market's activity.
close as the market entered deeper into a consolidation phase. The composite
index lost 16.02 to 2,920.19.
Volume surged to 3.1bn shares valued at 1.42bn pesos from 2.38 bn worth
1.28bn pesos.
Heavy selling was seen in a number of issues as investors took profits:
Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust lost 4.2 per cent to 795 pesos from 830 pesos. Oil
refiner Petron lost 3.45 per cent to 21 pesos.
PLDT dropped 1.6 per cent to 1,540 pesos, following its overnight decline in
New York.
SYDNEY fell back in a dull session, pulled down by a decline on the futures
market.
The All Ordinaries index lost 4.0 to 2,045.1, off its day's high of 2,058.3.
The September futures contract dropped 6 to2,032.
Turnover was ADollars 474.3m, in volume of 188.7m shares.
Gold moved against the trend, with the index adding 49.1 or 2.2 per cent to
2,262.9 as the bullion price firmed. Homestake Gold rose 15cents to ADollars
1.90 and Poseidon Gold rose 16 cents to ADollars 3.66.
News Corp fell 19 cents to ADollars 8.45, with John Fairfax down 4 cents at
ADollars 2.71.
CBA fell 7 cents to ADollars 7.80, with Westpac down 5 cents to ADollars
4.32 and NAB falling 16 cents to ADollars 10.26.
ANZ rose 1 cent to ADollars 4.01.
WELLINGTON was easier, led by falls in Telecom and Carter Holt.
The NZSE-40 capital index closed at 2,087.32, down 18.35. Telecom was 10
cents lower at NZDollars 5.10, Carter of 8 cents at NZDollars 3.85.
Fletcher gained 2 cents to NZDollars 4.44, but volume was heavy at nearly 2m
shares.
BOMBAY fell sharply amid heavy speculative selling, as investors booked
profits ahead of tomorrow's close of the fortnightly trading account. The
BSE 30-share index fell 65.41 or 1.4 per cent to 4,488.38 in the absence of
any demand from foreign institutional investors.
KARACHI found institutional support and buying in select financials although
an anti-government strike clouded sentiment. The KSE 100-share index rose
2.53 in thin trading to close at 2,206.86.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent turns lower in wake
of US figures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a generally positive morning session bourses turned negative following
the release of disappointing US trade figures.
The lack of an announcement on German M3 data also left many investors in a
holding pattern. The figures are due this week - possibly today. Analysts
have been expecting an M3 figure of around 8.8 per cent to 9.0 per cent from
9.8 per cent in July, but there were worries yesterday that the figure could
be worse.
ZURICH fell in the wake of the US data as the weaker dollar put pressure on
dollar earners and index heavyweights. The SMI index finished 28.7, or 1.1
per cent, lower at 2,593.0.
Kleinwort Benson, however, has raised its recommendation on the market from
underweight to overweight, citing rising expectations of better earnings
prospects for the banks and pharmaceutical stocks combined with a more
defensive trend in equity investment towards the end of the year. It argued
that the save haven qualities and liquidity of the market would outweigh
currency concerns through to the end of 1994.
CS Holding fell SFr16 to SFr548 after the group said it was making a
takeover bid for the Swiss regional Neue Aargauer Bank, which was marked
SFr40 lower to SFr1,970. UBS, which has a stake of about 12 per cent in Neue
Aargauer, saw its bearers slip SFr7 to SFr1,193.
Nestle gave up SFr12 to SFr1,201 on futures related selling. Ciba registered
dipped SFr15 lower to SFr761.
Registered shares in Swissair fell SFr35 or 4.1 per cent to SFr815 after the
company announced a bigger than expected first half net loss of SFr48m.
Forecasts had ranged between a loss of SFr25m and a profit of SFr35m.
FRANKFURT was pushed and pulled by the bond market, then dragged down
further by the US data which hit Ibis trading. The Dax index closed the
official session off 17.8 at 2,078.96, falling to 2,059.15 in the afternoon
session.
Turnover was DM6bn.
Holzmann and Hochtief still featured following Monday's stake building by
the latter and the publication of some buy recommendations. Holzmann rose
DM41 to DM923, while Hochtief gained DM4 to DM1,034 and RWE, the parent
company, slipped DM1 to DM458. In late trading Hochtief picked up DM2 to
DM1,035 and RWE weakened further to DM455.
Car stocks were weaker with Volkswagen off DM8.7 to DM449, drifting to
DM446.50 in the post, Daimler DM10 to DM793 and then to DM780,and BMW DM12
lower at DM780.
PARIS recovered well from the session low as the CAC-40 index settled off
3.62 at 1,919.25, after seeing 1,891.
The day's main news was Michelin, up FFr1.5 at FFr236, just below a session
high of FFr237, as the tyre manufacturer announced a healthy first half
profit of FFr314m, which was slightly lower than expectations, with some
analysts looking at a figure of FFr500m .
The company said that cost cutting was now its top priority, with the full
effects of such measures likely to come through in 1996.
MILAN was easier after a subdued session which took its lead from other
bourses and the bond markets as investors awaited the outcome of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's meeting with unions tomorrow aimed at reaching accord on
pension cuts. The Comit index fell 1.10 to 673.43.
Alleanza, the life insurer controlled by Generali, jumped L302 or 1.9 per
cent to 16,582 after reporting a 44.5 per cent rise in first half profit.
Other insurers were helped ahead by the news, Generali finishing L33 higher
at L39,676, after a low of L39,300, and Fondiaria rising L230 to L11,715,
with news of its return to profit coming after the market closed.
Telecommunications issues were hurt by rumours that a large investment fund
was pulling out of the sector. Stet fell L21 to L4,630 and Telecom Italia
was L52 lower at L4,280.
MADRID fell as bonds dipped and foreign bourses registered losses. The
general index gave up 3.71 or 1.2 per cent to 296.72 in relatively high
turnover of Pta24bn as the market looked ahead to today's one year T-bill
auction at which yields are expected to rise by between five and 10 basis
points.
Electrical shares were among the day's biggest losers with Iberdrola down
Pta10 or 1.2 per cent at Pta813 and Endesa falling Pta120 or 2.2 per cent to
Pta5,400.
AMSTERDAM was driven lower by the effects of weakness elsewhere on the
continent, leaving the AEX index off 5.54 at 401.55.
STOCKHOLM was upset by the same problems besetting the other continental
markets, although domestic investors were still taking stock of the
weekend's general election. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.3 to
1,432.8.
In a note on the election James Capel remarked that in the short term
volatility was likely, but that calmer conditions were probable by the turn
of the year.
COPENHAGEN was easier ahead of today's general election, the KFX index
losing 0.17 to 96.99.
ISTANBUL rebounded 4.9 per cent after the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller,
acted to ease political uncertainty by calling a by-election, and remarked
that privatisation remained high on her agenda.
The composite index, which lost 3.8 per cent on Monday, regained 1,123.26 to
23,908.35 as Mrs Ciller shrugged off rumours of a possible crack in her
three-year-old coalition government, adding that the austerity programme
would not be replaced by election spending.
WARSAW fell 3.4 per cent after the government announced plans to press ahead
with long heralded plans for a stock market transaction tax from the
beginning of next year. The Wig index lost 322.4 to 9,290.7.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Yen lifted by Dollar, D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen was the beneficiary of weakness in both the dollar and the D-Mark
yesterday as the US trade gap widened and jitters about forthcoming German
money supply figures made the Japanese currency more attractive, writes
Motoko Rich.
Against the dollar, the Japanese currency advanced by about a yen to Y97.75
from Y98.7650. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at Y63.03, from
Y63.61.
Sterling also had a good day, finishing up against the dollar and the
D-Mark. Against the dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5764,
from Dollars 1.568. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM 2.4446,
from 2.4347.
The UK currency was helped by overall market sentiment that base rates will
continue to rise, a view which was supported by an active short sterling
futures market.
The December short sterling futures contract fell 14 basis points to settle
at 93.03 from 93.17, discounting a short-term interest rate of 6.97, a full
percentage point above current rates.
The yen surged against the dollar following the release of the US trade
deficit figures for July, rising to Y97.55 in the afternoon, near its
mid-August levels and only a point off its post-war high of Y96.45.
The US trade gap widened by 21.6 per cent in July to Dollars 10.99bn, from a
revised Dollars 9.04bn in June. The trade gap with Japan rose 2.7 per cent
to Dollars 5.67bn, its highest since March.
Expectations before the figures were released were for an even higher
deficit with Japan. But against the background of upcoming trade talks
between the US and Japan, the markets took the news quite negatively and
sold off the dollar.
Mr Rob Hayward, economic advisor at Bank of America, said: 'Although it was
a disappointing number on the surface, I do not think it changes the US
trade position. It is just a bit of statistical noise.'
The dollar fought back against the D-Mark towards a floor around DM1.552
after US Commerce undersecretary Everett Ehrlich said that in spite of the
deterioration of the July trade deficit between Japan and the US, the trade
situation remained 'fundamentally unchanged'. The dollar closed in London
against the D-Mark at DM1.5508 from DM1.5528.
The D-Mark remained soft on the crosses throughout the day as markets
fluttered on concerns that German M3 money supply data, expected this week,
would rise above market expectations.
The markets are forecasting a small month-on-month rise, bringing down the
annual rate of growth to 8.9 per cent from 9.8 per cent in July.
But some analysts were talking of double digits, causing traders to unwind
long positions in the D-Mark. 'There are rumours that the M3 numbers will be
buoyed up,' said Mr Anthony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO. 'If
that happened that could prompt the Bundesbank to raise interest rates,
which would case increased bearishness in the bond markets, which is
affecting the D-Mark now.'
In London, the D-Mark closed against the lira at L1006 from L1010, against
the Swiss franc at 0.829 from SFr0.830 and against the French franc at
FFr3.418 from FFr3.416.
The markets responded positively to Mr John Major's speech to British
businessmen in Saudi Arabia on Monday, which gave a positive spin on the UK
economy, and boosted sterling against the D-Mark and the dollar.
But analysts were particularly struck by activity in the short sterling
futures market, which they believed impacted the movement of the pound.
The September short sterling contract, which expires today, finished at
94.03, from 94.15, discounting interest rates at 5.97 per cent, close to
current cash rates.
The December short sterling futures contract discounted the three-month
interest rate a full percentage point above current rates.
Mr Norfield said: 'There does not seem to be any willingness on the part of
the market to say this has gone far enough,' he said. 'But I would say the
extraordinary degree of tightening that the futures markets are forecasting
in the next three months go beyond the bounds of credibility.'
The Swedish krona remained fairly steady against the D-Mark, closing in
London at SKr4.818 from Skr4.805.
Although the Swedish trade deficit was worse than expected at SKr0.4bn
against a forecast of a Skr1.6bn surplus, the markets did not take the news
too negatively.
'The trade figures have not had much material impact,' said Mr Julian
Callow, economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The markets are awaiting judgement
on the new government.' An announcement on the government from prime
minister designate Mr Ingvar Carlsson is expected today.
The Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 243m at established rates
after revising its shortage forecast to Pounds 550m. It provided late
assistance of Pounds 215m. Overnight rates traded between 4 5/8 and 6 1/4.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government dithers over
edible oil imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With the elections to be held in several states, including some major
oilseeds producing states, late this year the Indian federal government is
finding it difficult to firm up its edible oils import policy.
The government, which must weigh carefully the impact of any policy
initiative on its electoral prospects, finds the agriculture ministry
strongly opposing the proposal of the civil supplies ministry to allow the
free import of all kinds of edible oils. At present only the import of palm
olein is freely allowed.
While it is important for the government to keep the 15m farmers engaged in
the cultivation of oilseeds happy bykeeping the import of oils to the bare
minimum, it cannot overlook the fact that prices are high in spite of a good
oilseeds crop during 1993-94 (November to October). Prices may rise even
further during the Indian festive season beginning October.
What the government has done in the prevailing circumstances is to postpone
taking a decision on freeing the import of all edible oils to a future date
and to allow the State Trading Corporation and the National Dairy
Development Board to import 100,000 tonnes of edible oils each, excluding
coconut oil, at a concessional duty of 20 per cent.
The private oil trade has, however, taken strong exception to the government
allowing only the state agencies to import oils.
Earlier this year also, the traders were discriminated against when the
government allowed the STC and NDDB to import over 200,000 tonnes of palm
olein at a duty of 20 per cent, compared with the normal rate of 65 per
cent. The import duty on palm olein may be reduced.
The government is, however, deriving some comfort in this election year from
the encouraging prospects for oilseeds production in the 1994-95 season.
According to initial projections, output is likely to rise to 22.4m tonnes
from 21.75m in 1993-94. The improvement in production will be mainly in the
groundnut and soyabean crops.
The excellent monsoon in most parts of the country has given a boost to
oilseeds production. The monsoon influences the production in a big way as
about 60 per cent of the land under oilseeds is unirrigated.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Embassy move puts Guatemalan
spice trade on the rack - Why cardamom growers are worried about losing
friends in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arab-Israeli conflict has never been of great concern to the poor
farmers who live in the department of Alta Verapaz, about 100 miles north of
Guatemala City. But the welfare of about 250,000 Keq'chi Maya Indians who
produce more than two thirds of the world's exports of cardamom is in the
balance following President Ramiro de Leon's decision to move Guatemala's
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Mr De Leon said last week he was moving the embassy 'for sentimental
reasons', an explanation that convinced no one.
About 85 per cent of Guatemala's cardamom exports go to Arab countries,
principally to Saudi Arabia where cardamom is mixed with coffee to produce
gahwa, a pungent, aromatic beverage traditionally drunk out of a brass pot
with an elongated curved spout. The rest goes to Europe, in particular to
Scandinavian countries, where cardamom is used to spice bread and pastries.
It is also used in confectionery.
In the past when other Central American countries have moved their embassies
to Jerusalem, Arab nations severed diplomatic relations and imposed economic
sanctions. But Mr de Leon, who appears to have taken his decision without
consulting either his foreign minister or economy minister, says he is
confident that the mood of reconciliation in the Middle East will ensure
that exports will not be put at risk.
However, Jordan's embassy in Chile has already criticised the measure, and
exporters fear that other Arab countries will follow. 'If the Arab countries
impose a boycott it will be a disaster for us and the thousands of
producers,' says Mr Rodolfo Rivera, director of the chamber of cardamom
exporters. 'The cardamom has nowhere else to go.'
Cardamom producers had been looking forward to a record harvest of 13,000
tonnes. Normally they would hope to sell to exporters for around 250
quetzales a quintal (about Dollars 44 for a 100lb bag) and for agricultural
labourers who earn less than Dollars 2 a day cardamom has proved an
important source of income.
The cardamom bean, a small ovoid green capsule about 2cm long, once picked
is then sorted by colour, mostly by women and children. The bigger and
greener the better, says Mr Rivera.
Revenue was expected to reach about Dollars 50m for the cardamom season,
which runs from October to April. Dried, it fetches about Dollars 5 a
kilogram, but the market is on hold until there is an official response from
Saudi Arabia.
The spice arrived in the impoverished region of Alta Verapaz about 30 years
ago, thanks to a quirk of history. A German immigrant, the late Mr Jacobs,
brought the seeds over from India where it is indigenous. He had tried
unsuccessfully to grow the plant in the Caribbean but the conditions around
Coban, the departmental capital, an important coffee growing region at
around 4,500ft, proved ideal. It grows almost wild, needing very little
attention or fertiliser, near the coffee plantations. Guatemala quickly
became by far the largest exporter in the world, accounting for about 70 per
cent of the export market.
Exporters have accused Mr De Leon of bowing to pressure from the Israeli
government to link economic aid and military assistance to recognition of
Jerusalem. The charge is denied by both the Guatemalan army and the Israeli
government.
Israel has enjoyed strong links with Guatemala since its creation in 1948.
It was the Israelis who stepped into the breach to provide military
equipment and intelligence training after the US cut off military aid to
Guatemala in the 1970s because of its horrific human rights record.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: London coffee futures up again,
but below highs - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London COFFEE futures ended firmer yesterday but below almost nine-year
highs hit during the day on talk of dry weather in Indonesia and underlying
concern over lack of rain in Brazil, dealers said.
The November position at the London Commodity Exchange closed Dollars 15
higher at Dollars 4,055. The day's peak of Dollars 4,130 was the highest
second position price since January 10, 1986, when Dollars 4,194 was
reached.
'Sporadic reports have been emerging of damage to the (Brazilian) trees,'
said the GNI trade house. 'However, because of the dry spell it seems as if
most trees are late developing flowers, and that they will be better placed
to withstand dry weather for a few more weeks.'
The overnight rally in GOLD was maintained as investment funds bought the
metal in New York, triggering stop-loss buying and pushing London's
afternoon fixing to an 8 1/2 -month high of Dollars 393.90 a troy ounce.
Jumps in North American gold stocks started the rally late on Monday, most
noticeably on the Philadelphia gold index, which jumped about 5 per cent,
and in Toronto, where the gold stock sector increased in value by 1.55 per
cent.
At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices resumed their uptrend
following the announcement of a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks.
Despite disappointment at International Primary Aluminium Institute
provisional figures indicating a rise in production in August the three
months price closed at Dollars 1,616.50 a tonne, up Dollars 14 on the day.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel deficit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nickel market will be in deficit from this year through to 1996 and
warehouse stocks are set to fall accordingly, Mr Hugh Morgan, Managing
Director of Australia's Western Mining Corporation, said yesterday, reports
Reuters.
The outlook for nickel consumption was good, based on the likelihood of
further stainless-steel capacity coming on stream in the next two years, he
said at a presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in London.
Since 1984-85, stainless steel production had been rising at a faster rate
than industrial production, and that was expected to continue, he added.
This year the nickel market would be in deficit by 12,000 tonnes, compared
with a 1993 surplus of 17,000 tonnes. In 1995 the shortfall would rise to
31,000 tonnes and by 1996 it was expected to reach 56,000.
LME warehouse stocks would fall over the next few years as well, and should
be around 50,000 tonnes by the end of 1996.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dairy farmers urged to
capitalise on price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK dairy farmers must use the short-term increase in milk prices that will
accompany market deregulation to invest for a secure future in an
increasingly competitive European market, according to a report published
today.
The report by Adas, the government's farm advisory service, predicts a heavy
concentration of ownership in the dairy sector in England and Wales by 2000.
'We estimate that 22 per cent of dairy farmers, equivalent to 6,500
producers, will leave the industry,' says the report, Options for Growth.
The number of herds is expected to fall by 20 per cent and average herd size
to grow by 4 per cent.
'If you want to stay in business, you will have to acquire more quota. . .
It is vital that businesses plan now to ensure they will be in a position to
purchase or lease when quota prices are more favourable.'
The UK is expected to rise to the top of the EU price league when the market
is liberalised in November and farmers are free to sell milk direct to dairy
companies or to Milk Marque, a voluntary producers' co-operative that will
act as a broker.
But the Adas report says that competition from imported milk products will
ultimately form a price ceiling for UK milk destined for manufacture into
butter, cheese or yoghurt.
The UK market reorganisation is proving highly controversial, with dairy
companies unhappy at Milk Marque's control of at least 65 per cent of
supplies in England and Wales. The Dairy Trade Federation begins legal
action this week to try to overturn government approval of the new
arrangements. It says Milk Marque's planned rise in prices will bring a
flood of imports and damage the UK processing industry.
The Adas report advises farmers to maximise milk yields. Britain has larger
dairy farms and herd sizes on average than its main EU competitors, but
lower production of milk per cow than Denmark, the Netherlands and France.
Production costs are among the lowest in the EU but not as low as they might
be given the UK's economies of scale, it says. 'The outlook for dairy
farmers will depend on their ability to capitalise on the advantages of the
UK industry and improve the relationship between output and costs.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker cuts cocoa production
estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading house ED &amp; F. Man has reduced its world cocoa production estimate
for 1993-94 by 24,000 tonnes to 2.36m as the prolonged effect of low prices
further reduces yields in Brazil, Malaysia and Ecuador, reports Reuters.
Man said it was forecasting Brazilian production of 265,000 tonnes for
1993-94, compared to an estimated output of 294,000 tonnes in 1992-93. The
forecasts for Malaysian output is now 205,000 tonnes, down from an estimated
224,000 tonnes in 1992-93. Ecuador is forecast to produce 80,000 tonnes in
1993-94.
While crops in Brazil and Malaysia have fallen as sustained lower prices
affect higher-cost producers, Indonesia remains the only origin where the
trend is towards higher production, the report said.
'We have raised our estimate of 1993-94 (Indonesian) production to 250,000.
Over the last five years production growth has averaged over 20 per cent per
annum and there is no sign that the rate of growth is declining.'
Cocoa arrivals up to the end of September from the Ivory Coast, the world's
leading producer, were estimated at 900,000 tonnes, which included some
100,000 tonnes carried over from the 1992-93 mid-crop season, according to
the report.
Man said it put its estimate for the Ivory Coast's mid-crop at 155,000
tonnes, giving a total 1993-94 production of 800,000 tonnes.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat amid concern over
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDLEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday on news of a widening US trade deficit
and an uncertain outlook on monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/16 lower
at 96 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.769 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99, to yield 6.404 per cent.
A combination of subtle factors served to push the market lower during the
session. It suffered heavy losses during the morning, but gradually improved
as the day progressed.
At the opening, traders reported a heavy wave of selling by foreign
investors concerned by the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve
would lift short-term interest rates before November.
Many investors were expecting an early move by the Fed in the light of
Friday's strong industrial production and capacity utilisation figures. The
risk of tighter credit conditions appeared to be persuading many of them to
shift their investments overseas.
Yesterday's trade data reinforced the thinking behind such a strategy. The
Commerce Department reported that the deficit in goods and services had
widened to Dollars 11bn in July, against expectations of Dollars 9.5bn.
The trend raised fresh concern over the value of the dollar, especially in
advance of an upcoming round of US-Japanese trade talks. Although the dollar
showed only limited weakness yesterday, a sustained sell-off in the coming
weeks would make US-denominated government securities less attractive to
foreign investors.
Many of them were taking no chances yesterday. Traders took advantage of the
relatively steady conditions prevailing since the week began to reduce their
holdings.
European government bonds had another volatile day, weakening in the morning
and recouping some of their losses in the afternoon.
Rumours that German August M3 money supply data, due today, would be worse
than expected pressured prices across Europe. Weak US Treasuries and
Far-Eastern selling ahead of the fiscal half-year-end were a further
dampener.
Market sentiment remains gloomy, with dealers continuing to worry about
rising European interest rates, while most end-investors remain sidelined,
running defensive positions. Bond chart technicals also are negative,
pointing to continued bearish sentiment.
The German bund market responded with cautious optimism to the Bundesbank's
announcement that it would auction a 10-year floating-rate government bond
next week.
The final terms of the issue, whose coupon will be linked to the three-month
Frankfurt Interbank Rate (Fibor), will be set by the German bond consortium
on Tuesday, when the first portion of bonds will be placed. A second tranche
will be auctioned the next day.
Some observers argued that the move reflected a desperate scramble for
funding alternatives by a central bank faced with a huge borrowing
requirement in the final quarter.
'When governments start issuing floating-rate bonds, it looks like an act of
desperation,' said Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International.
'If you want to be charitable, you can call it a flexible approach to debt
management, but I feel it reflects the acceptance of a very weak market,'
said Mr George Magnus of S. G. Warburg Securities.
However, others welcomed the move, which they said would take some of the
funding burden off the long end of the yield curve. 'They may not want to
add to the backlog of 10-year supply, which is positive for the market and
could help the (yield) curve to flatten,' said one dealer.
Many dealers were confident the paper would meet strong demand from German
money market funds, which became legal on August 1.
UK gilts had another volatile day, falling sharply in the morning but
recovering in the afternoon to close only slightly weaker.
The Bank of England announced it would auction Pounds 2bn of gilts due 2005
with a coupon of 8.5 per cent next Wednesday. The stock is the first
offering of next year's 10-year benchmark. The Dollars 2bn size was smaller
than some expected, lending some support to the 10-year sector in the
afternoon.
Much of the early pressure on gilts came from the short end of the yield
curve, amid fears of further monetary tightening after last week's base rate
increase. The September three-month sterling futures contract on Liffe fell
0.11 to 94.04.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Bonds: World Bank to follow Dollars 1.5bn
global issue with DM offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank yesterday launched its long-awaited Dollars 1.5bn global
offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds, priced to yield nine basis points
over US government bonds.
The offering, the bank's first in the dollar market since September 1993,
met firm demand, lead managers UBS and Lehman Brothers said, with 45 per
cent of the deal sold in the US, 33 per cent in Europe, and 22 per cent in
Asia Pacific.
The bank intends to follow up the deal with a global D-Mark issue later this
year and a further dollar global offering in the first half of 1994,
officials said.
'We are tentatively considering a D-Mark global offering in the DM2bn range
with a five-year maturity but this depends on market conditions and we are
not ruling out a 10-year bond,' a bank official said. The D-Mark offering
would be launched in October at the earliest.
The bank estimates that it will raise a total of around Dollars 10bn in the
1994-95 fiscal year, which runs to the end of June. It raised Dollars 9bn in
the previous fiscal year, Dollars 1bn below its initial target.
Syndicate managers said the deal was a success. 'All the bonds have not been
sold, but that is the nature of the market at the moment,' said one
syndicate manager.
However, some syndicate managers said that many of the new bonds had been
bought by investors who had sold existing bond holdings.
'There was little new money around,' said one dealer. 'There were some very
aggressive switch trades done by underwriters rather than outright sales in
order to get the new issue sold.'
The spread held at 9 basis points after the syndicate had broken.
In the sterling sector, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 250m
three-year offering, priced to yield 30 basis points over UK government
bonds.
The offering was prompted by investor demand for shorter-dated sterling
bonds due to current attractive yields and a lack of comparable recent
sterling issues, joint lead manager S. G. Warburg said.
The bonds were sold mainly to UK and continental European investors, the
lead manager said.
Dealers said pricing on the deal was tight, but S. G. Warburg argued that
bonds with a similar rating were trading at a yield spread of 22 to 24 basis
points. The bonds maintained their spread after they had broken syndicate.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Strong demand for new German
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German money market funds could attract investment of as much as DM50bn by
the end of this year, far more than previously forecast, said Mr Martin
Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank.
The funds, which invest exclusively in short-term instruments such as
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and short-dated bonds, were first
allowed in Germany from August under the latest financial markets law.
To date, around 10 banks and investment companies have announced money
market funds for German investors. Other countries, such as France and the
US, have had such funds for some time.
Mr Kohlhaussen said Commerzbank's own funds - based in Luxembourg until it
receives regulatory approval to operate them in Germany - had already
attracted more than DM7.5bn. Some of this money had simply been transferred
from fixed-term deposit accounts but more than 10,000 new clients had also
invested in the funds; Commerzbank said between a quarter and a third of the
inflows to its two funds could be classed as new money.
The attractions of money market funds are immediate access and higher
interest rates. One-month deposits in Germany currently pay around 3.5 per
cent against yields of more than 4 per cent on money market funds. The
forecast made by Mr Kohlhaussen includes funds based in Luxembourg and
Germany.
Mr Kohlhaussen said the variety of money market funds available in Germany
would increase in coming months. They would be sold by both German and
foreign institutions, be aimed at private and corporate investors, and be in
different currencies.
Officials of Commerzbank said its money market funds could total up to
DM15bn by the year-end, with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank likely to
attract similar sums.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Shinpan, a leading Japanese consumer credit company, has postponed an
offering of asset-backed securities, planned for this month.
The deal would have been the first international issue by a Japanese company
of tradable securities backed by domestic assets. The Japanese Ministry of
Finance recently eased restrictions on issuing asset-backed securities in
overseas markets.
Nippon Shinpan's Y20bn to Y30bn eurobond, backed by Japanese car loan
receivables, was due to be launched by Goldman Sachs.
The company received official approval from the ministry last week, having
applied a year ago, but has postponed the deal until later this year due to
low demand for funds and continuing negotiations over issuance fees.
Since Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last week welcomed the
finance ministry's decision to allow Nippon Shinpan's issue, adding that he
hoped it would lead to broader liberalisation of the asset backed securities
market in Japan.
The most likely assets for securitisation are leases, car loans and consumer
credit loans.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic rises 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jardine Strategic Holdings, the holding company of the Jardine Matheson
group, yesterday reported a 33 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars
161.3m from Dollars 121.3m last year.
These are likely to be JSH's last set of results reported out of Hong Kong,
as it is withdrawing its secondary listing from the colony's exchange on
December 31.
The figures are after preference dividends, which came to Dollars 19.2m, but
exclude an extraordinary item of Dollars 68.3m accrued in first half 1993
from the sale of an investment property by Hongkong Land. Stripping out an
exceptional gain from a property sale made by Dairy Farm in the first half
of this year, the year-on-year earnings rise shrinks to 19 per cent.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said: 'The businesses in which we hold our
strategic stakes are financially strong and, with their operations based
mainly in the expanding markets of the Asia-Pacific region, the outlook is
for many years of further development. The full year should see higher
earnings than in 1993, and the longer term perspective remains encouraging.'
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 28 per cent to 20.40 cents
from 15.97 cents, while directors are recommending a dividend of 4.60 cents,
up 15 per cent from last year's 4.00 cents payout.
Mr Keswick said JSH was ready to acquire smaller stakes in companies with
promising prospects and links, whether geographical or business, to the
group.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australis pins high subscription
hopes to satellite - A look at an energetic venture racing to provide a
pay-TV service by the beginning of 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone trying to locate the Sydney headquarters of Australis Media should
look out for the limos.
Australia's would-be pay-TV company recently moved to a central docklands
area, and the big, smart cars parked outside look startlingly incongruous
alongside terraced houses and building sites.
But few, if any, belong to Australis. Rather they are testament to a stream
of American-based programming executives passing through the company's doors
as it tries to get Australia's first significant pay-TV service up and
running by the beginning of 1995.
There is no mistaking the energy which surrounds this effort. Employees
debate technical questions in the lift. Mr Neil Gamble, chief executive,
exudes confidence. The meetings seem incessant. 'It's a day and night job at
present,' says Mr Gamble. 'The time zones start in the morning with America
and end in the evening with London.'
But the big question is whether a new company can amass the technical,
financial and marketing skills necessary to produce a saleable package in
such a short time - and, simultaneously, play the complex political game
which surrounds the media business in Australia. There are, after all, some
formidable entrenched competitors, in the shape of Mr Kerry Packer, owner of
Australia's biggest commercial TV network, and Mr Rupert Murdoch, whose News
Corporation has TV and newspaper interests across three continents.
Two years ago, Australis was no more than an idea. The company began as the
brainchild of Mr Stephen Cosser, a former chief executive of the Channel 10
network, and was officially incorporated in April 1993 to hold multipoint
distribution systems (MDS) licences for the Sydney and Melbourne markets.
An MDS provides local distribution of a service from a central satellite
receiving point to individual customers.
Interests now included within the Australis group launched Newsvision, a
24-hour news service put together for the hotel market, in June 1992.
Teleitalia, an Italian language service, followed in 1993. More recently,
Chinese and Arabic services have been added as more generally available
programming. The subscription base for all four, however, is small.
Australis, having recruited some prominent members of Australia's business
community to its board, floated on the stock market a year ago. But its
profile changed dramatically in November, when it acquired one of the two
commercially-available satellite licences. These allow delivery of broadcast
subscription services to most of Australia via an Optus satellite - a much
bigger proposition. The licences had been auctioned off by the federal
government earlier in 1993, and the big existing media operators had been
outbid.
Australis then strengthened its pay-TV delivery position by scooping up more
MDS licences in another federal auction, held this year. Initially at least,
it plans to use this mixture of satellite and MDS to get programmes into
people's homes, thus obviating the need for satellite dishes at receiving
premises.
But time pressures on Australis are now mounting. Australia's small
population base, of about 18m people, means that the country is unlikely to
sustain many pay-TV operators. Within two or three years, alternative
delivery mechanisms - notably cable - will probably be widely available.
Publicly, Mr Gamble is ambivalent about the threat. He claims, with some
justification, that Australia's geography gives satellite an inherent
advantage. But he adds: 'Nevertheless, cable will be here, and cable is a
long-term technology and we're not running it down. We think it is an
important technology and we're going to use it - but we think that the
window which (satellite) provides for us in the next couple of years is so
substantial that we can have a major foothold by 1997.'
Assuming, that is, Australis can get an attractive programming package into
the marketplace. Setting up all the programming agreements, service
facilities, financial and legal structures, is a Herculean task.
The target is a 'bundled' 10-channel package, covering films, sport, news
and general entertainment. 'There's going to be some form of gold, silver
and bronze packaging, priced accordingly. The most expensive will be the
sports and first release movie channels,' says Mr Gamble.
But, to date, Australis' main programming announcement has concerned sport
only. A joint venture has been set up with Liberty Sports/Prime, which in
turn is part of the giant TCI cable group in the US. This has acquired
rights to next February's Australia/West Indies Test cricket series, the
Rugby League World Cup in England later in 1995, and a solid spread of other
events.
Elsewhere, by contrast, programming details remain scant - although TCI,
which has an investment in Australis and a senior executive on the
Australian company's board, has also entered a joint venture to develop a
movie channel.
Meantime, the 10-channel bundling arrangement requires agreement between all
three licence-holders - Australis (with four channels), Continental Century
(four), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (two) - and formal
approval by Australia's Trade Practices Commission.
On other fronts, there are similar signs that Australis is edging towards
its goal, but still has a considerable distance to cover.
A customer service centre site has been selected in Adelaide, for example,
bringing financial assistance from the South Australian authorities, but
staff have yet to be recruited and trained. Agreement has also been reached
for the supply of reception equipment, and 200,000 units ordered.
There is the question of money. Australis - whose institutional shareholders
include the Australian Mutual Provident, Bankers Trust, J. P. Morgan, and
Cigna, the US insurer - raised ADollars 35m (USDollars 25.7m) when it came
to the stock market. It secured another ADollars 175.5m by a share and
debenture placing. But the sport venture cost has been put at up to ADollars
50m (split 50-50 with Liberty/Prime), and the MDS licences cost ADollars
66m. The operating loss for the 12 months to end-June was more than ADollars
19m.
Mr Gamble's aim is to attract 1m subscribers in the first three years. 'I
have yet to find anyone who, once they understand what it's all about,
doesn't say 'Where do I sign?'' he says. 'So we think a million is
reasonable. Remember, we're 10 years behind the US schedule, we're four or
five years behind the UK, we're four years behind New Zealand, and we're
eight years behind South Africa.'
If that target is attained, Australis' chief executive predicts that the
company could be profitable by 'the back of the third year'.
'We don't clean out all the losses, but the curve changes in year three,' he
says.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Suzuki, Mazda to swap products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki and Mazda, two Japanese carmakers, have entered negotiations to
exchange products, a growing trend in the Japanese motor industry, where
manufacturers are under severe pressure to cut the costs of new product
development.
Suzuki is considering the purchase of two-litre diesel engines from Mazda
for use in its Suzuki Escudo range of four-wheel drive sports/utility
vehicles. At the same time, Suzuki may supply this vehicle to Mazda for sale
under the Mazda badge.
In earlier moves the loss-making Isuzu group decided to withdraw from car
manufacturing to concentrate on four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles and
trucks.
It is now marketing a range of Honda cars under its own badge in Japan,
while Honda is selling Isuzu sports/utility vehicles under the Honda badge
in the US and Japan.
Suzuki announced earlier this month that it had agreed with Fuji Heavy
Industries to supply a four-wheel drive version of its Hungarian-built
Suzuki Swift small car range for sale in Europe under Fuji Heavy Industries'
Subaru brand-name.
Meanwhile, Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel and Isuzu said they would begin
supplying commercial vehicles to each other from May next year. Nissan,
which has suffered heavy losses for two years, also announced that it was to
transfer 60 assembly-line workers to Nissan Diesel, its truck manufacturing
affiliate, for six months from October.
Nissan has already seconded 100 workers to Fuji Heavy Industries and 250
workers to Isuzu Motors.
Nissan's domestic vehicle production fell by 19.9 per cent year-on-year in
August to 96,517, the 26th successive monthly decline.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Holden Automotive ahead at
ADollars 162.6m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Holden Automotive, the Australian carmaker, saw net profit jump to ADollars
162.6m (USDollars 119.5m) in the year to June 30 from ADollars 98.2m in
1992-93. The company said the return on sales of 6.5 per cent was the
highest since 1989-90.
'A result like this doesn't come around every year but when it does, it sets
a more secure platform for our future, and evens out the low spots,' Mr Bill
Hamel, chairman and managing director, said.
Holden is a subsidiary of United Australian Automotive Industries, owned
equally by General Motors of the US and Toyoto Motor of Japan.
Holden said the 1993-94 performance confirmed its confidence in Australia
and in investments such as its ADollars 150m paint facility. It also
prepared the group for essential future investments. The company has said it
needs an annual profit of ADollars 100m in order to maintain its competitive
position.
Revenues for the year rose to ADollars 2.51bn from ADollars 1.92bn a year
earlier, reflecting the market acceptance of Commodore cars launched in July
1993, and a return of economic and consumer confidence. Vehicle sales grew
15.9 per cent to 109,371 in 1993-94 in a market which grew 6.6 per cent to
584,702.

He said also that Sasol 'would be prepared to come down to an equal
shareholding' with AECI.
Sasol currently owns 60 per cent and AECI 40 per cent of Polifin.
'Things are going extremely well with Polifin,' said Mr Johannes Stegmann,
Sasol chairman, who declined to give figures.
In the year to end-June. Sasol saw income before taxation rise by 33.2 per
cent to R2.45bn (Dollars 660m) from R1.84bn a year earlier on turnover 10.9
per cent ahead at R9.84bn compared with R8.88bn previously.
Attributable profit advanced 14.9 per cent tp R1.5bn from R1.3 bn.

<TEXT>
Continental Cablevision, the US cable company, Mr Kerry Packer's Nine
Network, Australia's leading commercial TV company, and the smaller Seven
Network are joining forces with Optus, the national telecommunications
group, in a joint venture to develop a broadband cable network.
The venture will spend more than ADollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) during the
next four years.
The cable system aims to deliver local telephone calls, pay television and -
by 1998 - interactive services to 50 per cent of Australian homes. The
initial services, which will include pay-TV and local telephony, are
expected during the third quarter of 1995.
Funding requirements for the joint venture company, to be called Optus
Vision, are put at about ADollars 2.5bn. Part will come from debt financing.
Yesterday, Mr Bob Mansfield, Optus chief executive, suggested that the
equity investment by the four partners could amount to ADollars 1bn-plus
during the first two years.
Optus will have a 35 per cent interest in the joint venture company, and
Continental Cablevision, 30 per cent. Nine Network, which earlier this year
agreed to subscribe ADollars 318m for a 15 per cent stake in Optus, will
take a 20 per cent holding. Seven Network will have 15 per cent interest.
Seven's involvement is controversial. Its chief shareholders include Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the government-owned Telstra
telecommunications group, both developing rival cable plans. The company
said that its decision was in the interest of all its shareholders.
Construction of the network is due, and much of it will involve aerial,
rather than underground, cabling. Optus conceded that local authorities were
still being approached for permission but announced co-operative agreements
with two electricity suppliers.
Optus promises to be the first network to deliver phone calls exclusively
over a fibre-coaxial system. The company competes with Telstra in the
long-distance market, and with Telstra and Vodaphone in the cellular phone
market. Owned by several corporate and institutional shareholders, it plans
to float on the stock market next year.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swissair trims halfway deficit

Swissair, the Swiss international airline group, suffered a SFr48m (Dollars
37m) net loss in the first half of 1994, compared with a SFr65m loss in the
same period of last year.
Fare wars in many markets combined with the strength of the Swiss franc to
undermine 'better than expected' growth in traffic and continuing progress
in cutting costs.
Nevertheless, the group said it was confident of achieving 'a considerably
better' net income in the full year. In 1993, net profit tumbled 48 per cent
to SFr59m and the group passed its dividend.
Revenues were down 3.9 per cent to SFr3bn in the first half and operating
profit reached only SFr10m, compared with a SFr1m loss, in spite of a 4.3
per cent cut in operating costs. Operating revenues included SFr47m in gains
from aircraft sales compared with SFr85m from this source a year earlier.
The group said it had suffered from the high Swiss franc, particularly in
Europe where much more of its costs than its revenues are in its home
currency. Overall, currency effects knocked more than SFr100m off revenues
and SFr50m off operating profits.
The Swissair airline itself achieved a 10.3 per cent advance in traffic
volume, and its total load factor improved 3.8 points to 66.3 per cent. The
airline said its strongest growing markets were Africa and the Asia Pacific
region. However, revenues were down 1 per cent.
Among subsidiaries, the Balair/CTA charter airline saw a 23 per cent rise in
demand but only a 7 per cent gain in revenues.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: First Interstate to shed jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
First Interstate, the California-based banking group, announced plans to cut
the equivalent of 3,000 full-time jobs as part of a move to raise
productivity levels to rival those of the most efficient super-regional
banks in the US.
The job cuts, out of a total of about 26,000, will come over the next 18
months, the bank said. It has already slashed staff numbers by some 10,000
since the end of the 1980s. The latest move, announced at an analysts'
meeting in New York, echoes the growing reliance of other US banks on
cost-cutting to maintain earnings growth.
At about 66 per cent last year, First Interstate's efficiency ratio (the
ratio of non-interest expenses to revenues) was higher than the average for
other big US regional banks. However, Mr Edward Carson, chief executive,
told analysts yesterday that the ratio had come down to 60 per cent by June
and was well on its way to reaching the earlier-announced target of 'at
least 58 per cent' next year.
The job cuts, and other changes to improve efficiency, will result in a
restructuring charge of Dollars 139m in the current quarter, and a further
Dollars 26m over the next year.
First Interstate has around 40 per cent of its assets in its home state of
California and the rest in other western states, which are among the fastest
growing in the US.
This, and the success with which it has already raised its profitability,
has boosted the company's share price at a time when other bank shares have
sagged. The bank's shares climbed Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 81 5/8
yesterday.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Upbeat outlook for US biotechs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US biotechnology industry continues to confound the pessimists and
flourish, in spite of the difficult economic and political climate,
according to the largest annual survey of biotech companies.
The Ernst &amp; Young report shows the combined revenues of 1,311 companies up
12 per cent to Dollars 11.2bn for the year to June 30 1994. Research and
development expenses rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 7bn, leading to a total
net loss for the industry of Dollars 4.1bn, compared with Dollars 3.6bn for
the previous year.
'Biotech is marching on, although lots of people are trying to write its
obituary,' said Mr Kenneth Lee, Ernst &amp; Young life sciences director. 'Even
healthcare reform, which many believed could lead to the demise of many
biotech companies, will actually provide a boost to the industry as the new
marketplace embraces and reimburses innovative therapies.'
Best evidence for the industry's health is the growing number of products
undergoing clinical trials - up from 270 a year ago to more than 300.
The report shows that the two most successful companies, Amgen and
Genentech, are far ahead of the rest. The Californian pair developed eight
of the 10 best-selling biotech drugs, and their combined market valuation of
Dollars 11.4bn accounts for more than a quarter of the whole industry's
capitalisation.
Ernst &amp; Young's main concern is whether biotech companies will be able to
raise enough new money from investors to fund current levels of R&amp;D. The
average company has enough cash in hand to remain in operation for the next
25 months at its current 'burn rate'; the comparable figure a year ago was
34 months.
Although venture capitalists invested Dollars 639m in biotech in 1993-94
(compared with Dollars 459m in the previous year) their money is moving from
early-stage companies to later-stage investments.
Biotech 95 is available free from Ernst &amp; Young LLP, 1451 California Avenue,
Palo Alto, California 94304, USA.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in BNP profits
confirms trend in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris, a leading French banking group, yesterday
affirmed the upward trend in the domestic financial sector by announcing a
steep increase in net profits to FFr914m (Dollars 172m) for the first half
from FFr522m in the same period last year.
BNP's 75 per cent rise in interim profits reflects the continuing recovery
in the industry as France's banks, which have had a tough time over the past
two years, benefit from the general easing of economic conditions.
Banque Indosuez, the investment banking subsidiary of the Suez group, last
week announced an increase in first-half profits and other large banks are
expected to follow suit in the course of the current interim reporting
season, with the notable exception of Credit Lyonnais, the ailing
state-controlled bank.
Analysts are braced for another loss when Credit Lyonnais's interim figures
are published tomorrow.
One of the main factors behind the improvement in BNP's performance was a
reduction in provisioning, according to Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman.
BNP, like other French banks, was last year forced to make hefty write-downs
on poorly performing property investments and small company loans.
However, it managed to restrict net provisions to FFr4.02bn during the first
half, 22 per cent lower than in the 1993 interim period.
Canal-Plus, the French pay-TV group, yesterday disclosed a 25.6 per cent
fall in interim net profits to FFr503m for the first half of 1994 from
FFr676m in the same period last year due to losses on some associate
companies and the burden of FFr62m of financial costs against a FFr31m
credit for 1993.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three top Micron executives quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three top executives of Micron Technology, a US memory chip
manufacturer, have resigned abruptly for 'personal reasons'. No further
explanation for the unexpected resignations was offered.
The sudden resignation of Mr Joseph Parkinson, chairman and chief executive
and one of Micron's founders, Mr James Garrett, president and chief
operating officer, and Mr Reid Langrill, chief financial officer, baffled
analysts.
A possible explanation for the management shake-up is a rift with the
company's biggest shareholder, Mr John Simplot, chairman of J. R. Simplot,
an agribusiness company, who controls 21.5 per cent of Micron's shares,
analysts said.
Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is locked in competition with much larger
Korean, Japanese and US memory chip producers but has been performing well
as demand for memory chips outpaces supplies, boosting prices.
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, ending June 2, Micron reported
net income of Dollars 259m, or Dollars 2.47 a share, up sharply from the
previous year when the first nine months net income was Dollars 41m, or 41
cents. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 1994 totalled Dollars
1.1bn, compared with Dollars 522m for the nine months ended June 3 1993.
Micron is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings statement this
week, with analysts projecting strong earnings of about Dollars 1.12 a
share.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Banco Wiese, the first Peruvian company to be listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, were expected to open at about Dollars 15 a share
today.
The listing is under the ADR Level 3 mechanism, and should allow Banco Wiese
to raise between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m. This represents about 10 per
cent of the bank's total value. Three-quarters of the new issue has been
offered in the US, the remainder in Europe and Peru.
Banco Wiese is Peru's second-largest private bank, after Banco de Credito
but ahead of the state-owned Continental which is scheduled for
privatisation early next year.
It now accounts for some 21 per cent of all deposits in the Peruvian system,
compared with 5.5 per cent in 1988, and is among the more liquid shares
traded on Lima's small but active bourse.
The bank's offering is being closely followed in Lima. Several other
companies are contemplating ADR issues in the near future, including Pantel,
the fast-growing telecommunications group, and CPT, Lima's telephone
company, in which Telefonica International recently acquired a controlling
stake.

foreigner to main board

<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals multinational, yesterday announced an infusion
of fresh blood - and foreign experience - into top management.
Mr Ernest Drew, 57, chairman and chief executive of the group's Hoechst
Celanese US subsidiary, is to become the first foreign member of the main
board in the company's history.
Mr Horst Waesche, 54, president of Hoechst-Japan, will also join the board
after spending virtually his entire career in eastern Asia.
Mr Drew will replace Mr Hans Georg Janson on his retirement on January 10
next year, while Mr Waesche will take the seat of Mr Karl Holoubek. In the
interim, chairman Mr Jurgen Dormann, in office since spring, will reshuffle
boardroom responsibilities.
Mr Drew, whose only previous foreign working experience was in Canada, said
yesterday he had no preferences and no idea what he would be doing apart
from starting German lessons today.
However, he expected announcements in the next few months which would
indicate the future direction of the company. Mr Drew was until recently
head of a working party which reported to the board last month after
investigating possible structural changes in group operations.
These seem likely to include a more aggressive approach to investment in the
Asia Pacific region, where demand for chemicals and raw materials for
manufacturing is growing at double the rate in Europe.
Mr Waesche, who has worked for Hoechst in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
recently completed a restructuring of Japanese operations which he has run
since 1987.
The appointments appear to complete a top-level shake-out which started
shortly after Mr Dormann's arrival when the company announced that
membership of the management board was to be reduced from 11 to nine.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Azucarera counter-offer backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government has backed a domestic counter-offer for General
Azucarera, Spain's second-largest sugar company, rejecting a Pta5,100 per
share offer made by Generale Sucriere, a subsidiary of Saint-Louis, the
French food and paper group, and the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle.
Acor, Spain's third-largest sugar producer, has matched the offer in
co-operation with Banco Popular, the domestic retail bank and Acor's
traditional financial adviser, and Refinera de Portugal, the Portuguese
sugar cane refiner. Acor, which is owned on a co-operative basis by sugar
beet farmers, is seeking 30 per cent of Azucarera, with the Popular group
acquiring 10 per cent on a temporary basis and Refinera de Portugal looking
for 7 per cent.
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) agreed in July to a Pta20bn (Dollars 155m) sale
of its 47 per cent stake to Generale Sucriere and Tate &amp; Lyle, which already
jointly control 20 per cent. However, the agriculture ministry, which has
taken action in the past to prevent foreign takeovers of Spain's edible oils
sector, delayed the sale to the end of September.
BCH, which is anxious to maintain Azucarera's banking business after the
disposal of its share holding in the company, said it would be seeking
clarification directly from the agriculture ministry over the new offer for
its shares. It is understood to be aggrieved that its rival Popular group is
at the centre of the counter bid. 'Our view is the disposal should be good
for the sugar sector, good for Azucarera and good for BCH,' the bank said.
Industry analysts said, however, that BCH would probably have no option
other than to accept Acor's offer. 'BCH needs to sell out and raise
liquidity, but it is clear that the government does not want part of Spain's
EU sugar quota passing into foreign hands,' said Mr Juan Cueto, of
Ibersecurities, Madrid.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T sees 10% earnings dilution
from McCaw deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telephone group, expects its earnings to be diluted by at least
10 per cent in the first year of its ownership of McCaw Cellular
Communications, AT&amp;T said yesterday.
AT&amp;T said it would take 18 months to integrate McCaw fully into its
operations as a result of regulatory requirements. The Dollars 11.5bn
acquisition of McCaw was formally completed on Monday.
AT&amp;T said earnings would be diluted as a result of the issue of 209m shares
to pay for the merger. There would be further unspecified dilution due to
fees and other costs arising from the merger.
McCaw, the largest US operator of mobile phones, will be renamed AT&amp;T
Wireless Services. Its operational head will be Mr James Barksdale, McCaw
president and chief operating officer. Mr Craig McCaw, the company's
45-year-old founder, would sit on the AT&amp;T board, but play more of a
consulting role, AT&amp;T said.
Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said litigation by regional Bell telephone
companies to block the merger was largely a nuisance. 'We've obviously made
the judgment that the remaining risks do not warrant delaying any further.'
Under US Department of Justice terms, McCaw must offer access to its
networks to long-distance telephone companies competing with AT&amp;T, and
notify its customers.
This would take a minimum of seven months for any one market, and 18 months
for all the 105 local systems which McCaw controls. Until then, McCaw could
not offer its services under the AT&amp;T brand name, Mr Barksdale said.
Mr Allen said AT&amp;T, which is not constrained by the same 'equal access'
provisions as McCaw, would start offering wireless and wired services to
customers immediately, start-ing with the business market.
Mr Barksdale said McCaw's spending on capital investment and marketing would
not necessarily rise as a result of the merger. In particular, AT&amp;T had
access to cheaper finance than McCaw, which had very heavy borrowings. There
would be no job losses at McCaw, he said.
The deal leaves British Telecom holding 35.8m AT&amp;T shares, amounting to
about 2.3 per cent of the equity, in exchange for its McCaw stake.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Iridium raises further Dollars
733.5m in equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iridium, the international consortium building a global satellite system for
mobile phones, has raised a further Dollars 733.5m in equity, which
completes its equity financing.
This brings the amount raised to Dollars 1.57bn and opens the way for debt
financing for the Dollars 3.4bn project conceived by Motorola, the US-based
electronics group.
Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, heads the list of new investors
with a Dollars 140m investment as part of its strategy announced earlier
this week to expand its telecommunications operations.
Veba's commitment represents Dollars 70m in new investment and an assumption
of Dollars 70m of Motorola's existing commitment.
Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corporation leads a group of Korean
companies investing Dollars 70m. Other new investors include Inepar, the
Brazilian energy and telecoms group.
More than Dollars 400m of the Dollars 733.5m comes from existing investors
which include US groups Lockheed and Sprint, Bell Canada and 18 Japanese
companies including Sony and Mitsubishi.
Iridium is one of several groups seeking to build satellite networks for
mobile phones.
The intended market is international business travellers and regions without
existing infrastructure for cellular communications.
Last week, Inmarsat, the London-based international maritime satellite
communications organisation, launched a company aiming to raise Dollars 1bn
in equity from its 75 members by the end of the year.
Globalstar, another consortium in the market, is being developed by Loral,
the US defence group, and Qualcomm, a California high-technology supplier.
Globalstar has raised nearly Dollars 300m from investors such as the French
telecommunications groups Alcatel Alsthom and France Telecom.
Iridium's network will comprise a constellation of 66 low-orbit satellites.
Subscribers will access the network through dual mode handsets connected to
earth-based mobile cellular networks.
Iridium's services will include voice, data, paging and fax. The group, with
more than 4,000 employees, is developing its network and negotiating rights
of access with regulatory authorities worldwide.
Mr Robert Kinzie, chief executive, said: 'With the commitment of the US
government to license low earth-orbit satellite systems by the end of
January 1995, and the associated grant of interim construction waivers,
Iridium's satellite personal communications system will be available
worldwide by the end of 1998.'

Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer, yesterday
announced it would sell part of its US and international services activities
to Wang of the US for Dollars 160m in cash, bonds and shares.
The French group will take a 5 per cent stake in the US company and a seat
on Wang's board.
The US company will also become a distributor of Bull products, including
its Unix open systems and its Data Zenith Systems personal computers.
The companies described the deal as a strategic alliance. Mr Axel le Blois,
chief executive of Bull Information Systems, said the agreement would give
Bull critical mass in servicing clients and provide financial resources for
its other US activities, including ZDS and its enterprise server business.
Mr Joe Tucci, chief executive of Wang, said the accord would expand the
company's customer services, solutions integration, and software activities.
By the deal, Bull will sell a number of service activities of Bull HN, its
US subsidiary. Wang will acquire Bull's HFSI federal systems integration
business, which operates exclusively with the US government.

Commerzbank yesterday announced a further move into eastern Europe with the
planned purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Bank Rozwoju Eksportu (Export
Development Bank), a privately-owned Polish bank specialising in export and
corporate finance.
The German bank said its interest in the bank, founded in 1986 and now with
10 branches, was strategic. The stake requires the approval of NBP, the
Polish central bank. The central bank said it would only consider the
application after Bank Rozwoju Eksportu has held its next shareholders'
meeting in mid-October.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: AEG to spin off drive system
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz's shrinking AEG subsidiary is to spin off its drive systems
operations into a joint venture with France's Cegelec, a member of the
Alcatel Alsthom group.
The loss-making German company will be the junior partner with a 49 per cent
stake in a business turning over DM1.4bn (Dollars 890m) annually - DM600m
from AEG - which will fall under management control of Cegelec.
The undertaking would be one of the world's leading suppliers of project and
drive systems with factories in four European countries, the US, Australia
and China, AEG said.
The move marks a further step in AEG's slimming and restructuring programme,
launched last December with the announcement of the sale of its household
appliances business to Electrolux, the Swedish multinational group.
Electrolux has since paid DM730m for the 80 per cent of the AEG operations
it did not own.
Other measures include the establishment of a 50:50 joint venture in
computer controls for plant and machinery with the French group Schneider.
Philips of the Netherlands bought the lighting technology business, and the
remnants of the Olympia office equipment division were sold to Hong Kong's
Elite group.
Meanwhile, AEG has taken control of most of the Daimler-Benz group's
microelectronics interests and absorbed the high-performance diesel engine
operations of MTU.
It is in the process of expanding its electronic mail-sorting equipment arm
through a Dollars 260m agreed takeover of ElectroCom, a Texas-based group.
Although AEG has forecast a further deficit this year after a DM1.2bn net
loss in 1993, improving world demand for industrial plant and electrical
components is expected to help it towards its goal of breaking even in 1995.
Its railways division, for example, yesterday forecast annual turnover would
rise almost a third to about DM3bn in the next five years due to DM5bn of
outstanding orders.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: CS Holding in Swiss regional
bank rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit
Suisse, has launched a SFr905.6m (Dollars 686m) rescue package and agreed
takeover bid for Neue Aargauer Bank (NAB), Switzerland's largest regional
bank.
The move follows a review of NAB's credit standing which revealed a need for
extraordinary writedowns of about SFr200m.
This is the latest and largest development in the consolidation among
Switzerland's smaller banks. Many of the these banks, which specialise in
mortgage lending and credits for small and medium-sized businesses, were
badly hurt in the recession and property price slump of the early 1990s, and
have been unable to get back on their feet.
The Spar und Leihkasse Thun, near Bern, collapsed in 1991, leaving deposit
holders with large losses. The country's leading banks, seeking to protect
Swiss banking's image, put in place a rescue procedure which has prevented
any subsequent failures.
The process of mergers and acquisitions by the bigger banks has caused the
number of regional banks to tumble to 155 at the end of last year from 238
in 1988. The pace appears to be accelerating following a tightening of bank
auditing standards.
NAB, established in 1989 by the merger of two regional banks in the canton
of Argovie, claimed total assets of SFr9.2bn at the end of 1993 supported by
equity of SFr457.4m.
In an initial step, Credit Suisse is advancing a SFr200m convertible loan to
NAB. Conversion of the loan at SFr2,000 per share and other options on NAB
shares held by Credit Suisse would give it 34 per cent of the bank's
capital.
Meanwhile, CS Holding is offering three of its bearer shares and three of
its registered shares for each of the remaining NAB shares, equivalent to
SFr2,016 a share at Monday's closing prices. This values NAB at SFr705.6m.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann profits rise 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GUTERSLOH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, the German media group, boosted net profits 15 per cent to
DM759m (Dollars 489m) for the year to June 30, helped by rapidly expanding
US operations.
Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said conditions had become more difficult
in the first quarter of this year as margins tightened in the printing
business, excluding newspapers, which generates about 20 per cent of group
profits.
However, he said earnings this year would improve slightly, helped by an
economic recovery in Germany. He forecast that turnover would reach
DM20.8bn.
Turnover rose 7.2 per cent last year to DM18.4bn, helped by a strong dollar.
Accounting for currency movements, turnover was up 5.9 per cent.
The annual profit was struck after the group wrote-off DM435m for start-up
costs for Vox, Premiere and other television and music ventures. Writes-offs
for Vox, the financially troubled television station in which Bertelsmann
holds a 24.9 per cent stake, exceeded DM100m.
Mr Wossner said that book clubs and all print media interests remained the
most profitable divisions, contributing 80 per cent of net profits.
Adjusting for currency movements, US turnover rose 13 per cent to DM6.9bn
and accounted for a third of operating profits of DM1.49bn.
The Bertelsmann music group, based mainly in the US, saw sales rise 16 per
cent to DM5.3bn.
Foreign activities made up about 67 per cent of sales and the company
forecast that this share would rise to around 75 per cent in 2000.

FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: BHF-Bank to simplify structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-Bank, the eighth largest private sector bank in Germany, plans to turn
itself into a joint stock company and to shed its partnership status as part
of its strategy to become one of the leading advisory and trading banks in
Europe.
As the bank's shares are already quoted in Frankfurt - at yesterday's share
price of DM387, a rise of DM2, the market capitalisation was DM3.1bn - the
legal change will have no consequences for its ownership. About half the
share capital is in firm hands, including those of Allianz, the German
insurance group, which owns 16 per cent. About a quarter of the capital is
held abroad.
The bank said the move to joint stock or AG (Aktiengesellschaft) status
would provide it with a simpler internal structure, enabling managers to
concentrate more effectively on their specialised fields. That would make
sense to foreign shareholders who are sometimes confused by the idea of a
quoted bank run on a partnership basis.
The change will be proposed to the annual meeting in May. BHF's operating
profits rose by 20.5 per cent last year to DM323m (Dollars 205.7m), with
group assets nearly 18 per cent higher at DM55bn. In the first half of 1994,
operating profits were flat at DM148m.
The bank's six general partners are at present personally liable for the
business. They need to keep abreast of aspects of the bank's activities
outside their specialities. BHF said it wanted to instil the principle of
'performance-oriented entrepreneurship' at all levels.
The bank will pay more attention to merchant banking, expand its equities
side and concentrate more on serving wealthy investors. In corporate
business, BHF will position itself as a leading advisory bank for medium to
large German companies.
BHF said its co-operation with IKB Deutsche Industriekreditbank,
specialising in long-term finance to small and medium-sized companies, will
be intensified.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAJEEV MEHTA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcall, the duty doctor organisation, is buying, through its Healthcall
Services subsidiary, Medical Support Personnel for up to Pounds 1.85m.
Medical Support's trading arm, Euromed reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
326,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.1m in the year to October 31. Net assets at
the end of the period were Pounds 132,000.
Mr Maurice Henchey, Healthcall's chief executive, said the acquisition
fitted his company's strategy of expanding the services it offers to its
9,500 GPs and patients. He said Healthcall intended to continue to expand
both organically and through acquisition. An initial Pounds 1.07m will be
paid on completion and satisfied by Pounds 603,000 cash, Pounds 220,000 in
loan notes and Pounds 250,000 in shares. A further payment of about Pounds
750,000 in cash will be related to post tax profits.
Euromed specialises in placing medical professionals, such as chiropodists,
dieticians and psychologists on temporary and occasionally permanent
placements with hospitals, health centres, GPs and industrial clients.
Healthcall's share price closed unchanged yesterday at 104p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: APH rises 19% to Pounds 2.54m at interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive Precision Holdings, the Tonbridge-based precision engineering
company which came to the market in May at 100p, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 19 per cent at Pounds 2.54m, against Pounds 2.12m, in the six
months to June 30.
Mr Stefan Petszaft, managing director, said the result was in line with
expectations. The shares were unchanged.
Turnover at the group, which exports between 90 and 93 per cent of its
products, expanded to Pounds 9.51m (Pounds 7.62m) and operating profits
emerged at Pounds 2.61m (Pounds 2.14m).
Mr Petszaft said there would be some margin slippage from the former high
levels. 'We take jobs in . . . and then work away at the cost base.'
The parts the group makes are 'difficult to manufacture with tight
tolerances and we have to adopt a zero defect philosophy', said Mr Petszaft.
However, first deliveries were now going out for five new contracts started
in the half.
These included Jaguar, Bosch, Nacam and Lucas.
In the past 18 months, the group doubled the number of its customers: mostly
in the UK and Germany.
Mr Petszaft said that the general market had been more buoyant for the past
12 months and that most of the components made by the group - in power
steering, air conditioning, fuel injection and electronically controlled
diesel engines - could look forward to growth.
Earnings per share came out at 4.2p (3.4p) and, as was flagged at the
flotation, there will be no dividend.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: All-round increase lifts Bodycote 10.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increases in all divisions enabled Bodycote, the metal technology, packaging
and textiles company, to announce a 10.5 per cent advance in pre-tax profits
for the first half of 1994.
The rise from Pounds 6.52m to Pounds 7.21m was struck on turnover ahead
almost 10 per cent at Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.7m).
The advance was underpinned by continued progress from the metal technology
side and a turnround from the second half of 1993 in the protective clothing
business.
The metal technology division lifted profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 5.56m
(Pounds 5.15m) on turnover of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 21.2m).
Mrs Claire Avery, company secretary, said the rise had been on the back of
greater demand from the automotive and aerospace industries for Bodycote's
'hot isostatic processing' - hipping - a process which removes the porosity
from metal.
Mrs Avery said demand was growing in the UK and the US and that the group
was developing the process to cope with larger components.
EHCO-KLM, the protective clothing and uniforms maker, made profits of Pounds
880,000 (Pounds 629,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.7m). This
represented a sharp improvement on losses of Pounds 118,000 in the second
half of 1993, which included closure and redundancy costs.
Stockpack, the contract packaging group, was now reaping the rewards of the
group's recent investment. High-tech machinery was leading to smaller labour
costs, Mrs Avery said.
The industrial and general division, of which Stockpack is the main
subsidiary, raised profits 9 per cent to Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 1.15m) on
turnover up at Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 3.77m).
Capital expenditure for 1994 is expected to match 1993's Pounds 15m, with
most going to the metal technology side and Stockpack. Gearing is
'negligible'. The interim dividend is lifted 7.5 per cent to 2.15p (2p),
payable from earnings per share of 8.28p (7.68p).
The share price closed 6p up at 322p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Merger helps lift Secure Trust 6% to Pounds
3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Secure Trust, the financial services group, reported a 6.2 per cent rise in
first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 3.94m.
Net interest income rose from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 2.57m. Fees and
commission rose from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 7.56m.
Mr Henry Angest, chairman, said that the group had benefited from merging
the Peoples Bank and Secure Homes into the Secure Trust Bank.
This enabled it to offer a wider range of services to the existing customer
base. The acquisition of Aitken Hume Bank, now renamed Arbuthnot Latham,
made it possible to offer new ranges of services.
Mr Stephen Lockley, finance director, said acquisitions and establishing
Arbuthnot Commercial Finance, a factoring operation, accounted for the rise
in administrative expenses from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 5.62m.
Most of the profit growth had come from Secure Trust Bank, he said, and from
the Household Cash Management business where consumer lending had increased.
The group's insurance broking business was slightly down on the first half
of last year.
The interim dividend was raised from 4.5p to 5p.
Earnings per share rose 7.5 per cent to 18.6p (17.3p).

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Antofagasta to raise Pounds 11.5m - Placing
to fund 45% stake in world's third largest copper deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antofagasta Holdings, the UK listed Chilean mining, rail and banking group,
is buying a further 45 per cent of the Los Pelambres mine, which controls
the world's third largest copper deposit.
The deal - which will cost Dollars 29.6m (Pounds 18.9m) - will give the
group a 65 per cent stake in the mine. The remainder is owned by Midland
Bank and Lucky-Goldstar, of South Korea.
It is being part funded by an Pounds 11.5m placement; the balance will be
satisfied in cash.
The pricing was agreed at the time of a debt-for-equity swap by Midland in
1989, and is extraordinarily favourable to Antofagasta.
A report by RTZ valued Los Pelambres' proven and probable reserves at
Dollars 158m, suggesting a Dollars 71m valuation for the 45 per cent stake.
The company is placing 3.74m new shares to institutions at 308p a share,
compared with yesterday's closing price of 323p.
Los Pelambres, which is in the Andes some 200 kilometres north of Santiago,
is estimated to have more than 1bn tonnes of copper-bearing material, and
some gold and silver deposits.
Current production is around 5,200 tonnes per day, but the company has
recently completed a feasibility study which suggests that open pit mining
could increase production to 60,000 tonnes.
Mr Christopher Jowett, finance director, said Los Pelambres would invest up
to Dollars 120m in developing the mining operations over the next 6 years,
in order to achieve these higher production targets.
Antofagasta also announced that pre-tax profits for the six months to June
30 fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 10.1m.
This reflected a fall in the copper price from a 1993 average of 92.4c per
lb to a 1994 average of 90.6c.
Profits from mining fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.2m.
The railway operations contributed Pounds 1.6m, down from Pounds 1.8m, as a
result of its sensitivity to the mining industry. Associates contributed
Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.7m).
For every 1c increase in the copper price, Antofagasta's earnings should
rise Dollars 700,000, and the current price of 115p suggests a stronger
performance in the second half.
The company increased its interim dividend from 1.2p to 1.45p. Earnings per
share before exceptionals were 5.4p (6.9p).

Pearson yesterday announced a restructuring of its publishing interests to
reflect its new strategy of concentrating on information, education and
entertainment.
Under the reorganisation which is due to be completed by the end of this
year publishing will be grouped by theme.
As a result there will be redundancies at Longman's offices in Harlow, Essex
because of the consolidation of some head office functions. Pearson did not
say how many jobs would go although it is believed to be about 100.
Following a briefing on the reorganisation for analysts the shares fell 19p
to close at 564p.
The reorganisation means:
Information - the business and professional publishing arms of the Financial
Times Group and Longman Group will be combined to form Pearson Professional,
a subsidiary with projected revenues of about Pounds 150m a year. The
businesses that will be brought together include FT Newsletters and FT
Conferences, Federal and Capital Publications and AsiaPacific Business and
Professional.
Education - the English language teaching and educational publishing
interests of Longman will be merged with Addison-Wesley to form
Addison-Wesley Longman with projected revenues of more than Pounds 360m.
Entertainment - Ladybird Books, the children's publisher will be added to
Penguin. Penguin's worldwide business has projected revenues of of about
Pounds 370m.
Pearson Professional will be run by Mr Peter Warwick, at present Longman's
deputy chief executive.
Addison-Wesley Longman will be headed by Mr Larry Jones who has recently
been appointed chief executive of Addison-Wesley. Ms Paula Kahn, who has
been chairman and chief executive of Longman for the past five years, will
leave the company at the end of this year.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson's managing director said that although some jobs
would go 'the changes are driven by the logic of our decision last year to
concentrate, as a media group, on opportunities in information, education
and entertainment. Those are our key markets, and we have to line up our
resources accordingly'.
Pearson said that the net impact of the reorganisation on the company's 1994
financial results should not be material.
Earlier this month Pearson announced a 50 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 69.3m for the six months to the end of June. The results, and
hints of difficulties in the book market led to a 31p drop in the share
price to 628p.
Mr Richard Dale, media analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court said yesterday
that the change would have little effect in the short term. 'Over the longer
term, hopefully, it will engender a degree of communality.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BM makes Canadian disposal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the engineering concern, took a further step in the disposal of
its Blackwood Hodge interests with the sale of Blackwood Hodge (Canada) in a
deal worth Pounds 4.5m. It could raise a further Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m from
the sale of assets being retained.
The company is being sold for a nominal sum to a consortium including local
management and Mr Howard Sutton, who resigned as chief executive last year
after announcing higher than expected restructuring costs. The consortium
also includes Mr Ronald Strasser a former non-executive director of BM.
The deal includes the repayment of intercompany loans of Pounds 1.2m. In
addition BM will be relieved of bank borrowings, stock finance and finance
leases amounting to Pounds 3.3m.
As a result of earlier provisions and taking into account the Canadian
company's trading losses, BM said the sale would have a positive impact on
net assets. BHC lost Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 4.1m) before tax and exceptionals
on turnover of Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 65.2m) for the 1993-94 year.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Southern News rises to Pounds 11.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A gain of Pounds 3.5m on the sale of a stake in rival Portsmouth &amp;
Sunderland Newspapers helped Southern Newspapers to lift annual profits by
more than half.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended July 2 rose from Pounds 7.51m to Pounds
11.4. The figure included Pounds 789,000 (Pounds 868,000) from other
operations, mainly related to a Bournemouth industrial estate, and
exceptional costs of Pounds 1.22m related to a plant closure.
Operating profits from the main businesses of newspaper publishing and
contract printing rose from Pounds 5.93m to Pounds 8.24m. Total turnover
improved from Pounds 71m to Pounds 76.9m, including Pounds 1m from
acquisitions.
Mr James Sexton, chief executive, said yesterday that he was pleased with
the performance. The group remains ungeared, and is planning to fund from
its own resources Pounds 25m of capital expenditure over the next two years
on relocating its printing operations in Southampton and purchasing a new
web offset colour press.
Capital expenditure for 1993-94 was Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5m), and the group
ended the year with Pounds 5.8m cash (Pounds 4.3m).
The newspaper division, which publishes three daily and 30 weekly newspapers
in southern England, reported advertising revenues ahead by 9.4 per cent,
with the most significant increase coming in employment advertising.
National advertising taken through the London office rose by 18 per cent to
Pounds 6m.
Overall circulation levels were ahead by a little more than 2 per cent, but
the dailies in Bournemouth and Southampton showed a small decline.
Magazine printing, including Exchange &amp; Mart, contributed Pounds 23m to
total turnover. The group, which has concentrated all its magazine printing
in Upton, near Poole, said volumes had increased dramatically, but margins
remained tight.
Earnings per share were 39.27p, up from a previous 22.73p. Excluding
exceptionals, the latest earnings figure is 29.19p. A proposed final
dividend of 10p makes the total for the year 13.5p (11.8p).

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wassall 21% ahead at Pounds 11.8m -
Newly-acquired General Cable contributes Pounds 1.2m in just 22 days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wassall, the conglomerate that nearly trebled its annual sales with the
Pounds 177m acquisition of US-based General Cable in June, increased pre-tax
profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 11.8m in the six months to June 30.
General Cable contributed a profit of Pounds 1.2m in 22 days and Mr Chris
Miller, chief executive, predicted that it would enhance group earnings in
its first year.
Wassall has cut more than 20 per cent of General Cable's 300 strong head
office and appointed a new chief executive in Mr Steven Rabinowitz, formerly
with General Electric and Allied Signal.
General Cable's huge copper stocks have already been reduced by 10 per cent.
Wassall believes that eventually it will be able to hedge up to 70 per cent
of its copper exposure, but meanwhile it is able to pass on the rising metal
price to its customers.
It also faces rising polypropylene and aluminium costs in its bottle tops
business where Mr Miller admits price increases are very difficult to pass
on. But he predicted the effects would be outweighed by continued volume
growth.
The closures division recorded 10 per cent volume growth in Europe, helped
by good weather, expansion in eastern Europe and the success of Coca-Cola's
new half litre bottle which is taking market share from cans.
Closures profits rose to Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 4.96m) despite a downturn in
South Africa reflecting the uncertainty and upheaval caused by the
elections. Mr Miller forecast a better second half in South Africa and
added: 'Business confidence is better than it has been for years though
whether that translates into real orders remains to be seen.'
Excluding General Cable and exchange rate movements the existing businesses
increased operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 12m with the
contribution from DAP, the US DIY products supplier, up 31 per cent to
Pounds 4.99m.
Turnover from the existing businesses rose to Pounds 137.6m (Pounds 133.1m)
while General Cable contributed Pounds 42.6m.
Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 4.7p.
The interim dividend is up 19 per cent to 1.15p.
The shares fell 11p to 286p.
COMMENT
The slide in Wassall's share price yesterday had more to do with its
strength since the General Cable deal than with any concerns about the
figures. Virtually all the existing businesses are performing well and Mr
Miller is so confident about General Cable that he said the group could take
on another acquisition outside the US if the opportunity arose. He is
predicting margins of 4 per cent at General Cable in 1995 which should power
profits from around Pounds 36m this year to perhaps Pounds 52m. That puts
the shares on a multiple of 22, falling to 17. Demanding certainly, but the
Wassall team's record is hard to beat.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UK catering improvement helps Brake advance
24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improvement in the UK catering market helped to lift pre-tax profits at
Brake Bros, the frozen food distributor, which yesterday announced a 24 per
cent rise from Pounds 7.14m to Pounds 8.86m for the six months to June 30.
Group turnover lifted 18 per cent from Pounds 160.5m to Pounds 188.9m,
including a full six months' sales from Country Choice Foods, a frozen
products supplier which was purchased in May 1993. Operating profit rose 19
per cent to Pounds 9.26m (Pounds 7.78m).
However, the group's performance was held back by its UK chilled food
catering operation, Larderfresh, which made losses of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds
1.1m). Brake Bros sees the venture, which was launched in August 1993, as
part of its long-term strategic development.
The cost of establishing food distribution activities in France increased,
with operating losses standing at Pounds 1.1m (nil). The French activities
are not expected to make a substantial contribution this year.
Mr William Brake, chairman, said: 'while the costs of entering France are
proving greater than expected, the directors are confident that action taken
in getting into place a strong management structure, linked to the many
improvements already introduced, will enable the board to achieve its goal
of creating a business emulating that in the UK.'
Underlying sales at the company's core UK frozen foods business grew 6 per
cent, and are expected to perform soundly for the rest of the year.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 644,000 to Pounds 392,000, thanks to
reduced borrowings and lower interest rates.
Gearing was reduced from 5.9 per cent at December 31 to nil, after a net
cash inflow of Pounds 9.6m.
Earnings per share lifted 11 per cent to 11.1p (10p) and the interim
dividend increased by 15 per cent to 2.3p (2p).
The shares closed up 1p at 418p yesterday.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone emerging trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone is planning to launch a new investment trust concentrating
on emerging markets. It hopes to raise about Pounds 40m for the trust,
writes Bethan Hutton.
The management team for the Murray Emerging Economies Trust will be led by
Mr Rodger Scullion, who is already responsible for the Murray Smaller
Markets investment trust, which has considerable holdings in emerging
mark-ets.
Murray Johnstone has a total of about Pounds 300m under management in
emerging markets through a number of retail and institutional funds.
The new trust will follow the International Finance Corporation's definition
of emerging markets, which currently includes 25 countries. Unlike many
emerging market fund managers.
An institutional placing of shares in the trust will be taking place over
the next few weeks, with a public offer for subscription scheduled for early
November.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Offer gives Attwoods chief a disturbed
night - A look the Browning Ferris bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, undoubtedly had a rude awakening
yesterday morning. At some time about 3am he was roused from bed to hear
that he had been sold out, not only by his largest shareholder but also
three of his fellow directors.
The men from Laidlaw who negotiated the deal to sell the Canadian company's
29.8 per cent stake, which resulted in yesterday's hostile Pounds 364m cash
bid from Browning Ferris Industries, have been on the Attwoods board since
1990.
Relations have been strained for some time, however. And Laidlaw's comments
yesterday left no doubt that its disappointment with the investment was
increasing.
Yet Mr Foreman argues the worst is behind Attwoods, and the bid
substantially undervalues its recovery potential. Investors might be
forgiven for thinking they have heard such optimistic comments before, after
the cash calls, disposals, and management changes of the last four years.
Attwoods has long had a credibility problem with UK investors. In recent
years their interest has fallen to just 25-30 per cent of the shares.
The company has been plagued by rumours of Mafia links, which have been
denied, following the takeover of a US company in 1984. The group's US
subsidiaries, and some former US directors, have also at various times been
the focus of government investigations for alleged bribery, fraud and
corruption. Finally, Attwoods has faced regulatory problems in the US which
have led to a series of law suits.
Mr Foreman himself sits uneasily with the pinstriped brigades in the City of
London. A small man, permanently suntanned as a result of his preference for
his Florida home, Mr Foreman most often hits the headlines as the third
husband of Mandy Rice-Davies.
It was Mr Foreman's waste business, Drinkwater Sabey, which reversed into
Attwoods Garages in 1982 and came to the market with ADT, the security and
car auctions group, as a substantial shareholder. Laidlaw arrived in 1989,
after a complicated asset swap involving ADT and Attwoods.
Mr Foreman built the company through a series of acquisitions. He attracted
influential support, including Sir Denis Thatcher, who retired earlier this
year after 10 years as deputy chairman.
By 1990 finances were getting stretched. Within 16 months it called on
shareholders for Pounds 162m in two rights issues. The second was only
successful when Laidlaw agreed to underwrite a substantial proportion of the
issue.
Since then, Laidlaw's support has been poorly repaid. In 1991 it wrote off
half the value of its Dollars 900m (Pounds 580m) investment. Pre-tax profits
have plunged from Pounds 28.5m in 1990 to last year's loss of Pounds 62.2m,
after a Pounds 91m writeoff on disposals. Forecasts are for Pounds 20m after
exceptionals for 1994, still some way from the peak of Pounds 39m.
Nevertheless Mr Foreman says Attwoods is now set for its best year for some
time. Recovery is beginning in the US and UK, while Germany has at least got
no worse.
Attwoods' defence will draw strongly on the recovery story. However, a
greater challenge will be to convince investors of the management story.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hays expands to Pounds 87.8m - Personnel
recruitment in the UK and Australia give profit boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rebound in profits from personnel recruitment agencies helped Hays,
the business services group, increase pre-tax profits by 32 per cent, from
Pounds 66.6m to Pounds 87.8m, in the year to June 30.
Operating profits from the personnel division, which mainly supplies
accountancy staff, jumped from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 16.4m as continuing
economic recovery in the UK and Australia brought increasing demand for
staff, said Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman.
Hays' biggest business sector, distribution, increased operating profits by
29 per cent to Pounds 49.1m, helped by a strong performance on Continental
Europe.
The group said that Fril, the French distribution company it bought in 1992,
increased profits substantially in spite of the background of the continuing
recession in France. It had also won a number of new contracts with food
retailers and manufacturers.
Mordhorst, the German distributor acquired last year, exceeded expectations
in 'very competitive' trading conditions. Group operating profits from
Continental Europe more than doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 17.4m.
In the UK both the dedicated distribution and specialist distribution
divisions increased their profits. Network distribution - the multi-user
arms which serves manufacturers - made especially strong progress. New
contracts with a total annual sales value of Pounds 20m had been won.
The bulk products division of chemical distribution saw a decline in profits
as the worldwide pressure on caustic soda prices continued throughout the
year. Both the packaged products and specialist chemicals divisions
increased profits substantially. The group's commercial businesses increased
operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 27.3m.
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 14.7p (11.5p). A final dividend of
4.15p gives a total for the year of 6.1p (5.3p), an increase of 15 per cent.
COMMENT
These better than expected results were an impressive way to mark what is
nearly the fifth anniversary of Hays' flotation - a period that has seen the
group's market value nearly treble, in spite of a recession which damaged
the reputation of many other business services and logistics companies. The
bounce in profits from personnel caught the eye, but the strong performance
by the core distribution activities was less predictable. Although spending
Pounds 100m on acquisitions and capital expenditure has pushed up gearing
from 13 to 44 per cent, strong cash generation means the group still has
scope to make further acquisitions, particularly in Europe. Forecast profits
of Pounds 105m put the shares, up 6p yesterday to 287p, on a prospective
multiple of 16.4 - a 15 per cent premium to the market. That does not seem
unreasonable for shares that have outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by
91 per cent since flotation.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins confirms recovery with 83%
leap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travis Perkins yesterday confirmed the recovery in the building materials
market, with an 83 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.31m to
Pounds 17.06m for the first half of 1994.
The figure included Pounds 1.77m from property sales and a three-month
contribution from AAH builders merchants - which Travis paid Pounds 41.8m
for in March - worth Pounds 1.61m at the operating level. AAH also added
just over Pounds 23m to total turnover, which increased 29 per cent to
Pounds 215.6m (Pounds 166.8m).
Earnings per share jumped 89 per cent to 11.2p (5.9p). The interim dividend
was raised 12 per cent to 2.8p (2.5p).
Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said that the AAH deal had moved the company from
seventh to joint-second place among UK builders materials groups, which had
enabled it to benefit from economies of scale.
Net operating margins at the new subsidiary had been doubled, while for the
group as a whole they rose from 5.4 per cent to 7 per cent.
Price rises in the materials business had been successfully passed on to
customers, with Mr Travis putting inflation in the industry at about 7 per
cent.
Although the housing market was showing only moderate signs of recovery,
sales to the repair and maintenance side of the business - about 70 per cent
of Travis's turnover - had improved markedly. London and the south-east were
proving stronger than the group's other operating centres.
Mr Travis said that the company's aim was to increase its present UK market
share of some 6.5 per cent to 9 per cent. 'A small amount of this will be
achieved through organic growth, but most of it realistically will be
through acquisitions,' although he added that the company was currently
interested only in 'bedding down' AAH, rather than make fresh purchases.
COMMENT
Travis' solid record of controlling costs and focusing on the bottom line
has worked its way through to AAH's margins. The main part of the business
has reported margins at the top end of the industry range. The company is
better geographically spread than before and also has the benefit of being
well placed in the recovery cycle. Full-year profit forecasts were being
ratcheted up an average 15 per cent to about Pounds 33m on yesterday's
performance, giving prospective earnings per share of above 21 times and a
prospective p/e of 13 times. This is slightly below the sector average and
compares well with competitors Wolseley (currently on about 15 times) and
Meyer International (about 13.5 times).

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tomkinsons shares dive 10% after warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tomkinsons, the carpet manufacturer, dived more than 10 per cent
from 240p to 215p yesterday, after the company said second half results
would be below market expectations, with trading running at a similar level
to the first six months.
The company said trading conditions in the home furnishings sector had
continued to be very difficult and demand for carpets had been very
depressed during the summer.
Recently however, there had been some signs of a modest strengthening of
demand.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 430,000 to Pounds 332,000 in the six months
to April 2, but the interim dividend was held at 3.5p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews rises 80% to Pounds 8.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bernard Matthews, the poultry and meat producer, bucked the
market's downward trend yesterday by rising 6p to 127p, in response to an 80
per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 8.36m for the
28 weeks to July 27.
Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said both profits and turnover had benefited
from organic growth and acquisitions. Operating profits swelled to Pounds
9.25m (Pounds 5.09m), with acquisitions adding Pounds 2.82m (nil) to
continuing operations, which rose 26 per cent to Pounds 6.43m.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 137.1m (Pounds 88.9m), which included Pounds
33m from acquisitions.
In the past year, Matthews bought Turners Turkeys from Unigate for about
Pounds 12m at the end of 1993 and acquired Advanced Foods, the state-owned
New Zealand lamb business for an undisclosed sum in April. Mr Matthews said
the acquisitions represented a change of company policy, after years of
organic growth.
Mr Matthews said that whole turkeys now accounted for less than 10 per cent
of the group's business, with Christmas turkeys less than 6 per cent, though
he stressed that that side of the business had not shrunk, merely that the
contribution from value-added products had grown.
Sales of both branded cooked meats and fresh meat products continued to
expand though the group was suffering losses in France and Germany - markets
it recently entered with four products in each. A Pounds 1.2m advertising
campaign in Germany was currently running on TV to introduce consumers to
the company as well as to increase volume sales of the products.
Earnings rose to 4.54p (2.5p) and the interim dividend is lifted 20 per cent
to 1.32p (1.1p).

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Servisair forecasts 31% increase to Pounds
4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Servisair, Europe's largest independent ground handling
company, are forecast to increase by 31 per cent to Pounds 4.2m in 1994, the
company revealed in its pathfinder prospectus.
Profits growth will be aided by the March 1994 acquisition of Ogden Aviation
Services, although this will result in Pounds 1.4m of reorganisation costs,
taken as an exceptional item. The management is confident that substantial
cost benefits will follow next year.
The company is expected to raise Pounds 9.5m from the sale of new shares
from the placing and intermediaries offer, while its parent, Securum, will
sell 60 per cent of its stake. The company will be valued at close to Pounds
60m.
Servisair has been benefiting from an expected 6 per cent increase in
passenger throughput in the UK this year as it operates in all the country's
main airports, with the exception of Heathrow.
Servisair accounted for around 37 per cent of passenger traffic within its
network of 22 UK airports, and is confident of increasing its presence as
airlines pass on peripheral services.
Profit margins on aircraft handling are extremely low. Servisair achieved
operating profit margins of around 4 per cent in 1993, making it
unattractive for operators lacking critical mass.
In addition, British Airports Authority has started to devolve some of its
monopoly operations, such as baggage handling, and a limited number of
independent companies are competing for the contracts.
Servisair also plans to compete for contracts in Europe. In Spain, the
government has committed to opening up 16 airports to competition, and other
countries are likely to follow.
The prospectus is expected to be published on October 5 and dealings should
commence on October 18. The sponsor is Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bryant jumps 99% after completions surge in
north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in completions in the north of England caused a 99 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits at Bryant Group, the Midlands-based housebuilder.
In the year to May 31 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 36.5m
on turnover up from Pounds 310m to Pounds 392m. Operating profits rose from
Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 37.7m.
Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the development of a
multi-regional structure had strengthened the homes division and put it in a
position to benefit from a steady improvement in the UK economy.
'We will see volume increases on the back of our regional expansion,' he
said.
The homes division contributed 78 per cent of turnover and 90 per cent of
operating profit. It had been helped to a strong start in 1994 by fixed rate
mortgages, Mr MacKenzie said.
The division recorded a 15 per cent increase in financial completions to a
record 3,255. The main 'growth in Homes has come from Northern,' Mr
Mackenzie said. There were 400 completions from Yorkshire and the North
West.
Selling prices rose from Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 95,000
Sales since May were 30 per cent higher than the same period last year and
provided the position Bryant needed to achieve its target of 15 per cent
growth for 1995.
The luxury homes division Bryant Country Homes, with average selling prices
of Pounds 300,000, saw its first 15 completions. Mr MacKenzie said initial
setting up costs had led to small deficits for Country Homes and Scotland.
The land market had become increasingly competitive and was likely to remain
difficult, he said.
'The planning system, particularly in the south east, is consistently
failing to provide an adequate supply for market needs.'
Bryant increased its directly held land bank by 1,000 lots to 9,200.
Gearing stood at 14 per cent compared with a cash positive position last
year.
Earnings per share rose from 4.9p to 8.9p. A final dividend of 3.6p (3.4p)
has been recommended.
COMMENT
These results exceeded even the top end of expectations, and with them
Bryant brings a sense of security to a sector that has had its fair share of
scares. The company has set about increasing its product mix, which will
lift margins, and extending its geographical base, which will generate
volume growth. With all this in place, the  1/2 per cent interest rate rise
has failed to dent the optimism surrounding the company. The shares look
cheap with a profits forecast of Pounds 50m and a p/e of 10.9.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 0.4m at Sentry
Farming
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at USM-quoted Sentry Farming Group increased from Pounds 309,000 to
Pounds 406,000 in the first half of 1994, on a higher turnover of Pounds
2.41m, against Pounds 2.29m.
The company pointed out however, that its seasonal business meant that
losses would normally be incurred in the build up towards harvest.
Mr Nigel Brown, chairman, said weather over the harvest period had been
relatively co-operative. 'We are not in for a year of bumper yields but they
should be close to those anticipated.'
No account was again taken in the interim figures of income due under the
Arable Aid Payments Scheme, for which claims had been presented but would
not be recoverable until later in 1994. Losses per share were 6.54p (7.65p).

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mackie heads for USM with Pounds 17.3m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mackie International, the west Belfast-based textile machinery manufacturer,
is joining the USM later this month after a placing valuing the company at
Pounds 17.3m.
The Pounds 9.6m raised will transform Mackie's balance sheet which has been
weighed down with debt and scarred by years of losses.
The proceeds will pay off loans from Northern Bank and Overseas Private
Investment Corporation, a US Government agency, which are writing off Pounds
7.6m. The result will be to turn Mackie's negative net worth of Pounds
852,000 at June 30 into shareholders' funds of Pounds 16.3m.
The flotation is possible because of the dramatic trading recovery since Mr
Pat Dougan was brought in as chief executive in October 1991. Turnover,
which collapsed from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m in the two years to 1991
reached Pounds 13.2m in 1993 and Pounds 9.38m in the six months to June.
After a profit of Pounds 950,000 in the first half Mackie is forecasting at
least Pounds 1.9m for the full year.
On a pro forma basis and assuming a full tax charge earnings per share would
be 13.2p giving a notional multiple of 13.6 at the 180p placing price. The
notional yield is 4.2 per cent.
Founded in the 1840s Mackie is a world leader in the manufacture of
machinery for flax, jute, hemp and sisal fibre producers. To help counteract
the cyclical nature of the core business, Mr Dougan set up a water treatment
plant division last year which has won a Pounds 25m order from Argentina.
Mr Dougan's stake will be diluted to 20 per cent, but none of the existing
investors are selling shares in the placing. It is sponsored by English
Trust with stockbrokers Teather &amp; Greenwood.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BSM turns in Pounds 2.2m and pays 2.15p
maiden interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM, the UK driving instruction company which was floated last October,
yesterday announced a maiden interim dividend of 2.15p, compared with a pro
forma 1.93p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 1 were Pounds 2.23m, compared
with a previous loss of Pounds 144,000 after payment of Pounds 2.21m of
interest on debt incurred in its management buy-out. Earnings per share were
5.9p, compared with a 6.3p loss.
Operating profits on continuing operations were up 6 per cent from Pounds
2.23m to Pounds 2.37m.
Total turnover increased from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 12.7m. The latest
figure included Pounds 1.12m from discontinued operations, compared with
Pounds 724,000 previously. In July, BSM closed its MCR accident repair
centre at Leamington Spa with a loss of Pounds 168,000.
Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said that while the core market of teaching
learner drivers had been 'less than easy,' the group had finished the half
with a higher number of instructors and pupils. 'Overall, the company is in
a very healthy position.'
In the past 12 months the number of people applying for a provisional
driving licence fell by 1.6 per cent, while BSM increased its business by
1.7 per cent.
The group, which now claims to have 15 1/2 per cent market share, has also
pushed through a 2 1/2 per cent increase in prices.
It has also identified four ways of increasing its customer base. Next month
it will launch a national scheme for introducing school-pupils to driving;
it is continuing discussions with insurance companies with a view to reduced
premiums for newly qualified drivers who undergo further training; it has
started a scheme for teaching disabled people to drive; and it is continuing
to expand its Qualified Driver Training division, aimed at company car
drivers.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Recovery leaves BSG at Pounds 8.28m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG International, the West Midlands group with interests in motor and
aviation components, childcare products and vehicle distribution, staged a
1994 first half recovery after a worrying 1993 second half when trading
conditions deteriorated sharply.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 were Pounds 8.28m, compared
with Pounds 8.53m and Pounds 8.95m, excluding exceptional items, for the
whole of last year.
Mr Astley Whittall, soon to retire as chairman, was 'confident that the
second half will show further evidence of the group's recovery'.
BSG is maintaining its interim dividend at 0.7p, being paid on earnings per
share down from 2.07p to 1.97p. Turnover rose from Pounds 291.8m to Pounds
324.8m with operating profits static at Pounds 11.1m.
During the current half, Britax plans to consolidate its childcare product
manufacture at Andover at a cost of 217 redundancies and exceptional charges
of Pounds 2m.
Elsewhere in Britax, motor component manufacture for European markets is
recovering although pressure on margins is severe, while in the US and
Australia, the problem is finding capacity to meet demand. Losses have been
reduced in the aircraft interior business and profits should return next
year.
Bristol Street pushed up new and used car sales by 36 and 15 per cent
respectively. It completed the acquisition of Jessups, another distribution
business, on July 1, but the impact on profits is likely to be neutral this
year.
The shares gained 2p to close at 67p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong emerging markets business lifts
Nelson Hurst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong showing from its emerging market operations boosted half-year
pre-tax profits at Nelson Hurst, the insurance broker which came to the
market late last year, by 68 per cent from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 4.38m.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased by 17 per cent to Pounds
21.5m (Pounds 18.4m), with the best performance - a 25 per cent increase -
coming from the group's middle and far eastern division. Total revenue was
ahead at Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 19.8m).
Mr David Woodward, chairman and chief executive, said: 'we have a presence
in all the big Asian business centres and have developed good relationships
with prominent local brokers.'
The group's link with Hopewell, the Hong Kong insurance group, was beginning
to show good returns and the recently opened Philippines office had good
potential, he said. Offices in Shanghai and Vietnam are planned for early
next year.
Turnover at the financial and reinsurance operations grew 15 per cent to
Pounds 8.69m (Pounds 7.57m), with a particularly strong showing from the
North American casualty insurance business.
London Overseas operations, which includes reinsurance of large construction
projects such as power stations, saw turnover grow 15 per cent to Pounds 7m
(Pounds 6.1m). However, aviation and marine insurance were difficult
markets.
The UK-based retail business was boosted by the joint venture with Price
Forbes Group, one of South Africa's leading insurance groups. Turnover
advanced 20 per cent to Pounds 1.94m.
Mr Woodward was confident on second half trading. 'We are seeing continued
revenue growth, both from our existing business and from new ventures. I am
quite bullish over our prospects.'
Earnings per share advanced from 5.1p to 6.4p. There is an interim dividend
of 2.2p.

FT  21 SEP 94 / BFI bid gives Attwoods a rude awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste group, yesterday attacked a Pounds 364m hostile bid
from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US as an opportunistic attempt to
take advantage of one shareholder's desire to sell.
The bid was sprung on Attwoods yesterday morning after a late-night deal
between BFI, headed by former FBI director Mr William Rucklehaus, and
Attwoods' largest shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada.
Laidlaw, which has three directors on Attwoods' board, put the company into
play by agreeing in secret talks to sell its 29.8 per cent stake to BFI for
109p a share. Laidlaw has also agreed that in the case of a higher offer
from another bidder, it will remit the difference to BFI.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, was believed to be less than happy
yesterday over Laidlaw's actions.
The fact that the Laidlaw directors who negotiated the deal with BFI had
access to Attwoods' management accounts and budgets could be a blow to
Attwoods' defence to the bid. The defence must also deal with a reputation
tarnished by ill-fated acquisitions and financing difficulties.
Laidlaw said it had tried to sell the Attwoods stake for a year. It is
believed to have approached BFI, which claims to be the world's second
largest waste company, some months ago.
Mr Jim Bullock, Laidlaw chief executive, said the deal was in the interests
of shareholders. 'If there were any improvement in the offer, it would be to
the benefit of other shareholders, not to Laidlaw,' he said. 'We've been
quite scrupulous in making sure that all shareholders are treated the same.'
Attwoods' future depends on two other substantial investors, Templeton
Investments of the US and Fidelity, which together control 27 per cent.
Analysts yesterday expected the institutions to hold out for a higher offer.
The current bid was 'extremely low, very opportunistic and right at the
bottom of the 12-month trading range', said Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of
NatWest Securities.
BFI is offering 109p per share, against last night's close of 117p. The
offer represents Dollars 8.53 per American Depository Receipt, equivalent to
five shares, and 85p per preference share.
Laidlaw has agreed to sell its 73 per cent preference holding to BFI if the

Laidlaw has agreed to buy Attwoods' German portable sanitation business for
Dollars 56.8m, (Pounds 36.6m), if BFI cannot find an alternative buyer. If
BFI gets a higher price for the business, Attwoods' shareholders will

FT  21 SEP 94 / New benchmark worries UK pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British pension funds are just beginning to face up to the potential
upheaval which could result from the forthcoming legislation on pensions.
With the imposition for the first time of a statutory minimum solvency
standard, funds could be faced with a new effective benchmark which excludes
the overseas equities which on average comprise 26 per cent of their
portfolios. Moreover the benchmark will often imply a weighting of 50 per
cent or more in gilt-edged, against only about 7 per cent at present.
Of course, UK pension scheme portfolios are not suddenly going to be emptied
of global equities worth Dollars 160bn (Pounds 103bn). Nor are the pension
funds going to beg the UK government to create more than Dollars 200bn of
extra gilts. But over several years the asset allocation structure of UK
pension funds is likely to change substantially.
Recent investment strategy has been driven by peer group pressure and high
historical equity returns, to the exclusion of liability-matching
considerations. Thanks to the influence of me-too median fund performance
benchmarks the typical pension fund is now around 80 per cent in equities.
In international terms this is anomalous, as has been pointed out by the
analysis Global Pension Fund Indicators from UBS Asset Management. The
strategy has paid off before - over the past 10 years, the average pension
fund annual real return in the UK was 10.8 per cent, the third highest out
of 18 countries surveyed. But UBS warns that UK funds are now overexposed to
equity risk.
In chasing high returns, UK funds have largely ignored their increasing
maturity - that is, they have proportionately more liability to pay pensions
in the near term, for which gilts provide a safer match than equities.
At a Goldman Sachs seminar last week in London an actuarial consultant, Mr
Roger Urwin of Watsons, pointed out that in the past few years the asset
allocation of UK pension plans has been converging even though their
liability structure has been diverging.
Now a reassessment looms. True, the actuarial profession has forced a
compromise on the solvency test proposed last year by the Goode Committee.
Instead of being entirely founded on gilts it will be graduated: it will be
based on UK equity returns for liabilities related to younger employees and
on mixed gilts and equities for those within 10 years of retirement, while
only for current pensioners will the valuation be 100 per cent gilt-based.
The standard will thus vary in its impact according to the maturity profiles
of individual funds, but on average the equity content will probably be only
40 to 50 per cent. Moreover there will be no accommodation of the particular
risks associated with overseas equities or property.
Flexibility will not be abolished, however. A well-funded scheme will not be
forced to match this new benchmark for risk. Some companies might raise the
funding level so that they can pursue performance-driven rather than
solvency-driven objectives. But the danger exists of a stampede by the herd
from one benchmark to another.
There is no early deadline. Pension plans will have until at the earliest
the year 2002 to meet the solvency test, and attempts are being made to
delay and water down the proposals still further. On the other hand, pension
scheme trustees may reason that the later the strategy switch is performed
the worse the terms may be.
According to Goldman Sachs, sterling bonds will be the biggest
beneficiaries, but overseas bonds may have a role for the diversification
they can bring. The implications for UK pension fund holdings of overseas
equities are very negative, but the change in the UK equity portfolios may
not be significant. However, the distinction between domestic and overseas
equities is surely becoming blurred.
Already a few of the bigger pension plans with mature liabilities, such as
the British Rail Pension Scheme, are shifting resources into bond
portfolios. Most funds are waiting for a new consensus to develop, but the
logic of the new legislation is clear enough: if the short-term security of
members' benefits is to be improved the equity risk-tolerance of pension
funds will be correspondingly reduced.

FT  21 SEP 94 / NFC forced to cancel third scrip dividend: Company will have
to pay shareholders another Pounds 545,000 in cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cancellation of one scrip dividend is unfortunate, but to do so for the
third time in a row - as NFC did yesterday - could appear to smack of
carelessness.
The cancellation follows the transport and logistics group's recent
indignity of losing its place in the FT-SE 100 index. NFC's shares have
underperformed the index by 40 per cent in the past year.
The value of the scrip alternative to NFC's second interim dividend, under
which investors could opt for shares in lieu of cash, was fixed at 198.2p in
July. By yesterday, after the departure of chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock
and a profits warning, the shares had fallen to 163p.
The cancellation will cost NFC Pounds 545,331, as 21,500 shareholders had
already opted to take up the shares. They will now receive the 1.5p per
share cash payment.
The two previous cancellations, in March and June, cost it close to Pounds
1.5m in cash, turning NFC's declining share price into a meaningful expense.
In the past year, Ladbroke Group and Albert Fisher Holdings have cancelled
scrip offerings, and volatile stock markets can clearly wreak unforeseeable
havoc on such offers.
In NFC's case, a weak market has been exacerbated by disappointment at the
aftermath of last year's Pounds 263m rights issue. High hopes of the
benefits of Mr Sherlock's rationalisation blueprint, that accompanied the
rights, have been dashed, and his departure raised further concerns over
NFC's strategic direction.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Tesco cautious on margins but lifted by sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in margins and faster sales growth helped Tesco, the UK's
second-largest food retailer, to increase interim pre-tax profits 8 per cent
to Pounds 250.2m, from a restated Pounds 231.4m, but the company remained
cautious on the outlook for margins.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said Tesco's gross profit margin, which fell
0.7 percentage points in the previous half-year amid intense price
competition, had recovered to 0.1 points below the first half in last year.
The increase was due to better terms from suppliers and shifts in products,
including the introduction of higher-margin clothing and leisure goods.
But Sir Ian warned that price competition would remain fierce in the second
half, and Tesco did not expect much improvement in gross margin compared
with last year. His caution led to a 3p fall in Tesco's shares to 248p.
'The competition has not taken its foot off the accelerator, and it is not
going to be taken off,' Sir Ian said.
He reiterated his view that last year's margin decline was a 'step change',
not the 'downward spiral' City analysts feared. But Tesco would respond
firmly to any competitive price moves.
UK sales increased 11.8 per cent to Pounds 4.47bn, of which 7.8 percentage
points came from 12 store openings.
Existing stores contributed 4 percentage points, made up of 1.5 per cent
inflation, and a 2.5 per cent volume increase.
Sir Ian said sales benefited from lower prices on basic goods - countering
the threat from fast-expanding discount grocers - and from Tesco's wider
range, new store design, and improved service.
UK operating profits rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 249m, representing a fall
in operating margins from 6.1 to 6 per cent.
Group sales increased 17.3 per cent to Pounds 4.69bn, including a first-time
Pounds 219.4m contribution from Catteau, the French supermarket chain
acquired last year. Nine new store openings contributed to Catteau's
operating profit of Pounds 8.1m, but like-for-like sales were down.
Tesco gained control of its latest Pounds 250m acquisition, Scottish grocery
chain Wm Low, on September 2. Sir Ian said acceptances had been received
from 95 per cent of shareholders, about 70 per cent opting for the share
alternative rather than the 360p-per-share cash offer.
This meant the acquisition would dilute earnings 'slightly' this year -
rather than have the 'neutral' impact previously expected - but would
enhance earnings next year.
The interim dividend was lifted from 2.45p to 2.7p, although earnings per
share increased only 0.4 per cent from 8.43p to 8.46p owing to an increased
tax charge.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Buthelezi dismissed by king in KwaZulu leadership feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The feud between two of the leaders of South Africa's 9m Zulus came to a
head yesterday when King Goodwill Zwelithini dismissed Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi as his prime minister.
The confrontation could lead to a change in the political control of Natal's
provincial parliament, currently held by the chief's Inkatha Freedom party,
and help reshape the political future of South Africa.
The sacking could undermine Chief Buthelezi's position as a minister in the
country's coalition government if he were challenged from within his party.
In an announcement released at Nongoma in KwaZulu/Natal province by the
royal council, a group of advisers to the monarch, the king said he was
dismissing Chief Buthelezi as traditional prime minister to the royal house
 -an advisory position - and would have no further contact with him.
The move is the biggest political upheaval since President Nelson Mandela
took office after South Africa's first all-race elections in April.
The statement also said the king was cancelling this year's Shaka Day
celebrations, an annual festival to celebrate the Zulu kingdom's 19th
century founder which had been due next Saturday. The king called instead on
the Zulu people to observe a four-day period of 'prayer, unity,
reconciliation and peace'.
Both men will be vying for support of the conservative, traditional rural
vote which in April helped give Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party a
narrow victory in KwaZulu/Natal over Mr Mandela's African National Congress.
Should the king win what may be a violent contest, control of the province
could pass to the ANC, with whom the king has established close links.
Victory for Chief Buthelezi could reinforce Inkatha's hold over the region's
assembly and keep open the possibility that he might press for greater
powers for what would become a virtually autonomous Natal.
Mr Mandela, in Cape Town with Mr John Major, visiting British prime
minister, expressed optimism that the issue could be speedily resolved.
Chief Buthelezi said he had received no formal communication from the king.
Mr Ziba Jiyane, Inkatha secretary general, said the party would press ahead
with next weekend's celebrations without the king.
The king's decision was apparently prompted by rioting by Inkatha supporters
after a meeting on Monday night at the monarch's palace between himself, Mr
Mandela and the chief.
The talks were aimed at resolving a dispute stemming from Chief Buthelezi's
anger over the king's apparent failure to consult him about an invitation to
Mr Mandela to attend the Shaka Day festival.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Ashdown struggles to control Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown was last night struggling to restore his grip over the
Liberal Democrats after the party's Brighton conference again overturned his
efforts to present a more disciplined image to the electorate.
A defeat for the leadership over its approach to a minimum wage was
accompanied by renewed manoeuvring over the party's relationship with the
Labour party. Sir David Steel, a former party leader, added his voice to the
chorus of senior figures calling for the Liberal Democrats to abandon the
pretence that it is neutral between a Labour or Conservative victory at the
next general elections. He suggested that the Liberal Democrats could have
substantial input into a Labour government led by Mr Tony Blair.
With many of the party's activists vehemently opposed to a close
relationship with Labour, Mr Ashdown has resisted publicly endorsing the
stance of the majority of his senior colleagues.
The Liberal Democrat leader sees the potential for much increased
co-operation with Mr Blair but he wants to move slowly to ensure that he
takes his party with him. He is concerned also not to put the Labour leader
in a position where Mr Blair might be forced publicly to renounce the idea
of any partnership.
Mr Ashdown will be looking for signals from Labour that it wants a thaw in
relations. In the longer term, any formal arrangement between the two
parties would depend on Mr Blair embracing a proportional voting system for
elections to the House of Commons.
In yesterday's debate on employment, the conference defied a plea from Mr
Ashdown and his colleagues at Westminster to avoid committing the party to a
minimum wage. Encouraged by Baroness Williams to reject the unanimous
position of the 23 Liberal Democrat MPs, the conference voted to bind the
party to a regionally based system of minimum wage rates to prevent
exploitation of low-paid workers.
The decision marked the second defeat for Mr Ashdown in two days. On Monday
the party voted against the leader to reject a motion to decriminalise
cannabis. Both decisions were seen as a setback to Mr Ashdown's attempts to
present the party to the electorate as distinctive but disciplined. Senior
Liberal Democrats fear they face a third defeat this morning over their tax
and spending proposals.
The leadership, however, was spared further embarrassment when the
conference rejected a motion calling for the abolition of the monarchy in
favour of a republican constitution.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Nurses defy government with 8.3% pay claim: Pay review body
urged not to recommend national award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nurses' representatives will this week press for a pay rise of 8.3 per cent.
The claim will set them on a collision course with the government, which, it
emerged yesterday, has urged the National Health Service pay review body not
to recommend any national pay increase.
The government wants any pay awards to Britain's 500,000 nurses, midwives
and health visitors to be made locally by individual trusts.
The claim for nurses and midwives comes from the Royal College of Nursing,
regarded as one of the most moderate public sector unions. The RCN, which
believes its members' pay has slipped behind that of non-manual workers,
warned last month that it intended to use the 4.7 per cent offered to MPs as
a yardstick for its own pay claim.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, recently confirmed that total pay bills
in the public sector would be frozen for the second year running. Any
increases would have to be funded through improved efficiency.
Pay review bodies, which make recommendations to the prime minister, cover
several large groups of public sector workers including teachers, nurses,
doctors and the armed forces. Teachers' unions have already asked their pay
review body for an increase of about 4 per cent.
Most nurses are covered by the awards recommended by the pay review body.
National Health Service trusts are allowed to make their own awards to new
staff but few have yet done so.
Last week the trusts, in their evidence to the profession's review body,
said nurses and midwives should be put on performance-related pay determined
by local managements.
Last year nurses were awarded 3 per cent for 1994-95. The previous year the
award was 1.5 per cent, in line with that of all public-sector workers.
The government's current plans were revealed in a leaked document of its
evidence to the pay review body. It concludes: 'We would urge the pay review
body not to recommend an across the board increase - but instead to give a
strong steer to the continuing development and implementation of local
agreements.'
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the move would further
'destabilise' the NHS.
RCN officials were tonight 'horrified and outraged' at the evidence put
forward by the government. One said: 'It is absolutely appalling if the
government does not allow the pay review body to make a recommendation. It
is being pushed on to the sidelines and we will fight very strongly to
preserve it.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group's protestation that it does not believe it necessary to control
Scottish TV can probably be taken at face value. Not only is it unlikely
that the Mirror would ever be allowed to control STV, because the two groups
dominate the Scottish newspaper and TV markets, but the Mirror has anyway
developed a fondness for exerting significant influence through minority
stakes, as shown by its stake in Newspaper Publishing, the Independent's
owner. The Mirror can be expected to press STV to provide programmes and
expertise for its new cable TV channel. If it succeeds, its 14.9 per cent
stake could look a cheap way of diversifying beyond the price-war ridden
newspaper market.

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries' hostile bid for Attwoods is mean but clever. It
is mean because the 109p per share offer provides no bid premium, while
immediately enhancing BFI's earnings per share. It is clever because it
stands a good chance of succeeding. The key to the battle is that Laidlaw,
Attwoods' 30 per cent shareholder, has irrevocably pledged its stake at the
offer price. So even if a higher bid materialised, the extra pennies would
go to BFI, not Laidlaw. BFI trumpeted this agreement as proof that the offer
was fair; the reality is that Laidlaw so badly wanted out that it was
prepared to accept BFI's stiff conditions.
This puts other shareholders in a bind. Attwoods can hardly argue for an
independent future given its poor record. But if there was an obvious white
knight prepared to pay more, Laidlaw would have found it already. Warburg,
Attwoods' merchant bank, will have its work cut out to rustle up a better
bid. But, since it is still smarting from its high-profile failure in the
Enterprise/Lasmo bid, the bank has every incentive to prove its doubters
wrong.

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The immediate causes of yesterday's slippage in UK gilts and 42-point fall
in the London equity market were to be found abroad. The US trade deficit
unsettled New York markets, while Germany worried about the imminent August
money supply numbers. At least in gilts, though, the nervousness fits badly
with the domestic data. Net new mortgage commitments at building societies
fell 7 per cent in August while the fall in retail deposits in the banking
system suggests consumers may be squeezed by higher taxation. With recent
growth in M4 money supply well within the target range, there seems to be
little pressure for a further rate rise.
One danger, though, is that markets tend to confuse weakness in consumer
demand and housing with weakness in the economy as a whole. The chancellor's
decision to raise base rates last week clearly reflected a broader view of
the economy in which growth is driven by other things, notably exports. As
long as the overall growth rate remains high, the output gap will continue
to close and companies will try increasingly to pass on higher input costs.
The authorities may thus feel tempted to tighten monetary policy further,
but while corporate borrowing remains low the risk is that of overkill.
Against that background, gilts look an outright bargain at yields of over 9
per cent, but equities will continue to struggle.

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Marginal momentum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen months ago, margins at the UK's big food retailers appeared on the
verge of collapse under a new wave of pricing pressure from discounters.
Tesco's interim figures show such fears were misplaced. It held the
year-on-year decline in gross margins to 0.1 per cent in the first half,
following a drop of 0.7 per cent in the second half of 1993. Like-for-like
sales rose by 4 per cent, further evidence that Tesco's strategy for fending
off the threat from the discounters has been effective - so far.
Tesco has responded to the challenge by cutting prices of key products,
putting pressure on suppliers and improving operating efficiency, tactics
also adopted by J. Sainsbury. These steps could not have eliminated the
intense competitive pressures in the sector, but they appear to have shifted
some of those pressures back on to the discounters themselves. Judging by
Shoprite's profits warning this summer, problems at Lo-Cost, the Argyll
subsidiary, and analysts' scaled back expectations for Kwik Save, low prices
alone have failed to make really damaging inroads into the big retailers'
territory.
That said, market conditions are far removed from the second half of the
1980s when margins climbed at a comfortable 1 per cent a year. In a
low-inflation environment dogged by overcapacity, it will be a struggle to
preserve margins at existing levels. The sector has risen against the market
by 20 per cent in the last six months. Further outperformance on this scale
is unlikely.
