FT  31 DEC 94 / Banks pressed on part-timer pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and building societies could face bills for millions of pounds after
Bifu, the banking and finance union, lodged more than 2,500 industrial
tribunal claims to boost part-time workers' pensions.
The claims follow recent European Court rulings that excluding part-time
workers from company schemes could amount to sexual discrimination, as a
disproportionate number of part-timers are women.
Claimants will have to persuade British courts that their employer was
guilty of sexual bias in its decision to bar part-time workers from pension
provision.
The union said that many banks and building societies have only just
admitted all such workers to their pension schemes. But the European Court
rulings imply that workers could claim pension rights back to 1976. If they
succeed, financial institutions would have to put millions of pounds into
pension funds.
Mr Ed Sweeney, Bifu deputy general secretary, said: 'There has been massive
discrimination against part-timers. Employers tried to use them as cheap
labour and now they must pay the price.'
Staff from all the high street banks and many building societies are making
claims, but more than 1,300 claims cover staff and former staff of TSB
Group, which did not admit staff who worked fewer than 18 hours a week to
its pension scheme until 1991. TSB said last night that it was looking at
the directive's implications and meanwhile urged possible claimants to
register with it.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Reform of quango recruitment urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should surrender its powers of appointment to public bodies
to an independent commission or parliamentary select committee, the British
Medical Association said yesterday.
There has been considerable criticism of appointments to bodies which run
the National Health Service at local level. The government has been accused
of favouring Tory party members, supporters of free-market economics and
people with business rather than health backgrounds.
There have also been complaints that the 1991 NHS reforms have made health
authorities less accountable to the public by removing local authority
representatives, the BMA said in a discussion paper.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Pay ranking blow for chief executives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's chief executives are paid less than most of their international
counterparts, says a survey by management consultants Towers Perrin.
British chief executive officers came 16th out of 19 countries surveyed in
terms of total cash remuneration (salary and bonuses) - one place higher
than in 1993. Their total pay amounted to Pounds 158,000 compared with
Pounds 311,000 received by their equivalents in the US, who topped the
league table.

FT  31 DEC 94 / N Korea 'brought down' US helicopter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, Seoul Correspondent, and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US army pilot Bobby Hall, in his first debriefing by US officials since
being freed by North Korea, said his helicopter was hit by air defences
after it strayed across the border, forcing him into an emergency landing.
Chief Warrant Officer Hall reported that after he brought the craft to the
ground, he pulled his gravely wounded co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David
Hilemon, from the aircraft, according to a US government official.
Mr Hall told officials that Mr Hilemon died a short time later, the official
said.
At the time of the shooting-down, Mr Hall thought he was over South Korea
and apparently did not realise his helicopter had been struck and that Mr
Hilemon had been hit, the official said.
Mr Hall said he was well treated in captivity, the official said.
North Korea yesterday returned Mr Hall yesterday. His release appeared to
ensure that the recent US-North Korean nuclear agreement will proceed
smoothly after Washington warned earlier that his continued detention could
jeopardise the accord.
The US is 'pleased that we can now look to the future and implement the
important project', said Mr Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of
state, who spent two 'difficult' days in Pyongyang negotiating Mr Hall's
release.
Under the nuclear accord, the US has promised to establish diplomatic ties
with North Korea and guarantee international aid if Pyongyang abandons its
nuclear programme.
The return of Mr Hall was the result of a diplomatic compromise.
The US expressed regret for the intrusion of the helicopter into North
Korean airspace, which Washington said was an accident caused by a
navigational error.
The US did not offer a formal apology as demanded by North Korea, which
claimed the helicopter was on a spy mission.
However, North Korea appeared satisfied by a 'confession' signed by Mr Hall,
which described the 'illegal intrusion' as a 'criminal action' and asked for
forgiveness by Pyongyang.
North Korea claimed the US had agreed to further bilateral military contacts
to prevent future incidents. But Mr Hubbard denied that the US had given
such commitments.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Polish draft budget passed

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Sejm, the Polish parliament's lower chamber, yesterday passed the
country's 1995 draft budget by a large majority in the face of pay demands
by Solidarity-led health workers and teachers, which if successful could
destroy the government's monetary strategy. The draft foresees a deficit at
3.3 per cent of gross domestic product which has already been agreed with
the IMF but the budget has come under attack from President Lech Walesa, who
has backed the Solidarity pay demands.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Academic allies under different flags: War and Peace (The
end of 'Us and Them') - Peter Aspden finds that war studies and peace
studies are not that far apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On his first day as professor of war studies at King's College, London,
Lawrence Freedman barely had time to think about his forthcoming duties; it
was the day Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Eight years later,
misfortune began to look like carelessness when, on the opening day of the
college's new centre for defence studies, Iraq invaded Kuwait.
'I suppose it was apt,' notes Freedman dryly. He talks of invasion
dispassionately, as befits one who spends his time studying the intricacies
and nuances of warfare in all its grizzliest manifestations, from the fall
of Periclean Athens to the latest Bosnian Serb incursion.
Meanwhile, Paul Rogers of the University of Bradford covers much of the same
territory: how wars are started, how they might be resolved, how they can be
avoided in the first place; the only difference is that he is a professor of
peace studies.
The two men would appear to be on opposite sides of the most ancient human
dialectic of them all; both are keen to underplay their differences and
stress a common approach. Their differences might have been more apparent at
the beginning of the 1980s, when Rogers' department was under attack from
the right for its trenchant criticism of the nuclear arms build-up.
But then came the end of the cold war and the mutation of the bipolar
balance of terror into a series of vicious and complicated struggles all
round the globe. Suddenly, the 'Us and Them' model of international
relations looked, to western eyes at least, hopelessly crude and irrelevant.
And Freedman and Rogers have found themselves converging on each other's
territory.
Having said all that, Rogers is keen to emphasise his adherence to the
values of the Quakers who helped establish his department in the early 1970s
as a forum for the study and promotion of peace.
Borrowing from Sir Isaiah Berlin's distinction between two definitions of
liberty, a distinction is made between negative peace - the absence of war -
and positive peace - the establishment of socio-economic conditions under
which a peaceful society can flourish. The latter area gives the department
its broad scope. Rogers gives as an example of barriers to peace the
under-investment in the former Soviet Union by western powers, and in the
Middle East by the oil-rich Gulf states. 'It is a failure to look in the
long term which is the root cause of so many troubles.'
Freedman, on the opposite side of the coin, would no doubt see the
'obstacles to positive peace' as 'potential threats to security'; it is, I
suggest, the same area of study viewed from a different perspective.
'I suppose it is a case of us looking at the dark side, almost looking for
situations which are about to break down. But we obviously are not looking
to promote war. If you work at the Institute of Tropical Diseases, it
doesn't mean you want to help spread them,' he answers.
'Put it this way - I was very pleased to have appointed an expert in
Yugoslavia in 1990, firstly because he was very good and secondly because
you could see what was going to happen there a mile off.' I mention that his
appointments to the department could be seen as a kind of curse, which he
finds a compelling idea. 'Well, at the moment, I am looking for a specialist
in northern Africa.'
Rogers agrees with Freedman's prognosis, applying his own perspective: 'You
have all the conditions there which impede any prospect of real peace: huge
unemployment and disempowerment, a very autocratic government and a host of
fundamentalist groups looking for support.'
One difference between the two departments is that Bradford has a strong
training element - students are taught how to keep the peace. Conflict
resolution is also an important research theme. James Smith, a lecturer who
has spent three years in each institution, recently spent some time with
United Nations troops in Croatia, discovering the daily difficulties they
faced.
'Their phone lines are cut up to 50 times a day, some of them end up
clearing the same mine up to a dozen times. It is very demoralising for
them,' he says.
I ask Freedman if he ever feels like he is training his students for war.
'We cannot teach people how to fight wars, we are not a training
organisation at all. We believe in the good old liberal academic values,
reason and freedom. As Hedley Bull said, good scholarship is subversive of
all causes.'
But are there not unbearable tensions when students from certain countries
are put together? 'It can be difficult, but we don't ask people to change
their allegiances or views. We hope they come to accept that it is good to
converse in neutral territory.' I put it to Rogers that both he and Freedman
shared a fundamentally pessimistic view of the world, one which cannot see
the cycle of war and peace in human affairs ever reaching an end. He demurs:
'If we had been having this conversation 12 years ago, we would have been
talking about mutually assured destruction. The end of the cold war has
provided us with a window of opportunity, but it must be exploited.'
Both men are scornful of the 'end of history' thesis which sees the fall of
the Berlin Wall as signalling the triumph of the west. Malcolm Dando, a
lecturer at Bradford, provides his own epitaph for the Dr Strangelove era:
'I don't think we won - I think we all got through by the skin of our
teeth.' In the meantime, the two departments continue to talk to each other,
to try and make sense of what has replaced the rabid intensity of the cold
war years. The two institutions have even set up an annual football match.
Bradford recently won 2-1. 'The referee was our mediation specialist,' says
Rogers.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Private View: No rest for peace broker on sidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first politicians of stature to risk his reputation in the
graveyard of Bosnia was Lord Carrington, the British Tory grandee, former
foreign secretary and head of Nato.
For 12 months between 1991 and 1992 he and Jose Cutileiro of Portugal tried
on behalf of the European Union to broker a peace in the ruins of
Yugoslavia. They failed.
With American cries of 'Sell-out]' echoing ever more insistently across the
Atlantic, and with the former US president Jimmy Carter now trying his hand
as mediator, I went to ask Lord Carrington what lesson we should draw from
the Bosnian disaster.
'Oh, I think the lesson I draw is that you should never intervene in a civil
war - and this basically was a civil war - unless you are prepared to take
sides,' he said.
'You have to say that the Serbs, or the Moslems, or the Croats are right and
be prepared to fight for them. But to put yourself in a position in which
you are trying to hold the fort, which the UN has been trying to do, is
impossible.'
Later he said: 'We've really always known whose side we're on.'
Whose side are we on? I asked.
But the former negotiator did not reply directly. The international
community, he concluded, was totally divided. 'People tried to make it black
and white - the Americans certainly - and to say that the Serbs are wholly
wrong. But the Serbs have got a case.
'I mean, they are awful in the sense that they carry their case to the most
ridiculous and cruel limits, but they have a case. And the Croats have a
case. And the Bosnians have a case.'
But who in your opinion is in the wrong?
'I don't think any of them are particularly in the wrong. They are all in
the wrong. And all have some right on their side.'
So it is impossible for us to take sides?
'You could easily have taken sides. Whether you would have been right or not
and whether you would have carried the international community with you
would be a different matter.'
I said: many commentators, especially in the US, say Europe is secretly on
the side of Serbia.
'Why do they say that?'
They say we act as if we are.
'But that's because we're not acting as if we were on the other side.
'You could make out a very good argument - though it would be considered
probably very callous - that by intervening at all we have actually caused
more casualties, more ethnic cleansing, more misery than if we'd never
intervened at all.
'Because if we had not interevened, this thing would have been settled two
years ago. There would have been some very unhappy people, but at the end of
all this there are going to be very unhappy people whatever happens.'
It is the familiar realpolitik line which has upset front-line observers and
armchair pundits alike. In the mouth of a man less courteous and affable,
less distinguished and civilised than Peter Carrington, it could have
sounded merely cynical.
The seventh baron received me at the garden gate of his London hideaway, a
large cottage in Knightsbridge quite invisible from the street. A team of
gardeners was pruning shrubs and stripping ivy from the walls.
Lord Carrington has the pedigree of a model English gentleman: Eton,
Sandhurst, the Grenadier Guards, a Military Cross won at the end of the
second world war, and a string of political appointments dating back to
Winston Churchill's post-war government.
Because of his rank and wealth, Carrington's appetite for public service and
high office - though not, apparently, for the premiership - could never be
called vulgar ambition. His was the independent voice of moderation in
Margaret Thatcher's radical administration until the Argentines invaded the
Falkland Islands and the foreign secretary fell virtuously on to his sword.
'We got it wrong,' he said. 'There are all sorts of explanations but we did
get it wrong and therefore somebody had to take responsibility for it. It's
not very fashionable perhaps,' he laughed. 'It was very painful.'
The worst moment of your career?
'Oh, of course, yes. Very unpleasant. I'd always wanted to be foreign
secretary. It's not very nice to have to resign in those sort of
circumstances.'
Lord Carrington is among those who argue that Europe's fatal mistake in
former Yugoslavia was to recognise Croatian and Slovenian independence
prematurely. That, he said, torpedoed the constitutional conference and
raised the question of Bosnia's status. 'And it was quite clear that if you
asked the Bosnians whether they wanted their independence there was going to
be a civil war,' he said.
Would you agree that Bosnia has been very embarrassing for us west
Europeans?
'Yes, very. And it's brought the UN and Nato into disrepute as well as the
European Union. And all had good intentions.'
Is this impotence not only embarrassing but also dangerous?
'Very.'
What sort of consequences could it have?
'The Balkans are the Balkans, as we know from old Bismarck's remark.'
(Bismarck said the region was not worth the bones of a Pomeranian
grenadier.) 'But there is a danger that people will feel that in other
situations the UN is well-meaning but impotent, that it will only hold the
ring if there is no fighting.'
What upsets people, I said, is not just our collective impotence, but the
feeling that we have failed morally.
'I don't go along with that. Partly because of television, which has made an
enormous difference to people's perceptions, and partly because of the press
and the media which are bringing it daily into your life, we think that all
these problems are capable of being solved. I think some are not.
'And it's all very well for people, frankly, to say that they feel morally
culpable. Would they actually have advocated British troops going in there
and suffering casualties - and really quite a lot of casualties - to stop
this? It was quite clear that no western government was prepared to do that.
'So it's all right round the dinner table to say that you feel humiliated
and so on. But would you get up on a platform and say you'd send British
soldiers in there to get killed?'
Lord Carrington conceded that professional soldiers might be prepared to die
under a UN flag but their governments were not going to take that
responsibility because of the likely public and media reaction.
'I mean, it's no good wringing your hands if you're not prepared to do
something about it. And that's what the great British public, the great
American public, the great every public is doing.'
We don't know that until we've tried, do we?
'We've a pretty good idea.'
At another point Lord Carrington asked: 'Can you say there is a British
national interest in what happens in Bosnia?'
Plainly there isn't, I agreed.
'In that case, can a government send in British soldiers?'
If there is no British interest, nor French, then who is going to keep the
peace? Nobody's got an interest yet everyone's got an interest.
Lord Carrington answered by saying that the European interest probably
consisted of making sure that the war was contained within the former
Yugoslavia's borders. If it spread outside, we were bound to intervene
against the aggressor.
'In a sense,' he said later, 'it's a faraway country of which we know
nothing, or whatever Chamberlain's words were. But I don't think that what
we have done is 'appeasement'. What I think is extremely unfair is the
attack on General Rose (commander of the UN forces). I'm not pro-Serb. I'm
not pro-anybody. They all have a case.'
Lord Carrington is 75 now, but still a vigorous man. After I had asked him
about his resignation he reflected: 'Politics isn't the be-all and end-all
of everyone's existence - as Monsieur Delors has said.'
Many people would say you were born lucky, I said, in that you could afford
to treat politics with some detachment.
'One was more independent,' he agreed, 'in the sense that this wasn't the
only thing in my life. It wasn't the career on which I depended for my
livelihood. So I was lucky in that sense.'
Do you tell yourself that there's nothing more you can do about it - that
you won't be around for whatever next horror is in preparation?
Lord Carrington laughed. 'You mean, apres moi le deluge? No, I would like
very much to see a resolution of Nato's problems. The US must stay involved,
and we should get Nato sorted out to our satisfaction. Certainly the
Russians ought not to have a veto over what we do, although we should do
everything we can to carry them along and accommodate them. But I do feel
there is a new uncertainty in the world.'
Are you glad to be out of it all?
'Oh no] Of course not. Why would one be glad to be out of it?'
The nimble peer sprang to his feet, and escorted me down the front path to
the garden gate.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: High charges, poor performance - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novices often think of investment as a string of brilliant money-making
decisions. In practice, much investment consists of avoiding traps and
recognising your own limitations. But that does not remove all need to make
intelligent choices.
Many busy people decide that investing directly in ordinary shares is not
for them and stick to packaged products managed by professionals. The snag
is that packaged products need to be scrutinised almost as closely as
individual shares.
Some life insurance and pension policies bear much heavier costs and
commissions than others, and this is one of the reasons why the returns from
apparently similar products vary so much. Hence the need for the new deal
for investors which comes into force from tomorrow. The disclosure rules
mean that life insurance companies now have to reveal their charges to
prospective clients.
Such information, however, is of use only to clients who understand what
they are being told and have some standard of comparison. Few people are
going to have the patience to slog round scores of different firms before
they take out a life or pension policy.
So, we have done it for you. Our detailed survey on personal pensions (page
7), the first of an occasional series on different investment products,
throws up some staggering variations. Charges on a pension plan with a
notional end value of Pounds 134,000 ranged from just over Pounds 9,000 to
more than Pounds 34,000 over the 20-year period of investment.
The conventional justification for high charges is that they are worth
paying if the investment performance is outstanding. But what our tables
suggest is that, in many cases, the companies which charge the most also
have very poor investment performance records.
Costs and performance are the two main points to consider if you stick with
your investment for the full period planned originally. But only one person
in seven does. So, we have also looked at transfer values: how much of your
investment you get back if you move your pension to a different firm. In
several cases, you get back nothing if you move after the first year; in
many, you still lose some of your original investment after as long as three
years.
The new deal for investors is good in two ways: it increases the amount of
publicly available information, and fear of what the public will think of
this information has already made some of the insurance companies change
their ways. What it has not done is remove the duty of care from the
investor.
One reason Christmas crises tend to loom so large is that no one is around
to put out the fire. Next week is the soonest it will be possible to get any
realistic idea of where Mexican markets may stabilise. And that, in turn,
will depend greatly on what foreign investors think of the package of
measures proposed by Mexico's new leadership. Even if the overall package
looks acceptable, individual companies with large quantities of dollar debt
may be crippled or killed.
If US mutual fund investors panic, their managers would have to take money
from other Latin markets in order to meet investor demands for cash. But
economic prospects for many of the other countries in Latin America still
look attractive. And, although other Latin markets have fallen sharply, no
one really expects Mexico to start the dominoes tumbling.
It is unfortunate that the Mexican upset occurred just when rising US
interest rates were beginning to make cash deposits appealing to mutual fund
investors once more. But the big long-term flow of money into emerging
markets comes from US pension funds rather than individuals. That flow could
be checked, but it is unlikely to be reversed in the long term. Optimists
are even arguing that this could be a wonderful buying opportunity for Latin
American enthusiasts.
Impossible for the layman to tell? Undoubtedly. But he should not need to. A
well-spread emerging markets fund might have perhaps 10 per cent of its
assets in Mexico, and an average UK-based investor might have 10 to 20 per
cent of his assets in emerging markets. So, we are talking of a Mexican
involvement of less than 2 per cent of an overall portfolio. Anyone with
that kind of exposure has no need to take any decisions.
Several pundits are predicting that 1995 will be a year of hectic bid
activity for the London stock market. But don't waste time looking for the
next bid candidate; keep on searching for under-valued companies.
Most bid rumours do not turn into fact - but an under-valued company is a
good long-term buy regardless of whether it gets a bid in the short term.

<TEXT>
And now . . . the 'Low Fat' ski. For the last three days I have enjoyed some
of the best powder skiing in my life without a helicopter in sight. We have
been hurtling down Jackson Hole's legendary Hobacks with such control that
the casual observer might think we had become expert powder skiers. Yet
on-piste our skis have performed equally well. But it is not us who are
improving. It is our skis.
We were trying out the latest skiing fad - the Volkl 'Snow Ranger' a
compromise between a 'fat' ski - designed for use off-piste - and a
conventional ski. Sometimes, when manufacturers try to achieve the best of
both worlds they end up with the the worst of both. But these skis really
work both on and off piste, and in Jackson Hole, where the powder skier
reigns supreme, they are selling as fast.
The Snow Rangers are the latest in a bewildering assortment of skis on the
market this winter which have been spawned by the development of the 'fat'
ski.
First there was a rush by ski manufacturers to build their own version of
the Atomic Powder Plus - good in powder but cumbersome on piste. Now Atomic
itself has helped pioneer the compromise between 'fat' and 'thin' with its
Heli Guide model. But in Jackson it is the Snow Ranger which has captured
the hearts and feet of skiers.
These skis give you supreme control and confidence both on and off piste,
changing your concept about your own abilities and neutralising mistakes
which on ordinary skis would lead to a fall. But as Dave Wheeler, our guide
in Jackson, pointed out, you may have to be a reasonably good skier in the
first place to get the best out of them.
Beginners are not necessarily going to find 'low fat' skis are the answer to
their prayers: you need to feed some degree of skill into them to bring out
their best qualities.
Meanwhile, another new shape of ski - wide shovel and a narrow waist - is at
the centre of a separate 'revolution' in skiing. And again, the development
of the 'fat' ski was responsible.
Says Chris Stagg, a vice president at Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico, said:
'What's really happened is that when Atomic came up with the Powder Plus Fat
ski, it broke the mould of what the traditional ski should look like and the
ski designers said: 'If we can have skis this shape, what other shapes can
we come up with?''
Elan came up with the 'S' ski. Stagg and others are very excited about its
potential. Alberto Tomba had already revolutionised skiing wisdom with his
two-footed race technique - and now here are the skis to take this into the
recreational skiers' domain.
'With these skis you can forget about putting most of your weight on the
outside ski,' enthuses Stagg. 'You just set the S ski on its edge and it
will turn by itself. It wants to turn.
'This ski could change the way we think shout skiing. But you have to ski it
with your legs even further apart than normal and keep both skis in contact
with the snow. Skiing with your legs bolted together will be a no-no]'
Oh well, time to learn to ski yet again. What happened to all those days of
practising racing step turns, jet turns, counter-rotation, bending the knees
rather than the ankles, riding the outside ski, and leaning forward instead
of 'skiing tall'?

FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Youth appeal - Motoring / Why Rover transformed
the Metro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More of a nose job than a full facelift. That sums up the cosmetic changes
Rover has made to the Metro for 1995.
The name has changed, too. In future, it will be a Rover 100, which is what
it has been called for several years on mainland Europe, where a metro is an
underground railway.
The changes should make Rover's smallest modern car more attractive to young
buyers who have been put off by its angular, early-1980s styling.
This was a pity. Since it was given a new engine, transmission and
suspension a few years ago, the Metro has been one of the best superminis
for ride, refinement and handling. But it lacked sales appeal because it
looked thoroughly middle-aged.
Safety and security improvements include a cheap (Pounds 245) driver's
airbag option, standard side intrusion beams in the doors and a combined
alarm and immobiliser.
In addition to Rover's own K-series 1.1-litre and 1.4-litre petrol engines
(right), the 100 may be had with a Peugeot-Citroen 1.5-litre diesel. Prices
start at Pounds 6,495.
Three two-pedal 100s with continuously variable transmission will be good
town cars and would be even better if power steering were available.
A cabriolet with power-operated hood that joins the Rover 100 family in the
spring will cost about Pounds 12,000.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: King Cone looks for new roads to conquer -
Motoring / Simon Hughes meets a man who just loves roadworks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the interests of safety an ordinary motorway contra-flow requires about
10,000 road cones. In view of the number of roads currently under repair
this means there are probably more than 3m cones in use in Britain alone.
'By the year 2000,' the Highways Agency forecasts, '37 per cent of Britain's
motorway network could be operating above its design capacity.' In other
words, over a third of its main roads will be either blocked with cars or
coned off for repair. We are moving into the era of King Cone.
In the Gloucestershire hamlet of Broughton Poggs this news is cause for
optimism. Broughton Poggs is the home of Peter Cook Safety Products, the
world's leading producer of cones - every week they make 25,000 of them.
David Morgan, the company's managing director and inventor of the plastic
cone even collects them. He has 570 in his garage.
Morgan produced the first PVC cone in 1967 while he was working at ICI and
experimenting with liquid polythene.
'It was my job to make products using a rotating moulding machine. I tried
designing hollow toys - one was an elephant but when I pulled it out of the
mould the trunk kept breaking off. I drove over a wooden police cone going
to work one day and realised it was the perfect shape for my machine.'
In 1973 he was invited to set up a cone manufacturing plant for British
Telecom and he has been making and collecting them ever since.
Morgan was runner-up in a recent British television vote for the most boring
man in Britain (the winner collected brown paper bags). But how could anyone
want to surround himself with objects that symbolise danger and
frustra-tion?
'For me road cones hold an extraordinary fascination, and I can spot a
different design at 100 yards,' he says. 'I search for different styles
everywhere I travel, and then barter for new discoveries with swaps in my
boot.'
The prizes in his collection include a five-sided cone he picked up in
Manchester, a Malaysian version he found on a beach in the Scilly Isles, and
one from his own company which floated ashore while he was on holiday in
Corsica.
'I took it through the red channel at Heathrow customs but the man said: 'We
haven't got a category for that. OK, carry on.''
The adaptability of these coloured plastic sentries is immense. They turn up
guarding wet paint or washed floors in public buildings, on football
training grounds or at cycling proficiency test centres, as accessories in
student bedsits, and as chewable toys for young pit bull terriers. Morgan
spotted one suspended over a naked bulb outside a brothel in Amsterdam.
And he recently received a video from a zoo-keeper of a polar bear playing
with one - swimming with it and storing his food in it.
'Watch News at Ten every day and there'll always be one of mine somewhere,'
he says.
They possess great authority. Motorists manoeuvre obediently around them
even when they have strayed from their original position. The key is to keep
them upright - a horizontal cone is usually ignored - and for this reason a
legion of workers pour 20 tons of sand a day into the black-plastic base.
Morgan has done well from the cones. He runs a highly successful 24-hour
manufacturing business with a Pounds 9m turnover.
Britain, with the best road safety record in the world, has persuaded other
countries to invest in cones and 20 per cent of their sales are overseas,
mostly to mainland Europe. But Morgan sells cones to police forces and
traffic authorities as far away as Saudi Arabia and China, as well as large
and engineering companies across the UK. 'We get orders from all over the
world,' says Morgan. 'One of ours was pulled out of the sea by a man in Fiji
and he requested 5,000.'
Morgan's company makes everything from the diminutive 13-inch traffic cone
to the giant Highwayman. Personalised wedding cones decorated with lace and
frills are available to order and Morgan sells about 50 special black
funeral cones a week. He has even diversified into road signs, barrier
systems, flashing lamps and paint for marking out white and yellow lines.
But the production of around 1.5m cones a year is still the chief
pre-occupation of the 65 staff at the Broughton Poggs plant.
In Britain, the 365-page Traffic Sign Regulation and General Directions
booklet gives precise dimensions and colours of cones, and the layout needed
for certain types of traffic control.
Cones are forever getting stolen, mangled or discoloured, so there is always
fresh demand.
Is Morgan proud of his job?
'Well it's not something I admit to socially, but it's quite satisfying
knowing my product sees people through road works safely.'
What if there is a decline in road building?
'That's fine - old worn out roads are better for us. But if and when work
starts on extending the M25 to 14 lanes, we're going to have a big party.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Safety and security are selling cars - Motoring /
Stuart Marshall picks the cars that stood out in 1994 - a year in which
speed became less important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time, built-in safety and security has started to sell a lot
of cars.
In the past year, many people have asked salesmen not how fast the car they
were thinking of buying would go, but if it had driver and passenger
airbags, ABS brakes, thief-resisting deadlocks on the doors and effective
intruder alarms.
Convenience has moved higher up the list, too. Power-assisted steering has
come to be seen as a near essential.
I take just a tiny bit of the credit for this. For years I have been nagging
away at manufacturers about the need for small inexpensive cars to be as
effortless to park and drive in town as large ones.
The trend to diesel cars has continued during 1994. True, the rate of climb
in UK sales was less steep than it had been in 1993 because in that year it
had started from a lower base.
Even so, when the figures are published early next month they will show that
more than one in five of all new cars registered in Britain last year were
diesels.
Despite the government's signal lack of enthusiasm for and understanding of
diesel cars, their popularity will continue to grow.
As pump prices edge towards the Pounds 3 gallon (66p litre), a car that uses
anything between 20 per cent and 40 per cent less fuel is its own best
advocate.
Sensible people find the latest diesel cars are just as enjoyable as petrol
cars to drive.
Outstanding among the many diesel engines I have driven behind in the last
year were the ultra-economical direct injection VW-Audi 1.9-litre and
Peugeot-Citroen's new and silken 2.5-litre, both of them turbocharged.
Mazda's smooth 2-litre with a crankshaft-driven supercharger had massive
pulling power at low revolutions. And BMW's 2.5-litre in-line six-cylinder
diesel, also used in the new Range-Rover and Vauxhall (Opel) Omega, was
still the best of all.
I have lost count of the number of cars I drove in 1994 and, hand on heart,
I can say there was not a dud among them.
But a few stand out. Peugeot's pretty 306 cabriolet was a joy to drive
open-topped in Sinai. The Saab 900 soft top lived up to its reputation as a
car for all seasons in Ireland's sun and showers. And Renault launched its
Laguna spectacularly in Tanzania; the predatorially-priced and well-equipped
3-litre version made an even better impression on me in Britain than it had
on pot-holed African roads.
There were plenty of posh, powerful and pricy new cars in 1994. BMW
introduced its superb seven-series. Pearl among the latest Jaguar XJ saloons
was a sensational supercharged 4.0-litre. Audi's all-aluminium A8 with
four-wheel drive and Tiptronic transmission was unrivalled for advanced
technology. And the first new Range Rover in 24 years was more refined and
luxurious than ever.
Two compact and very high performing hatchbacks with four-wheel drive making
them easy to drive well, were the Ford Escort RS Cosworth and Subaru Impreza
turbo.
Fiat's Punto - winner of the Car of the Year Award - and the latest VW Polo
brought big car standards of refinement in much smaller packets. So, too,
did the new and sleekly good-looking Mazda 323 and more conventional Honda
Civic hatchbacks.
The joint Fiat-PSA multi-purpose vehicle was car-like to drive, not at all
bulky and offered a huge amount of adaptable interior space. And BMW's
Compact was good enough to convince me it might persuade existing BMW
3-Series saloon owners to trade-down a little next time and Ford Escort
owners to trade up.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: No turkey on the final leg - FT Ski Expedition /
Arnie Wilson misses the traditional fare as his odyssey nears its end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker spent Christmas in Utah, as they near the end
of their round-the-world trip.
Christmas Day at Snowbird in Utah dawned as bright and tingling as a TV
toothpaste advert and our first Noel on skis was superb.
The only disappointment was the complete lack of traditional Christmas fare.
Still, Dick Bass, the garrulous Texan oil millionaire who built the Snowbird
resort more than 20 years ago, rang us - very early - from his home in
Dallas with recommended restaurants.
Any man prepared to host us for a week over Christmas and take us skiing on
one of America's finest mountains on the 8am tram, before any holidaymakers
are allowed up the mountain, can call us any time he pleases.
Before arriving in Utah, we had been at Jackson Hole, where a party was held
in our honour. We began our odyssey in Jackson Hole on January 1. And just
as he had promised, John Resor, the chief executive of Jackson Hole Ski
Corporation invited us and 38 guests - including Jay and Connie Kemmerer,
the ski resort owners - to his home in Teton Village to welcome us back.
The following day it was back to business: Lucy rashly suggested that we
should celebrate our return to Jackson by trying to break our record for the
number of vertical feet skied in one day. Nine rides up Rendezvous Mountain
in Jackson's Red Tram (cable car) would do it. But we aimed for 10, which
would give us a total of 42,000 vertical feet (about 35 miles).
By coincidence, we were due to be accompanied by Richard Edwards, Ski Scott
Dunn's representative in Jackson, who had kept us company last April when we
set up our previous record of 34,000ft at Champery in Switzerland.
Unhappily, Edwards - steaming down through the trees with us in Wally World
during our first descent, hooked a ski in deep powder and gashed his eyebrow
bad-ly.
We eventually managed our 10 trams with minutes to spare, but Richard's
injury rather cooled our elation and made us realise how fortunate we had
both been to escape serious injury this year.
One step Jackson is taking to make skiing safer is to install 'restraints'
(safety guards) on its lifts. For years American ski areas have had an
ambivalent attitude towards these, arguing that they sometimes caused more
accidents than they prevent. But Jackson Hole has finally come round to
thinking they are a good idea.
In America, skiers are discouraged from jumping from lifts with such signs
as 'Do not jump from lift - survivors will be prosecuted'.
From Jackson we drove 300 miles to Salt Lake City to investigate Wolf
Mountain and Robert Redford's resort, Sundance. Wolf Mountain used to be
called Park West but is being completely revamped.
Its trails are now linked with threatened species, with names such as
Cheetah, Red Kangaroo, Rattlesnake and Red Wolf Bowl. In a state which by
and large bans snowboarders, Wolf is out to be the snowboarding capital of
Utah, thus making skiers a threatened species too.
Inevitably Sundance, Redford's charming resort in the shadow of Mount
Timpanogos (12,000ft) the highest peak in Utah's Wasatch Range, has Butch
Cassidy connotations which rather belie the beauty and tranquillity of this
spectacular canyon.
There are runs called Outlaw, Maverick, Stampede, Badlands, Quickdraw and
Top Gun.
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at The Inn at Teton Village, Jackson
Hole, Wyoming. In Utah they stayed at the Olympus Hotel, 161 West 600 South,
Salt Lake City, The Mandan cottages at Sundance and the Silver King Resort
Hotel, 1485, Empire Avenue, Park City. They spent Christmas at The Cliff
Lodge at Snowbird, Utah.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Property: Sea-change in UK attitudes to property - Gerald
Cadogan looks back on 1994 and makes some predictions for the new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Come the millennium, we shall look back on 1994 as the year of a sea-change
in British attitudes on how to live. Finally, Britons have started to
understand that the prime purpose of housing is not as a get-rich-quick
investment vehicle - it is to provide a place to live.
Greedy 1980s attitudes - the idea of buying one's home to make a quick
profit - are now seen as a false trail. Instead, the UK is returning to the
pattern of low property price inflation that existed for decades up until
the 1960s. At the same time renting has become a sensible, and growing,
alternative to owner-occupation, which it has not been since before the
second world war.
The stagnant buying market for most of 1994 (except at the top end which has
seen price increases, mainly in London and the home counties) is the first
sign of this change.
Ironically, it has appeared while housing has been more affordable than for
many years in terms of wages (for those in work), prices and interest rates.
Another irony is that it has happened under a Tory administration that used
to espouse a property-owning democracy.
Pessimistic realism has replaced the optimism that potential buyers possess
when they embark on buying a house or flat. Home buying is a big emotional,
financial and family commitment and one of the three main decisions in most
people's lives (along with choosing a partner and obtaining a job).
This negative outlook stems from a combination of reasons. Negative equity
is the worst of them for the 1.096m households that the Bank of England
estimates cannot expect to repay their mortgage from the proceeds of selling
their home.
While it does not affect those secure in their jobs and not thinking of
moving, it stops anyone who wants to move. And for all who have suffered, it
has destroyed the once clear financial advantage of buying one's own home.
Redundancy is equally responsible for preventing people moving home. The
whittling away of mortgage interest relief and the Budget's cuts in mortgage
benefit on losing one's job make matters worse. So does the fear of higher
interest rates - not that they are overly high, but they have gone up and
there is little trust that they will stop where they are.
The final blow, many think, is our shambles of a government. How can we hope
for better things - which we must do to make sense of buying a home - when
government seems so inept? If you doubt the general lack of confidence and
refusal to take on debt, look at the figures for private car buying. As an
act of commitment, the car is second to the house. Yet potential buyers of
new cars are holding back.
The year 1994 began full of hope, especially for those who had thought of
moving but decided to wait for the 25 per cent rise in prices in prime
London properties (and 19 per cent across the country) that Savills
predicted in December 1993.
The cheer lasted the first quarter, when attractive, worry-removing,
low-rate, fixed mortgages were on offer, and a lucky few enjoyed large City
bonuses. Net sales recorded by the Corporate Estate Agents property index
peaked in February and March.
In April, mortgage relief was pared, fixed mortgage rates went up and
turnover fell. Since June it has been below 1993 levels, says the CEA.
Average house prices peaked in March, Halifax reports, although Nationwide's
did not until August.
Both indices agree more or less on a slight summer rise, and a decline since
September. The latest figures, for November, show a year-on-year decline of
0.6 per cent (Nationwide) or 1 per cent (Halifax), and fewer sales than a
year ago (CEA).
For top properties the story is different. They have always had their own
market. Prices have risen, although there is disagreement as to how much.
Savills estimates a 20 per cent annual rise in prime London homes until
September, which goes a long way to validating the firm's forecast for the
year.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's London residential review is more cautious: a 10 per
cent year-on-year rise to June 1994. Most agents would agree with that, if
quickly mentioning larger increases for Kensington houses on domestic
buying. Prices have returned to 1988-89 levels or sometimes better, but in
nominal terms. The retail price index shows that the pound has fallen by
about a third since 1988.
The Savills/KFR figures differ from those of the building societies, because
the societies work from their mortgage lending and necessarily pass over the
28 per cent of purchasers who do not need a mortgage, says William Gething,
of buying agent Property Vision.
These cash buyers are concentrated in London and the south east of England
(where prices have risen most) and they tend to buy more expensive
properties. Central London also benefits from foreign buyers, especially for
flats. They led the market's bounce back in autumn 1992, and have kept it on
the move since. If you are from Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia, London is
still good value.
The London rises have spread throughout the south east and westwards along
the M4 and in to the Cotswolds. Savills estimates a 12 per cent rise for the
best houses in the home counties (for which KFR suggests a less bullish 6
per cent).
Demand is high, and the supply of good period houses finite. Hampshire
agents have reported many unusually quick sales, some before the house even
came to market. The tactic of resorting to 'best and final offers' is a ploy
that produces figures well above the guide price, while at public auction
this autumn a Cotswold rectory needing renovation, with a Pounds 400,000
guide price, sold for Pounds 592,000.
The demand for larger houses has helped developers build pricier new homes,
laden with extras and much improved on their products of 10 years ago,
'which can, however, be hard to sell,' says David Bedford, of agent Bedford,
in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He suggests that if new home values continue to
rise, we may even see developers buying 1960s and 1970s houses to demolish
them for their site value.
Further from London, and off the motorways, prices have shown little growth.
East Anglia, for instance, offers fine value. A house with a few acres near
Newmarket, will cost 40 per cent less than a comparable house near Newbury,
says Jock Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells in Cambridge.
In 1995, present conditions and lack of confidence will continue. Buyers
should think in terms of local markets and get to know their chosen area and
its prices thoroughly. Be prepared for prices to race if there is
competition. Sellers of good properties can be sure of finding buyers, but
that still leaves the problem of where to move, which may stop them selling.
The best forecast is more of the same in all the different micro-markets.
Top housing prices will probably continue to push ahead faster than ordinary
housing. But it is hard to see that anything can produce large rises soon.
The prospect of a Labour government by 1997 will ensure that those who have
to sell for tax reasons, or to organise their estate for their children,
will do so fairly soon. Hamptons already reports a 20 per cent increase in
open market sales over Pounds 1m by its Guernsey office, and 'a similar
increase in successful applications for Jersey immigration at this level'.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Gardening: Mean, moody and magnificent - Robin Lane Fox
considers an extraordinary year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps gardeners should never look back: this past year has been
extraordinary and we have all had problems in keeping up with it. The
diagnosis is simple - natural bloody-mindedness, tempered by violent swings
of mood. Has it ever rained more when it decided to rain, or less when it
decided not to, and has any other year made such a nonsense of seasons and
rates of growth?
At either end of the year, the winter produced no serious frost, and I enter
1995 with half-hardy perennial verbenas which are three years old and still
unscathed. There is one obvious winner: the luscious green leaves of
Melianthus major have never looked fresher, reminding us all what a
marvellous foliage plant it is in a sheltered corner or in isolation in a
big clay pot. Londoners ought to grow it more.
They have started to grow more of my other winner, the white-flowered
Solanum jasminoides, which has stayed in flower through December. Even if a
frost kills the top growth against a south wall, it usually shoots again
from ground level. Nothing has hit it hard for the past 2 1/2 years and it
becomes spectacular against tall walls on London houses.
In January and February, it rained so absurdly that the first hellebores
outdoors were damaged and the crocuses began to open in a paddy field. The
flowers on many of my early hellebores had also been torn, and I learnt for
the first time how slugs will wreck them in mild winters. Be warned, and
protect them with the necessary pellets.
I have also learnt to double-up on an old favourite, the hardy
winter-flowering Cyclamen coum. Its flowers are brilliantly cheerful and
curiously hardy in any winter, although they are native to the warm Greek
island of Cos. We all ought to grow more of it.
Mild winters make us all appreciate winter flowers. As 1994 has been mild at
both ends, the winners are, unarguably, the yellow jasmine and, as usual,
the winter-flowering cherries which have been out for five months in the 12.
Encouraged by this year, I am now on the look-out for everything which
flowers early, from the marvellous single yellow Adonis vernalis, 6in high,
to the newer forms of garrya, with longer and richer catkins of green and
dove-pink and names like Glasnevin Wine.
In spring, my own best success was childishly simple: the deepest blue
forget-me-not, called Indigo, and a newly-planted mass of my favourite
narcissus for orchards, the old Ice Follies. Other people's best success was
more exotic: the brilliant blue Corydalis flexuosa which grows no more than
6in high, flowers incredibly, and arrived from China as recently as 1988.
This outstanding plant comes in two distinct colours, sky blue or electric
blue, both of which are lovely. It dies away after flowering but re-appears
in even better form for the next year. It prefers shade but does not insist
on this, or even on a lime-free soil.
It was 1994's plant of the year because mass propagation brought it into the
better garden centres at prices which ought to continue to drop. It would be
my plant of the year if I had not already picked, and grown, it since 1991.
By mid-May, everything was absurdly far ahead and we began to fear a blank
July. I have now found that early unpredictability is Mother Nature's
prelude to an outrage. It turned dark and wet in mid-May, relented for the
old-fashioned roses and, just as everything began to grow at an amazing
rate, refused to rain on most of us until mid-September.
Sprinkler systems and dying trees dominated summer's conversation. I was
thankful to have discovered one of the few pink-flowered old roses which
will flourish on my poor soil in a dry spell. Called Rose d'Orsay, it has
American blood and seems to have been forgotten by almost everyone except
the experts.
I would prefer to forget the next 10 weeks, apart from annuals with African
blood in them. Prospects looked good for a watering system for the new year
until the weather relented in time for October, everything smiled, and I
learnt to appreciate the smaller-flowered blue and white Michaelmas daisies
with names like Little Carlow.
Autumn crocus, nerines, sternbergias and all autumn bulbs were spectacular
after such a dry summer. So were the late autumn shrubs, reminding us once
again that these weeks are a keen gardener's potential heaven.
Where, meanwhile, has the frost gone? The rain has decided to overdose and
1994 remains the year without serious spells of winter. We picked fresh
roses in mid-December and penstemons remained in flower for Christmas. The
results have been chaotic.
My personal choice of chaos, however, consists of a bouquet which you could
have picked in Plymouth in time for Christmas: roses, blue clematis, red
escallonias, fuchsias, yellow-flowered senecio, blue ceanothus, winter
cherry and jasmine, and some totally misguided sprigs of lilac. With
trepidation, I wish them all a happy 1995.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: The lure of black pudding - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expert whispered: 'Keep it under your hat.' 'What?' I asked. 'Black
pudding,' he hissed. I was silent. 'As a bait,' he added. 'It's absolutely
deadly.'
I am a complete sucker for this kind of sales talk. Reason tells me the
notion of the novel, sure-fire fish attractor is an absurdity. But there is
a credulous, naive side to me which longs to believe it. And when the secret
is passed on with the right evangelistic conviction, I believe it.
So there I was, a day or two later, sitting beside the river Kennet and
moulding a sticky ball of pig's blood and guts to my hook. I chucked it in
to a promising place and waited for the action to begin. Nothing happened,
and my faith began to ebb as swiftly as it had been engaged.
I reeled in and looked at the lump of black pudding. How ridiculous, I
decided, to imagine that any self-respecting fish would eat such a thing? I
concluded that what my prey wanted was something less exotic and more
familiar.
So, I opened a tin of luncheon meat, chopped it into cubes and, within 45
minutes, had captured four good chub - the best of them a stout, dignified
alderman of a fish which pulled my spring balance down to 4 3/4 pounds.
Now, give me black pudding any day for my own taste. Luncheon meat - that
pink, greasy, poor cousin to Spam - is really pretty vile. But the fish,
particularly chub and barbel, think highly of it.
Indeed, so vast have been the quantities thrown into our rivers to titillate
the fishes' appetites that some strange side effects have been observed. It
is claimed that barbel have grown additional appendages as a result of the
hormones used to fatten the porkers.
In olden days, there was no such thing as luncheon meat; or, if there was,
it certainly was not fed to fish. The way anglers caught barbel then was
like this. Having identified a likely barbel-bearing stretch of river, you
would buy several thousand lobworms from Nottingham (why Nottingham should
have been the worm capital of England, I know not - but it was).
You would chop up these worms - say, 500 or so at a time - roll them into
balls of clay and deposit them in the chosen spot. Having done this on a
daily basis for a fortnight or so, you would sally forth to fish, confident
in the knowledge that if the barbel hadn't arrived yet, they never would.
You would drop a Nottingham lob into the hole; there might be a savage tug,
or there might not; and you might catch a barbel, or you might not. Even to
me, this seems an awful lot of trouble. Fortunately, luncheon meat is a good
deal easier to get than a wriggling, heaving package from Nottingham; and
the barbel seem to find it just as tempting.
Not that they are easy to catch; at least I do not find them so. But they
are well worth the persistence required, for there is no coarse fish which
fights harder, nor one which is more splendid to look at.
Having pigged out on chub that November afternoon, my thoughts turned to
barbel. So, I took my tin of meat down to the mill pool, where the water
foams and roars in a manner pleasing to this battler of the depths. By now,
full darkness had fallen.
I stuck a lump of plasticine on my line (a brilliant tip from Channel 4's
Screaming Reels, just in case I might be accused of originality) and a lump
of meat on the hook. I cast to the edge of fast water and soon felt that
thrilling tremble which is the first contact of the fish's mouth, followed
by the solid pull.
No other fish communicates such an immediate sensation of strength as the
barbel. You can feel the head boring, the great muscled tail and fins
driving it down. Back and forth that fish charged until, at last, its
bull-like power drained and I saw its gleam on the surface. Seven pounds it
weighed: not big as barbel go.
As I slipped it back, and watched it fade into the inky water, I blessed it
and the toothsomeness of pig flesh. As for the black pudding, I haven't
given up. Like the rest of us, barbel just need educating.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Spirit of the Caribbean - Giles MacDonogh
compares the islands' rums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rums reflect the nations that make them,' said Vincent Osborne, the jolly
proprietor of the soon-to-be-three branches of the Brixtonian bars and
restaurants.
'You wouldn't expect much subtlety from a Jamaican. Jamaicans are not subtle
people.' Reading my thoughts, he added that he was not from Jamaica, but
from quite another Caribbean island.
Osborne proved his point in the course of a tasting of a couple of dozen
rums in his Covent Garden branch, Brixtonian Backayard.
Rum is distilled wherever sugar cane is grown and in a few places where it
is not. There is African rum from Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa; Indian rum
reeking of petrol; Australian rum, which in its heyday was aged in old wine
casks from the Hunter Valley; and north and south American rum. The best, of
course, comes from the Caribbean.
Some rums from the former Spanish colonies were predictably fashioned for
the sweet-toothed: Ron Colonial, a golden rum from Guatamala, or Ron Artemi
from the Canary Islands, for example.
Cuba had its own style of white, un-aged rum, of which Bacardi is now the
best known example, even if it is now no longer made in Cuba and is these
days less of a rum than a popular white spirit. If you want to try a Cuban
white rum you would be better off with Havana Club. Both a white rum, and a
three-year-old, golden, banana-smelling rum are available here.
The old French colonies and the two French islands of Martinique and
Guadeloupe (which are now departments of France) make the best rums. Most
are made in column stills which produce a less pungent spirit than that made
in Jamaica, and one which needs a longer process of maturation.
Osborne let me taste a 15-year-old from the famous old Barbancourt estate on
Haiti which was wonderfully complex, if slightly too woody in the mouth. He
charges Pounds 13 a shot for this, but concedes that its rarity together
with the difficulty obtaining it (he has to trawl the bas fonds of Miami to
lay his hands on the odd bottle) tends to push the price up.
Martinique white rums don't impress me much, perhaps because I am reluctant
to see any drink submerged beneath a liquidised fruit cocktail. The Saint
James brand, widely distributed in France, makes a Royal Ambre which despite
a slightly sicky nose has lots of spice on the palate.
Even better were two rums from J. Bailly at Larjus du Carbet in Martinique.
The 1966 was a dream, an absolute must for anyone who doubts rum's ability
to hold its own among the world's great digestifs. From the Domaine de
Montebello came a 1948 rum which was magnificently spicy: cinnamon, cloves
and ginger.
In the old British colonies many of the rums were made in pot stills using
molasses as opposed to the cane juice preferred by the French. The result
can be very 'estery'.
Ben Cross de Chavannes, a veteran rum trader, showed me some startling
figures relating to the ester-count in Jamaican rums. In layman's terms this
means that many Jamaican rums are a good deal more aromatic than malt
whisky. Some of these rums are blended with less pungent distillates before
they are bottled in order to tame their natural explosivity.
Many Jamaican rums are bottled at high strength. These used to be the 'high
wines' - the 'fore-shots' of the distillation which are generally
redistilled because they have an off-flavour or 'feint' . During the Great
War these were the only spirits made available to the Jamaicans, and they
developed a taste for them. Fortunately, perhaps, these are not widely
available.
Anyone wishing to try a subtle white rum from a British island, should
sample The Baron's CSR from St Kitts, which is remarkably smooth. Cockspur
is a golden rum with a well-mannered drink with a faintly nutmeg-like aroma.
Not so Lang's Finest Old Banana. This shoots fruit at you from 30 paces; not
even drowning it in fruit juice was able to suppress its violent bouquet.
Two rather more house-tamed rums are El Dorado Demerara rum (from Guyana)
and Alfred Lamb reserve. The 15-year-old Guyanese rum has a smell which
reminded me of angelica. The Lamb is a rather buttery drink, big and
warming. These two come closest to being after-dinner drinks, but the French
in Martinique and Guadeloupe, I'm sorry to say, do it a lot better.
The Brixtonian. 11 Dorrell Place, London SW9 (071-978 8870); Brixtonian
Backayard, 4 Neal's Yard, London, WC2. (071-240 2769); from early January, a
new Brixtonian will be open at 269 Portobello Road, London W10 (081-968

FT  31 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: A Loire chef in Paris - Eating out in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two independent reports alerted me to the good value and creative cooking
Thierry Coue offers at Les Amognes - so independent that the sources of
these reports live 6,000 miles apart.
The first came from Mel Knox, a San Franciscan who makes his living selling
French oak barrels to American winemakers, the second from Robert Vifian,
chef and part-owner of Tan Dinh, a Parisian restaurant which combines
excellent Vietnamese cooking with a stunning wine list, particularly of
Pomerols (60 rue Verneuil, 7th, 45 44 04 84).
What had aroused Knox and Vifian's interest in this restaurant had been its
name, Les Amognes. This is Coues birthplace, a little village close to
Nevers, in central France, a city known wherever wine or brandy is produced
for the quality of the oak that comes from the forests nearby. As anyone in
the wine world will tell you, whenever an area is associated with the making
of good wine, good food is not far away.
I was glad that I went with such strong recommendations, however. Although
Les Amognes is only 100 metres from the Faidherbe-Chaligny Metro and near a
stop for the 86 bus which took me back to Boulevard St Germain, it is not
easy to find - particularly when scaffolding encases its entire front
window.
As I wandered along in search of lunch, I began to appreciate some of the
commercial problems Coue faces, which he was to explain when we talked after
lunch.
The 11th arrondissement is not a business area, so there are few people
eating on expense accounts and there is a plethora of cheap competition  -
Italian, Chinese and other French restaurants - seeking the custom of the
quartier.
'I opened here 4 1/2 years ago,' Coue explained, 'which means that I have
never really known anything other than difficult trading conditions. I have
one FFr170 (Pounds 20) menu which includes four courses, an ameuse-geule and
petits fours, service and tax. This is my price for lunch and dinner and I
know I cannot raise it even by FFr5.
'The restaurant can seat over 40 but I work with five staff. A maitre d',
who doubles as cashier, a commis who takes the coats, myself, a second chef
and a plongeur. I change the menu with the seasons but I cannot change the
price. The great challenge for me is to rework those ingredients which fit
this price and which the customers like into slightly different dishes on
the menu.'
To sit in Les Amognes is not particularly exciting. It is a long, dark room
with natural light only from the front window. The left-hand wall is exposed
brick and the bar to the right and the ceiling are of dark wood. Attention
and money is devoted to the food.
As you sit down, a dish of salmon rillette and thinly sliced baguette is
placed on the table together with the menu. Reading the menu I made the
mental resolution not to eat more than half the rillette but as my first
course arrived I had finished it.
Coue's menu contained two of my favourite ingredients so I knew immediately
what I would order but I saw several other dishes that I would return for:
beignets of salt cod with fried sage leaves, black pudding wrapped in filo
pastry, a terrine of wild rabbit and rosemary, a skate wing with aubergine
caviar, cep stuffed with oxtail and noisettes of venison, red cabbage and
chestnuts.
Since I like to eat what I cannot prepare easily at home, I ordered a dish
comprising eight small pieces of toast, with cubes of warm beef marrow
topped in turn with thin slices of radish and chives. Slivers of mustard
gave this comforting dish an extra length of flavour. This was followed by
five, plump scallops around a mound of sauteed salsify on a truffle sauce.
Then came a plate of three cheeses and roast figs stuffed with red fruits.
With the coffee came an intense almond tuile.
There is a good list of Loire wines but as Coue explained: 'We French
believe that a wine list has to begin with Champagne, then Bordeaux and
Burgundy. My Loires have to come after that.'
Persevere. There are lovely wines from Huet, several red Loires, Chinon and
Bourgeuil, with bottle age and three different cuvees of white wine in
halves from Didier Dageneau, the region's most dynamic wine maker.
I enjoyed Coue's cooking, and admired his style, modesty and diligence. I
left, too, with admiration for two of his female customers whom the maitre
d' told me were frequent visitors even though they were in their 80s.
Les Amognes, 243 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75011 Paris, 43 72 73 05.
Closed Sunday and Monday.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: In search of the UK's curry capital -
Nicholas Lander and Iqbal Wahhab enjoy drawing their own curry map of
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER and IQBAL WAHHAB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The figures are impressive. According to Pat Chapman, founder of The Curry
Club of Great Britain, there are 7,900 people for each Indian restaurant in
the UK.
This breaks down roughly as follows: in Bradford there are 2,000; Manchester
2,700; Birmingham 3,800; London 4,300 and Glasgow 5,319.
But the figures alone do not reveal the breadth and regional differences in
the spread of Indian cuisine which has been developing in Britain since
1945. To set this right - and to offer a spicy alternative to more
traditional winter fare - Nicholas Lander and Iqbal Wahhab, editor of
Tandoori magazine, set out to draw a curry map of Britain.
EAST LONDON
Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan before independence in 1971) has supplied
the last main migrant community into Britain. There are 300,000 Bangladeshis
in Britain, 30,000 of them in Tower Hamlets. They are mainly from the Sylhet
region of north-east Bangladesh and, in the past 25 years, a large array of
specialist grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have opened to serve them.
Although Bangladeshis own and run the majority of this country's 'Indian'
restaurants, the Bangladeshi diet is different, drawing heavily on fish and
vegetables. The Shampan, 79 Brick Lane, E1, (071-375 0475) serves
specialities such as Rhui, a carp-like freshwater fish which weighs an
average of 10lb to 15lb and is firm and creamy-textured.
At 132 Brick Lane (247-8210) there is The Aladin, replete with Formica
tables and semi self-service, where you go to the glass counter and point to
what you want. Here you can eat Bangladeshi vegetables such as potol, a
smaller and more compact form of the courgette or lal sag, a leaf spinach
that is beetroot red. Two doors away, Nazrul (247-2505) was made famous by
Salman Rushdie in The Satanic Verses.
Just off Commercial Road is the famous Pakistani establishment, the Lahore
Kebab House (2 Umberston Street, 488-2551). This is not only popular with
locals but also with well-heeled City visitors. Simple dishes such as seek
kebab (barbecued minced lamb) and karahi gosht - meat cooked in a karahi, a
two-handled cast iron pot used for cooking and presenting food - are
popular. The restaurant is unlicensed but you may bring your own wine.
SOUTHALL
Punjabis started arriving in Southall, south London, when, just after the
second world war, a rubber factory was set up in the area which appointed a
head of personnel who had been stationed in India. He had been so impressed
by Punjabi Sikh diligence that he began to recruit them. Punjabi food, by
contrast to Bangladeshi, is spicy and meat based, with an emphasis on kebabs
and karahi cooking.
Known as Britain's Little India, Southall has a vibrant, upbeat atmosphere
compared with Brick Lane. Its High Street hosts a spectacular array of
colours - from sari shops to grocery stores.
There are two 'upmarket' (ie licensed) restaurants of repute - Brilliant (72
Western Road, 081-574 1928) where the butter chicken is a real treat and
Madhu's Brilliant (39 South Road 081-574 1897).
According to local folklore, Madhu's Brilliant was set up by the sons of the
founder of the original restaurant. At the end of the 1970s Sanjay and
Sanjeer Anand were trying to convince their father that tandoori chicken was
going to be the next big development in Indian cooking and that they should
invest in a tandoor, a deep clay oven, in anticipation.
The father would not hear of it and so the sons set up on their own to prove
him wrong. Both continue to prosper.
Catering more for the local market is Rita's (9 Regina Street, 081-571 1848)
and Moti Mahal (94, The Broadway, 081-571 9443).
Here more traditional Punjabi dishes are served, such as aloo tikki, fried
potato in a tangy, tamarind-based sauce garnished with onion and coriander,
papri, a flat crisp bread with yoghurt and sauces and sarson ka saag, a
spicy puree of mustard leaves.
WEMBLEY
The Indians who settled in East African countries such as Kenya and Uganda -
and who were then expelled in the late 1960s by dictators such as Idi Amin -
came originally from the Indian state of Gujarat.
Many were small businessmen who began trading again when they came to
Britain. Gujaratis are predominantly vegetarian and their specialities, to
be sampled at restaurants such as Chetnas (420 High Road, 081-900 1466)
include bhel puris, a combination dish of puffed rice, sev (crispy
vermicelli) and puri (deep fried biscuits) served with tamarind, coriander
and chilli sauces.
Other Gujarati dishes include channa (curried chick peas) and maag (a thick
broth of black lentils served with naan bread).
Meat dishes are served at the popular Karahi King (213 East Lane, 081-904
2760) and Curry Craze (8-9 Neald Parade, Wembley Hill Road, 081-902 9720).
Look out for methi chicken, cooked with fenugreek seeds which gives a
pungent aroma.
CAMDEN
Although the area is predominantly Bangladeshi, there are on Drummond
Street, NW1, near Euston Station, renowned vegetarian, South Indian
restaurants such as Diwana Bhel Puri House (114 Drummond Street, 071-387
5556) and Ravi Shankar (133 Drummond Street, 388-6458). Apart from bhel
puris there are dosas, huge, traditional South Indian pancakes stuffed with
spicy vegetables and accompanied by a coconut sauce.
BIRMINGHAM
The land of the balti. The balti is like a karahi and both are similar to a
wok. Curries are served up in baltis, floating in a huge amount of sauce
best mopped up with the massive naan breads they serve, often up to 18
inches long.
Claims to the origins of the balti range from Sparkbrook, a Birmingham
suburb, to a place called Baltistan which Pat Chapman, of the Curry Club,
spotted with a magnifying glass on a map of north western Pakistan.
Look out for The Adil (148, Stoney Lane, Balsall Heath, 021-449 0335) which
like most of Birmingham's 300 balti houses is unlicensed. Also safe bets are
Kababish (29 Woodbridge, 021-449 5556) and Royal Al Faisal (136-140 Stoney
Lane, Sparkbrook, 021-449 5695).
LEICESTER
One third of Leicester's population is Indian, the highest concentration of
any city outside India. They are predominantly Gujarati in origin but the
owners of Madhu's Brilliant (of tandoori chicken fame in Southall) own Curry
Fever (139 Belgrave Road, 0533-662941). Belgrave Road is Leicester's curry
centre although Melton Road offers good competition with, in particular, The
Taj at number 259 (0533-662185).
BRADFORD
Bradford boasts the highest concentration of curry restaurants in the
country. Bradford's Pakistanis are mainly from the Mirpur region, just south
of Kashmir and Pakistani cuisine is the most meat based of any region of the
Indian sub continent, typified in gosht khara massala, lamb cooked with
whole spices.
Here there is a heavy emphasis on kebabs and biryani dishes not just in
restaurants but also in private houses which open their dining rooms to
those in search of an authentic, home-made curry. Look for discreet signs in
the windows of these houses.
The Aargh (27 Westgate, 0274-594660) serves an excellent raan - a leg of
lamb marinated in yoghurt and spices and then roasted slowly. The Kashmir
(27 Morley Street, 0274-726513) is the oldest of Bradford's restaurants
having opened its doors in 1955. The chef at Shah Jahan (726 Manchester
Road, 0274-724814) recently won the Bradford chef of the year competition.
MANCHESTER
Like Bradford, predominantly Pakistani. The place to head for is Wilmslow
Road, Rusholme - aka 'Curry Alley' - where there are restaurants such as the
Tandoori Kitchen (061-224 2329) and The Punjab (061-225 1542) and a number
of cheaper cafes such as The Shezan (061-224 3116).
Classic Pakistani dishes such as haleem, a spicy broth of lentils and meat
cooked gently overnight, are sometimes available as a special.
More upmarket is the Gaylord (Mariots Court in the city centre, 061-832
4866) where a signature dish is methi mazz - minced lamb cooked with spinach
and fenugreek, Kashmiri style.
SCOTLAND
For the past two decades the Highlands of Scotland have been home to
Pakistani door-to-door salesmen while the racial mix of the Lowlands is more
evenly balanced: Punjabi Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in Glasgow,
Indians and Bangladeshis in Edinburgh.
In Glasgow there is the Killermont Polo Club (2022 Maryhill Road, near
Bearsden 041-946 5412) and Babir's Ashoka (108 Eldershie Street, 041-221
1761) which offers no less than 10 types of pakora - pastry pyramids with
spicy fillings.
Popular in Edinburgh are the Indian Cavalry Club (3 Atholl Place 031-228
3282), the southern Indian vegetarian restaurant, Kalpna (2-3 St Patrick
Square, 031-667 9890), and The Verandah (17 Dairy Road, 031-337 5828), which
boasts Clint Eastwood among its clientele.
Iqbal Wahhab is editor of Tandoori magazine and runs East-West
Communications.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: The Cup that blotted out the fun - War and Peace
(Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the
Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of
1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN

<TEXT>
The World Cup has grown so large that it blots out the sun for five weeks
and throws into shade other sports events for months before and after. But
around the orgy of marketing and broadcasting there was a normal sporting
year, with an abnormal number of extreme highs and lows.
The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in February opened in a blaze of
publicity after Nancy Kerrigan, a figure skater, was attacked with a crow
bar during the US trials by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of her chief rival
Tonya Harding.
Kerrigan lost at the Olympics to Oksana Bayul of the Ukraine. In Britain,
24m people tuned in to watch Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean try in vain
to regain the Olympic ice dance title. Instead, the hero of the games was
the impossibly noble Norwegian Johan Olav Koss, an Easter Island man on
blades, who won three golds and set three world records.
The unfancied Welsh won the five nations championship in rugby, though
nobody could quite work out how they did it. Wigan won the double in rugby
league. But the visits of the Australian rugby league team and the South
African union side suggested that the centre of gravity in both sports
remains firmly in the southern hemisphere.
The balance of power in golf is also shifting south of the equator. Nick
Price of Zimbabwe won the Open and the US PGA. While Ernie Els of South
Africa won five tournaments, including the US Open, and a record Pounds
1.8m.
Cricket had its share of heroes and villains. Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield
Sobers' test scoring record with 375 against England in Antigua in April,
then joined Warwickshire, helping them to win three trophies, and scoring
501 against Durham at Edgbaston.
The England Test team continued to reel from crisis to crisis, pausing only
to raise their fans' expectations cruelly with competent performances
against West Indies in Barbados, where Alec Stewart scored two centuries,
and against South Africa at the Oval, where Devon Malcolm took nine wickets
for 57 runs to save the series. The nadir among many low spots was the
unseemly matter of the dirt in captain Mike Atherton's pocket. The England
team finished the year supine at the feet of Shane Warne, the Australian
spin bowler.
The Formula 1 drivers' championship was decided in the last Grand Prix in
Adelaide where Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill at speed.
Schumacher was widely accused of crashing deliberately to preserve his lead
in the championship. Like all the drivers, Schumacher is acutely aware of
the dangers of losing control. The whole season was raced under a pall after
Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in much-replayed crashes. If
Schumacher was so desperate to win that he was prepared to risk being a
posthumous champion, then he has crossed the line between bravery and
lunacy.
Perhaps the anti-blood sports league should found a branch to protect
humans. It could demonstrate at grand prix circuits, American football games
and boxing matches. Boxing resembles professional wrestling more every year.
But wrestling has better costumes, fitter performers and more plausible
fights.
Twenty years ago in Kinshasa, a superbly fit 25-year-old faced Muhammad Ali,
32 and deemed to be over the hill, for the world heavyweight title. Ali won.
George Foreman lost. It is a measure of how far boxing has decayed that in
November, Foreman, now an overweight, bald, grandfather, regained the
heavyweight crown.
It is easy to understand why Frank Bruno was so willing to foresake
pantomime in search of yet another last boxing pay-day, since there is less
and less difference between the two.
Tennis also needs a serious heavyweight champion. Martina Navratilova
retired; Monica Seles refused to unretire; Steffi Graf often played as if
she was thinking of retiring; and Jennifer Capriati, retired, was arrested
in a drugs raid, and then came back. The WTC raised the minimum age for
players to protect them from burning out. It then waived the rules to admit
two 14-year-olds with star quality: Martina Hingis and Venus Williams.
Pete Sampras finished the year as men's number one. He is the leader of an
elite of hard-working young men without charisma who hit the ball very hard.
The exception is Andre Agassi, who returned after a five-month lay-off and
won the US Open unseeded, pleasing those who still believe in genius.
The apex of the soccer year was not the World Cup final but the European Cup
final in May. Milan swept aside Barcelona 4-0 with a performance that seemed
to herald a new era for the club and the sport. Instead, the club's fortunes
have mirrored those of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi. In the autumn, Milan
lost the World Club final to Velez Sarsfield, a poor and unglamorous club
from Buenos Aires.
The World Cup in the US opened well. Fifa, world soccer's governing body,
had, it seemed, got it right. The stadiums were full; the referees enforced
new, harsher laws and, as a result, goals and play flowed.
A darker note entered in the second round after Diego Maradona was expelled
for drug-taking and Andreas Escobar was shot after scoring an own goal which
helped eliminate Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favourites.
Matches were staged at midday or in mid-afternoon to accommodate European
television viewers, and the soccer began to suffer.
Players had to work in conditions that ran from sweat-shop (New York),
through steel-foundry (Dallas) to Turkish bath (Orlando).
Teams that had spent five weeks playing in steam ran out of it in the end.
The final was a weary spectacle. It yielded no goals and was decided by the
inability of the cramped legs of Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio to keep
their penalties down.
The finals still yielded rich memories: Baggio's last-minute heroics, George
Hagi's guile, Hristo Stoichkov's explosiveness, Saeed Owairan's unorthodoxy,
Romario's gift for the unexpected, the Nigerian mix of delicacy and power,
the attacking teamwork of the Spaniards. The World Cup provided some light
in the year of the crash and the crow bar.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: They died with their football boots on - War and
Peace (Playing fields and battlefields) / Simon Kuper says football is
politics by other means
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER

<TEXT>
The great Dutch manager Rinus Michels once said that football was war. After
El Salvador and Honduras met in three controversial matches in 1969, the
tanks rolled in. But more often, countries play football as an alternative
to war.
It seems that many people all over the world see life as a permanent battle
for status between 200-odd nations.
But football is by far the most direct way of ranking.
Recently, I spent a year travelling the world to write a book* about
football and politics. In Argentina, I spoke to an army general named
Enciso, who recalled the night that Argentina won the World Cup in 1978:
'All the country was on the streets. Radicals embraced with Peronists,
Catholics with Protestants and with Jews, and all had only one flag: the
flag of Argentina]'
I asked if he could compare this to the Falklands War, when the crowds
filled the streets of Buenos Aires again. 'Exactly]' said Enciso. 'It was
exactly the same]' So much so that the World Cup song, 'Vamos Argentina.
Vamos a Ganar' (Go on Argentina, Go and Win) was cranked out again during
the war. When Maradona's 'hand-of-God' goal put the English out of the 1986
World Cup, most Argentines felt the victory pretty much cancelled out defeat
in war.
Things may change when Croatia first play Yugoslavia, but the biggest grudge
match in Europe remains the Netherlands against Germany. When the Dutch beat
the Germans in Hamburg in 1988, 9m Dutchmen, or 60 per cent of the
population, took to the streets to celebrate. Although it was a Tuesday
night, it was the biggest public gathering since the liberation. A former
resistance fighter went on TV to say: 'It feels as though we've won the war
at last', and the Dutch poet Jules Deelder wrote of Marco van Basten's
winning goal: 'Those who fell rose cheering from their graves.'
On that night the decades seemed to fall away. The Germans still wore eagles
on their chests; the Dutch players were the resistance, and the Germans the
Wehrmacht. These comparisons are absurd, but they occurred to most Dutchmen.
Vrij Nederland, a magazine that began as an underground news-sheet during
the German occupation, interviewed the Dutch full-back Berry van Aerle: 'In
the match against Germany, you pulled the injured Voller's hair.' (The Dutch
have a particular dislike for the German striker Rudi Voller.) 'Did I pull
his hair? I can't remember that. I patted him on the head. I didn't pull his
hair.'
'No?'
'No. I patted him on the head and he got angry. I don't know why either. He
reacted quite strangely; he suddenly jumped up to chase after me, but when
Ronald stopped him he fell again and started rolling about. I thought that
was strange behaviour.'
Both the journalist and Van Aerle knew what really happened, but a
resistance fighter never discusses his heroics. He hints at them, using
irony.
As well as Wehrmacht against resistance, Hamburg was also a reversal of the
invasion: an orange-clad Dutch army numbering tens of thousands drove its
cars into Germany and defeated the inhabitants. (In the era of regular
England-Scotland games, the Scots would conquer London for the day.) People
in the Netherlands sang: 'In 1940 they came. In 1988 we came, Holadiay,
Holadio.'
The Ukrainians remember a similar game during the German occupation. Outside
the Dynamo Stadium in Kiev, there is a statue that depicts four men, all
10ft tall, who stand arm in arm gazing into the distance. They are wearing
shorts so you know that they are a monument to a football match.
The Germans arranged a match against Dynamo Kiev. The spectators were all
German soldiers with machine-guns, and when the Ukrainians took the lead the
soldiers began to fire at their legs.
Though several players went down, Dynamo hung on to win. After the final
whistle the whole team was executed. It was, in short, Escape to Victory
with an unhappy end. A famous Soviet film was made of the match, and the
actor who played the goalkeeper looked so much the part that a club offered
him a contract.
Sadly, the story is a myth concocted after the war by the local Communist
Party. No doubt some kind of game did take place, for one survivor still
lives in Kiev, but sensibly he remains silent.
The Germans really began to get over the war in 1954. That year, West
Germany was re-admitted to the World Cup, and won it. Friederich Christian
Delius, a pastor's son and author of the autobiographical novel, The Sunday
I won the World Cup, says: 'The time of defeat was past; from now on victory
was the aim.'
Many of the players had fought in the war or been taken prisoner. as Delius
writes: 'Never again would a German team be so representative of the
nation.'
As the journalist Brian Glanville has noted, the former England manager
Bobby Robson was obsessed with the world wars. But this did not give him an
overriding desire to beat the Germans (even though England fans like to
sing, 'Two world wars and one world cup, doo-dah, doo-dah]' at German
supporters).
Rather, the first and second world wars shaped the way Robson picked his
players. He told Pete Davies, author of All Played Out, about his captain
Bryan Robson: 'You could put him in any trench and know he'd be the first
over the top . . . he wouldn't think, well, Christ, if I put my head up
there it might get shot off. He'd say: 'C'mon, over the top.'' Robson may
have had in mind the first world war officers who would start a 'push' by
kicking a football out of the trench and chasing after it.
Robson is typical of British managers. People talking about football tend to
draw their metaphors from one of two fields: art or war.
Brazilian football has 'the rhythm of samba', and the British have 'fighting
spirit'. British managers almost always compare football to war, and the
players they favour are like soldiers: fearless, hardworking men who never
question their superiors. As Robson said, when he was reluctant to play the
prodigy Paul Gascoigne: 'You have to be utterly reliable.' Soldiers are
reliable, artists are not.
I realised just how much war can seem like football when I met another, more
senior, Argentine general, whom I shall call Sanchez. We were sitting in the
building of the Supreme Council of the Argentine Armed Forces, the highest
military organ in Argentina, and the setting was comic-book South America.
The building is shrouded by palm trees, guarded by soldiers with
machine-guns and moustaches.
Sanchez is a tall, thin man with a military moustache (no surprises there)
who looks like Enoch Powell. He had primed himself for our meeting: he was
carrying two files, one containing his incidental writings on football, and
the other his book on football tactics. Written in 1951, it had never been
published, and what he had in the file was the original, yellowed, typed
manuscript. He was nervous: he had walked around with his ideas in these
dusty files for 40 years, and here was someone who wanted to know. It was
why he had overcome his instinctive fear of the media to speak to me.
'If my team is concentrated on this small piece of paper,' Sanchez
gesticulated, 'and the opposition is spread out over that big file, then I
will have superior numbers in the crucial areas. You must have a force that
is compact, organised, and moving forward.'
I suggested that his ideas on football rang somewhat military. 'No, it's not
military,' he snapped, before adding: 'The principles of war can be applied
to anything.'
I suspected that he had done things the other way around: that he had
applied his footballing theories to military strategy, rather than vice
versa. It was chilling to listen to: old men all over the world expound
half-baked coaching manual wisdoms, but here was one who might use them on
the battlefield.
Football against the Enemy, by Simon Kuper, Orion, Pounds 9.99, is the 1994
William Hill sports book of the year.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: Careers fall to drugs and money - War and Peace
(Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the
Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of
1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN

<TEXT>
Antics off the sports field often dominated the headlines in 1994. Tales of
drugs and money were everywhere. More competitors were caught using drugs to
put extra meat on their bones. More agents, officials and competitors were
caught trying to take a larger cut from the fatted calf.
In soccer, Marseilles finished second in the French first division and were
relegated over a bribes scandal. In England, Bruce Grobbelaar, the
Southampton goalkeeper, was accused of taking money to throw matches. The
battle between Tottenham Hotspur and the Football Association over the
club's list of controversial financial deals dragged on until December.
Perhaps the FA should be grateful to the lawyers who persuaded them to
reduce Tottenham's punishment to a Pounds 1.5m fine.
As the Tottenham matter was being settled, George Graham, manager of
Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal, was accused of accepting Pounds
285,000 - allegedly paid back later, with interest, to Arsenal - from Rune
Hauge, the agent of John Jensen, a Dane who Graham bought in 1992. Graham is
not the only manager to have had dealings with Hauge.
If every club suspected of strange transfer dealings or of quietly writing
cheques to the Inland Revenue were relegated, Notts County would be in the
Premier League.
In the US, the baseball season ended abruptly and the National Hockey League
season never started as the team owners fell out with players. The dispute
is, ostensibly, over the players' willingness to accept the ever more
enormous sums of money the owners offer them. The owners want to introduce
salary caps, on the model of the National Basketball Association and
National Football League.
In the NBA, clubs are coming up with increasingly imaginative contracts.
Even with a salary cap the owners of wealthy clubs cannot resist trying to
pay as much as they can afford to star players.
The early experiences of the NFL salary cap - most teams have got rid of
highly-paid players, while the San Francisco 49ers have carried on signing
one superstar after another - suggest that the more complex the rules, the
greater the advantage of the best-run clubs. The 49ers have worked out the
nuances of the cap quicker than their rivals and used it to rebuild their
fading power.
In soccer, bungs, backhanders and tax dodges are the product of the desire
of the rich clubs to exploit their financial advantage and of less-wealthy
clubs to keep up. They are also the natural coin of an industry which seems
content to allow its managers to dip into the pot on their own behalf
whenever they conduct financial transactions.
Naturally, the soccer authorities find it convenient to blame outsiders  -
the agents - and plan to issue licences. But clubs eager to sign a star will
still talk to whoever the player chooses to represent him. The fact that an
agent plays too rough for the FA or Uefa may only recommend him to a player
keen to employ the toughest negotiator.
The year brought a fresh crop of steroid busts, each followed by the usual
protestations of innocence. In athletics, Britain leads the world in drug
use. Six Britons tested positive in 1994, led by Diane Modahl, a popular and
successful middle-distance runner.
Perhaps more significant were the positive tests of 11 Chinese competitors,
most of them swimmers, at the Asian games in Japan. These seemed to confirm
western suspicions that the recent successes of Chinese women were the
product of systematic drug use.
Diego Maradona's expulsion from the World Cup, after he tested positive for
five varieties of the stimulant ephedrine, drew mixed reactions. The British
tabloids, who still bear a grudge for the Hand of God goal that knocked
England out of the 1988 World Cup, were gleeful. In Argentina it was viewed
as a disaster.
Unlike steroids, stimulants must be taken just before competition and will
always show up in drug tests. They are taken by idiots or by desperate men.
For Maradona they were, briefly, the elixir of youth. They gave him nothing
that he had not once possessed. For three games he recaptured some of his
earlier brilliance. Soccer fans who drew pleasure from his reborn genius
will have regarded his disgraced exit from world football with mixed
feelings.
Cocaine is just for idiots. Perhaps the only surprise about the affair of
Paul Merson, the Arsenal footballer, is that it has taken so long for the
drug to spread from north American sport. Even so, the Merson case had a
peculiarly British twist. Merson said he snorted coke to keep himself going
during lager drinking sessions.
Merson was condemned by a host of pundits and ex-pros for setting a bad
example to young fans with his drug taking. Of course, cocaine is illegal
while lager is legal, but someone should tell children that drinking 14
pints of lager a night is also a bad idea.
One of the most encouraging spectacles of the year was watching bemused
middle-Americans being dragged round World Cup stadiums by children in
soccer T-shirts.
The experience of the US soccer authorities since then provides a healthy
reminder that money has its limits. The USSF, in spite of its mountain of
World Cup cash and goodwill, failed to launch the professional league it had
promised Fifa. Even the biggest, gaudiest sporting blooms grow from the
ground up. The US soccer authorities would be better advised to nurture
instead the flourishing grassroots of soccer in their country and show a bit
of patience.
But patience was a quality in short supply in a year when so many in sport
tried to take short cuts to success.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: The battle for history - War and Peace (Populist
social history and glimpses of hell) / Antony Thorncroft discusses the
changing strategies of war museums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is extremely unlikely that the Imperial War Museum in south London will
ever change its name to the European Peace Museum. Its director Alan Borg
thinks that any pejorative element in its title has long been accepted as a
quirk of history. No one visiting the museum could think for one moment that
it glorifies war or colonial conquest. Its theme is the history of warfare:
if anything it is likely to make pacifists of us all.
But the current museum is not quite what its creators anticipated when the
old Bedlam lunatic asylum was converted after the first world war into a
memorial to its veterans and as an example to their children. Then there was
a more heroic, patriotic, theme. Now Borg is keen to play up the wider
ramifications of nations at war.
The two most successful exhibitions held there recently, on 'Forces
Sweethearts' and the 'Wartime Kitchen and Garden', illustrate this greater
concern with the social history of wartime. It also helps the museum to
widen its appeal - attendances have risen steadily to nearly 500,000 a year.
In the future the IWM is set to become even more sensitive to changing
attitudes. Its permanent displays will feature recent events more
prominently - the comparatively bloodless strategies of the cold war, and
the activities of United Nations peace keepers. Borg is also about to launch
a multi-million appeal for funds to convert part of the IWM into something
very close to a Holocaust museum.
These have become very popular in recent years, with an impressive museum
just opened in Washington. Borg's project will not concentrate exclusively
on the experiences of the Jews. It will look at all victims of conflict. It
draws some inspiration from the successful Museum of Tolerance at Los
Angeles.
Of course traditional military museums, full of uniforms, and weapons, and
paintings of battles, will continue. The National Army Museum is an
under-appreciated gem in Chelsea, with enough red coats on display to stir
the blood of any retired Cheltenham colonel; regimental museums litter the
land; the Royal Armouries has succeeded in persuading commercial backers to
join the government in helping to fund a large new museum in Leeds to
supplement its display at the Tower of London. The de-commissioning of
barracks and naval bases throughout the UK following defence budget cuts
should free historic buildings that heritage entrepreneurs will see as ideal
homes for yet more museums dedicated to military life.
But basically these will be depositories of objects, many harking back to
distant conflicts in far-off centuries. War museums telling the history of
war, like the IWM, are very rare and are already outnumbered by museums of
peace. There is a case to argue that more resources should be devoted to
keeping alive poignant reminders of officially sanctioned death.
This popular embarrassment about war is affecting the commemorations
surrounding the 50th anniversary of the second world war. The British
government gave itself a bloody nose with its crass attempt to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the D Day Landings last year with parties; the veterans,
marshalled by Dame Vera Lynn, wanted, and eventually got, a more sober
tribute, based around on the personal memories of the participants.
The government has given the department of National Heritage a modest Pounds
5m to spend on VE and VJ Day memorials but they are unlikely to be too
triumphalist. Significantly the IWM is also adopting a low key approach to
remembering the end of the second world war. Its exhibitions concentrate on
minor themes, like the German occupation of the Channel Islands, London at
war, and the war in the Far East.
With the main participants - the UK, the US, Germany and Russia - indecisive
about how to react to this major anniversary it has been left to Belgium to
mount the most comprehensive exhibition ever devoted to the second world
war. If you would like to see the piece of paper Chamberlain waved after
Munich; Himmler's death mask; Stalin's hand gun; Hitler's personal world map
and order to invade Poland; Monty's uniform, and more, so much more, you
must visit the Museum of the Army in Brussels before May 14.
Called 'I was 20 in '45' it attempts to popularise the war without
cheapening it; presenting it as a thrilling story to the generations with no
wartime memories while respecting the more sombre feelings of the
participants, both active and passive. In fact it achieves at a gallop what
hundreds of military museums offer in a reserved and restricted manner - to
consign the war to history, but history with a heart.
Perhaps it is now time to look objectively at the conflict. Very few people
can observe the battlefield at Agincourt and feel little but excitement at
David defeating Goliath. Waterloo, too, is given over to military historians
and battlefield touring groups, with minimal identification with the
suffering endured. The Somme and Paschendale are losing something of their
message for our times as personal survivors dwindle. The second world war,
because it was less pointless, and less bloody, than the first, is fast
becoming an unemotional issue.
The Brussels exhibition helps this process along. It might be thought that
Belgium, always at the epicentre of European warfare, is in the best
position to see things objectively. This is a vain, indeed an unwarranted,
expectation: there can be few wars in which the villain is more blatant.
But, as in many military museums based on objects, it still remains
difficult to find the horror in documents like the Russo-German pact, or
Boris Yeltsin's written confirmation that the Russians perpetrated the Katyn
massacre. The documents and artifacts of war too often look bureaucratic,
although the memorabilia of the Holocaust, in photographs and artifacts,
like gold teeth torn from the Jews, will always freeze the soul.
Where the exhibition scores is in its unexpected tableaux. You move through
a chronological history, starting in 1914 and including the gun of Princip,
the assassin of the Austrian Archduke, and then are suddenly enveloped in a
recreated trench of the first world war. It is slightly misleading in being
the trench occupied by sentries rather than the actual bunkers where the
troops spent most of their time, but the point is made.
It is made again in other imaginative tableaux - a cabaret bar in Berlin
just smashed up by Nazis; a schoolroom in Belgium raked by the invading
Germans; a London Underground station where the population sheltered at
night; Hitler's luxurious bunker; and, most spectacular of all, a view
through a window of a devastated Berlin at the climax of the war. It is in
these fabricated mock-ups that the reality of war hits home, more
effectively than in the genuine relics.
What with videos and old film, broadcast speeches and uniforms, photographs
and maps, extending over a two kilometre plus journey, the exhibition is
relentless in its barrage of images. But it ends on a sobering note -
totally white and empty space to convey the nothingness that follows an
atomic blast.
'I was 20 in '45' is unashamedly populist, tugging at the emotions, but it
is also historically fair, carefully non- controversial, and sometimes
tedious. It manages the challenge of offering reflections to those with long
enough memories and information to the young. It could well be the last
comprehensive exhibition of the second world war in which visitors can
identify personally with the objects. In future, war museums will be
conveying history; peace museums tolerance.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Visions of the horror of the century - War and Peace
(Populist social history and glimpses of hell) / Contemporary artists feel a
need to respond to the legacy of concentration camps, writes Lynn MacRitchie
</HEADLINE>

In visual art, there is a face of war. Goya saw and drew it, and it could be
glimpsed throughout A Bitter Truth, Richard Cork's survey of the art of the
first world war which has just closed at the Barbican. It was also evident
in the paintings and drawings Peter Howson produced as official war artist
in Bosnia, shown at the Imperial War Museum this autumn. This face, usually
that of a man, stares out, a living skull, huge eyes locked wide open, too
many horrors witnessed for them ever again to close in peaceful rest.
For the most part, this face is absent from After Auschwitz, the first
exhibition in Britain of contemporary art responding to the Holocaust, which
opens in London in February. Concentrating on work produced in the past five
to ten years, curator Monica Bohm Duchen has rejected work she describes,
reluctantly but accurately, as 'Holocaust Kitsch' - over-familiar images
exploiting the viewer's responses in too obvious a way.
Trusting to aesthetic criteria alone, she reduced down to 20 a list of
several hundred artists, which included famous names such as RB Kitaj as
well as unknowns suggested by Jewish and Holocaust organisations contacted
all over the world. Of these artists, three are Holocaust survivors.
Zoran Music, born in Slovenia in 1909, is not a Jew, but was imprisoned in
Dachau for resistance activities. He made more than 200 drawings in the
camp, but the exhibition concentrates instead on work from the series 'We
are not the last', begun in the 1970s.
Music, like the two other survivors, was unable to deal directly with the
subject of the camps in his work until many years had passed. In his
paintings, that 'face of war' recurs set stunned and staring atop sketchily
suggested piles of bodies.
Kitty Klaidman, born in Czechoslovakia in 1937, now lives in Washington.
Recently, she returned to the Czech village where, as a child, she was
hidden in a storeroom. Her stylised monochrome paintings refer to the
architecture of her hiding place, and especially to the attic, which allowed
her the occasional glimpse of the outside world.
Daisy Brand, born in Czechoslovakia in 1929, now lives in Boston and worked
as a professional potter for many years. As a girl of 14, she experienced
seven camps in one year. Since the 1980s she has been making wall sculptures
relating to her experiences, using earthenware, porcelain and other media.
In the triptych 'The Broken Promise' three earthenware boxes contain
Torah-like scrolls made of porcelain, two of which have been unrolled to
show drawings of an abstract, many-chambered interior and a railway track
running into the distance.
The well-intentioned argument that only those who have direct experience of
terrible historical events such as the Holocaust have any 'right' to speak
of them fails to address the need felt by many others to deal in their work
with what George Steiner called 'the black mystery of what happened in
Europe'.
In a world where nationalist wars are raging and both neo-fascism and
anti-semitism have re-emerged as political forces in Germany, the continuing
struggle to understand the significance of the Holocaust has a particular
urgency.
Shimon Attie, born in the US in 1957, now lives and works in Berlin, making
a series called 'Writing on the Wall'. He projects slides of pre-war
photographs of Jewish residents on to the walls of the buildings standing at
the same locations today, photographing the results. Thus in
'Almstadstrasse', 1991, the figure of a religious book salesman of the 1930s
peers from a crumbling doorway next to a block of modern apartments. The
juxtaposition, while poetic in its poignancy, is also shocking.
The German photographer Henning Langheim, in his series 'Memorials', takes
black and white pictures of the sites of places of atrocity as they are
today. His most recent work includes an image of the extermination camp of
Maly Trostenets. The empty landscape is dotted with pieces of bodies, which
on closer examination turn out to be the discarded remains of demolished
statues of Soviet heroes; the liberators of yesterday, become fallen
oppressors in their turn.
The exhibition's title refers to Theodor Adorno's maxim that 'to write a
poem after Auschwitz is barbaric'. In her catalogue essay, Duchen points out
that Adorno's phrase dates from 1949, 'when the shock of the camps was still
fresh'. She suggests that artists would be 'foolhardy' to ignore the moral
issues raised by the relationship between culture and barbarism. Since one
of the greatest difficulties in approaching the subject of the Holocaust is
to find a way of grasping a horror on a scale that defies imagining, Duchen
is clear that we need to find means other than the merely documentary to
help us to understand 'not just with the mind but also with the heart'. She
suggests that 'art's ability - or otherwise - to deal with the most
significant event of the twentieth century can be seen as a crucial gauge of
art's credentials in post-war society.'
A mixed exhibition of work by artists of such varied experience and
background may be hard pressed to rise to the challenge. But the recognition
that artists still feel that they must try to understand this manifestation
of the heart of darkness is a welcome acknowledgement of their place as
participants in the exploration of the nature of humanity.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Just stay calm as the next fad arrives - War and Peace
(Populist social history and glimpses of hell) / And away with fakery and
lunch] Our critics make some New Year resolutions for themselves and others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The New Year may revive old desires; it also revives old rancours. So, this
year, away with all sorts of fakery and misbegotten Swan-Lakery. Leave well
alone is the message for would-be producers of 'the classics'. Let
swan-molestation be an indictable offence. Resolve to obey the dictum:
'Petipa knew best'.
And 'No' to interval drinks kindly provided by managements who have found a
vineyard on the outskirts of Hell for the tipple they offer.
And no, no, a million times no, to any more of Channel Four's Tights,
Camera, Action series, which turns dance on television into an Olympic
contest for the fastest switch-off. And, cunningly, manages to avoid showing
talented dance-creators.
But a hugely supportive 'Yes' to the work of such bright talents as Jonathan
Burrows and Mark Baldwin, who are making exciting new moves.
And let everyone resolve to give support to the work of Candoco and of
Wolfgang Stange, who use dance to enrich the lives and artistic potential of
disabled people.
*****
As 1995 draws nigh, the next fad in classical music must already be
preparing to take a bow.
Pavarotti started the rot with 'Nessun dorma'. Ever since the Italian world
cup it has been impossible to show football on television without the
accompanying soundtrack of Big Lucy hitting a high B as the ball goes into
the net.
Taverner's 'The Protecting Veil' came next, cello and orchestra straining in
religious ecstasy. Then - the music gets thinner each time - came Gorecki's
Third Symphony.
The two-minute extracts on Classic FM made that sound almost appealing, but
sitting through the whole symphony in the Royal Festival Hall was quite
another matter. When that was followed by a band of Spanish monks singing
Gregorian chant, we knew we had reached rock bottom.
The marketing department of EMI deserves a special prize for digging out
that old recording and getting it into the charts.
So my New Year resolution is to remain calm when the next fad arrives, to be
philosophical about the way the public is led like sheep and not to scream
'Oh, my God, whatever next?'. What will be next, you ask? Well, they say
whale noises are on the way in. A medley of high-pitched squeaking over an
undulating wash of strings, entitled 'Whale Symphony', would seem to have
all the necessary ingredients, intellectually as challenging as an
anaesthetic and trendily green as well. Place an order at your local record
store now.
*****
I promise to walk down Cork Street once a week and back down the other side;
to do the rest of Mayfair occasionally and Motcomb Street, and Bloomsbury,
and Clerkenwell, and Hackney; even to go inside a gallery now and again,
rather than hover furtively at the door, think better of it and slip away;
to give video/installation/performance art another try; to cross the road to
speak to the dealer/artist/fellow critic I spot on the other side; to go to
more private views for the sake of the stimulating conversation they afford,
the philosophical insight, the view and serious discussion of the work.
To be avoided at all costs: all the wonderfully distracting women of the art
world; all offers of a drink, unless I can get a good look at the label, or
it is after 12 or 6, or it fizzes; anything on a plate or a stick; the
artist/dealer/critic spotted on the other side of the road;
video/performance/installation; the telephone; lunch.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (9): The five crucial
questions - How pension plans work, and what to look for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal pensions are designed for employees without access to a company
scheme and for the self-employed. You can also use a plan to opt out of the
state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps).
If you fall into one of these categories, you are part of the 'target
market' for life offices and those who sell their products, and are likely
to find yourself at the end of a very persuasive sales process.
Since their introduction in July 1988, personal pension plans have been sold
to more than 5m people, many of whom would have been better off in their
company pension schemes.
With more than 100 providers in the market, clearly some will offer good
value, while others will offer an unholy combination of high charges and
abysmal performance. To help you through the selection process we set out
five basic issues to discuss with your adviser.
What are the charges, and are they competitive?
Is the contract flexible? Can you reduce and stop contributions, transfer
the fund or take early retirement without penalty?
Is the performance consistently good over the long term?
Is the provider financially sound? Will it still be there when your
investment matures?
How much does the advice cost? Should I pay this as commission or fees?
As you examine the tables on the two previous pages, it is useful to
understand how these plans work. There are two different types of personal
pension, although, for the sake of convenience, providers tend to sell a
single contract.
The 'appropriate' personal pension is used to contract out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), while a top-up personal pension is
used to invest extra contributions above the contracted out rebate.
Like all pension arrangements approved by the Inland Revenue, the personal
plan is tax-efficient. Contributions qualify for full tax relief, the
pension fund grows free of income tax and capital gains tax, and up to 25
per cent of the top-up pension fund at retirement can be taken as tax-free
cash. The rest of the fund must be used to purchase an annuity from a life
office to provide the regular (taxed) pension income. You can buy the
annuity at any age between 50 and 75. The amount of income secured by the
annuity will depend on several factors, including the fund performance, the
charges and the current annuity rates (these are determined largely by the
yield on long dated gilts).
Appropriate personal pensions allow you to contract out of Serps and, in
return, the Department of Social Security sends a partial rebate of your
national insurance contributions to your personal pension provider.
Rebate plans are designed primarily for two categories of employee:
Employees who do not have access to an occupational scheme; and
Employees whose company scheme is 'contracted in' to Serps, where the scheme
benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension.
If you earn less than Pounds 8,500 a year, it is almost certainly better to
stay in Serps, because the rebate is so small that most of it will disappear
in charges.
However, if you are in one of the above categories, and earning at least
this amount, an appropriate plan might be right for you, because the value
of the rebate is likely to be higher than the value of the Serps benefits
given up. (Serps benefits increase as you get older. From April 1997, the
government will increase the rebate for older employees to discourage them
from returning to Serps.)
To build up an adequate pension, employees should pay extra contributions to
a top-up personal plan out of their 'net relevant earnings'.
Net relevant earnings are roughly equivalent to annual earnings from any
self-employed activities (after deducting losses and certain business
charges on income) or from employment where you are not already paying into
a company pension scheme.
Employers can contribute to an individual employee's plan, although this is
not a legal requirement, and in practice few do. The annual contribution
limits are:
Age % of net
relevant earnings
*Up to 35 17.5
36-45 20
46-50 25
51-55 30
56-60 35
61-74 40
Notes*: All personal pension contributions are subject to the earnings cap,
which limits the amount of salary that can be used for pension purposes to
Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year. You can pay up to 5 per cent of your
contribution to a life assurance plan.
It is possible to run more than one top-up personal pension plan, provided
total contributions fall within the above limits. However, an employee can
only have one appropriate plan for each tax year.
Those who are still paying premiums to a retirement annuity contract - the
precursor to personal pensions - should note that the contribution and
benefit rules differ slightly. If you want to take out a personal pension as
well, seek advice on how best to structure contributions.
Finally, make sure that you are paying in a sensible amount each year. As a
rough guide, you should pay total contributions of between 10 per cent and
15 per cent of salary each year, depending on your age, how much pension you
need and whether you have other sources of income.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (11): How to choose your
adviser - The terms 'independent' and 'expert' are not synonymous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before turning to the Yellow Pages, it is helpful to understand how the
distribution channels operate for products governed by the Financial
Services Act 1986.
Essentially there are only two types of adviser. The first is limited to
offering advice on the products of just one company; the second should
search the market for the best product for your requirements.
In practice, it is not so simple. Nor is it immediately obvious which type
of adviser you are dealing with. Company representatives are authorised,
under the act, to sell only the products of the company they represent. It
is not the case that they are being obstructive if they refuse to discuss
other providers' products; under the regulations this is simply not
permitted.
Direct-sales agents who work for, say, the ABC Life Assurance Company
clearly fall into this category. Less easy to spot are the 'tied agents',
which operate a separate business from the ABC Life Assurance but have a
contract to sell only ABC personal pensions or endowments. Tied agents
include many building societies and banks which, ironically, are still
associated with independent advice in the mind of the public.
If you buy from a direct-sales operation, you will not find out if your plan
represents good value unless you get a second opinion from an independent
adviser - not from another direct salesman.
Also, consider how you want to pay for the advice. Many independent advisers
are remunerated solely by sales commission paid by providers. There is no
limit on commission levels. Your adviser might take the top rate available
or discount part of the commission and reinvest it in the plan - all of
which affects the final value of your fund.
Some advisers, including the professional firms with a financial planning
section - accountants, actuaries and solicitors, for example - work on a fee
basis and reinvest all the commission.
The fees-or-commission debate can be over-emphasised. If you want good
advice, you will have to pay for it one way or another. Your main concern
should be not 'how?', but 'how well?' and 'how much?'.
The taxation of advice, rather absurdly, favours the commission route.
Commission is deducted from your premiums, which benefit from tax relief;
fees do not. VAT is charged on fees but not on commission. This is the
reason why many fee-based advisers deduct their charges from the commission
and reinvest the surplus, because it is cheaper for the client.
Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, the private-client
banking and asset management group, said: 'This double tax whammy severely
prejudices the availability of good independent, fee-based advice. It
encourages the continuation of the commission-driven remuneration system.
Even with commission disclosure, will consumers get the best advice if their
advisers are driven by the tax system to be paid only if their advice
results in an insurance policy sale?'
Fee-based advisers charge anything from Pounds 30 to Pounds 200 an hour,
depending on whether you go to a local high-street adviser or a leading firm
of consulting actuaries.
If you want a personal pension and there are no complications (for example,
if you also have access to a company scheme the adviser must check which
option is in your best interests), you should expect to pay a minimum of
Pounds 250 to Pounds 400 for the initial recommendation.
Independent financial advisers vary in their competence. The terms
'independent' and 'expert' are not synonymous. There is no foolproof method
of selecting a good independent adviser, but if you follow this checklist
you should avoid the cowboys:
How long has the firm been trading? New firms should be investigated
thoroughly.
Does it only offer pensions advice? If it covers every aspect of financial
planning, it is important that it has the resources to do so.
What are the qualifications of the pensions staff, and how senior are they?
The minimum IFA qualification is the Financial Planning Certificate, but
this is quite general. It would be more comforting if the firm had at least
one qualified actuary who is an associate of the Pensions Management
Institute.
How many pensions clients does it have? (Can you get references?)
What criteria does it use to select a pension provider? How does it assess a
provider's performance, flexibility, charges and commercial viability?
What research resources does it use? Advisers must have access to a
comprehensive database that can rank pension plans according to performance,
product flexibility and charges.
How much will the advice cost per hour/case? You should also check with the
Securities and Investments Board that the firm is authorised and registered
with the appropriate regulator*.
Finally, the post-January 1995 shake-out will not be limited to providers.
Independent advisers, particularly the smaller non-specialist firms, face an
uncertain future as they struggle to cope with the increased financial and
regulatory burdens. Some will join forces, many will go to the wall. Small
firms should not be avoided altogether, but extra care should be taken with
your investigation.
Further information
If you are seeking a fee-based adviser, you could try the Money Management
Register. To get a list of advisers phone 01179-769444 and give both your
home and work address (advisers tend to be concentrated in towns and cities,
not in rural areas).
IFA Promotions, a trade organisation for both fee- and commission-based
independent advisers, offers a free factsheet, Look at how your IFA is paid,
together with a list of key questions to ask. Phone 01483 461-461. Callers
will also be sent the names of three advisers near their work or home
address (again, specify work address if you live in a rural area).

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (12): What to do if
something should go wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal pensions can be sold in inappropriate circumstances, and if you
think this has happened in your case, you should complain. Do consider
carefully before taking action, however.
Unfortunately, if you experience dismal performance due to poor investment
management and high charges, this will be regarded as bad luck and not
justified grounds for complaint.
If, however, you were sold a personal pension when you had access to a
company scheme, you are likely to get a hearing. This was one of several
circumstances highlighted by the Securities and Investments Board in its
recent investigation into plans sold on the basis of poor advice.
Anyone who transferred company-scheme benefits to a personal plan, opted out
of a company scheme or did not join a company scheme because they were
advised to take out a personal pension, should check whether they qualify
for compensation (see below for PIA pensions helpline).
How to complain
Write first to the compliance officer at the company that sold you the plan.
This may be an independent adviser or a company representative for a
particular life office. You should include the following details and keep
copies of all correspondence:
State clearly the nature of the complaint.
Include your full address and daytime telephone number.
Provide the name of the product, the date you took it out and the name of
the salesman (if relevant).
Quote all policy and reference numbers.
Enclose photocopies of letters and any other supporting material.
Impose a deadline for reply. You should receive an acknowledgment of your
letter within seven days, but allow two months for the actual investigation
before turning to the ombudsman.
Who to complain to
If you do not hear from the company that sold you the pension plan, or you
are dissatisfied with their response, you should take the matter to the
Personal Investments Authority (PIA), the new regulator for independent
advisers and insurance companies selling financial products. Write to the
PIA Ombudsman, 6th Floor, 1 London Wall, London EC2Y 5EA. Tel 0171 600-3838,
fax 600-4727.
Your case may be referred to the Pensions Ombudsman.
If you have a query about a personal plan and want advice, telephone the PIA
pensions helpline on 0171 417-7001, fax 417-8100. You should also phone this
number if you think your case falls into one of the categories investigated
by the SIB mentioned above.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (10): A Sipp will cost less
and allow you to have more control - Pensions for high earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees, the self-employed and business partners who can afford to pay
Pounds 5,000 a year or more into their personal plan, and who want greater
control over the investment process, should consider a self-invested
personal pension (Sipp).
The key feature of this product is that it separates the two main functions
usually combined under a typical life office plan - namely, the investment
management and administration. This adds considerable flexibility to the
arrangement.
First, you can manage the investments yourself, although most people prefer
to appoint a stockbroker.
Second, you can see exactly what you are paying for the administration and
investment management, whereas the cost of these functions can be blurred
under a standard plan.
Third, if you are unhappy with the performance, you can change the
investment manager yet leave the underlying administration in place. This
avoids the early termination penalties that often apply when you stop
payments to regular-premium personal pensions.
Eddy Woore, manager for personal plans with pension provider Pointon York,
said: 'For investors prepared to contribute Pounds 5,000 or more to their
plan, the flat-rate charges associated with Sipps are definitely cheaper
than the percentage charges imposed by conventional plans. Moreover there
are no policy conditions, so you can transfer out or retire early without
penalty.'
Only a few providers offer the administration and legal package you need to
run a Sipp. Pointon York and Personal Pension Management (PPM) specialise in
this market, while several firms of stockbrokers, solicitors and chartered
accountants have launched their own Sipps. Most use PPM's legal and
administration services.
Investment management charges will vary, but for the basic shell Pointon
York charges a Pounds 600 set-up fee and a Pounds 400 annual management
charge. PPM has several charging structures, depending on the level of
service required. For the full service you would pay a combined set-up and
annual management charge of Pounds 800 in the first year and an annual
management charge of Pounds 400 thereafter. If you are only interested in
investment trusts, then the fee would be Pounds 456 for the first year and
Pounds 228 thereafter. As a rule of thumb, the investment trust Sipp is
cost-effective for annual contributions of Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 or
more.
The rules on Sipp contribution limits and benefits are the same as those for
personal pensions, but there the similarity ends. Most conventional plans
allow you to invest only in the provider's funds, although one or two offer
links to other investment managers.
Mr Woore commented: 'Some personal pension plans give you access to external
funds, but usually there is an extra annual management charge which makes
this route very expensive. With a Sipp, there is no second tier of annual
charges.'
Under a Sipp, you can invest in:
Stocks and shares (eg, equities, gilts, debentures) quoted on the UK Stock
Exchange, and including securities on the Unlisted Securities Market;
Stocks and shares traded on a recognised overseas stock exchange;
Unit trusts and investment trusts;
Offshore funds (recognised by the Securities and Investments Board);
Insurance company managed funds and unit-linked funds;
Deposit accounts; and
Commercial property.
Professional firms find commercial property an attractive option. A Sipp
fund cannot purchase a firm's existing business premises from the
partnership, but it can buy new offices into which the partnership can move,
provided the property is leased back on a commercial basis.
Furthermore, a Sipp can borrow on the strength of the pension fund, to help
with property purchase, although it cannot lend part of the pension fund to
scheme members.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Farewell to a passionate man - John Osborne, who died
last week, always aroused fierce emotions. International director William
Gaskill recalls his own personal and professional encounters with the
controversial playwright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM GASKILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I first met John Osborne in 1956 when I was an unknown, out of work director
and Look Back in Anger had not yet been produced. Tony Richardson, the
play's first director, had given me the text to read and I was bowled over
by the passion and virility of the writing.
Soon after, Tony invited me to his flat to have dinner with Osborne. I
suppose I had imagined a shaggy, haired, open'necked intellectual. John
arrived in blazer and bow tie, very neat, a bit flash and accompanied by his
flat mate - or rather his boat mate - Tony Creighton, who was diminutive and
prissy and wore a kilt. Creighton had co-authored John's early play Epitaph
for George Dillon. It emerged that Osborne and Creighton were vegetarians.
Were they also gay (or queer, as we said then)? Richardson and I whispered
speculatively to each other in the kitchen. We never found out - John's
diatribes against homosexuals in later years were as virulent as his attacks
on women, Australians, Americans and critics.
John wrote as he spoke and could, if he wanted, speak as well as he wrote.
Even then the passion would surface beneath the laid back theatrical drawl,
with its mocking nasal twang and it was the immediacy of his feelings and
his ability to communicate them so directly to his own generation that were
to characterise his work at the Royal Court.
It wasn't until the end of 1957 that I went to work at the Court as
assistant to the director George Devine. Look Back in Anger had been
followed by the huge success of The Entertainer and both had opened on
Broadway. Osborne and Richardson were in New York, which is probably why
Devine asked me to direct Epitaph for George Dillon, with Robert Stephens in
his first leading part. It is a conventional three act play about an out of
work actor-writer and his impact on the suburban household where he lodges.
But there is a remarkable scene between Dillon - a first sketch for Jimmy
Porter - and the Communist intellectual aunt in the house (the only time
John wrote a give-and-take scene between a man and a woman). The play did
well at the Court, transferred to the West End for a short run and then went
to Broadway.
During the rehearsals for the Broadway opening John was very much in
evidence. He had become an eccentric figure who, like a Medici prince, went
everywhere with his entourage - his mistress, Francine; Robert Webber, the
actor, as a bodyguard; and his black tailor, Arthur Maguy. We would go in a
group to the talent night at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem and to hear Sarah
Vaughan. We laughed a lot at the excesses of the Broadway scene, while
loving every minute of it.
Osborne and I never quarrelled but I never worked with him again. He did ask
me to direct his satirical musical The World of Paul Slickey, about the
world of gossip columnists, but I managed to get out of it and he ended up
directing it himself. (On the disastrous first night, he was obliged to flee
the theatre and was pursued along Charing Cross Road by disapproving members
of the audience).
When I took over the Royal Court in 1965 we put on three of his plays - Time
Present, The Hotel in Amsterdam and West of Suez - all directed by Antony
Page. But they failed to strike the same response in audiences as his
earlier works. George Devine had died and some of Osborne's talent seemed to
die with him.
He was a passionate man who let his life and his writing be governed by his
feelings. When it worked it was thrilling; when it didn't it was very sad.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: When democracy called the tune - Andrew Clark reviews
a troubled musical year in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the year when politics counted more than music. To survive the
financial squeeze, to push through reform, or just to maintain the status
quo, Europe's musical movers and shakers needed friends in high places more
than ever before.
In France, a sympathetic centre-right government was the sine qua non for
Hugues Gall to adopt strong-arm tactics against Myung-Whun Chung, as he
began flushing out the old Bastille regime and laying foundations for the
new. Gall will need a superhuman dose of political guile in coming months if
he is to cut through the Paris Opera's back-stabbing, unionised culture and
give it a clean start next season.
Alone among provincial opera companies, Lyons could shrug off the recession
 -thanks to a culture-loving mayor. No other company north of the Alps saw
its subsidy keep pace with inflation. And none could match Lyons's knack of
picking up foreign tours and prestige recording work.
At Aix-en-Provence, the very absence of political clout left one of Europe's
long-established festivals struggling to survive. Mounting debts and
declining artistic appeal - together with the French government's evident
lack of sympathy - have knocked Aix out of the premier league of summer
festivals.
The situation was little different in Germany, where cultural shrinkage has
become a fact of life. In Berlin, the Staatsoper's political connections,
rather than artistic quality or good housekeeping, gave it the edge over the
Deutsche Oper in their cut-throat battle for public funds. The Deutsche
Oper's intendant, Gotz Friedrich, balanced his books and produced solid
artistic results. At the Staatsoper, Daniel Barenboim's ambitious programme
led to a huge overspend. But thanks to Barenboim's political influence, his
company emerged at year-end with an increased subsidy for 1995 - leaving the
Deutsche Oper with less.
At Salzburg, Gerard Mortier scraped together enough support within the
Austrian establishment to carry his festival reforms forward into 1995 -
despite an antagonistic Viennese press. Buoyed by healthy box-office returns
at the 1994 festival, the board of directors approved Mortier's
commercially-risky plans for a bigger slice of 20th century music next
summer. Their decision set the seal on Mortier's campaign for a livelier,
more contemporary festival. He now seems certain to stay beyond 1997, when
his current contract expires.
Elsewhere in German-speaking Europe, musical life suffered where political
will faltered. The city fathers in Bonn cancelled the triennial Beethoven
Festival, robbing the composer's birthplace of its only musical event of
international scale. In Frankfurt, the fractious governing coalition
advocated self-help, leaving the arts in a permanent state of crisis.
Basle persisted with its drastic scaling-down of cultural subsidy,
undermining morale and vitality. And the Swiss government ended the year by
slashing its contribution to the national cultural foundation, Pro Helvetia.
'Never has democracy been so hostile to the arts,' said a senior German
orchestra manager last month.
Amid the gloom, there were nuggets of comfort. Let us start with Sylvain
Cambreling, who resisted the temptation to leave Frankfurt in disgust, and
instead conducted much-praised performances of Pelleas The Ring and Don
Giovanni. Matthias Bamert took some calculated risks at the Lucerne
Festival, and widened its appeal. Thanks to Alfred Wopmann's canny
stewardship these past ten years, the Bregenz Festival stood out as an
example of how to mix art and commerce. Claudio Abbado brought his
programme-making skills to the Berlin Philharmonic and to Salzburg at
Easter. And the Prague State Opera sought inspiration in adversity, pulling
off revivals of forgotten works by Hans Krasa and Gottfried von Einem.
The biggest loser in 1994 was the Vienna Philharmonic, which found itself
marginalised at Salzburg and criticised on foreign tours - partly because of
its uninspiring choice of star conductors. The other prominent loser was
Myung-Whun Chung: it will be interesting to see what value his record
company places on him without his prestigious Bastille perch.
And now for some awards, based on a personal end-of-year glance across
musical Europe. Conductor of the year is Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whose blazing
Beethoven cycle with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe set the 1994 Salzburg
Festival on fire. Orchestra of the year is the Oslo Philharmonic, for
refusing to bow to the cynicism and complacency widespread in the
profession. Composer of the year: 91-year old Berthold Goldschmidt, who
lived to enjoy his rehabilitation in Germany at this year's Berlin Festival.
The most memorable instrumental performance was Miklos Perenyi's account of
the Haydn D major cello concerto at Salzburg in August - a matchless display
of old-world musicianship, entirely at the service of the composer.
The most satisfying opera production I saw was Billy Budd at Geneva,
conducted by Roderick Brydon and staged by Francesca Zambello: what a pity
the same cast and conductor cannot accompany the production to Covent Garden
in May. The outstanding individual performance was Robert Tear's Vere. The
most promising young singers were Andrea Rost (Gilda in the Muti Rigoletto
at La Scala), Rene Pape (Fasolt at Bayreuth) and Gwynne Geyer, the American
soprano who has been singing Marenka and Mim in Geneva over the past six
weeks. Flop of the year was the new Bayreuth Ring.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Culture and the embarrassment factor - Lynn
MacRitchie, in her round-up of 1994 exhibitions, describes the reviewers'
secret nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Paris earlier this month, I came upon a shop displaying dresses, coats
and suits by the great couturiers, not new but from the earlier decades of
this fast disappearing century. There were the unfortunate lengths and
experimental fabrics of the 1970s, the shorter look of the '60s, daring then
but almost frumpy now, the stacked heeled shoes with square toes. But that
coat - pure Dior New Look, tiny waist, huge cuffs, full skirt, jolly red
buttons on its green and tan tweed: how right it seemed, how perfectly now,
the curious mystery of 'the look' repeating itself some 50 years on.
The fascination of these garments, the almost physical pleasure the sight of
the 'right' ones gave, was to me just like the effect of looking at
contemporary art. Both offer the high of the perfect moment, epitomised in
the frock, the shoe, the object, the installation, so exemplary of its time
that no argument is possible, only the blissful surrender of recognition.
And, as with fashion, that shining moment can very soon transform into the
epitome of embarrassment.
Herein lies the secret terror of the new in art, the fear that those of us
who dare to like the work of today will look very silly when now turns to
yesterday. Several of the best exhibitions abroad this year have taken work
at this most embarrassing stage and boldly set it forth.
I found that Bruce Nauman in Madrid, the Reina Sofia the only European stop
in his retrospective, passed the test well. Nauman, American hero of
conceptual art, had to weather some sticky moments. Constantly developing
technology means that elderly video tapes, shining examples of experiment in
their 1960s heyday, now seem blurry and curious in black and white.
But the seeds of this tough humanist's newest and strongest works, concerned
with the varieties of trivial cruelty we daily inflict on each other, were
clearly present in these early tapes, simple-seeming explorations of the
body and its limitations.
There are some who wish that Joseph Beuys might be discovered to have feet
wrapped not in his famous felt or fat but clay. I am not one of them, but, a
true devotee, sometime wake in terror that, as time goes by, his work will
crumble before me, the vitrines seem empty, the installations a jumble of
old rubbish. The European touring exhibition which finished at the Centre
Pompidou in Paris this October, though coldly executed, did not have this
dreaded effect. The installations were magisterial, the vitrines full of
allusion and melancholy. The warmth and humour, so winning in the man,
survive in little gleams on film and video.
At home, as in fashion, there were themes and variations, and the best
things were sometimes found in more out of the way places. The Tate
Liverpool had a good year. While Picasso lorded it in London this spring, up
north they showed US video artist Gary Hill and Anthony Gormley's 'Field'.
While Gormley won the Turner Prize, work by Hill - the best by far of the
generation of video artists now receiving belated recognition - was not
purchased by the Patrons of New Art, who chose the pedestrian 'Nantes
Triptych', by fellow American Bill Viola, so huge but so dull, for their
grand video purchase (showing in London until from now to February).
Chocolate was big, a whole roomful of it smeared on the walls of Karsten
Schubert's London gallery by Anya Gallaccio to melancholy effect (the walls
half coloured, streaky brown, recalling school corridors, the fading odour
like time gone stale). Helen Chadwick made a fountain of it in the summer
heat at the Serpentine. It bubbled, and stank, but failed to impress. The
plain, thin spike from which the brown liquid oozed was just not tall or
powerful enough, its flow too gentle, the container beneath, painted a pale
municipal blue (prone to unfortunate splashing when the bubbles burst), more
a kiddies paddling pool than a Freudian ooze.
Much hype (the Chadwick show had some hysterical media coverage) doth not an
artwork make, although it can certainly draw a crowd, as the Serpentine
again discovered when hundreds had to be kept queueing outside during the
run of Damien Hirst's selection Some went mad, some ran away, even before
someone poured black ink into the tank with the sheep. But Hirst is a
serious artist, despite the wide boy image, and the show was impressive in
parts, most of all in its air of fin de siecle melancholy, so many of its
participants preoccupied with death, decay and degradation.
Back in Paris, the year closed at the Pompidou with Hors Limites (running
until the end of January) where a range of international artists show the
kind of work which has led to the strange dilemma contemporary art now
faces. Beginning in 1952 and continuing to the present, the show traces the
development of work by artists determined to break down the barriers between
art and life.
In the earlier years, when tireless jokers like Yves Klein used naked girls
smeared in blue paint as brushes and the new performance art explored the
boundaries of improvisation and chance, there was a belief that freedom of
artistic expression could somehow bring about the social and political
freedom of the individual.
This did not happen. Instead, artists turned in on themselves, leading to
extremes of body art such as the self mutilations of Gina Pane and others in
the 1970 which mutated into today's blank faced exposition of narcissistic
sexual ritual (the torture tables and self abuse of Matthew Barney to take
one example).
The avant garde of the 1950s, filmed at their dirty deeds, wore suits and
ties. Klein, heaving naked girls, was particularly dapper - (and I, had I
been in the audience, would have been wearing that full skirted coat). As
for today's society, the young know that we are what we buy.
Mike Kelley and others roamed the depths of America's consumer culture,
filling the gallery with dirty discarded clothes, toys and general junk, the
detritus of the limitless 'choice' which has brought so little satisfaction.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (7): Pick a long-term
achiever - Performance: why it is so hard to pin down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance arguably is the most important factor that affects the final
value of your fund at retirement, but it cannot be seen in isolation.
Charges and contract flexibility must also be considered, as these may
reduce overall returns considerably.
However, whereas providers' charges and contract flexibility can now be
assessed with some degree of accuracy, good performance remains a
notoriously elusive creature.
Five years is a long time in investment management, as the table with this
article illustrates, yet there are still many providers keen to lock
investors in for 20 years or more.
Using past performance as a guide to the future clearly is risky, but with
careful analysis the process can provide a more reliable indication of what
is to come.
Consultants and actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow supplied the five star guide to
performance used in Table 1, on page 2 of this survey. The performance
screens eliminated funds that achieved below-average returns, were
inconsistent or volatile.
Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at B&amp;W, explained the
process: 'The use of past performance statistics is probably the best guide
to gauge future performance, provided it is coupled with a clear
understanding of how past performance was achieved, an assessment of the
current investment style of a management team and a knowledge of whether the
individuals responsible for past performance are still in place.'
The screening process examined performance over quarterly time periods in
the three-, four- and five-year periods ending 31 March, 1994.
The following tests relate to the five-star ratings.
Screen 1 excluded funds whose average percentile score was below 50.5.
Screen 2 selected those funds which had appeared in the top two quartiles
most frequently and in the bottom quartile least frequently. This weeded out
funds that passed the first screening yet were consistently below median.
Funds were awarded two stars if they had appeared in the top two quartiles
more than 11 times and in the bottom quartile less than five times over the
20 quarterly time periods.
Screen 3 selected funds that achieved low volatility. This third star was
awarded where the percentile scores had below average standard deviation.
Screen 4 examined performance trends. Graphs were plotted showing the
percentile scores, and a 'best fit' line was drawn through these moving
average points. Those funds with an upward trend were awarded a fourth star.
Screen 5 involved a series of interviews with fund managers who had passed
the first four tests. The interviews were based on responses to a
questionnaire which sought details on, among other points, the growth in
size of the managed fund, contributions and withdrawals, the number of
managers and analysts on the fund management team, the asset allocation and
stock selection processes, the background of the principals of the team and
the fees charged to the fund which are not included in the published annual
management charges.
Several managers were awarded a fifth star on the basis of the interview
results.
Only funds with a five-year record and Pounds 20m under management made it
through to the final shortlist. This excluded Professional Life's external
funds (managed by Morgan Grenfell and Gartmore) and Mercury Life's fund,
although B&amp;W stressed that in other respects these were 'promising'.
We asked Bacon &amp; Woodrow to provide a star rating for all managed
unit-linked funds, although several of the poor performers in particular
declined the invitation to take part in today's survey.
Looking purely at performance, five stars were awarded to: Gartmore, Legal &amp;
General, M&amp;G, Norwich Union, Standard Life and Sun Life.
Four stars were awarded to Abbey Life, Allied Dunbar, Britannia Life,
Clerical Medical, Commercial Union, Equitable, General Accident, Hambro
Guardian, Irish Life (Opportunity fund), Lincoln National, London &amp;
Manchester, Prudential (corporate fund), Royal London and TSB.
At the other end of the spectrum, all too many failed even to gain one star.
These include AEgon, Albany, Axa Equity &amp; Law (balanced fund), Barclays
Life, Canada Life, Century Group, Colonial Mutual, Confederation Life,
Cornhill, Crown, General Portfolio, Hearts of Oak, Laurentian, London Life,
Manulife, MGM, Midland, National Provident, Premium Life, Provident Life
(apart from the S&amp;F balanced fund), Provident Mutual, Prudential (but the
corporate fund achieved four stars), Royal Life, Save &amp; Prosper, Scottish
Amicable, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Widows, Skandia (own fund), Sun Alliance
(own fund) and Windsor Life.
Moreover, bear in mind that data was not available for a significant
proportion of providers. If the entry shows 'no data', this may be because
it is a relatively new fund - but it is important that you check this point.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow operates on a fee basis, and in practice also excludes
providers which are not prepared to strip out the commission costs and
reinvest this in the fund.
Further screening with B&amp;W's survey analysed contract terms similar to the
product flexibility ratings in Table 1. On this basis, several providers
awarded four and five stars purely on performance would not be recommended
by the firm.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow's advice stresses that long-term consistency should be
favoured above the occasional years of exceptional returns achieved by the
more volatile managers. Indeed, there is considerable danger attached to
chasing last year's 'winners'.
John Sheffield, senior partner with pensions advisers and employee benefits
consultants AIS Pensions, said: 'The publicity given to the 'top five' funds
can make them an irresistible draw to the pension purchaser and produce a
business bonanza for the companies concerned.'
Sheffield analysed survey statistics over a five-year period to show how the
top managers in 1989 fared over the following five years. The results (see
the table with this article) are startling:
'Out of 1989's top five, only London &amp; Manchester maintained a high position
in the subsequent five years, but even here there is need for caution. L&amp;M
have two personal pension contracts, and under the wrong one you would have
found yourself in 71st place,' he said.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (6): Why they won't all
charge you the same - Advisers' commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a danger that the new regime will take investors one step forward
and two steps back in their quest for clear analysis of total charges. For,
while the providers' charges will not differ for a given example, the
commission can and will vary considerably, depending on how you buy your
plan.
Company representatives are remunerated partly by sales commission, but they
may also receive a basic salary, a company car and office equipment, among
other items. This means that the commission figure quoted on the key
features document will only represent part of the total cost of advice.
Commission-based independent advisers do not receive uniform rates. From
next week, many providers will offer a choice in terms of the level of
commission and the timing of payments. Advisers may discuss their commission
terms with you, but you will not necessarily know what a different firm
would charge.
For the sake of clarity, the tables in this survey assume standard
commission rates. If your adviser charges more or less than this rate, it
will have a dramatic affect on the total charges and hence on the final
fund. As a result, it may prove extremely difficult to compare like with
like.
The table below, supplied by independent advisers Blyth McKenna, illustrates
the problem. The example assumes that you invest Pounds 200 per month for 20
years and that the growth rate is 9 per cent. The fund at maturity where no
charges are deducted is Pounds 128,691. The difference between the nominal
fund with no charges and the nil-commission figure represents the provider's
own investment and administration charges.
Naturally, the nil-commission terms look best, but do bear in mind that on
this basis you still have to pay for the advice, either in the form of an
explicit fee or by agreeing with your adviser the amount of commission he
will take, which is deducted from your premiums.
There are other factors that will produce anomalies in league tables used by
advisers. For example, if you compare charges across the entire range of
funds, then the money market, deposit and gilt funds, among others,
naturally will show lower deductions than actively managed funds.
The same applies to performance. In any five-year rolling period there will
be star performers from the more exotic stables - emerging markets and the
Far East, for example - but these funds are likely to prove very volatile,
and exposure should be limited unless you can afford to take a gamble and
are confident that you have got the timing right.
The message here is that, if you want a managed fund, then be sure to ask
your adviser to compare performance and charges, just within that category.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Figures are based on Scottish Amicable's FlexiPension, assuming premiums
of Pounds 200 a month are paid for 20 years.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:  Level: a predetermined percentage of each premium paid to the
adviser throughout the term. Initial: most of the commission that would
be paid over the term of the contract is paid during 'initial' period,
about two years in the case of a long contract. Renewal: a commission
paid once the initial period has ended. Indemnity: the commission is
paid as a lump sum immediately. (Under indemnity terms, if the investor
cancels the policy early, the adviser may be obliged to pay back part of
the up-front commission to the provider. This is known as a clawback.)

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (8): How to read the vital
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As concern mounts over the future survival of so many life offices,
investors should vet providers' credentials thoroughly before parting with
their cash.
Consulting actuaries AKG, which provides technical information within the
financial services market, produced a 'vital statistics' checklist for
investors, drawn from its financial-strength reports on UK insurance
companies*. Here, we use Standard Life's vital statistics to illustrate the
checkpoints.
Standard Life: The vital statistics. . .
Type of organisation: Mutual.
Life offices can be mutuals or proprietary. Mutuals effectively are owned by
their policyholders - they cannot raise finance on the stockmarket.
Proprietary companies ought to give the life office capital security, but
they also have to pay dividends to shareholders.
Ultimate owner: Standard Life.
As a mutual, Standard's ownership requires no further investigation. The
point about available capital may be important, as competition intensifies
and profit margins reduce. Owners of proprietary life offices should be
vetted for the same reasons.
Funds under management: Pounds 30,738bn.
As the largest mutual in the UK, Standard Life's financial strength is
unquestioned. For other life offices, this figure provides a useful
indicator of size and commercial muscle. As a further indicator, you should
also look at last year's new business figures:
Free asset ratio: 17.04 per cent.
This refers to assets in excess of those held to meet liabilities, expressed
as a percentage of total assets. Free asset ratios generally are higher for
providers of with profits funds, which use the free assets to support
current and future business.

KARSKI: HOW ONE MAN TRIED TO STOP THE HOLOCAUST by E. Thomas Wood and
Stanislaw M. Japkowski John Wiley New York Dollars 24.95
Jan Karski was a courier for the wartime Polish underground who brought the
free world confirmation of the Holocaust. The story of his reception
illuminates a squalid corner of Allied conduct during the war.
Karski's promising diplomatic career was cut short by war service. When the
Polish army collapsed he fled to Russian-occupied eastern Poland where he
was interned. He was then shipped deep inside the Soviet Union and would
have been murdered, like most Polish officers, had he not concealed his rank
and bluffed his way into a shipment of ethnic German Poles repatriated to
western Poland.
Once home he joined the resistance. Karski's mnemonic and diplomatic gifts
made him an ideal courier. After circulating around Nazi-occupied Poland, in
January 1940 he travelled secretly to report to the Polish
government-in-exile. His account included descriptions of local attitudes
towards the Jews, an issue that still divides Jews from Christian Poles.
Wood and Jankowski have not written a hagiography, but they present Karski
in a favourable light. His report exposed the glee Christian Poles felt
towards Jewish suffering, but it also repeated the canard that Jews in
eastern Poland had welcomed, and profited from, the Soviet occupation. In
fact, Jews greeted the Soviets only because they were preferable to the
Nazi's. Before long the communists made Jewish life miserable.
This touching-up of Karski's record derogates from later accomplishments.
Yet he transcended minor prejudices and attained a lucidity concerning the
Jewish question that eluded most Poles.
In the summer of 1940 Karski was betrayed to the Gestapo. Savagely beaten,
he attempted suicide, fearing that he would break under torture. Salvation
came from the underground which freed him, but at a terrible cost.
For his third mission he was told to include information on the Jewish
plight, so he toured the Warsaw ghetto and was smuggled into a camp holding
Jews destined for gassing at Belzec. Shattered by these encounters, he
gladly carried Jewish pleas for Allied action to stop the slaughter.
Despite the sensational title of the book, by the time he reached London in
November 1942, the Allies had received decisive information from Jewish
sources about the genocide. But Karski was not a Jew and his electrifying
reports propelled the ambivalent Polish exile regime into demanding a
response.
Nevertheless, foreign office officials suspected the Poles of exploiting the
news. Eden dismissed Karski's suggestions for concrete measures, while Lord
Selbourne, head of SOE, compared his report to first world war atrocity
propaganda. Jewish leaders in Britain and America were also sceptical. Felix
Frankfurter, a US Supreme Court judge, told Karski bluntly, 'I am unable to
believe you'.
Karski's greatest success was a long interview with Roosevelt which may have
spurred the President towards the creation of the War Refugees Board, which
eventually helped thousands of Jews.
Mostly, Karski was a prisoner of the government-in-exile, manipulated
according to its desperate efforts to stave off Stalin's territorial
demands. Indeed, much of Wood and Jankowski's narrative concerns Karski's
role in this diplomatic struggle. Activism on behalf of the Jews was really
incidental to his work.
When the war ended, Karski was a prosperous exile in New York. He wrote a
best-seller based on his experiences, but his fame paled as quickly as
interest in the fate of the Jews. He enjoyed a brief revival as an
anti-communist serving the State Department and the CIA - a period which the
authors skate over suspiciously. The disillusioned hero resigned himself to
silence.
There is a bitter-sweetness about the fame that has come to him since he was
'discovered' by Elie Wiesel and Claude Lanzmann, who used Karski for his
film Shoah. Huge audiences now pack halls to hear him speak, but 50 years
ago few heeded his message.

<TEXT>
THE PHILBY FILES by Genrikh Borovic Little Brown Pounds 18.99, 382 pages
I always hoped I would meet Kim Philby. Like most aspiring young hacks in
the early 1980s I believed in secret histories. I dreamt of the phone call
in some lonely Stalin era hotel, the midnight rendezvous on a Moscow street
corner, and the familiar figure flanked by faceless KGB hoods stepping
forward, shaking hands and telling me in his famous nervous stutter that he
had decided, at last, to tell the whole truth . . .
I even wrote to him in 1984, cheekily, care of the KGB, Dzerzhinsky Square,
and asked for an interview. I never got a reply. Instead I took a flight to
the other side of the world and met another old survivor from the 1930s with
a drink problem, Peter Wright, who told me a different story on the same
theme. He told me how he spent his life chasing Philby and his ilk, looking
for the spoor that had metastasized throughout the Establishment until in
the end it drove him nearly mad.
Later, after Spycatcher was published, I visited Peter Wright once again in
Tasmania. He went to his bookshelves and pulled out a thick, dusty red
volume and gave it to me. It was A History of Labour by Gilbert Stone,
sometime secretary to the Coal Industry Commission and deputy head of
production at the coal mines department.
I turned to the flyleaf and there in an instantly recognisable fine hand was
the inscription: 'H R Philby. Trinity'.
Wright explained that Philby had given the volume to Anthony Blunt at their
last meeting in Beirut in 1963, just before he defected to Moscow. And Blunt
had in turn given the book to Wright at their last meeting in 1972, at the
conclusion of his M15 de-briefing. And now Wright wanted me to have it,
perhaps realising that this too would be the last time we would meet. He
told me Blunt had been given the book by Philby as a reminder of the
philosophy that had guided them all those long years undercover.
The book was full of cant about the masses, and their guiding scientific
principles - a kind of sub-Marxian James Michener novel without any
characters.
Maybe I had had more than my bellyful of Philby, Burgess and Maclean. Or
maybe I was too much an opportunist to be guided by any principles,
scientific, political or otherwise. But somewhere over east Asia I realised
what any women could have told me - and had - that none of this spying
business mattered any more. I knew then I would never get that interview
with Philby.
Shortly afterwards the old rogue died and the Berlin Wall came down. Spy
books have never been the same since. There have been good ones of course,
even important ones, and, as ever, trashy ones by the publisher's list. But
they have never sold as well. Somehow the heat has gone out of the subject.
But now we have, at long last, the scoop all spy hacks, myself included,
wanted all those years: Philby's last will and testament, a series of
interviews conducted by Genrikh Borovic at the old spy's comfortably
appointed dacha in the three years before his death.
Borovic, a respected and independent minded Russian journalist of the old
school, amassed 500 pages of transcripts of his conversations with Philby
and has interwoven them with excerpts from Philby's KGB file and novelistic
recreations of key incidents in his career.
It makes for an interesting, if somewhat uneven, read, shot through with
reminiscence and regret. But for all the claims ex-Insight journalist Philip
Knightley (himself the only Western journalist to pass Philby's door) makes
in his introduction, it is not a book to match with the classics of the
genre: his own Philby - The Spy who Betrayed a Generation, or Philby's My
Silent War, with its ironic, mocking detachment, or the broad sympathetic
canvas of Andrew Boyle's Climate of Treason. These were books that changed
the way we looked at spies and spying, and made their activities seem
contemporary and relevant. Here we cover familiar ground, with only
occasional flashes of revelation to catch our interest.
The book is dense with detail, especially from the files, of the early
years. An idealistic Philby emerges - refusing money, diligent, eager to
create a career in espionage. There are moments of fascinating detail -
young Philby spying on his domineering father, the noted Arabist adventurer
St John Philby, against whom Kim struggled all his life in a painful
love-hate relationship.
But in the end Philby was never a man for self-analysis, or the
psychiatrist's chair. And so Borovic, even after hundreds of hours of
conversation, is left with the same enigma faced by previous authors. The
man remains as elusive as he was that rain-swept night he took his one-way
ticket to Moscow.
Graham Greene is, not surprisingly, the only writer to have penetrated the
shield, describing him once memorably as having the chilling certainty of a
Catholic who, in the reign of Elizabeth, works for the victory of Spain and
then endures the long days of Inquisition, believing implacably that
although today brings Torquemada, tomorrow there will be a John XXIII.
The principal interest here for spy buffs is the extent to which Philby, it
now emerges, was mistrusted by the KGB during the war. This is genuinely new
information - and hilarious too. Moscow became so alarmed at the sight of
Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Blunt et al handing over suitcases of secret
documents to their KGB controller in London that they concluded the whole
operation was a fiendish British intelligence ploy and even recommended
cutting off contact with the most successful spy ring in history.
But the KGB files - fascinating though they are - diminish and disappear
once Borovic's narrative reaches 1945. Thus the latter half of the book is
less successful.
Philby's account of the defection of Burgess and Maclean is partial. Borovic
leans towards concluding that the whole affair was a colossal KGB cock-up,
but shrinks from the fundamental conclusion that, in the end, protecting
Maclean, who had handed over the Holy Grail of post war espionage - the
secrets of the nuclear bomb - was always more important to the Soviets than
protecting Philby. Perhaps that was why, when he finally got to Moscow, he
stole Maclean's wife.
Similarly, the account of Philby's career after his dismissal from MI6 in
1951 is also thin. Borovic tries to drum up interest in his Beirut
interlude, and waxes lyrical about his homecoming to Moscow. But the truth
is his work as an active spy ended long before his defection in 1963 and the
last 25 years of his life were spent in alternate periods of drunken
depression and a pleasurably idle existence as a KGB museum piece, making
speeches and cultivating the mythology that had grown up around his name.
But these are quibbles. I take my hat off to Borovic and Knightley. They
succeeded where the rest of us failed. They got to meet the old fraud
himself, shake his hand, hear his stutter. And I will put their book up on
the shelf next to Philby's own Gilbert Stone - that is the Gilbert Stone who
did not rise to become the greatest spy the world has ever seen, but got to
be a minor functionary with the Coal Board instead.
In his book Stone wrote 'I am no believer in a suddenly achieved Utopia; I
see little in history that suggests that short cuts are the best roads to
travel by; I see little gain in sharp upheavals. In the future, as in the
past, it will be character and worth which will secure us sound advantages.'
Maybe Kim the Cambridge undergraduate skipped that passage. Or maybe he was
just busy meeting his controller for the first time.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Books: An Iliad for our age - War and Peace (Fact and
fiction) / AN Wilson on the enduring impact and insights of Tolstoy's great
novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AN WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current pointless carnage in Chechnya, whose spirited Moslem
mountaineers are so sympathetically evoked in Tolstoy's early stories,
reminds us of the vast, peasant-simple questions which the greatest Russian
literary giant of the 19th century poses in his writings.
What causes war? The caprice of the gods, according to Homer. As Tolstoy so
cogently insisted in the epilogues to War and Peace, once you have discarded
this catch-all explanation, no post-Enlightenment theory of historical
causation, no system of economics, no proto-fascist notion of heroes or the
ambition of great men can fathom the mystery.
Certainly, the impotence of peace initiatives at the moment in various parts
of the world, the crass arrogance of foreign politicians thinking they can
'solve' the conflicts of Bosnians or Palestinians, sends us back to Tolstoy
 -not so much the furious septuagenarian pacifist pamphleteer who wrote The
Kingdom of God is Within You as the great novelist who at the height of his
powers hacked five years out of a tempestuous life to write War and Peace.
I never met anyone who had actually lived through a war who derived any
comfort from reading historians or philosophers, but several ex-servicemen
have told me that they read Tolstoy and Homer in the thick of battle - two
comparable writers with similarly anti-rational views of what is taking
place when the human race turns aside from its peaceful occasions -
procreation, friendship, the manufacture of artifacts, the cultivation of
crops - and devotes itself to wholesale murder.
'Why did millions of people kill one another', Tolstoy asks, 'when it has
been known since the world began that it is physically and morally bad to do
it? Because it was such an inevitable necessity that in doing it, men
fulfilled the elemental zoological laws which bees fulfil when they kill one
another in the autumn and which causes male animals to destroy one another.
One can find no other reply to that terrible question'.
When in the midst of war, the chief human concerns are practical: how to
survive this night of shelling, or that month, that year, of life in a
besieged town. Concepts of victory and glory might sound fine on the lips of
demagogues, but when it is over, war can be seen to have created no more
than the sum of thousands of individual torments and sorrows, and the best
that can be said is that it is over. Prince Andrew's words after Austerlitz
in War and Peace - 'We lost because we told ourselves we lost' - provide
just one example among hundreds of what Tolstoy was up to in his
masterpiece.
We fail to understand what an act of artistic self-abnegation was involved
by this most opinionated of writers unless we recognise the agenda of War
and Peace, spelt out in the numerous asides, and in the epilogues, about the
nature of history. Tolstoy is often accused of not understanding his own
talents, or of wilfully destroying his own 'art'. It would be truer to see
the historiographical asides and the formless gossipy flow of the book as
all of a piece. He was attempting to provide a Homeric blankness; in the
words of the John Cowper Powys, 'no philosophy - not even the philosophy of
having no philosophy'.
The formlessness, the cinematic details of War and Peace are what make us
all remember this book as something almost more 'real' than our own lives -
the excitement of Natasha at her first ball; the pride, turning to panic, of
Nicholas Rostov when he first goes into battle; the drunkenness of Pierre at
the debauch. Though Tolstoy was right, in a sense, to say that War and Peace
was not a novel, he was able to use the unashamedly trivial conventions of
fiction to illuminate, on every page, the significant mystery of human
heings, by virtue of their moral responses to existence, transcending the
impersonal forces which lead to cataclysms such as Austerlitz or Borodino or
the burning of Moscow. 'There are two sides to the life of every man, his
individual life which is the more free, the more abundant its interests, and
his elemental swarm-life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down to
him.'
Unlike the great 19th century historical theorists - Carlyle or Hegel -
Tolstoy deliberately cuts the 'great men' down to size. 'Power is the
collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or tacit consent, to
their chosen rulers'. It sounds almost Marxian, but, unlike Marx, Tolstoy
does not believe that the inexorable march of events renders individual
experience insignificant. In fact, the precise opposite.
His Napoleon, therefore, has no more idea of what is going on at Borodino
than the foot-soldier; but a common peasant taken prisoner by Napoleon
alongside Pierre has a deeper understanding of life than any of Pierre's
clever friends. Napoleon's belief in his own genius is ridiculed. The
hideous war in which he and hundreds of thousands of others are caught up is
portrayed as 'swarm-life'. The distinctive and significant life of a human
being is found not in pretension to power but to an attentiveness to what
eye and heart tell us. 'During the whole of that period, Napoleon, who seems
to us to have been the leader of all those movements - as the figurehead of
a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel - acted like a child who
holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.'
The book starts at a party. The war is a thing to be gossiped about amid the
glitter of crystal wine glasses, the brightness of sashes, uniforms and
gowns. We might be tempted to suppose that the 'real' story will only begin
when we are introduced to the 'important' characters - the generals, the
dictators, the emperors who believe themselves to be controlling events.
We do not have to read far, however before we divine that no one is
controlling events, that no character is more important than another and
that the 'artlessness' of scene following scene is the whole point of the
book. There is no immortal 'cloud-gatherer' plotting mortal destinies in
this epic; God, if found, is 'within us'.
An entirely Tolstoyan episode is the scene when Natasha Rostova goes to her
mother's bedroom to chatter and giggle about the boys she is half in love
with. It is the night before she goes to the ball where she is to meet, and
fall seriously for, Prince Andrew. It is the tenderness of the exchange
between the two women, and its humour which are so memorable - its conveyed
sense of a happy family simply bubbling along. This is so much more
successful than the frankly tedious moments when Pierre is thrashing out his
ideas, and which oddly enough have so little to do with the main action.
Tolstoy has a magnificent generosity as an artist in allowing characters
simply to be themselves - and we see them in so many ordinary situations,
playing cards, kissing a lover, hunting, borrowing money. This is where life
 -life which raises us above the swarm - is experienced. This is 'peace'.
In the decade after the book appeared, Tolstoy notoriously suffered an
emotional collapse, followed by his 'conversion'. The latter half of his
life was devoted to explicit exposition of his views - vegetarianism,
anti-Shakespeareanism; sew-your-own-felt boots and passive resistance. In
much of this urgently sincere attempt to discover the best way to live,
there was heroism - not least when he risked his own liberty for defending
eccentrics. But the pacifist tracts of these years are less powerful than
the 'art' which he came to despise and which, in War and Peace, reaches a
simplicity and gravitas unknown in Western literature outside the pages of
The Iliad.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (4): Shop carefully in the
new year - The charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From next week, many personal pension providers will slash sales commissions
and other charges deducted in the early years of long-term personal pension
plans.
The result will be a better deal for investors prepared to shop around -
provided that is, they know what to look for. Worth considering are the
providers with good performance with modest charges and flexible contracts
that allow you to stop or reduce premiums and retire early without penalty
(see Table 1).
Standard Life announced in October that, from January 1, it would no longer
penalise investors who stop premiums or transfer their fund to another
provider. Life offices that sell through independent advisers must follow
suit if they are to survive in the post-disclosure competitive environment.
Standard's changes are timely. As of today, it breaks its link with the
Halifax which no longer exclusively sells Standard's products through its
vast branch network.
The move away from 'front-end loading' (where charges are heaviest in the
early years) has been accompanied by the introduction of flexible sales
commissions for independent advisers (see facing page). This makes it even
more difficult for investors looking for the best value, since the amount of
commission taken by the adviser is deducted from premiums and naturally
affects the value of your fund.
Our tables assume standard rates of commission are paid, but in practice
from January 1995 many providers will allow the adviser to take anything
from nil (for the fee-based advisers) up to the current maximum, which can
virtually wipe out the first year's premiums on a long-term contract.
The commission and charges will depend on the type of contract. Tables 1 and
2 examine charges for regular and recurring single-premium plans. Regular
plans traditionally have carried the high front-end charges that result in
such poor value for early transfers. Recurring single-premium (RSP) plans
should deduct only those charges associated with each premium and therefore
provide better value for those who stop premiums in the early years.
Jon Minchin, managing director of independent adviser Pensionline, said:
'From January 1995, an adviser who sells you a standard regular-premium plan
with all the associated charges will not be offering best advice.' However,
Minchin warned that some of the alternative RSP contracts are nothing of the
sort, and still carry regular premium charges.
Bear in mind that RSP contracts are designed for employees who intend to
save on a regular basis. Francis Moore, operations director with pension
provider PPM, said: 'The self-employed and partners do not want this type of
contract, but instead should look for total flexibility over the timing and
level of contributions to suit their business cash flow.' These investors
would do best with a single-premium plan that allows them to pay what they
want when they want.
One further point - if your plan was well chosen, you may be able to
transfer your fund without penalty, but to little avail if your adviser
takes full commission on investing your transfer value with a new provider.
The golden rule here is to check the provider's and adviser's costs every
time you take action, whether transferring or simply increasing premiums
(another notorious trigger point for fresh charges).
More than 100 providers were invited to take part in this survey. Some were
still in the process of revising their charges right up to the end of
December and could not take part. Others simply refused. If your provider is
not in Table 1 and 2, ask for the reason and request the information so that
you can make up your own mind whether the plan represents good value and the
performance is satisfactory.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (3): Balancing the cost
against performance - How to read the tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tables 1 and 2 show the impact of charges on a managed unit-linked fund for
a typical 20-year plan, where Pounds 200 a month or Pounds 2,400 a year is
paid first under a regular-premium arrangement, and second as a recurring
single-premiums plan.
Bear in mind that, where your premiums are higher or lower than this amount,
the impact of charges will be different.
In Table 1, the first column shows what your investments might be worth if
annual growth is 9 per cent over the 20-year period and the provider's real
charges are deducted. Under a theoretical nil-charge regular-premium
(annual) plan, the final fund would be Pounds 133,835, yet Pearl provides a
final fund of just Pounds 98,494, Confederation Life Pounds 98,700, Barclays
Pounds 100,000, Royal Life Pounds 101,000, Save &amp; Prosper Pounds 101,362,
and Sun Life of Canada Pounds 102,000.
Conventional wisdom dismisses high charges on the grounds that good
performance will more than compensate. This may be true in some cases, but
Barclays, Confederation Life and Royal Life also failed all the performance
tests, while Pearl only passed the first screening.
Column two shows exactly how much is deducted from your premiums over the
entire course of the contract. This figure assumes 9 per cent growth, so the
charges are shown in real terms and can be related to the final fund.
Professional Life shows the lowest deductions at Pounds 9,287, although this
is a nil-commission figure, so you would have to pay your adviser an agreed
commission or fee on top. Other low chargers include Foreign &amp; Colonial, at
Pounds 11,627; Framlington (the latest unit-trust group in the market) at
Pounds 13,957; and Leeds Life (also a recent entrant) at Pounds 14,200.
Compare the figures with those of the high chargers: Royal Life Pounds
32,000, Pearl Pounds 30,197, Barclays Pounds 27,900, Crown Financial Pounds
27,184, J. Rothschild Pounds 26,586, M&amp;G Pounds 27,869, Prudential Pounds
28,072, Axa Pounds 27,100 and Standard Life at Pounds 27,650.
Column three shows how the deductions reduce the annual growth from 9 per
cent to as low as 6.7 per cent in the case of Pearl and Confederation Life.
Barclays is close behind with 6.9 per cent. The corresponding figure for
Professional Life, the lowest charger in this survey, is 8.4 per cent.
Column four highlights one of the most damning criticisms of the traditional
regular-premium plan, where most of the charges and sales commissions are
deducted in the early years. Inland Revenue rules do not allow you to get
your hands on personal pension money until age 50 at the earliest, so the
column does not show what you would get back. Instead it shows the transfer
value - the cash value you can take out and put into another approved
pension arrangement.
This column shows what your transfer value would be after five years, again
assuming that growth is 9 per cent and the provider's actual charges are
deducted. At this point you would have paid in Pounds 12,000, and in most
cases your transfer value will be worth less than your contributions.
Britannia Life, for example, returns just Pounds 9,605. Laurentian Life, one
of the lower chargers over the full 20 years, appears to make its heaviest
deductions in these first five years and offers a transfer value of just
Pounds 9,230. Royal Life and Scottish Equitable also offer transfers of less
than Pounds 10,000.
Under a single-premium or recurring single premium (RSP) contract, where the
charges are spread evenly throughout the investment period, you see a
completely different picture. All but one provider had a positive return
after five years. Under Hambro Guardian's RSP contracts, you would still get
a negative return, which might indicate that the charging structure retains
some elements of front-end loading.
However, under most RSP contracts the final fund values are higher than the
regular plan for the same contributions. Given that most five-year transfers
are also higher, it is hard to see how advisers will be able to justify
recommending regular-premium plans once all the RSP contracts are launched.
There are exceptions where, clearly, the provider has improved the returns
to early leavers at the expense of those who stay put. Allied Dunbar, for
example, deducts reasonable charges in the first five years of its RSP
contract, but total charges after 20 years are lower on its traditional
regular-premium plan. The same is true of Axa and Laurentian, among others.
Equitable Life, an early pioneer of RSP plans, only sells these contracts,
so its figures for regular and RSP are identical.
An analysis of the details on regular premium charges, together with the
performance star rating in the final column, reveals some interesting
details. Several lower chargers - Albany and Laurentian, for example - are
also poor performers. Other providers combine high charges with good
performance. Then there are the high chargers and poor performers. This
category includes Axa Equity &amp; Law, Barclays Life, Confederation Life, Crown
Financial, Manulife, Provident Mutual, Prudential, Save &amp; Prosper and Royal
Life, among others.
Table 2 shows the impact of charges at various stages throughout the
contract period. Again, note what happens in the early years. In some cases,
you will have little or nothing to show for your Pounds 2400 if you cancel
after the first year. This is the case with British Life Office (nil) Crown
Life (nil), Guardian Financial (Pounds 177), Hambro Guardian (nil), Irish
Life (nil), Lifetime (nil) and NatWest Life (Pounds 42).
The truth, the whole truth? Not quite, according to Andrew Warwick-Thompson,
head of partnership pensions at Bacon &amp; Woodrow. B&amp;W's research into
personal pensions raised a serious concern about the details financial
institutions provide on their charges.
Warwick-Thompson said: 'The annual management charge, bid/offer spread (the
initial charge) on the purchase of units and administration fees are not the
only costs passed on to policyholders. In most cases, unit-linked funds bear
additional costs which are reflected in the unit price; for example, audit
fees, dealing commissions, trusteeship fees, custody fees and stamp duty.'
These costs can add up to the equivalent of an extra 0.5 per cent on the
annual management charge, and are most likely to occur where the stated
annual charge appears low, he explained.
Warwick-Thompson pointed out that these hidden charges will not be revealed
under the post-January 1 1995 disclosure rules - an oversight the regulators
should have spotted.

The market for personal pensions is dominated by the life offices, which
account for about 97 per cent of sales to date. The only threat to this
near-monopoly comes from the unit- and investment-trust groups. Gartmore,
Invesco, Rothschild Asset Management, Framlington, Foreign &amp; Colonial and
Dunedin all offer plans.
Most large banks and building societies sell their own life office products
through their branch networks (a process known as 'bancassurance'), while
the smaller banks and societies act as appointed representatives and sell
the products of the life office to which they are tied. An ever-decreasing
minority act as independent advisers.
Within providers' product ranges there are several investment options to
consider. Unit-linked and unit trust plans are relatively easy to
understand. Conventional with-profits plans and 'unitised' with-profits are
not. The following summary may help you decide which is most suitable for
your age, financial circumstances, and attitude to risk. It also explains
how the charges are expressed.
Unit-linked plans are sold by life offices, including the life-office arm of
several unit trust groups (Save &amp; Prosper and Mercury, for example). Your
contributions buy units in a fund, and the value of these units fluctuates
in line with the market value of the underlying assets.
Funds on offer cover the entire risk spectrum, but most people opt for the
managed fund, which usually invests in a range of the provider's other main
funds and in this way offers a balanced spread of investments.
Unit-linked charges include an initial charge of about 5 per cent (known as
the bid/offer spread) and an annual management charge of between 0.5 and 1.5
per cent. On top of this there are monthly administration and/or policy
charges. If commission is paid to the adviser or salesman, this will form
part of the initial charge and may also account for some of the strange
terminology associated with unit-linked plans such as 'initial periods' and
'initial' or 'capital' units These terms imply high charges.
Unit trust plans offer a similar investment choice to unit-linked plans, and
again the value of your units will fluctuate in line with the performance of
the underlying assets.
The choice of unit trust personal pensions is still very limited, but more
groups are likely to enter the market over the next 12 months. The same goes
for investment trust personal pensions. You can also invest in the entire
range of both types of trust through a self-invested personal pension (see
page 4 of this survey).
As a rule, the charges on unit and investment trust plans are simple and
transparent, but not necessarily cheaper than unit-linked plans, although
the latest entrants - Framlington and Dunedin - claim to offer a low-cost
version.
Typical unit trust charges include an initial charge of 5 per cent and an
annual fund-management charge of between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent
depending on the fund. However, the trust plans impose level charges on each
premium - they do not weight charges to the early years, so there should be
no penalties for stopping and reducing contributions.
Until recently, 'conventional' with-profits formed the backbone of the
individual pensions market, because these funds provided a high degree of
security together with good potential for capital growth.
The with-profits fund (which is the fund of the life office itself) invests
mainly in UK and international equities, gilts and other fixed-interest
securities, and property. The investor is guaranteed a certain basic amount
at the end of the term. To this, interest or bonuses are added each year,
with a final discretionary bonus at the end. Like interest on a building
society account, once these bonuses are allocated they cannot be taken away.
The bonuses are 'smoothed' in order to provide a relatively consistent
return. To do this, the life office holds back some of the profits in good
years to boost returns in lean years.
There are no explicit charges on a with-profits plan, apart from a monthly
policy fee. Other charges are deducted from the fund itself before the
bonuses are declared - again, rather like a building society account.
Conventional with-profits plans are rare these days, following the
introduction of a unitised version in the 1980s which has a similar charging
structure to unit-linked plans. Unfortunately, this new version is even more
complex than the original, particularly in the way profit is distributed.
There is no basic sum guaranteed at retirement, and the bonus system varies
from provider to provider, which makes comparison difficult. However,
unitised plans allow you to switch more easily to other funds, or from a
unit-linked to a unitised fund - a common pattern in the run-up to
retirement, when you might wish to consolidate gains and reduce risk.
Unitisation heralded the arrival of the controversial 'market value
adjuster' (MVA). These adjusters, which are used as a safety net for life
offices in the event of a mass exodus of clients following a drop in the
markets, allow providers to reduce the value of units whenever, and by
however much, they wish. In this respect, the guaranteed nature of the
annual bonuses is less than rock-solid.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Fashion: Is glamour glitter - or a graceful line? - War and
Peace (Flesh versus spirit) / The Italian designers Versace and Armani
represent two opposing camps of high style. Each faction has its followers,
explains Brenda Polan
</HEADLINE>

The fashion industry is a community more visual than verbal. So when it
needs to articulate its themes, it has an irritating yen for buzzwords which
mean nothing to outsiders. The current favourite, repeated mantra-like to
the point of mind-washing meaninglessness, is 'drop-dead glamour'.
You probably think you know what it means. It is Joan Crawford looking
dangerous in silver sequins and a soft-focus aura of light. It is Marilyn
Monroe in something very similar singing 'Happy birthday, Mister President'.
It is Claudia Schiffer in a sliver of lame Versace, strategically covered
but in obvious and imminent danger of becoming, with one shrug, uncovered.
Drop-dead glamour, you might think, is distant, unattainable, on a pedestal
 -the refined glamour of Armani as opposed to Versace. But, others may say,
it is drop dead because that's the attitude it demands of the wearer, who
stokes up men's most fevered dreams, seemingly to gratify them, but tells
them to drop dead instead.
Versace is the standard-bearer for one sort of glamour. Armani leads the
opposite faction. It is an old battle. The tension between a richly
decorated, flamboyant, look-at-me style of dress and its modest opposite is
the allegory in cloth for the story of the flesh versus the spirit, power
versus piety, sensuality versus sensibility that has prevailed in most
cultures throughout history.
Cleopatra, Jezebel, Delilah, Mme de Pompadour, Jean Harlow, Christian Dior,
Jane Russell, Lana Turner, Gina Lollobrigida, Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte
Bardot, Claudia Cardinale, Cher, were all Versace girls, glitter queens to a
woman.
In the other camp, refined and Armani-esque, were heroines such as the
dignified Portia, Esther, Julian of Norwich, Catherine of Aragon, Queen
Mary, Mme de Maintenon, Madeleine Vionnet, Coco Chanel, Jean Muir, Rosa
Luxemburg, Wallis Simpson, Diana Vreeland, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich,
Lauren Bacall, Bette Midler, Princess Grace and Jacqueline Onassis.
Although the Versace army (and its uniform) may be in the ascendant, the
style wars continue.
Both sides have their great generals, their hierarchical lines of command,
their cannon-fodder foot-soldiers, their temporary alliances and fifth
columns. Their two field marshals, however, are both Italian and it is their
stated antipathy to each other's styles which has drawn up the battle lines
for the current round in a war as old as human dress.
You could, to be mischievous, sum up the style of Giorgio Armani as one in
which taste is everything and that of his opponent, Gianni Versace, as one
in which taste is of no account whatsoever.
You could define Armani's conception of female sensuality as a thing of
intellect, subtlety, and harmony, the product of a cultivated, civilised
sensibility. Versace would call it a characterless, bloodless celebration of
beige.
You might describe Versace's perception of woman's sexuality as an
uninhibited celebration of the archetypal female principle, the primitive
fertility symbol alive and predatory. Armani would dismiss it as vulgar,
crude, an insulting parody.
The two men have been stars of international fashion for two decades. It was
Armani, now 60, who, along with the knitwear specialists, Missoni, first
pushed Italian ready-to-wear into prominence in the 1970s. Around them grew
up a group of designers, including Versace, who showed their collections in
Milan - a city built on commerce and modernity.
It was Armani who added something new to the modern wardrobe by
deconstructing the masculine jacket. He softened it, relaxed it, and made it
the key item of clothing for women.
The laid-back, so-cool look of the modern executive woman, sleeves pushed
up, hands in pockets, was invented by Armani. He rightly demurs when you
call him a minimalist but his approach is certainly about rationalising,
paring down, permitting beautiful fabric cut in simple shapes to speak for
itself.
There is no anxiety to impress in Armani's style; there is, instead, a quiet
assumption of being perfectly, appropriately dressed. It is a style favoured
by the Duchess of Kent and her daughter, Lady Helen Taylor, by Michelle
Pfeiffer, Julia Roberts, Anjelica Huston.
The career of Versace, more than a decade younger, was launched on the back
of this new sophisticatedly understated Italian style. His own instincts,
however, tend more towards bravura overstatement. He may once have produced
those early-1980s Italian easy tweeds but he teamed them with slick, glossy,
body-hugging leather and, as he grew in stature and confidence, the tweeds
and the easy gave way to the leather, the satin and the lame, the
body-hugging and figure-flaunting.
Versace's favourite story, told with a sweetly innocent sincerity as if he
himself does not realise the implications of what he is saying, is about
how, when accompanying his mama to church in his home-town of Reggio
Calabria, they would pass the local brothel. Despite maternal injunctions to
cover his eyes, he would peek. He found the prostitutes beautiful. The
experience made him want to make all women beautiful.
From Armani you get no such charming autobiographical clues. He may reveal
that, destined for a career in medicine, he grew faint at the sight of blood
and so sought alternative employment but, when he talks about his work, he
resorts to the cerebral explanation rather than the anecdotal.
'Self-restraint, unaffectedness and a need for refinement are part of both
my lifestyle and the Armani style,' he says. Vulgarity in life and in
fashion offends me. An over-emphasis on decoration has no place either in my
personal style or as creative inspiration.'
Armani is ascetic in appearance, sober of demeanour, a watchful-eyed,
intimidating presence. He was once renowned for his irascibilty, his
impatience, his reluctance to be diverted from his work. He is still a
workaholic but, he confesses, he laughs more nowadays. He may not be as
bad-tempered as he once was but he is more outspoken. In the field marshals'
propaganda war, his arguments are more cogent, more politically correct and
more likely to win hearts and minds.
He flatters the foot-soldiers. 'In the past 20 years women have learned to
be people not objects. They judge themselves. Nowadays a woman chooses
clothes without mindlessly following fashion. She filters suggestions,
adapts them to her own personality. She does not need disguises.'
He savages the enemy. Interviewed last year in L'Espresso, Armani
passionately criticised the unnamed but easily identified designers who, he
insisted, are turning fashion into a 'porno show', whose collections present
'the image of woman as a receptacle for men, the incarnation of low-level
sexual fantasies, the nightclub where striptease is for provincial wolves'.
It is, of course, no accident that his disdainful use of the adjective
'provincial' is elitist. He has said: 'I believe that good taste and class
are innate.' They may not be innate, but they are linked.
Taste, to paraphrase brutally the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, is a
device invented by the rich and unproductive to identify and exclude the
upwardly mobile conspicuous consumer and fashion victim. Bad taste is
described as vulgar. Vulgar, of course, is an adjective which originally
merely meant of the masses, the common people.
I recently asked an old acquaintance who works the street markets what
commodity had replaced, in the hearts of free-spending young women, the
knock-off Chanel, chain-hung, quilted-leather handbag now that the market
was saturated. The answer was the medallion-tinkling Versace drawstring bag.
That, he said, was the ultimate object of desire among fashion-hungry
checkout girls, receptionists and secretaries.
Versace is the designer by appointment to the rock star and 'loadsamoney'
sets. Joan Collins, Elton John, Trudi Styler, Madonna, Ivana Trump, Bruce
Springsteen, Prince, David Bowie, Elizabeth Taylor and, of course, Elizabeth
Hurley all wear Versace. The clothes for both men and women are about
raunchy, up-front, cleavage-popping, pelvis-grinding sex.
According to Versace - a charming, diffident (though not as shy as he once
was) man - these clothes 'liberate women'. To choose to wear Versace, he
says, is to prove you are modern, free-thinking, fearless, uncowed by
convention.
The designer says: 'I don't believe in good taste. I don't believe in bad
taste. I believe in quality and fun, in things that make our lives happier.'
Beyond tight and revealing, the Versace style is also highly decorated. A
southern Italian, he absorbed his Greco-Roman aesthetic heritage with his
mother's milk. He was later to become enraptured by the Renaissance's
elaborations on it. His prints, the scarves and scarf-print shirts, and
porcelain collections are lushly coloured homages to archaeology and art
history. They are so beautiful that taste does not enter into the equation.
There is also the matter of skill. Lisa Armstrong of Vogue has argued that
it may be sleazy but at least he does it superlatively. And, she adds, his
simple clothes, the little black dress, the tailored cashmere jacket, are
more flattering than anyone else's. But in the style wars, that does not
count much.
Fashion plays fortune's favourites so, throughout history, a personality, an
idea (be it Christianity, capitalism, female emancipation or rock rhythm) or
a universal mood swing has been able to shift style its way. But its
opposite has always been there, its inseparable, warring twin, without which
there is no tension, no internal critique and no fun-in-disapproval.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (1): The new deal for
investors - The UK's first life and pensions products were sold in 1762.
Now, 233 years later, the life offices must at last disclose the full extent
of their charges. This survey is by Debbie Harrison

Next week a quiet revolution takes place, which will transform the way
financial products are sold in the UK and improve dramatically investors'
rights.
From January 1, 1995 the Securities and Investment Board, the chief
regulator, and the Personal Investments Authority, the regulator for
providers and advisers of financial services, require life offices and those
who sell their products to tell prospective clients how much they deduct in
charges.
Later in the year, providers of all other investments covered by the
Financial Services Act - such as unit trusts, investment trusts and personal
equity plans - will be required to comply with the new rules.
Previously, investors could look at the life office's 'illustration' of what
their fund might be worth at maturity and be utterly misled. To calculate
the illustration or 'projection', the life office had to make two important
assumptions - the level of charges and the growth rate. Before 1988, there
was no regulation as to what charges should be disclosed. Providers could
also pick and choose the growth rate. Often the best-ever annual return
achieved by the company was chosen to represent expected growth over a
25-year period - hence the notorious telephone-number projections associated
with the industry at that time.
In 1988, the regulators, under the Financial Services Act, curbed the more
ridiculous projections by enforcing the use of standard growth rates.
Unfortunately they also insisted that providers use in these projections a
standard basis for charges that bore no relation to actual deductions. As a
result, the life offices with low charges could not demonstrate the good
value they offered, while the high chargers could hide their exorbitant
costs behind the 'standard' format.
Under this system, most investors had no idea how much of their money was
disappearing in charges, and when. Salesmen urged clients to sign up for
long-term regular-premium contracts (monthly and annual), because the
commission they themselves would receive was higher. Sales commission was,
and in most cases still is, based on the level of premium and the number of
years to maturity. Most of the commission relating to the entire term was
paid in advance immediately after the sale.
Providers argued that this system was fair. Yet they obscured the heavy
upfront charges by an actuarial sleight of hand. Investors' premiums in the
early years would buy 'capital' or 'initial' units, which carry a punitive
charge for the entire contract term. Alternatively, the 'allocation rate'
(the amount of your premium actually invested) would be low in the early
years.
Either way, if a policyholder stopped paying premiums during the first few
years of a long-term contract, he or she could be left empty-handed. Figures
on pages 2 and 3 of this survey show this can still happen. If you sign up
for a 20-year regular-premium personal pension, paying Pounds 2,400 a year,
but stop after one year, you will get nothing back from British Life Office,
Crown Financial, Hambro Guardian, Irish Life and Lifetime. If you stop after
five years, most life offices offer a transfer value worth less than the
amount you have paid in.
Providers defended this practice by pointing to the often excellent returns
available after 25 years. Yet they are reluctant to reveal how many of their
clients actually make it this far. Office of Fair Trading research indicates
that only one in seven long-term endowment policies ever reaches maturity.
For the rest, the investment can represent a costly mistake.
The threat of full disclosure of charges has concentrated life office minds
wonderfully. In the run-up to the January 1995 regime, they pondered whether
investors would still commit themselves for a 20- or 25-year term if they
first saw the penalties for pulling out early. Their conclusion was a
resounding 'no', judging by the flurry of revamped charging structures
launched in recent weeks.
Life offices realise that they must spread their costs over the entire term
to make early-surrender deals look better. Allied Dunbar, Standard Life and
the Prudential are among those which have already taken this step. Equitable
Life has always operated this system.
But life assurance is a slow-moving industry, and many offices were
reluctant to see the writing on the wall. Some providers whose figures are
not present in this report were still revising their charging structure only
days ago.
The new rules do not prevent life offices from selling poor-quality and
expensive products - what they do is to make it easier for the investor to
avoid them. For the regime to work, investors should seek independent advice
from a specialist who has the software to compare quotations across the
entire range of providers.
Unfortunately, many will not, because a significant proportion of consumers
do not understand the difference between company representatives (direct
salesmen and tied agents), who by law can only recommend the products of the
life office they represent, and independent advisers, whose job it is to
select the most suitable product on the market.
Some of the largest providers are direct-sales operations. Equitable Life,
the Prudential, Pearl, and Allied Dunbar sell most of their products this
way. So do the 'bancassurers' - the banks and building societies that use
their high-street outlets to sell products generated by their life assurance
companies.
Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, Abbey National, Midland, Royal Bank
of Scotland, TSB, Britannia, the Woolwich, National &amp; Provincial and, from
January 1995, the Halifax, all operate in this way. (Some also operate an
independent advice service, but only for clients who ask.)
Most of the remaining banks and building societies, with a few exceptions,
do not give independent advice, but sell the products of just the one life
office to which they are tied. The most notable exception is the Bradford &amp;
Bingley, which does offer independent financial advice.
Independent advice is widely available, but still forms a minority sales
outlet - over two thirds of regular-premium life and pensions business is
sold by direct-sales operations.
Of course, independent advice is not necessarily expert advice. Advisers
have a mixed reputation, and the new regime will not turn the cowboy element
into competent professionals. Moreover, the new rules only apply to charges.
Some of the lowest chargers offer poor performance, while some of the top
performers are also the most expensive. A competent adviser will marry
reasonable charges with good performance, and also consider the flexibility
of the contract terms, among other factors.
The new rules on charges will be phased in over the next few months,
although most large life offices operate the full system from January 1.
Stage 1: January 1, 1995. From this date, direct salesmen, tied agents and
independent advisers must tell prospective clients the exact amount they
will receive in commission from the product provider after the sale is
completed.
They must also show details of the provider's actual charges over the term
of the contract. This will show what your fund may be worth if you stop
payments during the early years.
However, these details initially do not have to be 'client specific' (in the
regulators' jargon). This means that the example used to illustrate the
provider's charges will be based on a hypothetical case, and does not have
to relate to your own investment details.
Stage 2: July 1, 1995. The provider's own charges for each particular sale
must be explained clearly. All of this information is set out in detail in a
'key features' document, which the adviser or salesman personally must hand
over to the prospective client before the sale is made.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (2): Make sure your plan is
a portable one - As competition increases, more than 40 life offices may go
out of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent research by the consultants and actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested
that at least 40 of more than 100 life offices currently trading were likely
to disappear by the end of the century.
This would be a direct result of the new disclosure requirements and the
consequent competition to reduce charges.
The same report said that only 10 per cent of existing offices are cost
effective, and added: 'The remainder, mostly traditional life offices, are
leaving themselves open to attack by the new, lower-cost, simple-savings
providers.'
For 'traditional' read old-style mutual. Mutuals are life offices that do
not have shareholders but instead distribute profits to members, unlike the
proprietary offices that are quoted on the stock exchange and can call on
shareholders for extra cash.
Some of the mutuals have proved less than adept at modernising their product
range. Others are so small that they cannot afford the investment in
marketing and information technology necessary to survive.
The long arm of the Department of Trade and Industry will ensure that the
rationalisation process takes the form of a series of takeovers and mergers,
not insolvencies. The DTI closely monitors the solvency of insurance
companies through the annual returns.
A DTI spokesman said: 'It is unlikely we would let the solvency position of
an insurance company get to the stage where it was in dire straits. If a
company appeared to be getting into difficulties, we would try to encourage
a takeover or merger. We would certainly try to avoid an insolvency. This
would harm the insurance industry's image and would not be in the best
interests of policyholders.'
In the unlikely event of a life office insolvency, investors would be
protected by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 and receive 90 per cent
of the value of their plans at the time the company crashed.
In addition to the small life offices, Bacon &amp; Woodrow identified two
further 'at risk' categories. These were the subsidiaries of foreign
companies and the broad-based, medium-sized life offices that try to be all
things to all men - and in practice do nothing very well.
Two recognisable groups emerge as survivors - the bancassurers, which
produce their own products to sell through their extensive high-street
branch networks, and life offices that concentrate on specialist products
sold through independent advisers.
In theory a rationalisation of life offices should be welcomed. Currently,
over 100 insurance companies produce life and pensions products, the
majority of which depend totally, or to a great extent, on their
direct-sales force to sell their products. If the high chargers and poor
performers go to the wall, then the blood-letting will leave behind a
healthier financial services industry. Unfortunately, in many cases the
criteria for survival will not be based on excellence but on commercial
muscle.
The streamlined insurance sector is likely therefore to be dominated by the
giants, most of which sell the bulk, if not all, of their products through
company representatives.
If you plan to take out a long-term pension or life assurance-linked
investment, your adviser should look for a provider that is likely to be
around in 10 to 20 years' time when your policy matures.
Consulting actuaries AKG carried out research into life assurance and
pension providers' backgrounds. Managing director Nick Anderton said:
'Investors and their advisers should examine, among other factors, a
company's ownership, its size, its backing, its relative position in the
market, and the way it distributes its products. The last point may be
important in terms of distribution costs, and hence the charges. Careful
analysis of the provider's background should avoid turning the selection
process into a lottery.'
However, if inadvertently you do invest with a life office that subsequently
is taken over, what assurances do you have that your fund will continue to
be well managed? One theory is that a fund closed to new business following
takeover should do well, because it does not bear any new business costs.
For this reason, some advisers are thought to be recommending funds on the
assumption that the provider will be taken over.
Their logic has merit and may well prove to be accurate where the takeover
was a result of synergy rather than impecuniosity. But bear in mind that, if
you were originally sold a poor investment, an acquiring company is under no
obligation to reduce excessive charges or remove high early-termination
penalties.
The best way to avoid storing up future problems for yourself is to make
sure your personal pension is genuinely flexible and portable. If it is, you
should be able to transfer out at any time without penalty, and your adviser
should not take a fresh chunk of commission on the transfer in to the new
provider.

FT  31 DEC 94 / How To Spend It: The decorator who makes your house look
lived in - War and Peace (Chintz versus Zen)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom Parr is chairman of Colefax &amp; Fowler, which perhaps more than any other
decorating company, symbolises the countrified look, the world of chintz and
'humble elegance'. Nobody else is quite so skilled at doing up houses so
they look as if they had been forever thus. His motto could be 'nothing
should look too new or too smart' or else: 'Comfort, comfort, comfort.'
'There are two main approaches to life, living and decorating - what I call
the heart and the head approach. Minimalism or the outright modernist
approach is really about the head, the theory of it, the rationalisation of
it. Whereas what I stand for . . . I think . . . is all heart.
'A decorator is an arranger of rooms and houses and the intention is to make
them more comfortable, more enjoyable for the owners and their friends, to
give them a way of housing their collections and and belongings. In the end
one must arrange the house and the belongings so that they are not only
pleasing to the eye but to all the other senses.
'When I see pictures of minimalist bedrooms I see not a book in sight and
nowhere to put a book down, no belongings to bring comfort to the eye. What
do the people live in them do? I see no pianos, no knitting, no children's
toys, no television sets, no dog baskets. All these things have a place in
life and need to be allowed for. Putting one stool in the middle of a
bathroom and calling it a bathroom seems to me bad decoration. It may please
the eye but what is the point of having a fine room if there is nowhere to
put your martini glass?
'I am reminded of the house of the great American architect Philip Johnson.
Years ago I had lunch with him in the famous glass house he had built for
himself. It was a glass cube with a core in the middle apparently for the
kitchen and other essential workings but when it came to lunch all the
delicious food came from outside, from another nearby kitchen. The house was
a game, a front. It didn't work.
'In a Tom Parr house you would be able to cook and watch the sun go down and
then flop into your comfortable sofa, read a book, watch television. Of
course this takes skill and you must be knowledgeable about fabrics, about
how to light, about proportion and architecture but comfort above all is the
aim.
'Popularly, people think that our approach is only for the rich but it isn't
so. I had a sweet friend who lost all her money and she had to go and live
in a council flat and we made her two rooms very special. The high and
mighty came to play bridge with her there and the rooms made them feel
comfortable.
'When I start on a room the first thing I do is find out how the owners are
going to use the room. Only then do I think about colours and textures and
furniture. I try to give them a background against which they can live their
lives.
'I like to use some of the things they already have and don't like to
re-cover everything and make it look brand new. Old things, shabby things,
offer continuity with the life they had before.
'My own bedroom perfectly sums up my approach - it gives me such joy when I
go back to it. It's got everything I want - a desk, a bed with a hand-made
hair mattress, good lights, a television set, lots of books, a fireplace
that works, pictures that I love.
'The library at Badminton is a room that I love - everything happens there.
There are always lots of people and drinks and dogs and it's so sympathetic
and the people who own it know how to entertain better than anybody else in
the world. Sometimes you make people lovely rooms but they don't know how to
make them work because they don't have generosity of spirit. The people who
live there matter - as a decorator you can only give them the framework -
then it is up to them to bring them to life.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / How To Spend It: Why minimalism can be a tyranny - War and
Peace (Chintz versus Zen)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Chipperfield is an architect who is possibly most famous for his
association with the Equipment shops (for those who do not know them, they
are the brainchild of a Frenchman, Christian Restoin, who has built a
business on a single garment - the perfect shirt).
His sensitive and sympathetic settings tune in perfectly with the sense of
timeless quality which Restoin wished to convey. In his earlier years he was
deemed to be part of a group of minimalistically inclined architects such as
John Pawson, Kenneth Armstrong, and Eva Jiricna. These days he is associated
with a 'school of rigour' - that is, with those who believe in precise,
rigorous work lacking the bravura and exuberance of the post-modernists.
It is the greatest possible compliment that he is much sought-after in Japan
for his serene and confident approach to the complex problems that modern
retailing must address as well his Tak Building in Kyoto and the Gotoh
Museum in Tokyo.
'I wouldn't describe myself as a minimalist, for minimalism suggests a
stylistic approach which I am not fundamentally very interested in. What I
am interested in is designing with a certain authenticity.
'For instance the decorative approach is often used to suggest a richness
and a depth of culture which is often not there and it is the falseness that
I do not like. But equally minimalism implies a Zen-like austerity which is
often just as false. The stuff is there all right, it's just hidden away in
cupboards.
'I don't mind anything which people genuinely value. I wish they would ask
themselves why they feel they must have pelmets or frills or curtains -
often it is simply because they feel they must, they have not really
bothered to work out why. If people truly value them and have real
preferences then they are valid.
'I like houses that are a true reflection of the people who live there -
books that are there to be read, objects that they have chosen and really
like, displays that relate to someone's life and characters.
'I've got friends with amazingly cluttered houses and I love their houses
because it's all about them.
'It's when people wrap up their homes with suggestions of things which they
haven't really thought about or don't relate to them that I find it . . .
well, tasteless.
'I also don't like the industrialisation, the mass-production of the
decorator-look turning into a marketable consumer commodity, making it a
this or that year fashion because I believe it takes away from people their
sense of who they are.
'I don't like what I call symbolic taste - for instance the sort of hotels
that go in for acres of stuff and fluffy things and a riding print on the
wall because this is what they think a room should look like. It is
difficult to get people to disentangle their real attitudes from cliches,
for instance, to make them think about what is real comfort as opposed to
apparent comfort.
'Japan has been a huge influence on me - the Japanese have a gift for
enjoying the essence of things. When the cherry blossom comes out you will
find people just sitting under the trees enjoying it. It is the same with
bathing which is a simple daily task but they approach it in a ritualistic
way, it is important to them and yet it is very simple.
'Personally, I am not convinced by minimalism - it can become a tyranny but
if you are going to have less, everything must mean more. I like to make
spaces and to create a framework for people's lives.
'I like to give them essentials such as daylight - if you make a window
which enjoys a certain view you have brought them closer to nature. What
people do with the frame-work after that is up to them.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / How To Spend It: Hmm, very tricky subject, taste . . . - War
and Peace (Chintz versus Zen) / Lucia van der Post on a subject which causes
more dinner party angst than when to serve the cheese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taste, as some of us know, is as tricky a subject as class and money. It can
break up marriages and friendships more quickly than disputes over children.
Lob it in as a dinner-party subject and the opposing sides line up with rare
ferocity.
What most of us can usually agree on is that we are imbued with impeccable
taste . . .it is other people who are prone, unfortunately, to dubious
lapses.
When it comes to houses, and the way we live today, there are two
instinctively different and opposing aesthetics. There are those who feel
comfortable with the old and familiar, with established patterns of living,
with time-honoured ideas and the reassurance of tradition. They tend to
choose chintz and capacious sofas, the familiarity of much-loved objects
that appear timeless and mellow.
Then there are those who just as instinctively feel a psychological need for
a new broom, for a look that breaks with the tired patterns of the past,
that reaches out into the future. They need air and space, the aesthetic
shock of the new, a sense that first principles have been re-addressed, that
modern needs have been redefined.
Andree Putman perhaps puts their point of view best when she says 'physical
comfort is never the first thing. I prefer spiritual comfort, by which I
mean space, light (natural as well as artificial), contrasts of textures and
pure lines. I never look for literal comfort, but for something that allows
my mind to rest.'
What both sides do agree is that there is more to style and taste and ways
of living than mere function: our houses and the things we surround
ourselves with resonate with emotion.
They matter to our psychological comfort. In a world where the home is ever
more important, they are a refuge from the increasingly hostile world, a
place for self-expression, a setting for the most intimate and important
part of our lives, how we furnish, how we live in our homes touches us at a
deep level.
That we all do it in different ways proves that beauty is indeed in the eye
of the beholder. As Christopher Alexander, mathematician, architect,
contractor and craftsman, put it: 'What does 'beautiful' mean? It means that
the thing makes me feel joyous, more rooted in the world, more whole as a
person.'
And, perhaps even more pertinently, as Frank Lloyd Wright put it: 'There
should be as many kinds of houses as there are kinds of people and as many
differentiations as there are different individuals. A man who has
individuality (and what man lacks it?) has a right to its expression in his
own environment.'
So, in celebration of man's diversity, of the happy fact that not all of us
think alike, that there are as many ways of living well as there are people,
How to Spend It interviews the leading exponents of the two main aesthetic
trends.

<TEXT>
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a
building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption
date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your
investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of
capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the
table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically
not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the
market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy
and sell.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An annuity provides guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum
investment. PURCHASE LIFE ANNUITIES are bought by people wanting extra
regular income. Rates are attractive for older people. The annuity
income is not fully taxable. The table shows rates net of 25 per cent
income tax. Certain rates include 'capital protection' - allowing
the capital invested - less instalments paid to you - to be returned to
your estate when you die.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: The forgotten desert lake - War and Peace
(Travelling in Troublespots) / Mark Nicholson discovers a remote corner of
Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a place, 1200km south of Cairo, of daunting calm, isolation and
alien majesty; of black, silent nights illuminated only by the dim whitewash
of the Milky Way, of swirling blood-orange sunsets over a remote, forgotten
landscape.
It can also, surprisingly, be a place where afternoon tea is accompanied by
Sinatra tunes and 3,000-year-old Pharaohs are serenaded by Madame Butterfly.
Few more tranquil places exist. So I decided to spice the appreciation of
this idyll by departing from one of the rowdiest, most rambunctious places
in Egypt, Cairo's Ramses Station, and pass through one of the most violent,
the Nile valley towns around Assiut, where police and militant Islamic
gunmen have traded fire and fatalities almost daily for two years.
Beginning a journey which would take me the length of the Egyptian Nile, I
caught the Cairo-Aswan overnight express. 'The spirit of the Orient Express,
but with more sophistication,' said the brochure. And fewer passengers, it
might have added.
After dinner, only the staff remained in the walnut-trimmed fin de siecle
bar of the first-class carriage. A lone English couple had played a hand of
cards over a nightcap and retired. Essam, 14 years a barman on this route,
waved towards the empty tables. 'The newspapers they make a problem for us
writing about terrorists. Now it's finish, the terrorists. But the tourist,
too, it's finish.'
Militants have not fired at the overnight express, or tossed small bombs
through its windows, since spring. Tough Egyptian policing has seen to that.
Just up the corridor, a brace of soldiers peered out at the passing cane
fields and dimly-lit little brick dwellings. Rifles nestled between their
legs, bayonets fixed.
The British government advises travellers not to pass by land through
Assiut, where the train stops to change drivers. I spent my defiance of Her
Majesty's government unconscious of it, asleep in my Wagon Lit. Before my
train passed, though, two militants were shot dead that night near the
station at Mallawi, 100km north of Assiut.
At Aswan station, I took a short taxi ride to the High Dam, where, in the
dam's westward lee, sat the MS Eugenie: the only cruise boat on Lake Nasser,
a five-deck, mock paddle steamer, just one year old.
It is a bizarre vision among the rusty boats and barges which once plied the
lake to Sudan, before Egypt's relations with its southern neighbour soured.
But Lake Nasser is an odd, forgotten place. It yawns, glittering and
incongruous, way off into the desert. An average of 10km wide, reaching
300km to Sudan and 200 thereafter, it is, thanks to Gamel Abdul Nasser's
grand design and Soviet engineering, the biggest man-made freshwater lake in
the world, full of perch and crocodiles; but by man, virtually uncharted in
its 30 years.
Eugenie, though, is its queerest fish. It is an elegant, white,
perky-looking craft, 73m long with 50 cabins, each with its own balcony.
Inside, from a marble-tiled entrance hall beneath a star-spangled atrium
with stylised Egyptian motifs, the boat opens up a curling wood staircase to
a long, elegant bar upholstered in rich reds and greens, a saloon of leather
chesterfields and card tables, framed prints of Egyptian treasures between
its windows. The whole decorated as if Terence Conran had designed a set for
Death on the Nile.
On this cruise, on the rear deck beneath a white Italian panama, sat
Mustapha Guindy, the boat's dapper 34-year-old owner, showman and one-man
evangelist for the forgotten Lake Nasser.
He sold his Aswan-Luxor cruise boat to build Eugenie, completed with two
year's work and 800 men on the lake itself. 'People thought I was crazy,' he
says. That he may not be becomes clear after just an hour's sailing into
Lake Nasser's lost horizon.
Beneath a Nubian sun, a low tableau of distant, mysterious peaks and bluffs,
hidden lagoons and virgin dunes glide by.
Wind-hewn natural pyramids suggestively litter the timeless horizon. As the
lake's remote shores converge on Eugenie at the Tropic of Cancer and the
breeze stills, the calm of this lunarscape only becomes more riveting.
Thousands of miles of desert shores touched only by a few gazelles, monitor
lizards or basking crocodiles, the empty sky punctuated by a graceful wing
of pelicans.
After a day's sailing grows the odd sense that this enormous empty expanse
is a private lake for Eugenie and you. And not an Islamic militant in sight.
It becomes easy to understand Mustapha's missionary zeal for this remarkable
resource. 'The government sees it only as a big reservoir,' he says. 'But
look how much more it is. It can be a dream. It just needs a plan - like the
High Dam or the Suez Canal.'
But while it remains his to play with, our host turns his lake into an
extraordinary theatrical set. Eugenie several times moors beside temples
rescued before the dam flooded this stretch of the Nile - less impressive
than Nile valley treasures such as Karnak, Luxor or Philae temples, but
incomparably more grandly and evocatively sited.
A third stop, by night, is beside the craggy ruins of the ancient fortress
of Qasr Ibrimm, now an isle. Under the stars, an improvised son et lumiere;
the citadel is lit by dozens of flaming torches as Rimsky Korsakov's
Sheherazade is blazed out from its midst, aptly the first movement: The Sea
and Sinbad's Ship.
By the second day of this three-day voyage a week might have passed. Short
guided tours at one of the stops create the fiction of an appetite for the
uncharacteristically - for Egypt - good food at lunch. Tea and Frank Sinatra
in the lounge at five. A general evacuation into the roomy cabins for a
snooze, or perhaps a sauna or steam bath. Then dinner.
By mid-afternoon on the final day, Abu Simbel hoves into view - the
3,000-year-old temple of Ramses II, who proclaimed himself a god and carved
himself an appropriately grandiose tribute: four implacable seated colossi
20m high, and a massive inner hall of statues, chambers and dramatic
reliefs, hewn from the rock.
It was rediscovered, deep beneath dunes, by Swiss Egyptologist John Lewis
Burckhardt in 1813, cleared and entered four years later by Giovanni
Belzoni, the Italian bodybuilder turned Egyptologist, and moved from its now
submerged original location under Unesco's auspice 30 years ago.
Before Eugenie moors beneath the colossi's gaze, the engines are cut, the
boat glides to shore and Madame Butterfly rings from the boat's speakers.
More theatre.
After dark, the boat also has this magnificent temple to itself. The crew
serves glasses of wine, and Mustapha, clearly relishing the role of latter
day pied piper, leads us into the temple's innards of dramatic friezes and
statues.
Then, alas, flights depart at dawn from Abu Simbel's tiny airport bound for
what passes as civilisation.
Of course it is perfectly possible to fly directly to Abu Simbel, but as we
walked from the temple gates to our airport bus, and the first pack of
visitors scrambled past, our collective sense of smug self-congratulation
was palpable.
Eugenie departs Aswan-Abu Simbel on Saturdays and returns on Wednesdays.
Double berths cost Dollars 155 (Pounds 94.50) a night for a double, Dollars
96 a single. The suite is Dollars 400 a night. Belle Epoque, which runs the
cruise, is on Cairo (202) 352 4775/8734. Jules Verne travel is UK agent.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: How to remain safe in Africa - War and Peace
(Travelling in Troublespots)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
I was once staying in a game lodge in Uganda when a Belgian tourist met a
painful death because he tried to feed a sugar lump to an elephant. No doubt
his friends back home concluded that Africa was a dangerous place and
resolved never to visit the savage continent. They would not have understood
that this had been a most rare and unlikely accident.
Many potential visitors to South Africa, who do not already know the
country, probably have similar, and excessive, fears about what might happen
to them. After all, an awful lot of people get killed there - you see it on
television all the time, and this is no longer political violence but
criminal (ie anyone can be a victim).
South Africa is a world leader in the incidence of violent crime (just one
statistic: 60 of every 100,000 South Africans are likely to be murdered next
year, compared with 10 in the US and two in Britain). The overall crime rate
continues to rise, with heavy increases in rape and assault this year.
Is this not bound to enter the mind of the first-time visitor? Is it safe
(or rather, because South Africa palpably is not as 'safe' as Bournemouth or
Biarritz) - is it safe enough?
The answer, as foreigners begin to pour into South Africa to visit this most
beautiful of countries, is that the new South Africa is adequately 'safe' so
long as you are sensible, which is to try to understand the roots and the
manifestations of a security situation which obviously cannot be compared
with the Cotswolds:
The present situation in certain districts of the big cities is undeniably
tricky, by which I mean that it demands caution and commonsense on the part
of the visitor. Downtown Johannesburg is the best example: you would not
dream of walking the streets after dusk and you would exercise some care
during daylight.
More generally, the visitor should learn the habit of locking car doors on
the inside, concealing handbags and parcels, driving through red lights if
there are suspicious youths at the junction, not flaunting jewellery, not
carrying too much cash.
Outside the towns, the open countryside is much safer on the nerves. But the
sensible rules still apply: do not drive through certain areas (eg the
Transkei) at night - not so much because of any danger of brigands as of
cattle on the unfenced roads; do not drive yourself into a township unless
you have a guide or know where you are going; do not pick up people at the
roadside without looking carefully; and do not go walking in remote areas
without taking advice (best to stick to the national parks, where security
is good).
Bear in mind that South Africa has an appalling record for simple road
accidents. Drive very carefully.
There is no point in denying that South Africa today is an even more violent
society than it used to be, which is saying something. But that does not
begin to make it a no-go area. Let us keep a sense of proportion. How much
of the above would also apply to New York City or Florida, Rio or Zimbabwe?
I am writing this from a delightful hotel on the Indian Ocean coast of the
Transkei. We are protected by an electrified fence. At least, that is what
it says: I have not tested whether the current is turned on.
PS: I am actually filing this piece from another, equally delightful hotel
on the edge of Zululand. We are only a few miles from an area where
horrifying tribal bloodletting has featured in the international press this
year, yet they do not bother to lock the doors. But they do have a dozy
Alsatian, a puppy, in the garden.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Law brings no relief -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My son and I are the only shareholders of a small limited company. The new
law exempting small businesses from the burden of an audit account has not
brought any relief. What would be the consequences regarding capital gains
tax if the asset and liabilities were transferred to either one of us or
changed to a partnership, leaving the company dormant?
Would we have the same VAT number as the company which was no longer active?
You appear to have so little knowledge of company taxation etc that you need
professional guidance - from the company's accountants, perhaps? Briefly, if
the company's assets were distributed (leaving it dormant), the distribution
would be treated like a dividend.
Ask your tax office for the free booklets IR1 (Extra-statutory concessions)
and 1R131 (Statements of practice). In the IR1, look at concession C16
(Dissolution of companies under section 652 of the Companies Act 1985:
distributions to shareholders). In the IR131, look at SP D3 (Company
liquidations: tax on shareholders' capital gains).
The company's VAT number would not be transferable.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Revenue is right -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am the trustee of a discretionary trust for my grandson (a minor). Its
capital is invested in a government deposit bond, and the sole income is the
gross interest which this bond pays annually. The Inland Revenue bases its
tax demand of 35 per cent each year on the previous year's actual interest.
Because of the declining interest rates of recent years, this has meant that
the tax levied on each year's actual income is, effectively, at a rate
higher than the nominal 35 per cent (for instance, it is 42 per cent for
1994-95).
This higher rate has not hurt my grandson; since his income is below Pounds
3,445, he has been able to reclaim fully the tax paid by the trust. But the
Revenue now says it has erred in previous years by allowing the full
reclaim. It says the reclaim is limited to a tax rate of 35 per cent on the
actual income in any tax year.
Unfortunately, the Revenue is correct. Your case is a graphic illustration
of the curious results that can be thrown up by the preceding-year basis of
assessment (soon to be replaced).
The form R185 - which the trustees must provide to your grandson in respect
of actual income payments made to him - will show those payments grossed up
at a tax rate of 35 per cent. The fact that the trustees may have paid tax
more or less than 35 per cent of the gross income of the year (because the
assessment is based on the income received in a different year) is
irrelevant for this purpose.
The situation is no different if it is an individual who is getting gross
interest income at a time of falling rates. The net interest received will
be reduced by the fact that the tax liability for a particular year will
exceed the individual's marginal rate for that year as a result of the
preceding-year basis of assessment.
In such cases, taxpayers often take the opportunity to close accounts and
re-open them with other deposit-takers to ensure that the opening and
closing rules of assessment apply, thus ensuring assessment on a
present-year basis. (Reply by Andrew White).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, I arranged to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs)
to my employer's pension scheme. Since then, my company has been acquired by
another group and I am concerned regarding two matters:
1. The security of my AVC. Are AVCs less secure from possible raiding than
FSAVCs?
2. Future changes in employment (the owner has been reducing staff
recently). Are AVCs less portable than FSAVCs?
There is no reason why an AVC scheme should be any less secure than an
FSAVC. Neither scheme would be portable in the true sense of the word,
although you would have a greater degree of control, particularly on
investment questions, with the FSAVC. (Reply by Andrew White of Gordon

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Earn more while
keeping a rein on your risks - In the latest in her series on investing for
income, Debbie Harrison suggests how people who are reluctant to invest in
ordinary shares can still obtain a rising income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many investors, particularly pensioners, need to squeeze as much income as
they can from their ventures and are reluctant to take any risks with the
capital. The trouble with this approach is that inflation eats into the real
value of both capital and income.
That is why most advisers say that even income-orientated investors should
have at least some equity-based investments in their portfolios if they can
afford to invest over the medium to long term.
If you cannot, or will not accept the risk of ordinary shares, it is worth
considering a half-way house: investments which offer some capital
protection plus a rising income. This week, we cover four of these:
index-linked gilts, index-linked corporate debentures, stepped preference
shares of spilt capital investment trusts, and escalator bonds.
Index-linked gilts
Issued by the government, these guarantee to increase both the six-monthly
interest payments and the 'nominal' or original capital investment due at
redemption in line with increases in the retail prices index.
Since the starting RPI used is eight months before the date of issue, the
final value of the investment can be calculated precisely seven months
before redemption (RPI figures are published a month behind). Like
conventional gilts, the index-linked variety are traded actively, so the
price and real value can fluctuate significantly between the issue and
redemption date.
Gerry Loughrey, economic strategist with stockbroker Albert E. Sharp,
explains: 'These are market instruments, and the value will rise and fall
according to inflation and interest expectations, the economic and the
political environment.
'At present, investors could be interested in index-linked gilts because
they provide a hedge against political instability. If a Labour government
is elected and inflation rises, both income and capital would be protected
fully.'
Investors seeking absolute guarantees from their income-yielding portfolio
may be tempted to put all their money in gilts. In this case, Loughrey would
recommend a balance between conventional gilts, which offer a comparatively
high fixed income but no index-linking of the capital value; and
index-linked gilts, which offer a low initial income but protect the income
and capital from rising inflation.
Loughrey says that in a more general portfolio of income-yielding
investments, index-linked gilts could represent between 5 per cent and 10
per cent of the holding depending on the investor's attitude to risk. It is
also possible to buy the corporate equivalent of index-linked gilts, but
these debentures represent a small market at present - mainly utilities and
investment trust companies.
Corporate index-linked
debentures
These work in a similar way to index-linked gilts, paying interest twice a
year which, along with the original capital investment, is linked to the
RPI. Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, says: 'The main benefit
of the corporate version is the higher coupon, or interest rate, payable.
'The real yield on corporate index-linked is around 5.1 per cent at present
on the Severn River Crossing debenture (issued to raise funds for the new
Severn Bridge), whereas the real yield on index-linked gilts is around 4 per
cent.'
Phillip Payne, sterling and fixed interest analyst with stockbroker
Capel-Cure Myers, has reservations about corporate index-linked debentures.
'Our first preference is the gilt market because of its liquidity and
yields. There are only five or six corporate issues around at present, and
most of these are expensive to trade compared with gilts. So, they would be
suitable only for the longer-term investor.'
Escalator bonds
These share some of the characteristics of gilts.
The account pays a pre-determined rate of interest for the first year, then
increases the rate by a fixed amount for subsequent years. Typically, the
increase is 1 per cent for the first four years and 3 per cent for the
fifth, although you will lose part of the interest payment if you pull out
early. Angus Jones, account manager at Capel Cure Myers said: 'Escalator
bonds could be attractive if interest rates remain low. They might form part
of a deposit portfolio, but are not a substitute for equity investment.'
Stepped preference shares of split-capital trusts
These offer an income which is guaranteed to rise each year at a fixed rate,
and a fixed redemption price for the shares when the trust is wound up.
The four biggest names in this specialist market are General Consolidated,
River &amp; Mercantile, Scottish National and TR Technology. Each investment
trust offers a different yield and annual increase, depending on the risk
profile of the underlying assets.
The factors to consider are the investment profile (level of risk); the
present dividend yield; and gross redemption yield (the total return
expressed as an annual percentage, assuming the share is bought at the
present price and held to maturity).
General Consolidated invests in UK medium-sized companies. Present yield 3
per cent; 7.5 per cent annual increases until January 1997; gross redemption
yield 9.2 per cent a year.
R&amp;M invests in UK high-yielding stocks. Present yield 4.9 per cent; 5 per
cent annual increases until April 2000; gross redemption yield 9.5 per cent
a year.
Scottish National invests in UK high-yielding stocks and convertibles.
Present yield 5.7 per cent; 5 per cent a year increases until September
1998; gross redemption yield 9.2 per cent.
TR Technology invests in international technology companies. Present yield
6.0 per cent; 5 per cent a year increases until April 1998; gross redemption
yield 10.8 per cent a year.
Loughrey says: 'It is important to remember these are not bonds. You buy
into an equity investment which is structured to pay an income - the risk
level depends on the underlying assets in which the trust is invested.'
For those prepared to accept the risks, the yields can be much higher than
index-linked gilts and corporate bonds.
Preference shares, as their name suggests, have first call on any income the
trust receives.
Joanne Eaves, assistant personal equity plan manager with R&amp;M, stresses:
'There is no way that these annual increases would not be paid. They are
attached to the class of share at the time of launching the trust, and are
guaranteed through to the wind-up date.'
Postscript: The four investments are likely to appeal to different types of
investor. Escalator bonds are the easiest to understand and offer some of
the best immediate yields.
If inflation and interest rates in the United Kingdom rise more than
expected over the next five years, however, escalator bonds will provide no
inflation-proofing for your capital - and even the increased income might
look less competitive than it does now.
Index-linked gilts are a safe choice for anyone who can afford the low
starting yield, and they offer capital protection and inflation-proofing so
long as you can hold them to maturity. The other two offer potentially
greater rewards - and risks.
INDEX-LINKED GILTS
Net income or yield:
Non-taxpayer: 2.1%-4.5%
25% taxpayer: 1.56%-3.38%
40% taxpayer: 1.26%-2.7%
Key facts: Income paid twice a year, gross if purchased through National
Savings Stock Register (details from post offices), net of basic rate tax if
purchased through a stockbroker (reclaimable for non-taxpayers). No capital
gains tax liability.
Comment: Low initial income but both capital and income protected against
rising inflation. Investors with less than Pounds 5000 to invest in index
linked stock should use the National Savings Stock Register because
stockbroker charges render this level of investment uneconomic.
CORPORATE INDEX-LINKED DEBENTURES
Net income or yield:
Non-taxpayer: around 5%
25% taxpayer: 3.75%
40% taxpayer: 3.0%
Key facts: Income paid twice a year net of basic rate tax (this is
reclaimable for non-taxpayers). No capital gains tax liability on qualifying
corporate bonds.
Comments: Small market at present, more utilities expected to enter in the
future. Higher interest than index linked gilts. No minimum, but not
recommended for investments under Pounds 5,000. Corporate index-linked
debentures can be expensive to trade so best held for the long term.
ESCALATOR BONDS
Net income or yield in first year:
Non-taxpayer: about 6%
25% taxpayer: 4.5%
40% taxpayer: 3.6%
Key facts: Available from several building societies and banks. Return of
capital guaranteed. Minimum investment varies (Pounds 2,000 for Barclays).
Typical rates (based on Barclays' account): 6 per cent year one, 7 per cent
year 2, 8 per cent year three, 9 per cent year four, 12 per cent year five.
Income paid monthly, annually or at end of term.
Comment: Only attractive if you think interest rates will remain low. Less
secure than gilts. If a building society becomes insolvent all you get back
is 90 per cent of up to Pounds 20,000.
STEPPED PREFERENCE SHARES OF SPLIT CAPITAL TRUSTS
Net income or yield:
Non-taxpayer: 4%-7.6%
25% taxpayer: 3%-5.7%
40% taxpayer: 2.4%-4.56%
Key facts: Income and redemption value guaranteed by the trust. Dividends
paid net of basic rate tax (reclaimable for non-taxpayers). Any capital gain
on sale or redemption will be assessed for CGT.
Comment: Small market. Equity investments always entail possible risk, but
to date no trust has failed to deliver. The higher the risk rating of the
underlying assets, the higher the income. Not economic to purchase through
stockbroker for amounts less than Pounds 5,000.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: To Jericho by bicycle - War and Peace (Travelling in
Troublespots)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ibrahim Jadallah was insistent that we would be perfectly safe in Jericho.
But, as the Director of Tourism, he wanted to be absolutely certain and so
we were provided with a combined Israeli and Palestinian Authority armed
escort.
We streamed proudly into the previously occupied West Bank town, flanked by
Israeli jeeps flying orange flags and saloon cars with curtained windows
containing moustachioed men toting AK47s. We were VIPs on bicycles.
In reality we were participants in a 250-mile sponsored cycle ride on behalf
of the British Heart Foundation. But ours was a trail-blazing event, just 21
pioneers in advance of three much bigger rides to be held in April 1995.
We were a mixed bunch, ranging in age from early 20s to mid 60s, all
interested in visiting Israel at a time of great change and enormous
optimism.
Our journey took us from Hagoshrim along a 'J' shaped route through the
Jordan valley to the Dead Sea and then up to Jerusalem. Each day the cycling
was different. We pedalled through orchards of grapefruit and avocado, down
fertile valleys, through small farms growing salad crops in the Occupied
Territories, across deserts, beside glittering lakes and under shady trees.
Sometimes we biked on main roads and at others on rough farm tracks.
We cycled close to the heavily fenced Jordanian border along a road lined
with minefields and barbed wire and with occasional signs of past
engagements. Our intention to ride along a track parallel to the fence
itself was thwarted by a remote Israeli officer, even though permission had
already been granted. But the Israeli soldiers, who had waylaid us in their
machine gun carrier, were relaxed and jovial as the organisers strove by
radio to reach agreement with their headquarters.
With the general air of optimism in the country, they had no qualms about
passing over a flak jacket and gun for a fellow cyclist to pose for
photographs. After all, the peace agreement with Jordan had just been signed
and almost overnight a new road and checkpoint had been built at the border.
Reaching an agreement with the cyclists proved less easy, however, and after
an hour's negotiation, the soldiers were instructed to lead us away from the
border along a tortuous route, using field tracks, to the main road.
We found Jericho a green oasis after the desert, the latest of a series of
23 cities which have been built on the same site over the millennia. It
claims to be the oldest permanently inhabited spot in the world, the place
where man first gave up being a hunter-gatherer to become a farmer.
Our route was littered with such gems, places made familiar by memories of
religious education and Sunday school. We passed through the valley where
David slew Goliath, cycled under the desiccated hill where Jesus spent 40
days and 40 nights in the wilderness and enjoyed a whole day in Jerusalem.
We even stayed overnight in the lowest place in the world, a kibbutz built
1,200ft below sea level, where we learnt how the Dead Sea scrolls were
discovered, hidden in large jars and concealed in caves which we cycled past
on the following day.
It was to be a day of desert storms, strictly meteorological of course,
which hit us on our way to Massada.
A brooding blue-black bruise hung over the Dead Sea as we set out after
lunch on this empty section, 12 miles of exposed road snaking off into the
distance.
The wind came from the side, picking up stinging sand, buckling palm trees
and hurling tumble weed across the tarmac. It was quickly followed by rain,
hail and lightning causing flood water to flow across the road in brown
rivers. Shortly before Massada we were turned back by floods and we had to
make a rapid retreat by vehicle before the waters closed in behind us too.
It all seemed terribly biblical.
At a time when the National Lottery threatens to soak up the benevolent
intentions of the British people, charities such as the British Heart
Foundation are having to think of new ways to garner funds.
The lure of the Israel Experience, a trip to the Holy Land with a 250-mile
sponsored cycle ride included, is just one of these. In order to take part
in the Israel Experience, every one of the participants paid an initial
Pounds 175 registration fee, and undertook to raise a minimum of Pounds
1,500 through sponsorship, of which at least Pounds 1,000 goes to the
British Heart Foundation Angina Research Appeal.
Some, such as Sarah, a non-clinical research scientist, and medical
students, Karen and Ingrid, were motivated by their interest in medicine.
Others had relatives who had experienced heart disease including Robert,
whose father had suffered from angina since his late 30s and who underwent
extensive heart surgery in his 50s.
Still others, such as Adam, a film student, just fancied going to Israel and
wanted to support a good cause at the same time. And one, Tony, had even
suffered a heart attack just a week before retiring from his marketing job
with a pharmaceuticals company six months before.
At that time he could hardly have imagined that less than half a year later
he would be cycling into Jericho with a Palestinian Authority escort, still
less that he would be crossing the desert with rain lashing his face and
lightning searing the clouds in front.
In retrospect, in an increasingly peaceful Israel, I suspect the desert
storms were the more dangerous of the two.
Michael Woods flew with El Al and the ride, including accommodation,
transport and the bikes themselves, was organised by Classic Tours. Three
further Israel Experiences will take place in April 1995 - to find out how
to take part, freephone the British Heart Foundation on 0500-200 575.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: Signs of hope under the wall - War and Peace
(Travelling in Troublespots) / Jimmy Burns visits the Belfast front line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was at the far end of Cupar Street, West Belfast, in 1990 that I had
first set eyes on Europe's last remaining political wall: a 20ft barrier of
concrete and reinforced steel, zig-zagging through housing estates,
churches, and factories, separating communities from each other on account
of religion.
The 'peace line' was erected 25 years ago by the security forces, with the
support of both Protestant and Catholic residents. It still stands, a
poignant symbol of political failure.
The peace line cuts across the back garden of Colette Mcferran's small
terraced house in Cupar Street and still blocks out the light from her
sitting room. And yet, when I visited her, she sat talking of hope, a
Catholic living in protestant-dominated Belfast.
'You know it's really strange but I'm not afraid to go out at night any
more,' she said. 'You have to give it time, but the mood is changing. People
are talking about the houses they would like to live in, and the schools
they would like their children to go to, and the lottery.' Mcferran plays
both the Irish and the British lotteries.
It is this war-weariness, this desire to experience the ordinariness of life
without bombs and bullets, that is making life difficult for the men of
arms. For as the ceasefire continues, the collective sense of fear is
gradually lifting.
When I last visited Mcferran four years ago, she described at length how she
and her Catholic neighbours felt harassed by the British army. She told me
about the day three drunken soldiers had ripped the flowers from her garden
and called her an Irish slut.
Now she had a different story to tell, more in keeping with changing
political realities. She described how her house had been taken over by the
IRA. 'My daughter Sinead, who was then three, was sitting on my knee in the
sitting room when these three IRA men kicked in my door and ran up the
steps. They then started shooting from my upstairs window at the protestants
across the wall.'
Sinead was traumatised by the experience and had to undergo psychiatric
treatment. Even now, at the age of seven, she still suffers from recurring
nightmares and wets her bed. Whenever news about Northern Ireland comes on
the TV she goes up and switches it off. The IRA has fewer friends than it
once did in Catholic West Belfast.
One of the greatest challenges facing the peacemakers of Northern Ireland is
to change the attitudes of the children and young people, who have never
known any other life than that dictated by political violence and sectarian
hate.
No one knows this better than Mina Wardle, a stress counsellor, who lives on
the Protestant side of the peace line, a few blocks away from Mcferran, off
the Shankhill Road.
Wardle's life reflects the Troubles in microcosm. During the last 20 years,
she has been the victim of armed robbery and death threats; she has tended
to the mutilated victims of bombs, and seen a taxi driver shot dead outside
her front door. Her first husband, an alcoholic, unable to cope with it all,
beat and abused her until she had no option but to call in a friend in the
Royal Ulster Constabulary.
When I met Wardle in 1990, she was pessimistic about the future of Northern
Ireland. As many local residents were being killed by paramilitaries as she
was recruiting to her community workshop. She admits that such pessimism
takes time and effort to erode, but she too feels a psychological change is
taking place.
'After the IRA ceasefire, my son rang and asked what I thought about it. I
told him I didn't think it was going to last. He said 'mum, don't be so
cynical, you've got to give peace a chance. I just want to savour it. I want
it to happen in my lifetime.' Then he broke down crying. That really touched
me.'
Wardle believes something fundamental was changing in Northern Irish society
well before the ceasefire: the demoralising effect of so much of the
violence and the sense of impotence that this generated among ordinary
people, was giving way to a conscious effort to end tribal warfare.
It was the IRA bomb attack on a political meeting above a fish shop in
Shankhill Road in October last year (it left nine bystanders as well as the
bomber dead and led to the inevitable retaliatory killings of another group
of innocent Catholics in a pub near Derry) that cut through sectarian
bigotry and provoked a catharsis. Neither the IRA nor their loyalist
counterparts had any option but to consider suspending their military
operations.
'Everyone involved in those killings felt they were in some way responsible
and it generated a new way of thinking. All of a sudden people were united
in wanting to claw back the value of life,' Wardle said.
But wasn't the situation still fragile with both sides still holding back
from handing in all their armoury, I asked?
'We have to believe that this is the end of it and that we cannot go back to
a situation where people are prepared to kill themselves over a wee bit of
land. You have to believe that tomorrow is going to be better than
yesterday, otherwise you're never going to wake up,' she answered.
Faith in a better, less violent future, the tentative thought - unimaginable
a few weeks ago - that 1995 could be the year of peace in Northern Ireland
has yet to break down the peace wall. But it is beginning to be shared by
those whose minds were once set on protecting their kind by killing others.
Twenty-one years ago Paddy Wilson and a woman friend were victims of a
killing quite appalling even by Northern Ireland standards. Wilson, the then
agent of the Catholic Gerry (now Lord) Fitt, and the woman were stabbed to
death and mutilated.
John White, the man charged with their murder and recently released after
serving part of a life sentence, now sits in a recently furnished office off
the protestant Shankhill Road, on the other side of the peace line from
Cupar Street. He is a spokesman for the loyalist paramilitaries who have
declared a ceasefire.
The man responsible for what Lord Fitt describes as 'one of the most vicious
murders in Northern Ireland history' looks fit and healthy, with his
paramilitary tattoo on his right arm, and little repentance for past
actions. White wants to talk only about the future.
'If I've changed my mind about violence, its not because of my prison
experience but because of my analysis of the changing political situation -
I realised that killing people was getting neither side anywhere and that it
was futile. It was only alienating us from the community.'
Yet change still has its parameters. Ask White about taking a bulldozer to
the peace line and he will reject such an option, at least for now. He
remembered the day it was put up. People were throwing petrol bombs at each
other. He would be in favour of cutting a small door in the wall to allow
people to move in and out during the day. It would close at nightfall. For
he believes there remains a chilling threat of a return to violence.
'If rioting did break out again, it would degenerate into full-scale
warfare. Stones would turn into guns, and violence would begin all over
again. There needs to be compromise, but we have to move gradually,' he
said.
That night, I drove to Bombay Street, another Catholic ghetto which backs on
to the peace line. I knocked without warning on the door of a local
resident, who I knew was a political activist.
Through a window I saw a youngish man, who had been sitting with his
children, rise quickly and hide in the background. Only later, after
extensive introductions through a family member, did he come forward.
Martin McIlwee is leading a campaign to stop the peace line being taken
down. His language remains unchanged as if the events of recent months were
simply a cosmetic interlude in an ongoing process of ethnic cleansing.
'The day that wall gets taken down, the prods will be across, shouting
'Let's get those Fenian bastards'. If London is gearing up for another
onslaught when the ceasefire breaks down, why shouldn't we.'
So the collective catharsis has touched White, but not McIlwee. Quite how
many fall into one camp or the other is impossible to say.
Yet when I left Belfast this time it was neither White nor McIlwee that
stuck in my thoughts, but Mcferran and her daughter Sinead. I remembered
what parent and daughter had said about some British soldiers they had seen.
Clutching her school books, Sinead butted in on our conversation and said:
'You know the soldiers make me laugh. They have pom poms on their hats which
go round and round.' Her mother had a more ordinary explanation. 'It's very
strange, you know, seeing soldiers without helmets. They look human.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: A city without vultures or doves - War and Peace
(Travelling in Troublespots)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a while before you realise what is missing in Beirut - apart, that
is, from electricity, interesting night-life and traffic lights. Then it
strikes. No birds. Not a sparrow, not a pigeon in sight.
Who can blame them for clearing off? Wracked, wrecked and wretched after a
particularly nasty civil war lasting almost two decades, Beirut is only now
returning to a semblance of normality. When the birds return, you will know
that Beirut is once again on the regular tourist list. Until then, it beats
other off-beat destinations - Tirana springs to mind - into a cocked hat.
For although Beirut easily wins 1994's Most Densely Packed Urban Bomb Crater
gold medal - and narrowly nudges Manhattan into second place for the year's
international Street Trash award - its inhabitants could charm the birds
from the trees. If there were any birds, that is. How can a city where
collective madness blasted bullets and mortars from every corner, suddenly
be populated by such a relaxed, informal and welcoming citizenry?
There is probably no simple answer. When I was there, the most plausible
tended gently to ooze away, usually over dozens of mezze dishes and some
succulent red wines. Beirut may have been blitzed into rubble, but it is
still a gourmet's delight, as we found in the splendid Hotel Arabi, high
above the town of Zahle, on the edge of the Bekaa valley.
Zahle makes an excellent oasis en route from Beirut from Baalbek, 86km
north-east of Lebanon's capital. From 1975, when a Moslem leftist coalition
began slugging it out with Christian right-wing militias, the (originally
Phoenician, now Roman) site of Baalbek was inaccessible to all but the most
determined traveller.
Even today, more than two years after the first parliamentary elections in
20 years signalled the petering-out of the war, obvious strangers strolling
through Baalbek's bustling market are curiosities, to be gracefully
acknowledged by older people, or giggled at by youngsters. It matters not
that you have no Arabic; try French - even though the French mandate expired
in the second world war, many Lebanese have enough French for basic
communication.
Baalbek's beauty is two-fold. As one of the world's biggest ancient sites,
the temples to Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus are well-preserved and beautiful.
That dedicated to Jupiter still has six of its huge, 22-metre high, columns;
the temple itself is enormous, measuring 440ft by 370ft. To give some idea
of that scale, the Parthenon is 228ft by 100ft. The nearby smaller temple of
Bacchus - on the same scale as the Parthenon - is astonishingly complete,
lacking a roof but with much of its internal detail remaining.
And if the war kept away the tourists, it also frightened off the tourist
parasites. Apart from the Syrian and Lebanese flags, flying high on the
ramparts of Jupiter's temple, the site is pristine. No ice-cream stalls, no
fast-food joints, not a plastic souvenir in view. If hungry, dozens of
stalls selling tempting cooked sweets and savouries are just five minutes
walk away in the town.
Just a handful of postcard sellers stand eagerly at the gate, one of whom
does a nice line in touting coins, allegedly filched from the ruins. He also
spoke excellent English: 'I am going back to my studies next week, please
buy. Look, I will sell you two silver ones for Pounds 30. Take them, take
them] Have this bronze one too, for Pounds 25] Please.' Were they genuine?
Who knows. If you tire of Baalbek, then the 19th century palace of Beit
Eddine, or the port city of Byblos - one of the oldest continuously
inhabited cities in the world - are within easy reach.
Inevitably, travellers will be jittery about security. But I found it much
safer to walk round Beirut late at night - the streets were empty, the rare
passing Beiruti amiable - than many cities of much safer reputation. Parts
of south Lebanon are still out of bounds for travellers, as the sporadic war
between Hizbollah's fighters and Israeli forces drags on. Today, the Bekaa
Valley is quiet, with only the occasional tiny Syrian anti-aircraft gun
emplacement dotted along the route connecting Baalbek with Beirut. They look
ill-prepared to fire shots in anger.
Has Beirut found peace through exhaustion? Hardly. The only cause of
exhaustion today is the city's frenetic activity: rebuilding whole blocks;
street-level trading of everything from three-piece suites to designer
clothes; 1m cars clogging streets bereft of traffic lights and road
markings. It used to be said that whatever you wanted could be bought in
Beirut; it is probably true once more.
Luxury apartments have sprung up again on the Corniche, the famous promenade
overlooking the Mediterranean. Most are empty - understandable, at prices
from Dollars 1m for three bedrooms. Why don't their owners ask less? 'They
don't have to. They are waiting for the good times to return, and then there
will be plenty of buyers,' said a Beiruti.
The good times cannot be far off, if the current uneasy peace persists. The
thousands of homeless Beirutis who have stuck up plastic sheeting as
protection against the elements in bombed-out apartment blocks, cannot wish
for any more fighting. The advance guard of development - bankers, venture
dealers and financiers - have already begun to trickle back, sniffing out
embryonic deals in the urgently-needed reconstruction of everything from
telecommunications to waste disposal.
Go to Beirut. It will not be easy, but it will be worth it. See for yourself
what mass insanity can do; and see too, how the human spirit can survive
even that. And get there before the universal merchants of plastic tat
discover the country's delights; once they arrive, even the sparrows might
think twice about returning.
Gary Mead travelled to Beirut courtesy of British Mediterranean Airways,
which flies directly between Heathrow and Beirut five times weekly. Middle
East Airlines flies the same route. Best hotels in Beirut are the Summerland
and Coral Beach hotels.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, of the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenner is involved in a wide range of different businesses, writes Vivien
MacDonald, of the Inside Track. Over the past 18 months, the rise in the
price has been spectacular, although it has slowed recently.
Since the announcement of final results at the begining of November, three
directors have bought stock on the market. The non-executive chairman, Colin
Cooke, has now increased his holding by a sizeable amount. The year-end
report was good and three directors dealing together is usually a vote of
confidence.
Asprey has been in the press a fair amount over the past year, and it has
not done the company much good. After weak interim results, the share price
fell almost 350p to 135p. At this lower level, directors have started to
pick up more stock again. JR Asprey has added further to his already
considerable family trust while Naim Attallah, who wisely sold when the
stock stood at 310p, has also been back to the market and has more than
returned to his previous level of holding.
Largest sale of the week was at Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group.
David Abbott, chairman, and Peter Mead, chief executive, sold a total of
440,000 shares at 337p each but retain sizeable holdings. The share's
performance has been good over the past 12 months.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Lloyd serves a profits ace - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY: David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis and health club company, is
expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of Pounds
7.5m, ahead by more than 30 per cent. A total dividend of 3.6p is forecast,
compared with a notional 3.25p previously.
Although only one new club was opened during the year - in Glasgow - the
group has benefited from growing membership and the good weather last
summer. Glasgow, which was opened in October 1993, has also made a good
initial contribution.
The group acquired two clubs in Hampshire last July and expects that centres
now being built in Birmingham and Bristol will open in 1995. It has a policy
of introducing two new clubs each year.
THURSDAY: Boots, which includes Britain's biggest chain of chemists among
its retailing interests, is expected to become the first of the large
retailers to reveal how it has performed during the all-important Christmas
trading period.
After a late surge, analysts are looking for a total sales increase in the
chemist shops of at least 5 per cent in the second half so far.
Full-year group profit forecasts are about Pounds 520m-Pounds 540m, but
could change depending on when the group completes the sale of its
pharmaceuticals division to Germany's BASF.
THURSDAY: Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise motor retail group, is expected to
announce interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 4.6m and Pounds 5m. The
substantial increase on last year's Pounds 3.51m is helped by acquisitions
but also proves the value of the company's specialist retailing strategy.
The interim dividend is forecast to rise from 1.4p to about 1.5p.
FRIDAY: Bid speculation surrounding Scantronic Holdings is likely to
re-surface when the debt-burdened security components manufacturer and
distributor announces widely-expected losses.
Following a profits warning, the company is expected to confirm hefty
re-organisation and debt servicing costs led to pre-tax losses of Pounds
2.4m in the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 1.4m last
time.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Paisley power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
The Rev Dr Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, MP for the Northern Ireland seat of
North Antrim, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, founder of the free
Presbyterian Church in Ulster, member of the European parliament for the
province, has for 25 years personified protestant resistance to any change
in the constitutional link between Britain and the six provinces of Ulster.
In stentorian tones and fiery oratory he has boomed out 'no surrender' so
often to every proposal for change that as, John Hume, his nationalist
Catholic counterpart, once remarked, tongue-in-cheek, if the word 'no' was
struck from the English language Ian Paisley would have nothing to say.
The current talks involved in the so-called peace process portend the best
prospect in a quarter of a century for changes in the constitutional
arrangements for the British Islands.
Yet, for once, Ian Paisley, has been strangely muted.
His implacable hostility to change stems not so much from a love of British
governments. It derives more from a deep-seated opposition to the Roman
Catholicism of the Republic of Ireland.
In his dread of all things Roman or papist, as he refers to the Republic,
Paisley seems to be fighting the battles of long ago.
Presbyterianism has long been the province's largest protestant
denomination. And it is to these that Paisley has played. The protestants
today amount to 1m of the province's 1.6m population and the Catholics form
the considerable minority.
Whether it was a rural farmer frightened of being deprived of his land, or a
skilled Belfast industrial worker afraid of losing his job, they were united
in the belief that they were superior to their Catholic neighbours.
Their presbyterianism heavily influenced as it was with Calvinism gave then
a moral edge, as they see it.
Ian Paisley was born on 2 April 1926 in Armargh, the son of a baptist
minister. In 1951 he started in a Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast.
In 1963 he began his career of protest, well before the Troubles broke out
again in 1968. In that year he organised a march to protest against the
lowering of the Union Flag at Belfast City Hall to mark the death of Pope
John XXIII. Other protests followed.
But to see him as just a bombastic, slightly unhinged bible basher is to do
him less than justice. By the early l960s he had become interested in
politics. and political organisation, and has proved a very canny politician
indeed. He won the parliamentary seat for North Antrim in a by-election in
1970, and in 1971 launched the Democratic Unionist Party. In l979 he won one
of the three European Parliament seats in the province and has continued to
hold it with huge majorities.
His position as a high profile, constitutional politician has given him a
certain legitimacy in presenting as spokesman for loyalism.
The apotheosis of his role came in 1974. The protestants demonstrated their
great ability to cohere under pressure. A coalition of paramilitaries, trade
unionists and extremist politicians like such as Paisley, united to form the
Ulster Workers Council. It made the province ungovernable for a week,
largely through shutting down the power stations. The government of Harold
Wilson lost its nerve, failed to break up the strikes, and the new
executive, the first attempt at power-sharing, collapsed.
What the strikes demonstrated was Paisley's rare ability to march the Ulster
Protestants up to the brink and then back again without suffering any loss
of face. He has always publicly eschewed violence and distanced himself from
the paramilitaries.
The point about Paisley is that while he personally seems to personify
unionism, his party is a minority one. Critically, the Loyalist paramilitary
organisations have now said they want their own political representatives to
enter discussions with the British government.
This is a serious blow to his claim of having the mandate to speak for all
the unionists
Paisley is 68 years old and visibly not the man he was. Is the 'big man' he
about to shout his last hurrah?

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Arafat's pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem churlish to speculate that Yassir Arafat chose peace because
other options had been closed, but it is a difficult conclusion to resist.
The terms accepted by Arafat in the Oslo agreement, signed at the White
House in September 1993, bore little relation to the conditions sought by
the Palestine Liberation Organisation in successive rounds of talks since
the opening of the Madrid peace conference in October 1991.
But, in one secret swoop, the deal with Israel catapulted Arafat from his
backstreet office in Tunis to the forefront of international diplomacy.
Unaccustomed to western praise, Arafat found it heaped upon him. The gun had
given way to the olive branch. Peace, it seemed, had arrived in the Middle
East.
Hamas, the extremist Islamic group, and other radical Palestinian factions,
rejected the deal. Palestinian sceptics were little moved, arguing that any
outline accord which relied so heavily on Israeli generosity was doomed. The
doubters were silent, or grudgingly willing to await developments.
Enthusiasts declared that there could be no turning back.
The question voiced more generally was whether Arafat, already under
mounting criticism for his arbitrary leadership of the PLO, could ever
develop the skills of consultation and delegation needed to administer a
self-rule authority in the Gaza strip and West Bank. He has yet to provide a
positive response.
It might be argued that Arafat has scarcely been given a chance, either by
the Israelis with their insistence that he wages war on Hamas, or by the
international aid donors with their demands for total transparency and
accountability in the dispersal of funds. But suspicions are growing about
Arafat's handling of contracts, and his reliance on a small group of cronies
linked to international business. This all smacks of the old Arafat in his
Beirut days of the 1970s when he was accountable to no one, controlled a
generously funded budget, and commanded a powerful guerrilla army.
When, in November, Arafat's police opened fire on protesters in Gaza, fears
grew among Palestinians that he was acting just as Hamas had forecast: as a
surrogate for the Israeli armed forces so recently withdrawn. At the same
time, little or no progress was being made on the Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank which would trigger the holding of much-delayed Palestinian
elections. With senior members of the Israeli cabinet openly questioning
whether adequate protection could be provided for Israeli settlers, Arafat's
popularity among Palestinians continued its decline.
Unable to deliver for his own constituency, or for the Israeli government,
Arafat's political prospects look bleak. However, he can draw some comfort
from the number of times he has rebounded after being written off. The
difference this time is that Arafat is relying for survival on the
co-operation of old enemies, rather than old friends. The participants in
the process all like to describe themselves as contributing to a 'peace of
the brave'. Arafat knows what it is like to lose a war, but must fear that
losing a peace could be considerably more painful.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Saddam's gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Saddam Hussein has bet on war as other addictive gamblers play
roulette. He has laid extravagant wagers, borrowed to cover his losses, and
then doubled the stakes in a vain effort to recoup. Not for him the pre-dawn
remorse, the guilt-laden call to Gamblers Anonymous, and the tearful pledge
to repay his distraught family for the grief he has inflicted. Of all the
punters in the Middle East, Saddam is the one least likely to kick the
habit.
The west, backed by Arab governments and UN resolutions, is trying to remove
temptation by denying Iraq the cash with which its leader has invested so
heavily in arms. The resolve is greatest in Washington and Kuwait, but the
voices of China, France and Russia have increasingly been heard arguing that
the Iraqi people have suffered too much already, and that Baghdad has to be
rewarded for complying with Security Council resolutions.
Compliance, however, is a hard concept for Saddam to accept, as are other
words which might imply compromise, weakness or defeat. The Iraqi leader's
career has been built and sustained through the creation of an aura of
unchallengeable strength.
When Iraqi troops marched into Iran in 1980 it was glorious revenge for
humiliations heaped on Arabs by the Persians over the centuries. When the
Iraqi troops were driven out a couple of years later, the war became a
no-less-glorious defence of the Arab nation against the Shia Islamic
revolution. Ten years later, history repeated itself in Kuwait. A military
rout was presented within Iraq as a David-like defiance of the western
imperialist Goliath.
Saddam's survival continues to baffle western governments, though not the
people of Iraq. An obsession with security and British-trained personal
bodyguards explains part of it. More important is his reputation for the
ruthless elimination of anyone whose loyalty may be in doubt, a total grip
on senior military appointments, and the belief among some that the country
could fracture into at least three parts.
The allies failed to prevent Baghdad reasserting its grip over the
rebellious Shia population in the south, and without a protected zone for
the Kurds there is no doubt that Saddam's troops would march northwards. The
combination of sanctions and military threats is thus limiting Saddam's
domestic ambitions. But the Iraqi leader is chaffing at the bit, and it
would take a credulous international community to accept at face value his
recent recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and acceptance of the
UN-designated border. It is more realistic to look back to October when Iraq
moved armour and troops to within striking distance of Kuwait, before
withdrawing in the face of a US deployment.
The episode served at least two purposes. It reminded the Iraqi people of
their leader's ability to tweak the nose of an American president. And it
should have reminded everyone else that Saddam is still at the table, and
may not be able to resist the challenge of another throw.
Dice and leopards do not change their spots.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Mandela days - War and Peace (Warmongers
and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the year in which southern Africa laid the foundations of a lasting
peace, two images stand out.
In the first, Nelson Mandela, right hand raised, is sworn in as president of
the newly democratic South Africa, in a ceremony which formally ended more
than three centuries of white rule.
Six months later the same grey-haired septuagenarian is again in front of
the cameras, this time posing proudly with a beautiful young woman, the hint
of a tear in her eye, resting her head on his broad shoulders.
With an enthusiasm for Whitney Houston's charms that belied his years,
Mandela declared: 'I'm only here to shine her shoes. She is one of the
unpolished jewels in the anti-apartheid struggle.'
'I love you Madiba,' replied Houston, a singer, her eyes glistening, using
the clan name for Mandela.
Clearly Mandela, now a sprightly 76, is enjoying the status that his
personality and newly acquired power have brought, but that does not
diminish speculation about his capacity to stand up to the demands of
office.
Indeed, some observers suggest that Mandela's reverence for Houston smacks
of an infatuation that is a sign of approaching dotage, and point out that
his aides and doctors have urged him to ease his punishing schedule.
It seems unthinkable that Mandela should step down. Ideally, say senior ANC
officials, they would like Mandela to see them through the five-year life of
the current parliament - none, however, are prepared to suggest that it
might already be time for Mandela to retire.
Yet age eventually takes its toll - even of a man as resilient as the one
who walked out of Cape Town's Pollsmoor prison nearly five years ago.
Together with former president FW de Klerk, fellow recipient of the Nobel
peace prize, Mandela went on to achieve the seeming impossible - a
negotiated end to apartheid. In steering their country through one of
history's most extraordinary political transformations, they also liberated
southern Africa itself.
White South Africa's defence of apartheid had been at the heart of conflicts
that have devastated the region, beginning with wars for independence in the
early 1960s, and the end of apartheid marked the end of Pretoria's
destabilisation of its neighbours.
Mandela has since made his influence felt beyond South Africa's borders,
playing a leading role in southern Africa's informal grouping known as the
front line states, intervening in Lesotho, Angola and Botswana to help
secure peace and democracy in the region as a whole.
Today, six months after being sworn in as president in Pretoria, Mandela's
achievement remains no less remarkable, but a crisis of expectations is
developing which will put all his skills to the test.
Election euphoria is over, and young blacks are impatient for the fruits of
victory. 'We in office, but not in power,' quips one senior official,
pointing out that they are the inheritors of a white dominated economy, and
dependent on the implementation of reform on a white-dominated civil
service.
Meanwhile the party itself is showing signs of division within its ranks,
and there is a whiff of corruption in the air, as a growing black elite
enjoys the benefits of office.
South Africa is fortunate to have outstanding potential successors to
Mandela, such as Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the
party's secretary general.
African tradition, however, suggests that 'Madiba' will stay, like other
partriarchs of the continent's liberation - Jomo Kenyatta, Houphoet-Boigny,
Hastings Banda. Yet this tradition carries a warning. All three countries -
Kenya, Ivory Coast, Malawi - initially thrived when these men were in their
prime, but went into steep decline as aged, enfeebled, and increasingly
autocratic, they kept their people and their parties in harmful thrall.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Khamenei enigma - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is an 'honest, virtuous, well-informed, courageous,
efficient administrator and religious jurist, enjoying the confidence of the
majority of the people as leader'. He has to be, because those are the
obligatory virtues of Iran's spiritual leader as specified by the country's
constitution.
But not all the world, and especially the western part of it, shares the
views expressed by the authors of the Iranian constitution. The US
Administration has substantially different ideas. It has constructed a
policy of 'containment' towards Iran under Ayatollah Khamenei, designed to
frustrate what it believes are politically hostile intentions, supported by
a military build-up and ultimately the acquisition of nuclear weapons. In
short, senior members of the Clinton administration think that Ayatollah
Khamenei might contemplate going to war in pursuit of his ambitions.
Judged solely on Khamenei's public statements, the Americans might have a
point. He has described the US as the pinnacle of sedition and corruption.
He advocates spreading the message of Islamic revolution. He vigorously
supports the fatwa condemning writer Salman Rushdie to death. As for the
Middle East peace process, the ayatollah argues that 'those taking part in
this treason will suffer the wrath of nations'.
From this it would seem fair to conclude that Khamenei is a worthy successor
to Ayatollah Ruollah Khomeini, his theological and political mentor. It was
not so clear five years ago when Ayatollah Khomeini died. Despite having
served as Iran's president, Khamenei was still only a middle-ranking
clergyman with several more senior Islamic jurists ahead of him as possible
spiritual leaders. And he was considered, even within Iran, to represent the
more pragmatic face of the Islamic revolution. Together with Hojateslam Ali
Akbar Rafsanjani, who succeeded Khamenei as president, there was deemed to
be the prospect of a more moderate Iran seeking its way back into the family
of nations.
Exhausted by the eight-year war with Iraq, it was not unreasonable to hope
that the sharpest edge of the Iranian revolution had been blunted. The
country needed a period of calm to bind the wounds of war, absorb the impact
of radical political change, and begin rebuilding its economy.
Much rested on the ability of Ayatollah Khamenei and President Rafsanjani to
work together. Western experts spent long hours attempting to decide whether
the two men were different sides of the same political coin, or locked in a
struggle for power. Whatever the judgment, Khamenei has come out ahead,
while economically and politically Iran has fallen further behind.
International debts have mounted, the economy has contracted, unemployment
and poverty have worsened.
But the rhetoric of the leadership is little changed, and Iran still looks
hopefully around the region for the emergence of Islamic regimes with which
it can ally itself.
Weapons and financial aid are available to deserving causes, while the
Iranian propaganda machine continues to assail neighbouring monarchies and
other western-oriented governments. Khamenei may have compelling reasons for
not wanting to involve his country in another war, but remains responsive to
others pursuing the cause of Islamic revolution.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Rabin the soldier - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, may have been awarded a one-third
stake in this year's Nobel peace prize, but it is still to men in uniform he
instinctively turns for advice. The long-time soldier measures every
proposed step towards peace against the potential risk to Israeli security.
It has been Shimon Peres, the foreign minister and fellow Nobel peace prize
winner, who over the past two years has provided most of the vision, while
Rabin has made the daily calculation about levels of violence and their
impact on the electorate.
Nothing better summed up Rabin's approach to peace with the Palestinians
than his initial reluctance to attend the White House signing ceremony in
1993, and his obvious distaste at having to shake the hand of Yassir Arafat.
But it was the price which had to be paid for getting Israeli troops out of
the Gaza strip. A year earlier Rabin had remarked that he wished Gaza 'would
sink into the sea', a comment which he claimed had originally been made by
David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister. But, Rabin added, as Gaza
was unlikely to drop into the sea, it had to be dealt with.
One attraction of the 'Gaza first' option was that it did not require Rabin
to make many tough decisions on more contentious issues such as the future
of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The settlements remained
in Gaza under Israeli military protection. The arrangements for the far more
numerous and highly populated settlements in the West Bank were to be the
subject of future negotiations, while the opening of talks on their
long-term status was at least two years away.
Although not explicitly stated, the chances of those talks proving fruitful
rested to a large extent on Arafat doing what Israeli governments had for so
long failed to achieve and bring a halt to attacks on Israelis by
Palestinian radicals, and especially by Hamas, the extremist Islamic group.
Predictably, Arafat and his inexperienced police force have not succeeded.
Worse, the failure of the peace process to bring visible economic benefits
to the impoverished Gaza strip is tilting the political balance away from
Arafat and towards his opponents.
The Palestinian leader needs help, and the man best placed to provide it is
Rabin. But he is already balking at undertaking the next stage of the peace
process: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the main Arab population
centres in the West Bank to allow elections to be held. Rabin now says he
does not see how this can be done while ensuring the safety of Israeli
settlers, a comment which brought howls of protest from Palestinian
negotiators.
Rabin is also moving with caution in his contacts with Syria, insisting that
President Hafez al-Assad commits himself to a timetable for establishing
full relations before Israel announces how much of the Golan Heights it is
willing to withdraw from, and when. Even if US mediation produces an
improbable breakthrough, Rabin has promised Israeli voters the final say in
a referendum.
In spite of the loss of momentum and the stand-off with Syria, Rabin will
have been satisfied with his year, if only for the peace treaty signed with
Jordan, an achievement that won almost universal acclaim in Israel. His
place in history is assured, but whether it will be primarily as a man of
peace has yet to be decided.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Adams' choice - War and Peace (Warmongers
and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Belfast's leading political commentators believes that the
inspiration for Gerry Adams, the president of Provisional Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA and now, ostensibly, a peace broker in Northern
Ireland, is Michael Collins, an IRA leader who, in 1920, agreed to the
treaty partitioning Ireland.
Collins was the IRA strategist and intelligence officer who made Ireland
ungovernable between 1916 and 1919 through guerrilla warfare. But by 1920 he
had come to the conclusion that independence could not be won by military
means alone and agreed to sign the treaty.
'When you have sweated, toiled, had mad dreams, hopeless nightmares, you
find yourself in London's streets cold and dank in the night air . . .
Think] What have I got for Ireland. Something she has wanted these past 700
years? I tell you this - early this morning I signed my death warrant,' he
reflected after signing.
Sinn Fein split, Eamon De Valera leading the faction which resisted
partition. A bitter civil war followed. Eighteen months later Michael
Collins was dead, ambushed in Cork. It is always dangerous to push
historical parallels too far. But Irish people of both main political
persuasions are consumed with a sense of their past.
What can be said is that Gerry Adams, some time during the late 1980s,
became convinced that the military campaign was not going to lead to the
goal of a British withdrawal from Ireland - and a united country under the
jurisdiction of Dublin - and that another route should be tried.
Thus the ceasefire. It could cost him his life. There is no shortage of
rumours that the IRA will again split as it did in 1979 when he, among
others, formed the Provisional IRA because the old IRA had grown weak and
tired of the military struggle.
For the moment, he has carried the day and, significantly, persuaded Martin
McGuinness, the vice-president of Sinn Fein, over to the talks process.
McGuinness is the overlord of Sinn Fein in Londonderry and thought to be the
real hard man within the IRA.
Adams was born in West Belfast in 1948. His family was steeped in
Republicanism. He was believed by the security forces to be head of the
Provisional IRA in the Ballymurphy area of West Belfast when he was interned
in 1971.
He was released in 1972 to take part in secret London talks between the
provisionals and William Whitelaw, secretary of state, which gave rise to a
brief ceasefire.
In the resumed campaign he was believed by British intelligence sources to
be Belfast brigade commander of the provisionals. He was arrested again and
released in 1976. There after he moved steadily up the hierarchy. As
president of Sinn Fein he continued the policy of the 'bullet and the ballot
box'. The military campaign would continue, but it would run in parallel
with a political campaign.
For a while it worked. In 1983 in the aftermath of the hunger strikes of
1981, Gerry Adams won the West Belfast seat at Westminster.
He refused to take the seat but used his victory to claim that Sinn Fein was
overtaking the Social Democratic and Labour party, run by the moderate John
Hume, as the true representative of the Catholic minority in the six
counties.
By the late 1980s the support had begun to wane. Gerry Adams lost his
Westminster seat in 1992.
By this time Adams had been in protracted talks with John Hume and covertly
with the British government.
It may well be that he has a sense of history and realises it is time to
talk. He is a vain man and is thought to be over-weaningly ambitious and
wants legitimate political power. He is also said to be tired of going

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Key facts you need to know - Disclosure of
Investment Charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market research was used to refine the format of the 'key features' paper
and, given that it is dealing with complex financial products, the final
version is reasonably clear, writes Alison Smith. Although each life company
will produce its own variant, regulators have been specific about what
information it must contain and how this should be presented.
The front of the four-page paper must state the aims and risks of the
policy, as well as the commitment the customer has to make. The back page
deals with more general information about the company and aspects of the
policy such as tax treatment, paying premiums, the 'cooling off' period
after the sale, and how complaints are handled.
In between, there is more detailed information about the specific policy
chosen and how it would apply in your own circumstances. Much of it comes in
a question and answer form, and it includes two tables. One shows what a
customer might get back if a policy is given up in any of the first five
years.
The second shows what a customer might get back at later stages before the
policy reaches its full term. This shows the impact of deductions to cover
commissions, administration and other charges.
The other important numbers in the paper show how the benefits would mount
up depending on different rates of investment growth; the impact of the
charges expressed in terms of reducing that yield; and the cost of being
given the advice to buy the policy.
While the figures are useful, they do carry a health warning: the investment
returns are not guaranteed. But they are not entirely notional, as they must
be based on the life insurer's own charges and not on some arithmetical
average for the sector. This makes them most valuable as a way to compare
similar policies offered by different companies, rather than as an absolute
guide to what the policy will provide.
To make the most of the information, though, you need to shop around.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Now you've a right to be told the truth -
Disclosure of Investment Charges / Alison Smith reports on the new
disclosure rules for insurance salesmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people are baffled by the intricacies of life insurance, pensions and
investment policies. But too little knowledge can lead to serious errors
when making important financial decisions. Faced with a sales agent or
adviser discussing types of investment or the merits of endowment policies,
understanding what you might be buying and its potential cost is crucial.
Now, after years of wrangling between the financial services industry and
assorted regulators, a new regime has been set up which will require sales
agents to volunteer more information about the policies they sell and how
much it costs customers to buy. It applies from tomorrow - January 1.
What difference will this make to me?
From here on, sales agents must hand over a short, stand-alone paper -
called a 'key features' document - setting out the main points of the policy
and its charges.
This should mean that customers are better able to decide if they really
want the policy - or if it is too expensive compared with the potential
benefits. And seeing in print what you get back if you surrender a long-term
policy early - often, less than you have paid in  - could make you think
again about making such a commitment.
But aren't these financial matters too difficult for anyone except actuaries
to understand?
This might be true of some products, but you do not have to be particularly
numerate to make sense of what you are told. Market research suggests that
even people who said they were not good with numbers - or found buying life
insurance nerve-wracking - could understand most of the main points in the
key features paper.
Will its figures tell me how much I will get from a policy?
No. They simply give examples of what you would get back after, say, 10
years - and assuming particular rates of growth.
What is the point of these numbers, then?
All life companies will have to use the same rates of growth for their
illustrations. So, if you are prepared to get details from several companies
instead of accepting what just one tells you, it gives you a common basis
for comparing the impact of their charges.
In practice, of course, the investment performance of different companies
varies. Doubtless, sales agents will be only too happy to explain how well
the policies they are recommending have performed in the past. But their
explanations should also make the point that past performance is no guide to
the future.
Will I get a better deal as well as more information?
It depends what you buy. The greatest emphasis has been on improving the
return to the customer with a long-term policy who gives it up after a few
years. Generally, this has meant finding ways of spreading the commission
paid for the sale more evenly over the life of the policy so that the
customer's initial payments are not so taken up just with paying for the
advice.
In some cases, as surrender values have improved, the value at full-term
also has risen. This is because the amount invested in the first years has
increased, giving a larger fund to grow over the period.
In other cases, taking lower charges out of the premiums in the early years
means that more is deducted later on, and the maturity value comes down
slightly.
Research commissioned by the regulators suggests that the new regime will
increase competition - and there are signs already that this is putting more
pressure on commissions and charges, with some life companies cutting their
margins slightly and reducing their costs.
Is it all worthwhile?
Given how commissions have risen since the end of the industry-wide
agreement about the maximum commission that could be paid, then certainly it
is an important step in the right direction.
There is another, more general, advantage as well. This new regime has been
one of the driving forces behind moves by many life companies to make their
policies more flexible and able to take account of changes in customers'
circumstances.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Trusts face disclosure crunch - Disclosure of
Investment Charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many insurance salesmen will be out and about tomorrow - January 1. But
those who are will, for the first time, have to provide clear information
about charges, risks and commission payments, writes Tim Miller.
For those involved with unit trusts, there has been a stay of execution. The
first proposals on unit trust disclosure came out in September and are being
revised in the light of industry comment. The new version is expected soon
and could come into force on July 1.
Many unit trust managers are miffed that they should be brought into line
with insurance products. They say unit trusts are transparent and the
percentage rates of charges and commissions always have been stated clearly
True. But the point is not simply to disclose facts but, rather, to
communicate clearly to prospective buyers the effect of those facts. Not
many people can do compound interest sums in their heads - which might
explain why charges and commissions have increased so markedly despite their
apparent transparency.
Until controls were lifted in 1979, a unit trust could charge a total of
13.25 percentage points over 20 years.
The rate of commission to agents was a fixed 1.25 per cent. A typical
charging structure was 3.25 per cent initial (of which the manager retained
2 per cent) and 0.5 per cent annual.
Today, a typical unit trust personal equity plan might have a 3 per cent
initial charge, all of which goes to the agent, and an annual charge of 1.5
per cent, of which 0.5 per cent is passed back to the agent as renewal
commission. In percentage points over 20 years, this adds up to 33, compared
with 13.25 under the old regime.
Of those 33 points, the manager's share now is 20 compared with 12, a
moderate increase. But the agent's share is up from 1.25 points to 13 - more
than 10 times as much.
Given reasonable performance in the underlying fund, the agent will do even
better because the 0.5 per cent renewal is calculated not on the basis of
the original investment but on its re-based value year by year.
Such generosity can be financed only by reducing the return to the investor
 -who, so far, has not had this explained properly. After July 1, however,
all should become clear.
For unit trust managers, there may well be a serious choice to be made from
July. On the one hand, there will be those with low-cost, no-commission
products selling through a small number of up-market, fee-earning IFAs.
On the other, those with high-cost renewal commission products will continue
to sell through the more traditional IFA outlets. But they will have a lot
of explaining to do.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Kim Jong-il puzzle - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When North Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty in March 1993, Kim Jong-il, the 52-year-old son and heir of President
Kim Il-sung, took public responsibility for the act that precipitated an
international crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
Analysts debated the motives behind the decision. Some believed that North
Korea was fearful that the International Atomic Energy Agency would discover
the country's nuclear weapons capability as inspections became more
intrusive.
Others saw the action as a desperate attempt by an isolated and ailing North
Korea to gain diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the US in return
for its compliance with nuclear safeguards.
Another explanation was that Kim needed to build his credibility as a strong
leader and refute criticism by domestic rivals that he was not fit to
succeed his charismatic father as the country's new head.
After 18 months of tense diplomatic brinkmanship, Kim has apparently
succeeded in achieving all these goals. Under an agreement reached with the
US in October, North Korea was promised diplomatic ties with Washington and
badly-needed energy supplies to revive its crippled economy in exchange for
dismantling its current nuclear programme and accepting safer light-water
reactors provided by an international consortium.
Moreover, North Korea won as much as five years' breathing space before the
IAEA is allowed access to several facilities that could disclose the full
extent of the country's past nuclear activity.
The deal, which was concluded three months after the death of his father,
has also bolstered Kim's reputation. But it is still uncertain why he has
not yet formerly succeeded his father as general secretary of the ruling
Korean Workers' party and national president.
North Korea is reaping other benefits from the agreement, including
exploratory visits by foreign businessmen seeking to invest in the country.
What is extraordinary is that the country, which had a very poor hand to
play, was able to gain such results. Pyongyang, using bluff and
intimidation, played on regional fears that if it was pushed too far, it
would lash out.
The US found that it lacked support from its Asian allies for a policy of
confrontation, such as economic sanctions. The only realistic alternative
was offering concessions to North Korea to persuade it to adhere to nuclear
safeguards.
Nonetheless, the nuclear deal could still become unstuck. North Korea has so
far refused to resume political dialogue with South Korea, although it
promised to do so under the accord. Pyongyang is hoping to isolate Seoul
from its US ally in the same way that South Korea successfully weakened
Russian and Chinese support for North Korea in the early 1990s. Continued
refusal to negotiate with Seoul could jeopardise the agreement.
The recent downing of a US army helicopter over North Korea has also cast at
least a temporary shadow over the deal.
More significantly, the agreement poses a potential threat to Kim's
government in spite of the gains that it offers. The infusion of foreign
investment and influence into North Korea's closed society could eventually
undermine public support for the rigidly authoritarian state. Even if the
nuclear agreement proceeds smoothly, Kim will still be engaged in a delicate
balancing act to open his country without provoking social unrest.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Rose on a mission impossible - War and
Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As he nears the end of his year-long term as the world's most visible
peacekeper, General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, is a
paradoxical figure: a daredevil soldier with a cautious view of
peacekeeping, an intellectual with some colourful swear words in his
repertoire.
The fact that he has lasted in the job for the full 12 months is itself a
formidable achievement. He is the only man to have stayed the full course in
a post which could be designed to turn the holder into a whipping boy for
all sides.
His predecessors - a Canadian, a Frenchman and a Belgian - all left Sarajevo
early, admitting their inability to cope simultaneously with the Neanderthal
brutishness of the Serb forces and the devious strategems of their enemies.
Yet General Rose, a youthful 54-year-old with ice-blue eyes, has stayed the
course, despite a whispering campaign against him in Washington, and endless
abuse from Moslem politicians in Sarajevo, where no less than eight
political parties have banded together to demand his removal.
The British officer, a veteran of more clear-cut military campaigns in
Ulster, the Falklands and the Gulf, has been excoriated by US newspaper
columnists for his reluctance to call in air power against the Serbs except
as a last resort.
But the general - acutely sensitive to criticism when he believes it to be
ill-informed - has retorted that he is in the business of peacekeeping, not
the imposition of peace by force.
'I work for peace and the people of this country, not for extreme
propagandists or politicians,' he indignantly declared after Bosnian Moslem
legislators demanded his removal.
His tasks in Bosnia - to keep 'safe areas' safe, broke and monitor truces,
and ensure the delivery of aid - are ones that have repeatedly placed him on
a collision course with local power-brokers, military and political. If they
were praising him, that would be a sign that something was wrong.
In the latest blow to its mission, the UN has seen hundreds of its men
detained for varying periods by the Bosnian Serbs, prompting even the most
sympathetic observers to wonder how long the UN mission can continue.
For his first few weeks in Sarajevo, General Rose was hailed as a local
hero, after knocking heads together and bringing an end to the siege of the
city. But since that brief honeymoon period, his task has been a thankless
one.
Where his mission works well - for example, in stopping any recurrence of
fighting between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia - the world hardly
notices. His failures - especially the recent failure to stop the Serb
encroachment on the enclave of Bihac - attract heaps of derision.
So the general, a tough-minded and sharp- tongued man who has often let his
exasperation with Bosnia's warlords show, will doubtless be relieved to pass
the baton to his successor, Major-General Rupert Smith.
General Rose is an intellectual among army officers.
He studied politics and economics at St Edmund's Hall, Oxford and learnt to
speak fluent French at the Sorbonne. Yet he has devoted much of his life to
the application of force at its most spectacular and surgical.
He made his career in the Special Air Services, the British army's elite
commando regiment, and he enjoyed the reputation of a tough-talking hawk in
both the Falklands war of 1982 and in Northern Ireland.
Before coming to Bosnia, his best known achievement was masterminding the
April 1980 operation to free 26 hostages from the Iranian embassy in London.
With the television cameras of the world looking on, a squad of SAS men
under his command killed five of the Arab terrorists who had seized the
building.
The rescue earned Rose the esteem of Margaret Thatcher, who was Prime
Minister at the time; it made such a welcome contrast to the fiasco which
befell the US air operation to rescue hostages from Tehran.
In recent weeks, the general has expressed astonishment that his erstwhile
admirer has lent her support to the arming of the Bosnian Moslems and
mounting tougher air strikes against the Serbs.
In the general's view, these moves would rebound against his soldiers: Lady
Thatcher's comments are just one more brickbat for the stoical SAS commander
to endure.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Mladic almighty - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When reading Bosnia's tea leaves, analysts tend to ask two questions. Where
is General Ratko Mladic and what does he think?
As much as he detests western observers, the Bosnian Serb commander does not
appear to have much time for local politicians either. He appears to enjoy
keeping them guessing. This may be the most innocuous of his pleasures. Over
the past 32 months of war, Mladic has gained a reputation for brutal genius,
masterminding the Serb campaign to carve out an ethnically pure state in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
His frequent disappearances have fuelled excited rumours of his death, and
raised the hopes of his outmanoeuvred Bosnian Moslem and Croat foes. Even
western newspapers have jumped the gun, carrying banner headlines reporting
the 'murder' of Mladic.
In his brash and crudely mischievous manner, the 52-year-old general shrugs
off the reports, making impromptu appearances, usually somewhere on the
front. Amid intense speculation about his split with his leadership last
April, Mladic played a flamboyant chess match with his political
counterpart, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, on the frontlines
near Gorazde. Mladic thumbed his nose at the outside world, which was
focused on Nato air strikes against Serb targets attacking the Moslem
enclave.
Nine months earlier, in flagrant defiance of a UN no-fly zone, he had flown
in a helicopter touring Serbian positions on strategic heights besieging
Sarajevo.
Adored by the Bosnian Serbs, especially by soldiers for his hardline stance,
the short and stocky Mladic regularly visits the frontlines. 'We'll never
hand over land for which Serb blood has been spilled,' he pledges by way of
explaining his refusal to meet international demands to roll back current
Serb holdings from 70 to 49 per cent of Bosnia.
Described by a UN official as a 'soldier's soldier', Mladic has spent long
evenings over dinners and rakija, home-brewed brandy, with his UN opposite
numbers in the Serb stronghold above the Bosnian capital. This cameraderie
with the man who has been named by the US as a potential war criminal has
stirred bitter comment in Sarajevo.
But the ruddy-faced general appears not to care. Earlier in the war he was
overheard ordering his men to pound Sarajevo with the largest calibre
artillery the Serb forces had.
Personal tragedies seem only to have hardened his resolve to 'completely
defeat the Moslems'. His mother was killed in the beginning of the war in a
mortar attack on the outskirts of Sarajevo. Last April, his beloved daughter
Ana, a 23-year-old medical student, committed suicide. The Serbian commander
appeared dressed in black mourning clothes during marathon negotiations
aimed at defusing the crisis round Gorazde.
Long before, Mladic was primed to seek revenge. The battle lines in 1991
gave him the chance to avenge his father's death in the second world war.
Born in the village of Bozinovici, in traditionally Serbian south-east
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Ratko was two years old when his father, a communist
partisan fighting against the Croat Ustashe fascists and the Germans, was
killed in an attack on the native village of the Ustashe leader, Ante
Pavelic.
As soon as the Serbo-Croat war broke out in 1991, Lt-Colonel Mladic was
transferred, appointed corps commander in Knin, which would be the heart of
the Serb armed rebellion against Croatian independence. In this remote
region, the loyal communist officer, who once vowed never to remove the red
star from his cap, underwent a transformation into a Serb nationalist hero,
wearing the uniform of Serbian royalist generals from the first world war.
But the cruel soldier occasionally wants to bestow what he sees as his gift
of life on Moslems or Croats. 'When I guarantee something it is the same as
the word of the Almighty,' he often says. During the mass exodus of Moslems
from the eastern enclave of Srebrenica, a man of military age was discovered
hiding among hundreds of hysterical Moslems jam-packed into a lorry. Mladic
told the terrified man: 'I will spare your life, but just remember who did
it.'

<TEXT>
It appeared at times during the past year that the South Korean president,
Kim Young-sam, was hindering, rather than helping, the process to find a
solution to the international dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme.
As the US negotiated last autumn with North Korea to persuade it to return
to the international nuclear safeguards treaty, Kim was describing as
'naive' Washington's conciliatory approach. He suggested at one point that
the troubled North Korean economy should be allowed to collapse rather than
being bolstered with international aid that would be granted in return for
Pyongyang's compliance.
The remarks by the 67-year-old president reflected the general frustration
that South Koreans felt about the subordinate role their country was forced
to play in the nuclear talks and the resulting agreement reached in October.
North Korea, which regards its southern counterpart as a 'puppet state' of
the US, had successfully demanded exclusive negotiations with Washington to
settle the issue. Seoul's participation was limited to sending an observer
to the talks in Geneva.
Seoul's exclusion from the US-North Korean talks was considered a blow to
the country's strong national pride. It was also taken as another sign that
Koreans have not yet achieved full political mastery over their divided
peninsula without meddling from outside powers. Feelings of betrayal also
affected Seoul's attitude. 'How would you like it if your best friend was
suddenly talking to your worst enemy,' said one presidential aide, referring
to the US.
Attempts by Seoul to influence the outcome also led to policy confusion.
While Kim sounded hawkish at times, he also urged Washington to resist
adopting a tough response when the US was contemplating a confrontation with
North Korea earlier in the year. Although Kim was criticised for his
inconsistent stance, his advisers contend that he was engaged in a delicate
balancing act to avoid a deep split in his own government.
He also wanted to prevent the nuclear issue leading to the possible break-up
of the ruling Democratic Liberal party, which is still dominated by allies
of the former conservative military government. 'President Kim could not
appear to be too conciliatory to the North,' said one adviser.
Kim also had to take account of public opinion. An estimated 7m South
Koreans, one-sixth of the nation's population, are either refugees from
North Korea or their descendants. Most of them are supporters of the ruling
party and harbour strong anti-communist sentiments. Moreover, Kim has
experienced the hostility of North Korea at first hand. His mother was
killed in 1960 by North Korean infiltrators when they landed on his home
island of Koje off the south-eastern coast of Korea.
By adopting a firm position on the nuclear issue, Kim has probably done much
to persuade the Korean public to accept the eventual agreement produced by
the US-North Korean talks. Although the public was initially sceptical about
the accord when it was announced in October, support for it has been
growing.
South Korea is now supporting tentative economic ties with the North by
allowing its businessmen to visit Pyongyang to discuss proposed investment
projects.
If North Korea fulfils its promise to resume dialogue with Seoul, Kim can
claim that the country has benefited from the Geneva agreement.

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Delic's ragged army - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a coalition of Moslem-Croat forces appeared to have scored stunning
gains against the Bosnian Serbs, just two months ago, it seemed that General
Rasim Delic had fulfilled his pledge to turn the tide of the war in Bosnia.
However, the taste of victory was short-lived. Delic's Bosnian government
forces were pushed back in a Serb counter-offensive backed by artillery and
aircraft.
Since his appointment as commander of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army in June
1993, Delic has been hard-pressed to change the fortunes of his out-gunned
army.
The 45-year-old general has launched two big offensives which have cost
territory and lives. Last summer, he tried to link up two Bosnian enclaves.
He dispatched 8,000 men, backed by fewer than 10 artillery pieces, according
to UN commanders. A bold offensive in northern Bosnia resulted in a
humiliating press conference in which Delic had to admit that his forces had
walked into a Serb trap.
Delic is one of a handful of ranking officers in the Bosnian Army to have
completed the commanders' training course, obligatory for making the rank of
general in the old Yugoslav Peoples' Army. He was trained as an artillery
specialist.
It is one of the cruel ironies of the war that the artillery man finds
himself commanding an army without artillery. He blames the UN arms embargo
for the failure of his forces to break the Serb grip.
Delic was still in the JNA when war broke out in Bosnia. It remains a
closely guarded secret how - already under suspicion for being Moslem - the
then Colonel Delic managed to desert his command in the JNA barracks to join
the improvised Bosnian territorial defence. From his logistics unit in
Visoko, to the north of Sarajevo, he co-ordinated the arming of his
fledgling forces.
Former JNA comrades remember him as a 'pro-Yugoslav' soldier, a compliment
considering that he now leads the enemy. Delic is credited for patching up
the alliance between Croat and Moslems, who were at war when he assumed
command of the Bosnian army. The new federation so far has paid off, helping
him to open weapons channels through Croatia.
As commander, his first task was to root out criminals in his ragged armed
forces. Many of the initial front-line defenders of Sarajevo, who roamed the
city press-ganging Serbs to dig trenches and terrorising the population at
large, were arrested. A few of the most notorious gangsters were 'shot while
trying to escape'.
He then set about trying to build a real army. Unlike his Serb counterpart,
Delic has made it clear that he obeys political directives.
The portly general is often seen strolling with his wife along the streets
of Sarajevo. This does not go unnoticed by the inhabitants, who are keenly
aware that most political and military leaders long ago sent their families
to safer destinations outside Bosnia.
In spite of his unsuccessful campaign to re-capture Serb-held territory,
Delic has vowed to free a string of towns. His native town of Celic remains
a key Bosnian-government stronghold in the north.
While pledging that his army is 'stronger every day', Delic occasionally
reveals that the odds are against his army. Asked recently why he did not
'take back Bosnia to the Drina', the river on the frontier with Serbia.
He snapped back: 'With what?'

FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Carter's peace quest - War and Peace
(Warmongers and Peacemakers) / The former president is waging a lone
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jimmy Carter is a naval engineer by training and, as such, believes there
are few problems not susceptible to a practical resolution. If, apart from
the Camp David Middle East accords, his presidency from 1977-81 was
unexceptional in its achievements, his life after the White House has
demonstrated that the peace-making fire is burning more vigorously than
ever.
It has been an extraordinary year for this independent-minded one-man moral
band. In the summer he was instrumental in defusing a US nuclear
confrontation with North Korea; in the autumn he led the US delegation that
prevented, in the 59th minute of the 11th hour, a full American military
invasion of Haiti; as winter dawned he took on the toughest problem of them
all in attempting to stop the fighting in Bosnia.
Between 1989 and 1993 he had led international election monitoring teams to
five third world countries and helped broker the settlement in Ethiopia that
led to the independence of Eritrea.
Carter brings to any negotiating table rare talents, uncomfortable as they
sometimes are to his own government and to others involved. His intellectual
grasp of the minutiae of problems and his dogged persistence in pursuit of
the goal of peace are widely admired, yet his independence and his tendency
to speak his mind can take him down roads that make both his supporters and
his critics cringe.
His technique is built on the belief that the intractable may be subject to
resolution if warring factions can somehow be assuaged, even if this means
discarding past baggage.
Thus he was complimentary about Kim Il-sung, the late North Korean dictator,
who had never heard a kind American word in 45 years; he commended Lt Gen
Raoul Cedras, leader of the Haitian junta that had so oppressed the island
nation, as a simple and honourable military man, with a rather attractive
wife to boot. Yet on both occasions his public emollience seemed to have
helped produce agreements.
This month he was so bold as to assure Radovan Karadzic, leader of the
Bosnian Serbs, who stand accused, on solid evidence, of ethnic cleansing
among other sins, that Americans had received a one-sided picture of the
nature of the Balkan conflict. This may be accurate in the literal sense but
was hardly politic and, for a man who, as president, had raised high the
banner of human rights, it had the appearance of apostasy on a grand scale.
Yet, to Carter, the dynamics of the negotiating table may have justified
such statements. Nor did he apparently allow the fact that Karadzic might
have been using him as a pawn to secure legitimacy for his own regime to get
in the way of his pursuit of the overriding goal of a ceasefire and a
negotiated settlement.
Operating from the Atlanta-based Carter Centre, a combination think-tank and
advocacy institute, the former president has a formidable network of
contacts independent of the US government. In this year's intercessions, he
acted after receiving approaches from North Koreans, Haitians and Bosnian
Serbs and not on prior commissions from Washington.
Because of this there has been tension between him and the Clinton
administration - at one stage over Haiti palpably so with his old friend
Warren Christopher, the secretary of state.
But this very willingness to take on issues that governments themselves have
failed to resolve, allied to the increasing respect in which he is held
around the world, makes him impossible to ignore.
There are those who spent the 1980s denigrating his presidency who now say,
cynically, that he is only in it for personal redemption, and perhaps the
Nobel Peace Prize. But this surely misreads the man himself.
He left the White House at the age of only 56, sound in body and mind,
deeply imbued with Christian beliefs and incapable of spending the rest of
his life on the lecturing or golf circuits, as many ex-presidents do.
What he has done at home, building low income housing, and in peacemaking
abroad has brought him not only new regard from his fellow countrymen as a
'good man' but clearly a revived purpose in life.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Five resolutions for the new year -
In the Pink / John Train has some tips on the art of successful investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN TRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Train is chairman of Montrose Advisers, investment counsel in New York.
His latest book, The Craft of Investing, has just been published by
HarperCollins.
There are no sure ways to make money on the stock market - but here are some
suggestions.
1. Watch the company, not the stock.
A stock does not flutter hither and thither like a butterfly. When a company
is prospering its profits rise, its dividends rise with them and,
infallibly, its stock will rise to follow. The question is not if, only
when, which is unimportant.
Most investors follow the prices of their stocks anxiously in the financial
pages instead of poring over each company's reports to see if its profit
margins and return on capital are staying healthy, whether it has
interesting new products coming down the pipeline, and if it is re-investing
cash flow for growth.
Some inane people hang on to a stock that fell after they bought it. Their
aim is to wait until it regains the purchase price - and then sell it. You
often hear someone say: 'I'm waiting to sell until I can get it even.'
Unfortunately, the stock does not know what you paid for it and might not
recover at all. Or, when it does, it could be a better buy - because of
re-invested earnings - than it was originally.
Women seem fond of this manoeuvre. I suspect they think of a disappointing
stock as an unfaithful lover. After disappearing for a while, it dares to
stick up its head again. 'Take that, you cur]' cries the lady, swatting it
with her handbag, so to speak.
Obviously, the limit of irrationality is to sell your stock in a good
company just because it has gone down. 2. Take the long view.
Surtout pas de zele is an excellent rule. The big money in a portfolio is
usually made by a few companies that go up and up, year after year, until
they have made their owners rich. There are exceptions but, basically,
that's how it is done.
They have to be long-term growth companies, of course, or else there is no
reason for them to go up. An easy definition of a growth company is that its
business is good enough so that it can re-invest its cash flow for an
internal rate of return of 15 or 20 per cent. That is such an attractive
proposition that its owners will not want it to pay out high dividends.
Now, there are many ways to get shaken out of a good position: the stock
seems over-priced; your broker calls with a hot tip; or you got discouraged
by dull price action. The essential fallacy, though, is to have a trading
mentality at all. Don't] You can do splendidly through inactivity within a
consistent growth philosophy.
'Market timing' rarely works. You will, probably, be out of stocks at a
major bottom when, amid universal gloom, the tremendous snap-back comes. The
Dow doubled in six weeks in the summer of 1932 as banks crumbled and brokers
falling from high windows darkened the sun.
3 Do not fret about economics.
Investors who are not informed fully on the companies in which they own
stock usually dwell instead on economics and Great Questions such as: 'Who
will win the next election?' or 'Which way will interest rates go?'
Alas, almost all Great Questions fall into one of two categories. First,
many are unknowable. Second, those that are knowable are probably factored
into the market price already.
In the course of writing books on outstanding investors, I discovered that
they rarely talk among themselves about economics or Great Questions but,
instead, almost always about specific companies. I asked Peter Lynch, the
prodigiously successful manager of the Magellan fund, how much time he spent
on economics. 'A little less than 15 minutes a year,' he answered.
Some categories of investment professional, such as Swiss bankers, are
expected to know about many stocks in each of a number of different markets.
That is an excessively difficult assignment, so they prefer to turn the
conversation to politico-economic trends in those countries. It is a way of
satisfying a client, but seldom leads to superior performance.
4. Leave currencies alone.
My clients often ask me: 'Should we buy Chilean stocks on the chance of a
revaluation in the peso?' or 'Is the yen overpriced?' Here are two thoughts.
First, for a good company, a devaluation is essentially a unilateral wage
reduction - which cannot be all bad.
How does Glen McGargle Whiskies Ltd cope with a weak pound? It maintains its
dollar price but fails to raise wages correspondingly. So, its margins and
profitability improve. The stock price should rise to offset the weaker
currency.
How about just holding cash or equivalents in the currency you think will
rise? Investors often forget that the interest rates paid on bank deposits
or short-term bonds already reflect the market's judgment of the outlook.
Suppose I think that the new Brazilian real will gain against the Argentine
peso. Fine - but the interest rate on peso bonds should be correspondingly
higher than on the real.
Over the years, I have known very few currency services offered by banks,
brokers or funds, and available to retail investors, that actually made
money over long periods.
5. Remember that investment opportunity is the difference between the
reality and the perception.
If the prevailing view of a company or a situation generally corresponds to
the truth of the matter, then there is no investment opportunity. Yet, most
people forget that and buy popular stocks in good times, which means they
pay too much.
So, for 1995, resolve to buy only stocks that are neglected or else
misunderstood for reasons that, in turn, you understand. That way, you will
seldom over-pay. The odds will be on your side.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): High hopes sag as locals remain
wary - Tokyo / Emiko Terazono reflects on a year that started well but fell
away in the second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kabuto shrine in front of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has had another bad
year. During the late 1980s, the offering box was frequently full of Y10,000
notes. But this year, as with the three before it, Y50 and Y100 coins have
been more the norm.
The god of investment does not really deserve such unkind treatment.
Investors in 1994 at least saw the Nikkei average of 225 shares gain more
than 10 per cent in local currency terms. In dollar terms, the index rose
more than 20 per cent because of the yen's appreciation against the US
currency.
It is, however, hard to ignore the fact that the Tokyo stock market failed
to reach the heights predicted by many pundits at the start of the year.
At that time, overseas fund managers hoped that an easing of government
regulation over industries, active corporate restructuring, and the easing
of short-term interest rates by the Bank of Japan would lift the economy
and, consequently, boost share prices.
Foreign funds - mainly US and European - bought a record Y3,200bn in net
terms during the January-March quarter. But Japanese investors did not
follow suit and share prices, which had risen 24 per cent in the first half,
sagged after peaking in June.
Many US and European fund managers blamed the sluggish second half on this
conspicuous lack of stock-buying by the Japanese. But they were constrained
by continuing problems with their balance sheets and profit/loss statements.
Banks, which needed to offset their losses on bad loan write-offs, sold
their long-term holdings to realise profits while manufacturing companies
also liquidated their securities portfolios to shore-up earnings.
Life assurers, the leading institutional investors, found their ability to
put money into risky investments (such as shares) limited by the falls in
value of their existing investment portfolios. Their unrealised capital
gains provided a safety margin, allowing them to take some risks, but this
safety margin contracted as the market dropped.
Indeed, the unrealised gains of the top 18 life assurance companies totalled
just Y12,500bn last year, down 72 per cent from the peak in 1988.
Most retail investors have been absent from the stock market since the
Nikkei average started its tumble in 1990. Some analysts had hoped that a
rally led by private investors - similar to that of the UK and US a few
years ago - would pull the market out of its slump, but they have stuck to
safe bank deposits.
Although the mood has improved since last month's fall in the Nikkei to a
nine-month low - triggered by the Y600bn privatisation of Japan Tobacco and
Sony having to write off losses arising from its entertainment business -
fund managers at leading life assurance companies and banks remain cautious
over equity investments.
And while the likelihood of a gradual economic recovery, a double-digit rise
in corporate profits and low inflation point to a case for buying Japan,
companies' balance sheet problems will continue to act as a drag on their
ability to take investment risks.
While a rise in corporate profits could stem the degree of profit-taking
selling by Japanese companies, most analysts believe it could take until the
latter part of the year for banks and life assurers to resume buying shares.
The compelling question is what overseas investors intend to do in 1995.
Yuichi Matsushita, an analyst at Nikko Securities, points out that although
this year's performance could have left some foreign fund managers less than
impressed, Japan - as the last major world economy to recover from recession
 -would seem to offer favourable returns with only a low degree of risk.
Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, says overseas funds remain
underweight in Japanese shares. Average weightings in Japan for UK pension
funds, for instance, were only 5.1 per cent at the end of September, while a
neutral weighting within the overall overseas equity component would have
been around 6.3 per cent.
James estimates that the underlying rate of net buying by foreign fund
managers could be around Y2,000bn next year. He argues that while they may
not increase Japanese weightings further, it is unlikely they will fail to
buy Japanese shares in 1995.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): When optimism was misplaced -
London / David Wighton looks at where the analysts got it wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a traditional Christmas game beloved of financial columnists which
consists of pointing out how wildly wrong highly-paid analysts were with
their end-of-year forecasts. This time, the results are striking.
Their predictions for 1994 were mostly way out. But had they merely repeated
their forecasts for 1993, they would have been spot on. Having been
over-cautious in 1993 they were over-optimistic in 1994.
The FT-SE 100 index closed 1994 at 3,065.50, down 10.3 per cent on the year,
but up nearly 8 per cent since the beginning of 1993.
In their defence, analysts might argue that the period between November 1993
and March 1994, in which shares rose and fell by more than 10 per cent, was
what Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, might have described as a 'blip' -
an interruption in the steadily-rising trend since sterling fell out of the
exchange rate mechanism.
The forecasters would have to admit, however, that they read the economy
wrongly. The City, and almost everybody else, under-estimated the strength
of the UK's economic recovery in 1994 and the extent to which it would be
achieved without re-kindling inflation.
It turned out that the threat to UK markets lay not at home but across the
Atlantic. Low US interest rates had generated strong economic growth in the
US and booming bond markets around the world as US funds sought out better
returns.
Given the pace of US growth, a rise in short-term interest rates was
expected widely. It was the reaction of the bond markets following the
Federal Reserve's first move in February that took most observers by
surprise.
Bond prices crumbled, driven partly by the unwinding of highly-geared,
speculative positions held by hedge funds and banks' in-house trading teams.
The UK gilts index fell by a tenth in two months and equities were dragged
down in line.
To be fair, many leading analysts downgraded their expectations swiftly as
interest rates started to rise. Nomura's Nick Knight, whose bullishness was
spot-on in 1993, turned bearish shortly after the Fed moved; by June, his
1994 Footsie forecast had been slashed from 4,000 to 3,000.
He is now one of the more bearish of market forecasters - along with Robin
Aspinall of Panmure Gordon, whose January prediction that the Footsie would
hit 2,900 at some stage during the year came true in June.
As gilts bottomed over the summer, equities staged a short-lived rally.
Both ended the year on a firmer note, but 1994 still goes down as one of the
worst years in recent memory. Including dividends, equities provided
negative returns for only the second time in the past 20 years (the other
was 1990), while the negative return on gilts of around 11 per cent was the
worst since 1974.
For equities, that came against a background of around 20 per cent growth in
earnings per share and average dividend increases of almost half that.
Dividend growth was better than expected, with cash flooding into companies'
coffers and investment remaining subdued.
Many companies found themselves with too much and decided to return some of
it to shareholders. Boots spent Pounds 500m buying back its shares, while
the regional electricity companies put a total of Pounds 1bn back into
investors' hands through buy-backs or through special dividends.
Given the strength of corporate balance sheets, bids for UK companies were
surprisingly few. Following the series of television bids - for LWT,
Central, and Anglia - and GKN's offer for Westland, activity was rather
subdued apart from the battle for VSEL and Enterprise Oil's unsuccessful
Pounds 1.45bn bid for Lasmo.
The problem initially was that the stock market was valuing companies more
highly than potential bidders. This was reflected in the many new issues as
companies (particularly former management buy-outs) that might normally have
been sold to trade purchasers floated instead. All too many rushed on to the
market - only to trip up shortly afterwards.
The fall in share prices failed to stem the flow of new issues or to fuel a
widely-expected explosion of bids. But this month's Pounds 1.2bn bid by
Trafalgar House for the Newcastle-based Northern Electric could well mark
the start of a much more active period.
The bid helped to ensure that electricity was one of the few stock market
sectors to end the year ahead. Most of the others that did so - such as oil,
mining and paper - were businesses which benefited from price increases.
Once again, small company shares outperformed large, although not by much.
During the first part of the year, small companies continued the strong
relative recovery begun in 1993. But they were left behind somewhat in the
end-of-year rally; what trading there was concentrated more on larger
stocks.
At the end of 1994, both equities and gilts are offering reasonable value by
historic standards. The yield on shares is back to 4 per cent, with another
year of strong earnings and dividend growth ahead, while 10-year gilts are
offering 8.7 per cent. That promises an attractive real return, and stiff
competition for equities, unless inflation breaks back through 4 per cent.
UK valuations also look attractive relative to the US and most continental
markets although, as 1994 showed once again, relatively cheap stocks can
easily get cheaper still.
Taking all these factors into account, we can predict confidently that the
Footsie will have regained the 3,400 mark by the end of 1995 . . . or
perhaps 1996.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Buoyant economy keeps equities
afloat - Wall Street / Patrick Harverson surveys a year in which bonds
slumped but shares held their own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been the year of the stock market crash that wasn't, and the bond
market crash that was.
Contrary to the popular belief that US equity investors had a miserable
year, 1994 was pretty good to the stock market. True, the gains in the main
indices were either modest or non-existent (the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose just over 2 per cent while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 1 per cent),
and share prices ended the year some way below their highs.
Yet, it was quite an achievement for stocks to hold their own in a year in
which a Federal Reserve, determined to prevent inflation from getting out of
hand, raised interest rates six times (on the last occasion, by a hefty
three-quarters of a point - the biggest increase in 13 years) and in which
the bond market had its worst crash in living memory.
There was a good reason, however, for investor resilience in the face of
rapidly rising rates. Throughout the year, the economy displayed remarkable
strength.
In the first three quarters, gross domestic product grew by 3.3 per cent,
4.1 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively. Analysts are expecting
fourth-quarter growth of between 3 and 4 per cent.
The surprisingly strong economy led to corporate earnings remaining buoyant
during 1994. The 900 US companies in Business Week's corporate scoreboard
reported profits growth of 15 per cent in the first quarter, 45 per cent in
the second, and 45 per cent again in the third.
Although analysts expect profits growth to have slowed in the fourth
quarter, it will not be by much.
Thus, impressive earnings and economic growth sustained the market and
investor confidence at a time when equities were under attack from rising
interest rates and the fall-out from the crash in bond prices. And what a
crash it was.
This year, 30-year Treasury bonds lost 24 per cent of their value. An
equivalent decline in the stock market would have lopped 900 points off the
Dow.
While the bond market's woes should be put in a longer-term context - this
year's slump came at the end of a decade-long bull market - it is of little
consolation to those who bought bonds at the start of the year in the hope
that fixed-income investments would match the stellar returns of 1993.
The slump in bond prices triggered a rush among investors to get out of bond
market mutual funds in 1994. Since the Fed began raising rates in February,
investors have withdrawn more money from bond funds than they have put in,
and in increasingly large amounts.
In November (the latest month for which data is available), bond fund
outflows totalled Dollars 10.9bn, the highest figure on record. But flows
into stock funds held up relatively well this year, which makes sense given
the performance of equities.
There was not a single month in 1994 in which sales of stock funds exceeded
purchases, although sales in November were the lowest since August 1991.
Sales are expected to have risen in December when the market staged a late,
but quite effective, year-end rally.
That money continued to pour into stock funds - to the tune of about Dollars
10bn a month - was not due just to strong economic and earnings growth.
Demand for equity mutual funds remained healthy in part because of changing
demographic and investing trends in the US.
The number of Americans in their 40s and early 50s is growing as the 'baby
boomers' of the 1950s and 1960s reach middle age. And they have been
investing in stock funds over the long term to provide a future income
stream to pay for educating their children and making provision for their
own retirements.
Fund managers believe that the billions of dollars which this generation has
invested in stock mutual funds in the past few years will not be dislodged
easily. A 1 per cent decline in the S&amp;P 500 was certainly not going to do
it.
This year also saw the return of the big corporate deal: Wall Street's
mergers and acquisitions specialists had not been this busy since the boom
days of the 1980s.
Corporate titans as diverse as Bell Atlantic, American Home Products, Eli
Lilly and Viacom all completed billion-dollar takeovers which made many
investment bankers - and many shareholders - very happy.
Yet, perhaps the most extraordinary statistic of 1994 emerged in the last
few days of the year.
This week, the New York Stock Exchange announced that, for the first time in
its long history, more than 1bn shares of a listed company were traded in a
year. And what was the name of that company? IBM? General Motors? AT&amp;T?
No, it was Telmex, also known as Telefonos de Mexico, the giant Mexican
telecommunications group. If ever proof was needed of how global the
financial markets have become, this surely was it.

Tomorrow marks the start of a new year. What will it hold for investors  -
prosperity or another dose of financial gloom? Will 1995 be, for instance:
The year in which the dollar dies?
The year when investors begin to take Russia seriously as the cheapest of
the emerging markets?
The year of the corporate merger?
Those are just three of the predictions from our panel of forecasters: two
fund managers, two conventional strategists, one technical analyst and a
stock market historian. We asked each to guess the end-1995 level for a
number of stock market indices and several key rates.
All expect US and UK interest rates to rise over the year, but those who
expect only a minor up-tick in UK inflation also expect only a minor rise in
UK base rates. And although some are predicting further falls in gilts, no
one expects another massive setback. All are predicting a recovery in UK
equities, with the Footsie finishing anywhere between 3,200 and 3,700.
Recoveries in the Japanese stock market and emerging markets are also common
ground - although, again, views on the extent differ. The hardest market to
call has been Wall Street, perhaps because it has shown such puzzling
stamina in 1994. Their predictions are summarised on page 4.
Michael Hart, the chairman of investment management group Foreign &amp;
Colonial, is modestly optimistic about most markets. He says:
Probably the most important factor of all is what happens to the US economy.
My belief is that the high real interest rates experienced for some time
now, and the rises likely in the next month or so, will slow down the
economy by mid-year. The dollar should have a better year.
Inflation will be the key. Valuations are not too demanding if investors can
look forward to steady economic growth, low inflation, stable interest rates
and improving corporate profits.
A recession is unlikely until mid-1996 at the earliest. The stock market has
not been down in a pre-election year for 55 years.
The forecast of a 10 per cent rise for the UK market is based on the belief
that growth is likely to slow and interest rates will not be forced up to
panic levels by either internal or external forces.
The outlook for corporate profits and dividends remains good as the benefit
of higher volumes and productivity improvements come through. The market is
cheap on current estimates of 1995 and 1996 earnings, although the
Conservative party's prospects appear bleak and a Labour government probably
has not been fully discounted.
The reasons for assuming that the Japanese market will rise are:
1. The economy is steadily recovering and growth in 1995 is expected to be
ahead of that for 1994.
2. Profits are also recovering: 25 per cent increases are possible in the
manufacturing sector.
3. Inflation should remain low; thus, there should be no particular pressure
on long-term bond rates.
4. Imports are now growing strongly, which should help to stabilise the yen
and avoid trade friction with the US.
5. There are also some signs that Japanese institutions are beginning to
commit money into the market.
My forecast of a rise of more than 20 per cent for emerging markets is based
on Europe and Japan stepping up imports, and an eventual slowdown in the US.
Most of these markets are expected to perform well, but the most compelling
valuations are to be found in Latin America.
1995 will be the year when investors began to take Russia seriously as the
cheapest of the emerging markets.
David Rough, Legal &amp; General group director (investments), is the other fund
manager on our panel. He is more worried about the possibility of a hard
landing in the US than Hart, but remarkably sanguine about the medium-term
outlook for the UK. He says:
Expect a further monetary tightening around the world as governments seek to
curb any emerging signs of a pick-up in inflation.
With the UK in the vanguard of recovery, domestic interest rates have
bottomed already and begun the move upwards. But even with further interest
rate increases in prospect, the UK can continue to expect steady growth
through to the end of the century without a damaging rise in inflation.
US inflation is more of a worry, even though US interest rates started to
move upwards many months earlier than in the UK. Consequently, the
continuing risk of a hard landing in the US is significantly depressing all
world markets.
The Japanese economy is more reassuring with a pick-up in growth expected
following recent sluggishness.
Continued acceleration by the German economy could weaken the recovery of
the rest of Europe but the UK will be largely insulated from the impact of
any German rate rises because our recovery is already well-established.
The emerging economies are, therefore, the most likely to suffer from any
further rises in US interest rates or a slowdown in US growth rates. The
1994 crash in world bond markets probably went too far. Although it may be
too early yet to predict a bull market in bonds, it looks as if the worst
has been seen already. But, overall, we still prefer equities to bonds.
1995 will be remembered as the year of the corporate merger, with major
deals across many industrial and financial sectors.
Michael Hughes, head of global economics and investment strategy at BZW, is
the more optimistic of our two strategists and expects anyone with an
internationally diversified portfolio to make a modest but real capital gain
in 1995. He says:
Economies rather than markets won the competition for funds in 1994.
Liquidity was the key factor. The global recovery strengthened but sapped
the available savings, with the result that markets fell. Although this
shake-out has improved the valuations of many markets, few would appear to
offer exceptional value.
The UK is not one of them, although we feel that the equity market will
benefit from the strengthening dollar and exposure to economic recovery in
Europe. Corporate mergers and acquisitions could also propel prices. Higher
domestic UK interest rates will, however, limit the adjustment of gilt
yields despite an improving budget deficit.
Most progress during the early months may be concentrated on Japan, where
the economic recovery at least appears to be materialising as the yen falls.
But this will take time, so the expected improvement in Japanese equities
should be reasonable rather than exceptional.
The recovery in Europe seems likely to gain momentum but, in the Anglo
markets, the peak of the economic growth cycle may have been achieved by the
end of 1994. Judging the timing and degree of the economic slowdown, should,
therefore, take over as a market pre-occupation.
We do not fear huge inflationary pressures at the consumer level. We are
looking for a peak US inflation rate of 4 per cent, which would suggest that
Fed funds may need to reach 7 per cent.
For the year ahead, we would expect a global balanced fund to gain by around
12 per cent, which is modest by comparison with the exceptional period in
the late '80s but very respectable against the background of 4 per cent
inflation.
This will be remembered as the year . . . when the Franc fort policy tying
the French franc with the DM is deemed no longer to be feasible nor
desirable.
Nicholas Knight, deputy managing director of Nomura Research, was
outstandingly bullish a year ago. Now, he is outstandingly cautious. He
says:
Stop-go-stop is likely to be the UK government's tactics for 1995 through
1997. This prognosis is not good for financial markets. Tight fiscal policy
and higher base rates in 1995 will kill growth faster than currently
expected, and cause downward revisions to corporate earnings estimates.
Gilts will take no comfort; fear of a big pre-election bribe, therefore,
could force gilt yields higher even if inflation remains low in the short
term.
In these circumstances, the equity market looks vulnerable, especially in
the first half. If 1995 is indeed a 'slowdown' year in a cyclical context,
valuations are still dangerously high. With UK institutions more interested
in gilts, retail investors more interested in cash and overseas investors
returning home, buy-backs and bids will be insufficient to drive the market
dramatically higher. Indeed, it could go lower, perhaps, if international
influences are as negative as we think. Higher short rates in the US,
therefore, may spark a consolidation phase for the US equity market as money
flees to the safety of cash deposits. Such has been the flood of American
money overseas in recent times that all equity markets, not just the Dow,
will feel the draught.
1995 will be remembered as the year when cyclical optimism about budget
deficits gave way to secular pessimism.
Robin Griffiths, technical analyst at research house James Capel, who warns
that he only makes year-end forecasts for fun, expects world markets to
touch bottom late in February, roughly a year after they peaked. He says:
The trend for the current year has been negative for bonds and equities all
around the world, and this will continue into the new year. Our models
indicate a low in late February to early March. We could see the FT-SE 100
at 2,680 by then. The US Dow might get to 3,200. But unless a depression
starts - there is a risk, but we bet against it - the rest of the year
should see earnings recover and stocks rise. If that is accompanied with
inflation, then equities rise a lot.
This year's down-trends will continue to late February 1995. Then, we get a
positive reversal. By then, the US Fed will have raised rates enough to have
cooled the economy without killing it and the growth in earnings will then
be able to drive equities ahead. Later, the dollar will end its rally and
become weak.
The dollar has actually been in a down-trend for 25 years but has still been
thought of as the main reserve currency. During this year, it will be
downgraded and no longer used as the dominant unit of account. The yen will
dominate the Pacific region and the D-mark or Ecu will dominate Europe.
This is the year in which the dollar will die.
David Schwartz, a stockmarket historian, is a one-man band - unlike the rest
of our panel. He says:
The critical issue that will drive stock market prices up is the next US
presidential election, due in 1996. The year preceding an election has been
a constant winner for UK shareholders since 1951. The average pre-election
year profit was over 20 per cent.
Because the stock market anticipates the real economy, it is good to own
shares in the preceding calendar year. Since 25 per cent of all FT-SE 100
company profits emanate from the US, UK investors benefit from this US
domestic issue.
1995 will be remembered as the year the UK stock market scaled a 'wall of
worry'.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Tut, tut, another lovely war: War and Peace (The next 50
years: local wars or global threat?) - Joe Rogaly on the sad truths and
tragedies which those who shirk armed conflict must recognise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
In the west we think differently about everything now, particularly about
war and peace. Differently? In just a handful of years we have moved from
terrified to dangerously complacent. The present century has been the
bloodiest yet; before it was half way through millions of people, soldiers
and civilians alike, had died in the two most horrendous conflicts in
recorded history. Yet memories of both are fading.
That is only half the story. During the 45 years following the end of the
second world war many, perhaps most of us, lived in trembling or fatalistic
anticipation of a third, final, thermonuclear, Gotterdammerung. Now the dark
mushroom cloud of foreboding, which dominated our thoughts for so long, has
vanished.
A fundamental transformation of the global outlook is proceeding, and at a
dizzying pace. In just a few months, on May 8, VE day, the Atlantic
community will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the second great
war in Europe. Shortly afterwards, in August, most countries will
commemorate the end of the war in the Pacific, VJ day. Perhaps that is an
inadequate sobriquet, for the victory over Japan was the first and so far
the only occasion on which the atom bomb was deployed in anger. Can we
really believe that the nuclear weapon will never be used again? That sounds
like tempting fate.
Yet something final, a drawing of a line, may be achieved by ritual
recognition of the passage of half-a-century since the first VE and VJ days.
The youngest of the combatants able to fight in the 1939-45 war are
approaching 70 years of age; when the newborns of 1995 reach maturity there
will be hardly any second world war veterans left.
Total war, the mobilisation of entire nations, the willingness of dictators
to sacrifice their own people, is no longer in prospect in the rich,
developed countries of the world. The very concept belongs to the nightmare
decades, the 1930s and 1940s. Future generations will not carry the European
wars in their imaginations, as many of us, the passing throng, still do.
As to the next 50 years, prediction is a mug's game. Yet it is possible to
build a case for optimism. Since November 9, 1989, when the Berlin Wall
fell, it has been a comfort to reflect that the threat of mutual
annihilation implicit in the cold war was itself a guarantor of peace.
Neither the Soviet Union nor the US was willing to provoke the other to the
extent that nuclear rockets would be fired. There were localised battles,
such as in Korea and Vietnam, but these were expressions of the cold war,
complicated by anti-colonialism. Globally, the bomb kept the peace.
The subsequent disintegration of the USSR has been accompanied by a
fragmentation of western strategic thinking. Initially some of us settled
into the consoling thought that if there was to be a single superpower, none
could be more benign than the US. Uncle Sam had looked after Europe for 50
years; the world would henceforth be a safer place under a Pax Americana.
The view seemed to be vindicated when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.
President Bush, his resolve stiffened by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
assembled a mighty multinational fighting force under the UN flag. With the
use of 'smart' weapons it minimised its own casualties and achieved its
stated objective, the withdrawal of Iraqi soldiers to their home territory.
The Pax Americana ended there. The unstated aim of the Gulf force, the
overthrow of president Saddam, was not achieved. Subsequent peacekeeping
expeditions in Somalia and Rwanda likewise failed, despite the deployment of
US troops in the first instance and US logistical support in the second. As
to former Yugoslavia, the initial American view was that this was a European
war, a test-bed of the unity of purpose of the member-states of the European
Union.
In the event, Bosnia has been the quagmire into which all pretensions have
sunk. The UN is exposed as at worst harmful to the interests of the
populations it was sent to protect, at best ineffective. Nato, which still
seeks a post-cold war reason for its existence, has been revealed as what it
has become: an ageing eunuch. Britain and France, the leading suppliers of
UN troops, have been held hostage by the expansionist Serbs. Germany and the
US, original occupants of the moral high ground, sent no troops of their own
but helped tangle the EU and the others in arguments about aims, objectives,
the means of reaching them, and how much Moslem land would buy off the
aggressors.
Those who argued at the very beginning that the UN ought to go into former
Yugoslavia with a force as strong as that deployed in the Gulf, or not at
all, have been proved correct. The troops who were sent, some of whom have
given their lives, have been increasingly frustrated in their efforts to
provide humanitarian aid. Bosnia has revealed the impotence of the post cold
war international community.
This, you might ask, is the case for optimism? The answer depends upon where
you are sitting. If it is in a rich country, the TV ahead of you, food and
drink by your side, you may not feel directly threatened by the few wars
that flicker across the screen, not the ones adumbrated above, not Bosnia,
not the Russian bombing in Chechnya, not any of the other 30 or so
untelevised but nevertheless real armed conflicts listed by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, Sipri.
These are in remote places, many in poor countries. If a camera crew is
sent, you might wince at what is shown and cry 'something must be done', but
most of us are unlikely to support anything bearing a price calibrated in
our own blood, or that of our children. As to money, our consciences allow
for donations, but not too much.
This picture is consonant with the much-criticised thesis adumbrated by
Francis Fukuyama in a book entitled The end of history and the last man
(1992). The essence of Mr Fukuyama's case is that democracies do not go to
war with one another, and that, since liberal democracy is spreading, the
risk of war is diminishing. A variant of the Fukuyama theme, by Max Singer
and Aaron Wildavsky, divides the world into stable, wealthy democracies and
the rest. The former are peaceful, the latter not. Other specialists in
global prognostication have written along similar lines.
Common sense suggests that the general proposition may be correct, at least
for the next decade or so. Voters in democracies have a say over whether
they, or their sons and daughters, may be used as cannon-fodder. They will
pay for wars when there is a direct threat to their own nation, but rarely
otherwise. The triumph of the free market, of economic liberalism, may have
resulted in the replacement of nationalistic fervour by a preoccupation with
creating wealth.
In some areas, according to Lawrence Freedman, writing in Brassey's Defence
Yearbook, 1994, the liberal economic order 'can channel old rivalries into
creative competition and though it can also spark disputes, the context
tends to be one in which military instruments appear inappropriate'.
Professor Freedman, head of the department of war studies at King's College,
London, warns that this does not guarantee stability.
He must be right, yet the initial proposition stands. The prosecution of
mercantile interests by the sword has become irrational since the followers
of Adam Smith convinced us that international trade can benefit all
participants. The Anglo-American drive towards minimalist government
elevates the pursuit of comparative economic advantage above dreams of
empire, or conquest of neighbouring territories. The near-universal
unpopularity of elected politicians may protect us from the dangers of
finding ourselves in thrall to a manic leader, prone to warmongering.
Such arguments may assure the TV viewer in the developed world. It does
nothing for the victims of the many extant wars noted by Sipri. The
institute's 1995 list, recording conflicts in 1994, is in preparation. It
seems that renewed fighting in the Yemen will be added to the roll, while
South Africa, Northern Ireland, Georgia, Croatia, and the Kurdish north of
Iraq may be on their way to reclassification as peaceful.
Sipri recognises all conflicts in which 1,000 or more deaths have been
caused. In some, such as Afghanistan, more than a million people have been
killed; in most others the casualties are measured in tens of thousands. Yet
the developing regional pattern supports the peace-through-democracy thesis.
South and central America, in which liberal democracy is spreading rapidly,
may fall right off the Sipri tables within a year or two.
The danger spots are, unsurprisingly, parts of the former Soviet Union,
parts of Africa and the Middle East. As to the last, the US will presumably
intervene if oil supplies are threatened, or if Saddam foolishly tries to
invade Kuwait again or, in theory, if Israel's existence is imperilled. In
each case the US president would be under strong domestic pressure from
economic or political interest groups. He might be obliged to act, and even
the present neo-isolationist Congress would find it difficult to withhold
its consent.
That, however, is it. Expect nothing more from the US, and less from the
Europeans. When other local conflicts occur we are likely to see more
hand-wringing, more conferences of this or that European, Asian, or global
security organisation, but little that actually helps to end the fighting.
Most of the world's small wars are internal battles between insurgents and a
government, or between rival ethnic claimants to territory. The idea that
the UN, or anyone else, should intervene in such cases is relatively new.
Yet when people are starving, or ethnic cleansing is used as a euphemism for
genocide, the natural human urge to aid the victims is intense.
The need for rescue is especially great in Africa, where post-colonial
bloodletting is not yet over. Some see no relief to the gloom. Robert
Kaplan, writing in the February issue of the Atlantic Monthly, argued that
West Africa 'is becoming the symbol of worldwide demographic, environmental,
and societal stress, in which criminal anarchy emerges as the real
'strategic' danger'. Mr Kaplan, who is expanding his article into a book,
apparently sees the continent retreating into chaos, internecine strife, and
bloody anarchy.
Carol Lancaster has challenged this apocalyptic vision. Writing for the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, the deputy administrator of
the US Agency for International Development points out that many states in
Africa suffer from rapid population growth, environmental degradation and
poverty but do not collapse into ungovernability. The reason is that they
are better governed than others. She cites Botswana and Ghana.
Even if Lancaster is right, Kaplan's imagination stretches beyond West
Africa. He is one among many who regard the dangers facing the developing
countries as global threats. Rootless gangs, perhaps financed by drug sales,
may become international terrorists. One or another such group may
eventually acquire a nuclear weapon. This possibility can only be shrugged
off by the complacent.
A conference on the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of
1970 is due next year. What should it decide? Ryukichi Imai, professor of
social sciences at Kyorin University describes the potential for the
acquisition or manufacture of nuclear weapons by small countries.
Writing in the Japan Review of International Affairs, he seems to envisage a
super-NPT, imposing conditions beyond 'the normal stipulation of arms
control measures . . . far beyond voluntary restraints on export control of
sensitive technologies'.
There are other possible causes of conflict. The southern border of the US
and the southern and eastern borders of the EU are increasingly firmly
policed. President Clinton's intervention in Haiti was partly a defence
against an influx of destitute boat people. Migration from poor countries to
their rich neighbours could lead to other such actions or, worse, to the
emergence of xenophobic, non-democratic governments.
In sum, sitting back and tut-tutting about the tragedies of the insecure
quarters of the globe is profitable short-term politics. That is all that
can be said for it.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Unfinished business poses threat - Lingering
problems from 1994 could spell danger next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with the frothiness of 12 months ago, the securities markets are
starting this new year on a much more even keel. So, I would see 1995 as a
year of fluctuations, rather than one with any pronounced trend.
These are hazardous times for forecasters, though - especially forecasters
of economies. Last year, economic growth overshot expectations in most
countries outside Japan and inflation, in an entirely uncorrelated (even
contradictory) way, provided a surprise by undershooting.
We cannot be at all confident that established economic models will tell us
anything helpful about what will happen in 1995. At present, the consensus
is that the pace of economic growth in the US and UK, at least, will
moderate. That could be wishful thinking, but I shall use it as a working
hypothesis. If, on the other hand, growth is sustained or even accelerates,
then overheating will become an increasingly urgent issue.
In any event, short-term interest rates are going up. In the US, I expect
money market rates to go to 7 per cent during the first half of the year.
They will continue to rise in the UK as well and will embark on a rising
phase of the cycle in Germany. Rising short-term interest rates always
create difficulties for the long-term markets in bonds and equities, and
there are particular structural hazards this time.
In this sense, the main dangers in 1995 could well arise from the unfinished
business of 1994. The unwinding of speculative excesses in the bond markets
has not been completed satisfactorily.
Certainly, we must assume that rising interest rates will uncover some
further horror stories in proprietary trading and corporate treasury
mismanagement. Moreover, they will put increasing pressure on US mutual fund
cash flows, which went negative for bond funds months ago but have showed
signs of doing the same for stock funds only recently.
Repatriation of US capital has caused problems for many stock markets around
the globe in recent weeks, with a flurry of redemptions in Latin America
within the past few days. For the moment, however, this has conferred safe
haven status on Wall Street itself. But Wall Street could find 1995 more
difficult.
The long-term strategic problem remains that of the combination of dangerous
financial imbalances in the US - now toying with the alarming and wholly
inappropriate possibility of tax cuts - with the financial insecurity of
Japan, where investors are hoarding yen rather than mopping up the glut of
dollar securities. This produces a structurally weak dollar and the constant
danger of a surge in US Treasury bond yields.
Still, Wall Street appears to have come back from the edge of a precipice
within the past few weeks. For the third year running, the US stock market
has displayed astonishingly low volatility in 1994, while bonds have
fluctuated wildly. But Wall Street is surely headed for a more serious
setback some time in 1995.
In sharp contrast, the UK economy appears better balanced than for many
years. A massive transfer of resources is under way, from the personal
sector into company profits and higher government net revenues.
Over the past two years, company profits have jumped by 27 per cent while
real personal disposable incomes have climbed by just 1.7 per cent. People
hate it, but the shifts could persist for another year - until, finally, the
government starts to panic about the imminent electoral consequences.
For the UK's equity market, these changes are generating a benign framework
in which the stock market's basic arithmetic is looking better all the time.
True, the numbers looked more favourable before the Christmas rally and the
All-Share dividend yield dipped below 4 per cent at one stage this week -
awkward when gilt-edged yields have drifted back up to 8.7 per cent. But the
company sector is cash-rich and dividends have risen by 8 per cent over the
past year, with the good prospect of at least the same again in 1995.
Equities are, therefore, priced rather less tightly against long gilts, and
an index-linked gilt yield of 3.9 per cent, than they have been, at times,
in the past year. The prospective yield ratio, 12 months out, could be about
2. All the same, shares will need assistance from a reasonable bond market
if they are to perform positively.
My general reason for caution - although not pessimism - about 1995 is that
we are now moving towards the later stages of the economic cycle in which
stock markets tend to encounter financial pressures, encouraging shares to
become rather cheap.
I have two specific reasons as well. The profits boom looks anomalous in the
face of comparatively weak domestic demand, and could lead to competition
becoming more intense. That could undermine the market's present earnings
per share projection as rates of increase fall off disappointingly in the
second half of the year.
Second, political tensions may well rise during 1995. The possibility that
the UK government might fall in some unscheduled crisis during the coming
year is not factored properly into the market. In any case, the possibility
of a Labour victory late in 1996 or early 1997 is bound to become a more
obvious drag on market values by the end of 1995.
If it is a problem for gilts, it will be a problem for equities, too. And
gilt-edged will have to face the prospect of a government seeking popularity
desperately in 1996. On the other hand, political uncertainty could hold
back sterling - whereas, otherwise, sterling strength would be my suggestion
for the biggest potential financial surprise for 1995 (if that is not too
much of a contradiction in terms).
From the point of view of a UK stock market investor, 1995 seems likely to
bring a contrast between domestic corporate sector optimism and increasing
tensions in the global capital markets. Both bulls and bears may, at
different times, have cause to feel satisfaction.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Czech phone group ousts chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's national telephone
operator, has been deposed in a row over a contract for telephone cards, as
international buyers compete for a 27 per cent stake in the company.
Mr Jiri Makovec was ousted as chairman and from his executive board seat
after he lost a company supervisory board confidence vote instigated by the
privatisation ministry. The board passed the motion after it considered
newspaper allegations that he awarded the lucrative telephone card contract
to Augustus, a company in which Mr Pavel Lintymer, described as a close
friend of his, is a big investor.
As general director, Mr Makovec combined the roles of SPT chairman and chief
executive. It is understood that, stripped of his other offices, he will
remain chief executive until a board meeting early in the new year considers
the matter further. No replacement as chairman was immediately announced.
International telecommunications groups bidding for the stake in SPT, worth
up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), said yesterday the controversy was unlikely
to affect the timetable for the tender. An executive at one bidder said Mr
Makovec had had little or no role in developing the strategy for the sale,
which is being supervised by the economy ministry and J P Morgan, the US
investment bank.
The government has said it will announce the winner of the tender in March.
Ten international companies from Europe and the US are vying for the stake
in what is expected to be eastern Europe's biggest telecommunications deal
so far. They include AT&amp;T and Ameritech of the US, Deutsche Telekom, PTT
Nederland, Italy's Stet, TeleDanmark, and a consortium grouping France
Telecom and Bell Atlantic.
The remaining 26 per cent of SPT's shares have been sold to Czech citizens
and investment funds and will be distributed soon.
The move to oust Mr Makovec must be approved at a shareholders' meeting
within two weeks. This is thought to be a formality, as the state currently
owns 74 per cent of SPT. Ten of the supervisory board's 15 members are
state-appointed, and the no-confidence motion is understood to have been
approved by a substantial majority.

FT  31 DEC 94 / West criticises Russia over Chechnya assault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Russian government is facing an increasing barrage of international as
well as domestic criticism over its strong-arm tactics in the breakaway
Chechnya region.
In remarks to be published today in the German daily Berliner Zeitung, Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, says: 'The methods which the Russian
government is using to try to resolve the conflict are cause for the utmost
concern.'
In Washington, the state department for the first time directly criticised
Russian tactics. Urging an end to attacks on civilians, it said the US was
'deeply disturbed' by reports of the bombing of an orphanage in Grozny, the
Chechen capital.
A Chechen official meanwhile warned that a blaze at an oil refinery on the
edge of the capital Grozny, set alight by the Russian bombardment, could
spread to a nearby storage facility containing 5,000 tonnes of ammonia. This
threatened environmental catastrophe across the Caucasus, he said. The
Russian ministry for emergency situations said the fire threatened only
those living in the 'near vicinity'.
Renewed fighting left at least two Russian soldiers dead.
The Russian government seemingly spurned an offer of a new year ceasefire
from Mr Dzhokar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, who declared independence
from Moscow three years ago. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister,
reiterated Moscow's message that force was the only way to solve the crisis.
'We are in a situation where there is no other choice,' he said, claiming
that any other democratic state would behave in the same way.
The use of force was again condemned in Moscow yesterday when Mr Leonid
Petrovsky, a communist member of the Russian parliament's human rights
committee who has just returned from Grozny, said military action threatened
'the direct destruction of the Russian state'.
The Women of Russia parliamentary faction also said it had been inundated
with messages from soldiers' relatives urging a peaceful solution to the
crisis.
In further criticism from abroad, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, a US-based
organisation which monitors compliance with the human rights obligations
enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Accords, protested that Russia was violating
its international obligations under the Geneva Conventions, which protect
civilians in armed conflicts.
Some Russian officials privately fear a continued conflict in Chechnya might
tarnish Russia's image abroad, jeopardising its chances of receiving a
substantial aid package from the International Monetary Fund.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Flat year for house prices forecast by lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices will not recover significantly in 1995 because of government
plans to restrict mortgage interest payments for those on income support,
the Council of Mortgage Lenders says today.
In a gloomy forecast for next year, the council says measures in the Budget
last month to cut help for unemployed home-owners have introduced 'a new
uncertainty and nervousness' into the market. By the end of 1995, it expects
house prices to be just 2 per cent higher than now.
It anticipates house sales will rise by less than 5 per cent to 1.325m in
1995 compared with about 1.28m this year. However, net new lending for homes
next year is expected to reach Pounds 22bn - an increase of about 13 per
cent on estimates for this year.
The importance of the mortgage benefit cuts, to be implemented from the
start of next October, is that they will probably mean lenders will be more
cautious about taking on new business.
Potential borrowers may also be deterred by the restrictions: they include
reduced benefits for new claimants with mortgages, and no mortgage interest
entitlement for the first nine months of a claim for new claimants who have
taken out loans after the start of next October.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies
and other lenders, is more optimistic about the prospects for 1996, however.
It believes that once the impact of the mortgage benefit changes has been
absorbed, more positive underlying factors such as rising real incomes and
stable interest rates will come to the fore. It forecasts that base rates
will be 7.5 per cent by the end of 1995 compared with 6.25 per cent today.
The uncertainties that would come from another flat year like 1994 for the
housing market, as the council predicts, were highlighted yesterday in
figures for monthly mortgage lending by the larger British banks.
These showed that new lending in November was slightly higher than in
October, but still less than in November last year.
New gross lending totalled Pounds 1.67bn (increased by the inclusion of
Pounds 100m of mortgages transferred from a non-bank source) in November,
compared with Pounds 1.54bn in October and Pounds 1.59bn in November last
year.
New net lending last month was Pounds 736m, compared with Pounds 576m the
previous month and Pounds 819m in the equivalent month in 1993. New loans
approved but not yet undertaken slipped to a value of Pounds 1.47bn compared
with Pounds 1.42bn in October.

FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japan's current account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus should shrink in coming years. The yen's appreciation
will make exports increasingly expensive. Imports should rise as the economy
recovers and products arrive from factories recently built elsewhere in Asia
by Japanese companies. But the current account surplus is likely to remain
contentiously large. Japan's net foreign asset position should surpass
Dollars 800bn in the next 12 months and could rise above Dollars 1,000bn by
the end of the century. This means that net income could rise from about
Dollars 40bn to as much as Dollars 90bn by the year 2000, rather than the
figure of Dollars 1000bn erroneously mentioned in Thursday's Lex Column.

FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Power generators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The forthcoming sale of the government's remaining 40 per cent stake in
National Power and PowerGen contains two investment banking novelties.
First, the number of banks appointed to market the Pounds 4bn offer is
limited to 17, compared with around 60 when the third tranche of British
Telecom shares was sold last year. Second, the so-called pre-marketing
exercise - the time spent canvassing potential investors ahead of the formal
book-building process - has been carefully structured. With British Telecom
last year, the global co-ordinator conducted the bulk of the pre-marketing
on its own. This time each of the 17 banks will be given the opportunity to
pitch to favoured clients.
The innovations are devised by joint global co-ordinators BZW and Kleinwort
Benson Securities and are modelled partly on practice in recent French
privatisations. They are designed to create what bankers call 'demand
tension' - the broadest and deepest possible demand for the new shares. The
mechanisms should be effective doing this, thus meeting the Treasury's aim
of achieving the highest price for the shares. The limited number of
syndicate members, including some niche players like Argentaria and
Mediobanca as well as global investment banks such as Merrill Lynch or
Goldman Sachs, gives each institution large potential rewards and thus clear
motivation to market the issue aggressively. This was not the case with the
third tranche of BT shares: it is thought that more than 90 per cent of the
shares were placed by fewer than 10 of the 60 syndicate members, suggesting
that many did not try hard to sell shares.
The formalised pre-marketing procedure will also help motivate the syndicate
members. They will have to compete among themselves for the right to make
presentations to given clients, but, having jumped through this hurdle, they
are likely to win the lucrative buying business from those clients when the
book-building gets under way.

FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK governance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The focus of the Cadbury committee's proposals was enhancing management
accountability to shareholders. This has led to tangible improvements in
corporate governance in the UK, for example a new and welcome emphasis on
the role of non-executive directors. But it is time for the new Cadbury
committee - due to be constituted early in 1995 - to investigate the
responsibilities of shareholders as companies' owners.
Directors are entitled to feel aggrieved about a vast increase in their
responsibilities - most recently requiring them to pass judgment on the
efficacy of internal financial controls - when there has been no
corresponding increase in shareholders' commitment to companies. Even if
they complain in private about issues such as executive pay, UK
institutional investors are reluctant to vote at annual and extraordinary
general meetings. The implication is that they prefer to respond to problems
at a company by selling their shares. This is easier and less time-consuming
than involving themselves directly in a company's affairs by voting. The
reluctance to vote on contentious issues also reflects a conflict of
interest. Institutions are afraid of offending executive directors who, as
trustees, award the mandates which are a fund managers' life-blood.
The solution would be to take a page out of US legislation, and require
pension fund managers to exercise their votes. The current Pensions Bill
would present an excellent opportunity for the necessary legislative change.
As a quid pro quo, investors should lobby the government to change the
Companies Act so as to require companies to disclose fuller information on
directors' compensation packages.

FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: French fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French markets were supposed to pick up this year, as they benefited from
economic recovery and low inflation and interest rates. But the CAC-40 has
underperformed the DAX by 7 per cent and the FT-SE 100 by 9 per cent. French
10-year bonds were yielding less than German bunds in January, but now yield
60 basis points more. This week the franc hit a 13-month low against the
D-Mark.
In theory, the markets should, at last, stage their recovery during 1995.
The economy is making reasonable progress, with industrial production up
about 2 per cent. Inflation, at only 1.6 per cent, does not appear an
immediate problem, particularly as capacity utilisation is limited to 83 per
cent.
But prospects, at least for early in the year, are not propitious. French
markets, like those in Spain and Italy, are overshadowed by the threat of a
rise in German interest rates. For the franc fort policy to be defended, any
increase in Germany would need a compensatory rise in France. That could
stifle French economic growth at a time when there is no inflationary threat
and hit the equities market which has already discounted strong earnings
expansion.
In any case, the markets are unlikely to move forward until April because of
the presidential elections. The decision by Mr Jacques Delors, the franc
fort's strongest supporter, not to run for office has contributed markedly
to the markets' turbulence. Mr Edouard Balladur, the most likely future
president, is viewed as economically sound. But the fear is that populist
Euro-sceptical candidates could force him to make concessions during the
campaign that might undermine European economic convergence. The markets are
unlikely to stage a rally until after the elections unless Mr Balladur's
lead in the opinion polls strengthens further.

FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 13.2% in
disappointing 1994
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dealer trading dominated yesterday's half-day session, and share prices
sagged on the last trading day of the year on profit-taking, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 29.92 lower at 19,723.06, up 13.2 per cent on
the year. The Topix index rose 4.75 to 1,559.09 and closed up 8.3 per cent
from the end of last year.
The Nikkei moved between 19,679.34 and 19,833.22 during the day, fluctuating
on year end position adjustment by dealers. Volume totalled 120m shares
against Thursday's 208m. The Nikkei 300 edged up 0.81 to 287.17. Gainers led
losers by 570 to 390, with 176 shares remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.90 to 1,287.92.
While the performance of Japanese shares this year has disappointed many
market participants who were expecting the Nikkei to rise as high as 25,000,
returns have been favourable relative to other world-wide markets. The
Nikkei has posted its first double digit gain for the first time since 1989
when the Nikkei rose by 29 per cent. Thanks to the yen's appreciation, in
dollar terms, the Nikkei has gained 27 per cent and the Topix has risen by
21 per cent.
The leading gainers of the year were cyclicals, with machinery up 30 per
cent on the year, and other sectors including paper, steel and shipping
showing strong performances. Utilities, metals, construction and foods were
among the losers.
Some analysts believe that a weak recovery will mean further room for
strength in the manufacturing sector. 'If the current economic recovery were
to follow previous cyclical patterns in the economy, the manufacturing-led
recovery of 1994 would shift to a non-manufacturing led recovery in 1995,'
said one.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 73.22 to 21,702.45 in volume of 11.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y110 to Y5,390 on
profit-taking.
Roundup
Thin turnover characterised trading as the year closed.
HONG KONG rounded off the year marginally lower on low turnover. The Hang
Seng index fell 4.98 to 8,191.04 in turnover of HKDollars 1.31bn.
The index lost 1.4 per cent on the week, but over the year fell 31.1 per
cent, its the worst performance since 1982 when it lost 44.2 per cent.
The index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong closed at 1,069.67, up 5.24
mainly as a result of Japanese buying.
The session also marked the final day's trading in Hong Kong of Jardine
Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings, which have now moved their
secondary listings to Singapore.
Jardine Matheson lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55.25 and Jardine Strategic was
down 80 cents at HKDollars 25.40.
SYDNEY closed sharply lower in pre-holiday, half-day trading.
The All Ordinaries index lost 20.1 to 1,912.7 in volume of 138m shares
valued at ADollars 696m. The index was barely changed on the week.
Brokers noted further profit-taking among resource issues following good
gains in recent trading. BHP dropped 32 cents to ADollars 19.58, with CRA
declining 18 cents to ADollars 17.80 and MIM Holdings off 9 cents to
ADollars 2.15.
SINGAPORE registered a new year's low in terms of volume traded at 43.1m
shares as the Straits Times industrials index shed 3.46 to 2,239.56, a
week's rise of 1 per cent.
Most of the trade was accounted for by Malaysian shares dealt over the
counter.
TAIPEI was strong but brokers warned that the rally was based on speculative
buying and could prove hard to sustain in the new year.
The weighted index added 83.67 or 1.2 per cent to 7,111.10 for a week's
improvement of 3.7 per cent. Turnover was TDollars 100.19bn.
The market has been been among the region's best performers in 1994, showing
an index gain of more than 17 per cent.
China Airlines rose or 6.84 per cent to TDollars 48.4 on hopes that an
imminent relaxation of visa rules for travel to Taiwan would boost passenger
loads.
KUALA LUMPUR closed slightly higher, with the composite index up 4.07 at
971.21, and down 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was MDollars 35.3m.

FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher on mixed day for
data

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Investors not already on vacation finished the year with a mixed performance
in very light trading yesterday, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 1.01 at 3,834.44.
The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 1.90 at 459.27, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.31 at 433.67 and the Nasdaq
composite rose 2.43 at 751.96. Trading volume on NYSE was 256m shares.
Share prices, which many analysts had expected to rally on the last trading
day of the year, were not helped by sinking bond prices. The long bond
dropped nearly half a point in very thin trading and the two-year note was
off slightly. The bond market closed at 2pm in advance of Monday's holiday.
Economic data was mixed. Sales of new single family houses fell by 2.5 per
cent in November, but data released by the Purchasing Management Association
of Chicago showed business activity up to a stronger than expected 67.5 per
cent in December. Economists had expected a slight decrease to 65.0 per
cent.
Health Systems International rocketed 39 per cent, rising Dollars 8 1/2 at
Dollars 30 3/8 on news that the health services company was in discussions
about a possible merger with Foundation Health. Shares in Foundation Health
dropped Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 5/8 after the company announced the
negotiations.
The B shares of Viacom gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 40 3/4 after reports
that a sale of the company's cable systems was imminent. TCI Communications,
down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 21 3/4 , was said to be among the group
involved in the acquisition.
After rebounding moderately on Wednesday and Thursday, Mexican shares fell
yesterday morning as companies began to report their foreign exchange losses
due to the peso's precipitous decline. Grupo Sidek, down Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 10 1/8 , said it expected a foreign exchange loss of Dollars 104m.
Telmex lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 41.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed the year on a positive note, making modest gains in
thin trading. The TSE-300 composite index added 10.96 points, or 0.26 per
cent, to 4,213.61, with winners predominating over losers by 491 to 225.
A volume of 29.0m shares valued at CDollars 325.4m compared with Thursday's
32.9m worth CDollars 368.1m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks closed down 1.47 per cent dragged lower by investor
profit-taking after Thursday's steep rise. The IPC index closed off 35.40
points to 2,375.66.
Traders said investors were partly disappointed that the address to the
nation by President Ernesto Zedillo failed to deliver details about the
country's revised economic plan for 1995.
Following Thursday's 3.14 per cent advance, the appointment of Mr Guillermo
Ortiz Martinez as Mr Jaime Serra Puche's successor as finance minister did
little to encourage markets.
Venezuela
Caracas stocks ended the last day of trading in 1994 slightly stronger for
the sixth successive session.
The Merinvest index rose 1.09 per cent to 132.82,
Benchmark utility Electricidad de Caracas rose one bolivar to 243 on 131,000
shares.
Brazil was closed for a holiday.

FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Contrasts, conflicts in long-term
equity returns - Adrian FitzGerald compares a spectacular decade with the
results of a five-year fight against inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Major equity markets around the world tend to produce their best returns
during the month of January, and things were no different in 1994. The FT-A
World Index rose by over 5 per cent on the month in local currency terms;
the Japanese market rose by almost 13 per cent.
Then the US Federal Reserve spoiled the party in February by raising
short-term interest rates. Long bond yields in the US and elsewhere were
already being pushed up by fears that inflationary pressures would follow
hard on the heels of economic recovery. And the US domestic economy was
beginning to show signs of overheating.
Six interest rate rises later, those fears have not been laid to rest.
Medium and long-term bond yields in the US are 2 percentage points higher
than in February reflecting, in the main, the inflation risks that investors
still perceive. Long bond yields in other major markets have also risen,
though by a lesser degree in most cases.
It is not surprising, against this background, that global equity markets
failed to extend an excellent start to the year. In fact, the FT-A World
Index in local currency, which hit its peak on February 2, is closing the
year some 7 per cent below that peak level.
What is surprising is that, given the extent of the weakness in bonds, some
equity markets did not suffer even greater falls during the year. US
equities, for example, have held up remarkably well, falling only 4 per cent
from their February peak. Optimistic investors (and stockbrokers) would
argue that this resilience is proof that the bull market in equities is
still intact and that a strong rally is assured once inflation fears
subside. However, realists should take special note of the fact that US
equities still appear very overvalued relative to bonds. Indeed, the ratio
of bond yield to equity yield - a crude, inverse measure of relative
attractiveness - is, worryingly, at its highest levels since just before the
October 1987 crash]
Equity markets need a bond market recovery, therefore, if progress is to be
resumed in 1995. But this does imply, of course, that investors willing to
commit new money to financial markets should not ignore the potential
returns from bonds. Good returns from equities will only be forthcoming on
the back of good returns from fixed interest securities.
And here lies one of the more important lessons to be learned from the first
half of the decade, a period in which authorities around the world have
fought to squeeze inflation out of the economic system. Contrary to the
experience of the 1980s, it should no longer be assumed that equity markets
will churn out high double digit returns year after year. Moreover, it would
also be wrong to assume that equity returns will always better bond returns
by a wide margin.
Equity returns were spectacular during the 1980s. UK-based investors were
particularly well served by international diversification, because of the
depreciation in sterling against some of the major currencies. The 21.0 per
cent annualised return in Japan, for example, translated into an annualised
sterling return of 31.5 per cent.
Performances look very different over the first half of the 1990s. Japan has
been the worst performing of the major markets and now sells in local
currency terms at 54 per cent of its value at the start of the decade. The
yen has continued to appreciate, however, which has eased the pain for
foreign investors. The biggest losers have been the Japanese themselves who
will have struggled to eke out satisfactory returns from most of the major
equity markets.
Equities will continue to deliver superior, long-term returns to investors
prepared to take on additional risks. But long-term means long-term. And the
experience of the last five years should serve as a reminder that equity
returns may disappoint in the short to medium term.
UK-based investors, who tend to have a relatively extreme exposure to
equities, will no doubt wish to do some hard strategic thinking in the light
of this experience. Despite a poor performance in 1994, UK long bonds have
outperformed UK equities during the decade so far. The outperformance
averages just 2 percentage points per annum, but it is the first time since
1978 that long bonds have come out on top in a rolling five year analysis.
A similar analysis for the US market shows equities and bonds running neck
and neck as the New Year approaches. It certainly seems highly likely that
the current controversy over the scale of the equity risk premium - the
excess return to be expected from equities over bonds - will become even
more frenzied on both sides of the Atlantic in 1995.

FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Window dressing features as
some bourses recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stability in the dollar, and recovery in a number of bond markets allowed
some bourses to close the year on the upgrade, writes Our Markets Staff.
Amsterdam and Zurich were closed for the New Year holiday.
FRANKFURT saw window dressing push the Dax index to a session close of
2,106.58, up 1.4 per cent on the day and 2.8 per cent on the month, but down
7.1 per cent on the year.
In December, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, chemicals
and electricals staged a recovery on positive interim results: Hoechst and
Degussa kept up the good work yesterday with gains of DM10 to DM337 and
DM11.50 to DM469.
The best performer of the month was Metallgesellschaft with a gain of 12 per
cent; but it was the worst performer in 1994 as a whole with a loss of 48.9
per cent.
Otherwise, the year saw its expected switch out of interest rate driven
stocks: Bayernverein and Bayernhypo followed Metallgesellschaft in the
laggards list with losses of 22.6 and 21.3 per cent respectively. But the
switch into earnings driven shares was delayed by the weaker dollar, the
fall in bond markets and other election year vagaries.
PARIS was swayed by the expiry of the December futures contract. Activity
was generally muted with year-end position squaring much in evidence as the
CAC-40 index fell 13.00 to 1,881.15, down 3.5 per cent on the week and 17
per cent on the year.
The 30 basis point increase in base rates announced on Thursday was expected
to have only a limited effect on economic growth, according to Salomon
Brothers. It noted that many leading French companies had large cash piles
and were therefore less dependent on credit to fund growth. Medium and small
sized companies, however, could feel the effects. The broker added that
political worries ahead of the presidential election in May was beginning to
exert its pull on the activity of the financial markets.
Bank stocks remained under pressure following the rate rise. Societe
Generale fell FFr15, or 2.6 per cent, to FFr561, BNP FFr3.50, or 1.4 per
cent, to FFr245.5 and Bancaire FFr9 or 1.7 per cent to FFr515.
MILAN bounced back after the correction of the previous two sessions as
hopes grew that an institutional government, headed by a non-political
figure, might be appointed in the New Year.
The Comit index rose 7.48 to 632.48 in very thin trade, little changed on
the week. The index was 2.1 per cent higher over the year, but 22.6 per cent
down from the euphoric post election peak seen in April.
Montedison rose L30 to L1,223 in very heavy volume of 42.9m shares after the
group said that it would merge with Finagro at midnight last night, ending
recent arbitrage trade seen between the shares. Finagro, whose shares were
delisted last night, finished L250 higher at L9,800.
Benetton gained L184 to L18,950 as the market awaited confirmation of
reports that La Standa, the retailing arm of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest company, was poised to sell its Euromercato hypermarket chain to a
group led by Benetton and the businessman, Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio.
MADRID saw less overt pressure on the Spanish government and the general
index rose 4.68 to 285.01, still down 2.7 per cent on the week, and 11.7 per
cent on the year.
Banks improved, sensitive to the rise in bond markets, BCH leading with a
gain of Pta80 at Pta3,150; but Banesto reversed Thursday's outperformance
with a fall of Pta24 to Pta925. Turnover was Pta46.39bn.

FT  31 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Winning line for Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News that the government is to allow gaming machines in bookmakers' shops
brought a cheer to both Ladbroke and Stanley Leisure.
Shares in the former hardened 2 to 171p, while the latter moved 8 ahead to
344p, though with little market activity on the last trading day of the
year, volumes in both stocks remained thin.
Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court said: 'Assuming two machines per betting
shop, this could add between Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m to Ladbroke's profits
and between Pounds 2m and Pounds 4m to Stanley Leisure's profits but it will
be some time before we will see this impact.'
Market watchers also pointed out the government move could have an impact on
Bass, owner of the Coral bookmaker chain. Shares in Bass closed 1 1/2
lighter at 514 1/2 p.
Shares in RJB Mining returned to the market yesterday after the company
completed its Pounds 815m acquisition of the English mines from the coal
board.
Having been suspended at 348p, the shares returned at a deep discount at
329p, before regaining some momentum to close at 333p, in trade of 4.2m. The
deal was partly financed through a Pounds 400m placing and open offer, and
the new shares finished 4 ahead of of the issue price at 324p, on turnover
of 3.3m.
A recent circular published by Smith New Court said: 'The fact is that
electricity generated from coal is the cheapest electricity in the UK, and
that coal mined domestically is cheaper for the power generators to burn
than imported coal. For these reasons we expect RJB to renew its contracts
to supply the generators and with falling production costs it will be able
to deliver strong and rising profits.'
Among oil stocks, Burmah put on 3 to 815p and Lasmo added 1 1/2 to 147p but
for the most part the sector barely flickered in reaction to the continued
recovery in oil prices which has taken Brent blend up to within a whisker of
Dollars 16.50 from a pre-Christmas low of Dollars 15.60.
Stock market opinions on the outlook for oil prices are polarised with
strong non-Opec production and mild winter worries about stock levels
pitched against a number of more bullish views. These mostly revolve around
hopes for flattening output growth and a reviving European economy.
NatWest Securities heads the latter camp looking for a 1995 average price of
Dollars 19 for Brent Blend (Dollars 3 better than 1994) and putting BP -
down 1 1/2 at 425 1/2 p - at the top of their list of oil price sensitive
stocks.
Abbey National did its best to keep bank shares bubbling ahead of the 1994
results season which gets an early show of the betting on January 12 when
TSB's preliminary figures are due. Abbey National gained 2 1/2 to 430 1/2 p
while TSB was  1/2 better at 234 1/2 p. With 1.3m traded, NatWest was the
most active bank share, holding steady at 514p.
Lloyds, down 23 in the three previous sessions as Latin American worries in
the wake of peso fall-out gnawed away at sentiment, eased marginally to 552
1/2 p. HSBC and Standard Chartered slipped as the Hong Kong market continued
to wilt, dipping 4 1/2 and 2 to 706 1/2 p and 280 1/2 p respectively.
Among merchant banks, Cater Allen retreated 13 to 445p and Gerrard National
gave up 7 to 481p. S. G. Warburg, which called off merger discussions with
Morgan Stanley of the US just before Christmas, added 2 to 691p as takeover
hopes showed signs of limping on into the New Year.
Interest rate uncertainties in Europe in the wake of Thursday's unexpected
rise for French base rates continued to dog those building materials groups
with a sizeable continental business. RMC retreated to 935p, down 5 for a
two-day decline of 20 1/2 . Hepworth fell 6 to 313p while Blue Circle was 3
easier at 282p, although in every case activity was nominal at best.
Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle hire company floated on Thursday at 94p,
continued to make progress with a buy note from Albert E. Sharp helping to
lift the shares a further 3 to 100p.
Engineering group James Dickie, which this week appointed a new chairman,
improved 11 to 196p on expectations of a favourable performance next year.
Hopes of an improvement in the Mexican economy boosted Allied Domecq, which
derives a sizeable part of its profits from the country. The shares put on 3
to 540p.
Reports that Mr Maurice Saatchi is to stay on as chairman of one of the
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiaries gave a boost to the group's shares. They put
on 5 to 149p.
The lacklustre market activity did little to banish recent bid speculation
in the regional electricity companies sector where several of the so-called
takeover favourites continued to move ahead.
The day's gains included Yorkshire Electricity which advanced 9 to 727p,
South Western Electricity 4 harder at 882p and London Electricity whose
shares closed 5 ahead at 746p.

Stocks index futures staged a steady recovery, lifting the FT-SE 100 March
contract to 3,092 by the end of pit trading at 12:10pm, up 15 points for a
net decline on last Friday's close of 33 points, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At 4,213 contracts dealt, activity was almost in line with Thursday's 4,699
for a full session. The March contract ended just below its 3,098 best of
the day. The premium to the cash market was 22 points or some five points
over fair value.
Stock option volume was 21,936 lots, significantly better than Thursday's
13,564.

FT  31 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Last minute dip leaves Footsie down
on the day - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market did no more than crawl over the finishing line of the
year 1994 after one of the quietest trading sessions on record. With only
seconds to go before the line was drawn under the FT-SE 100 for the year, a
handful of marketmakers tipped the balance in the index by lowering their
quotations for British Gas, Glaxo and Allied Domecq.
The upshot was that the index, up 0.4 with a minute to go before the veil
was brought down on the year, ended the last session a net 0.1 lower at
3,065.5, a last ditch triumph for the bears who have trampled over all
attempts to drive the UK equity market higher over the year.
Over the year, the FT-SE 100 index has fallen 363.3, or 10.6 per cent,
against a 284.8, or 7.5 per cent decline in the second line stocks, as
represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 index.
Dealers said the better tone in the market reflected a much calmer
performance by international bonds after a worryingly turbulent session on
Thursday.
'The market game really stopped on Thursday afternoon when bonds, bunds and
gilts ran back ahead of, and following, news of the increases in French bank
base rates,' said one senior dealer. 'But the feeling around the markets
today(Friday) is that the sell-off was overdone,' he added.
The performance of gilts yesterday tended to underscore that argument, with
the 10-year gilt easing a shade at the outset and then moving up eight ticks
before settling unchanged on balance.
And there was none of the expected last-minute action in the market's best
and worst performers of the year that many marketmakers had been expecting.
'Not an OTC expiry in sight,' said one.
The FT-SE 100 had begun the day under light selling pressure, with
marketmakers wary of the previous day's sharp sell off in bonds and
equities. The index kicked off with a 1.3 decline at 3,064.3 and slipped to
a session low of 3,062.9, down 2.7, before responding to the gradual
improvement in the gilt-edged market.
With gilts quickly moving to post gains of eight ticks shortly after the
opening, the 100 index similarly moved into plus-territory, and climbed to a
session high of 3,073.1, up 7.5, just before midday.
Thereafter interest in the market, which was always minimal, faded away, and
the skeleton staffs manning the City's trading desks did little more than
head off any attempts to trade by brokers.
A firm opening by Wall Street, which came in up around 12 points following
an encouraging Chicago Purchasing Managers' index,was largely ignored by the
UK market, where the 100 index maintained its quietly firm tone before
slipping off at the very end of the session.
The utilities areas of the market remained very much in focus with traders
speculating on the possibilities of early takeover activity in the water
stocks, where the Government's golden shares disappear at midnight tonight,
and in the regional electricity stocks which have long been seen as takeover
targets. Only one of the water stocks, Wessex, managed to attract turnover
in excess of 1m shares. None of the Recs or generators could attract that
level of business.
Turnover in London totalled a miserly 240.2m shares, among the lowest
figures this year. Non-FT-SE stocks accounted for 68 per cent of the overall
number.
Strategists, although looking for the UK market to record healthy gains over
the coming year, are not expecting any fireworks when the market re-opens on
Tuesday.
'The interest rate situation in Europe and the UK will overhang the markets
for some time, but the positive earnings and dividend outlook and the
prospects of substantial takeover activity will produce big gains over the
year,' was the view of one old market hand.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Market breather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets ended the year on a quiet note yesterday as traders
took to the sidelines after a surprisingly busy week, writes Philip Gawith.
There was little price volatility compared to the previous days which had
seen sharp movements in the dollar, Mexican peso, lira, peseta and franc.
Trading desks were very lightly staffed. European trading effectively
finished at lunchtime, and New York desks were not planning to open in the
afternoon.
Despite the thin trading conditions, the dollar was completely unmoved by
the release of November home sales figures, and the Chicago purchasing
managers index. It closed barely changed in London at DM1.55 and Y99.77.
In the UK sterling had a solid day, with the trade weighted index finishing
at 79.7, from 79.6. The pound broke through DM2.42 again to close at
DM2.425, from DM2.4183.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.25bn money market shortage at
established rates.
In early Mexican trading the peso was unchanged at 4.85/5.00 pesos to the
dollar. Traders said the announcement on Thursday by President Ernesto
Zedillo of an economic emergency plan had not affected the market as he had
not offered full details.
The three European currencies that have been weak recently all made up some
ground yesterday against the D-Mark. The lira finished at L1,047 from
L1,049, the franc at FFr3.433, from FFr3.455, and the peseta at Pta 84.91,
from Pta 85.15.
Holders of these currencies received something to cheer about from the 1995
global economic and financial market survey conducted by IDEA, the financial
analysis service. This found that the median forecasts, at the end of 1995,
were L1,010, FFr3.42 and Pta 84 - in each case a strengthening from current
levels.
The corollary of weaker currencies has been a deterioration of interest rate
sentiment, with markets anticipating the need for higher rates to bolster
weakening currencies. The past week saw the March PIBOR and Eurolira
contracts respectively lose around 23 and 13 basis points.
These moves have been accentuated by the increasing conviction that the next
move in German rates will be up, reflected in the recent fall in Euromark
futures prices.
This conviction was bolstered by the hawkish tone of comments from Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, in the Handelsblatt newspaper. He
said a strong D-Mark was necessary to remedy the economy's structural
problems, and that structural change would not be assisted by a loose
monetary policy.
But Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI, cautioned: 'One should watch
what the Bundesbank do as opposed to what they say ..the Bundesbank like to
keep some speculation alive in the markets that interest rates have the
scope to go either way at this stage in the economic cycle.'
Mr Steven Bell, economist at Morgan Grenfell, has produced some interesting
research on sterling. He finds that the two years 1993-4 exhibited the
lowest degree of sterling volatility in any two year period in the floating
exchange rate era. Also, short term interest rates were also unusually
stable, with their volatility the lowest in over 20 years.
Mr Bell has no ready explanation, save to say that there is no simple
relationship between financial variables and exchange rate stability.

FT  31 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrailian market closed 1994 with prices about 50pc higher than when
the year began. The rise for wool growers was enough to mean a return to
economic production after the extremes of deep recession. The wool trade and
textile industry experienced a much more satisfactory year as prices took an
upward trend. The problem which developed during the latter half of the year
was that of passing on the higher raw wool prices. Lower levels led to
better business but when it comes to replacement retailers were reluctant to
pay prices up by 50pc to 100pc or for speciality fibres by more than that.
Wool is not the only commodity facing this problem of a rising market at the
primary end but resistance further down the line, closely related to
policies designed to check inflation. The outlook for 1995 is seen as
difficult largely for this reason.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper ends with a
flourish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange copper contract finished 1994 with a flourish in
yesterday's shortened trading session. The three months price touched a 5
3/4 -year high of Dollars 3,032 a tonne before ending at Dollars 3,022, up
Dollars 10 from Thursday and about 75 per cent on the year.
In ignoring a second successive rise in LME warehouse stocks and resisting
the temptation to indulge in an end-of-year sell-off the copper market
encouraged hopes of fresh highs being reached in the first half of 1995,
before increased supply begins to hit the market in the second half. 'We
remain very friendly towards copper for another four or five months,'
brokerage house Merrill Lynch, told the Reuters news agency.
Aluminium ended virtually unchanged on the day, despite news of another big
fall in LME stocks, but traders predicted that the market could build on its
74 per cent 1994. They warned, however, that the longer term prospects for
aluminium prices depended on whether producers maintained the production
cuts implemented under the 'memorandum of understanding' agreed early this
year.
A second-half price surge put the nickel market into the frame in the 1994
LME stakes. Ending just short of the Dollars 9,000-a-tonne resistance area
the three months delivery position registered a 69 per cent rise on the
year; and dealers thought any substantial retracement was unlikely while
uncertainty persisted about Russian shipment levels.
In contrast, the gold market ended a disappointing year with a fall towards
its Dollars 382-a-troy-ounce support level. Early hopes of a decisive break
through the Dollars 400 barrier persisted for much of the year in spite of
repeated disappointments. But analysts were yesterday keeping a low profile
on prospects for 1995. After seeing the price end in the middle of its
Dollars 370-Dollars 395 trading range, and down about 3 per cent over the 12
months, most were content to point to the Far Eastern demand underpinning
the market, without seeking to encourage any bullish hopes.
In terms of its overall price gains the London Commodity Exchange's robusta
coffee market has been London's star performer in 1994, nearby positions
ending with net rises of about 135 per cent. But at Dollars 2,822 a tonne
the second position was more than Dollars 1,200 off the nine-year peak to
which it was driven by the two damaging frosts and a subsequent drought that
hit Brazil's growing regions in the third quarter. A post-Christmas rally
was trimmed back yesterday morning when end-year book-squaring lopped
Dollars 54 off the March delivery position.
LCE white sugar futures were marking time yesterday at the end of a year
that saw nearby positions surge 44 per cent to 4 1/2 -year highs. At Dollars
405.20 a tonne the May delivery price was about Dollars 10 off the peak,
however, and there was concern that a big decline could ensue when US
investment funds decided to take their money elsewhere.
The uptrend that attracted the funds into this market was prompted by
successive scalings down in production forecasts and expectations of big
purchases by China and Russia. But London broker C. Czarnikow said recently
that these countries would probably stay out of the market until well into
next year, and the International Sugar Organisation warned that present high
prices could 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive importers
which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: HK exchange chief looks
forward to 1997 - Simon Holberton meets Dr Cheng who has been chosen to
oversee the transfer of the colony's stock market to Chinese sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Edgar Cheng, 51, has been chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange for
nearly two months and already he barely has time to scratch himself.
'I have recently taken up calligraphy,' he said in an interview. 'A master
visits once a week and that's the only time - my one hour of peace - when I
don't think about the stock exchange.'
This is not a complaint, but is said simply to underline that Dr Cheng has
given up his other business activities for the exchange. He has been elected
for a year, but he accepted the post on the understanding that he will see
the exchange through Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
The Hong Kong stock exchange has been adept at picking chairmen in the
recent past. The outgoing incumbent, Mr Charles Lee, was highly experienced
in the law of securities regulation, just at the time when the exchange -
recovering from the trial of its former chairman Mr Ronald Li, and the shock
of a new regulatory framework - needed such a figure. He was also
instrumental in devising a means by which mainland Chinese companies could
list their shares in Hong Kong.
In opting for Dr Cheng the members of the exchange appear to have made a
similarly prescient decision. They have gone for a man with impeccable
credentials in China even if he is a little unknown in his native Hong Kong.
Dr Cheng is the son-in-law of the late Sir YK Pao, the Hong Kong shipping
magnate, whose closeness to the Beijing regime was underlined by the fact
that he played bridge regularly with Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount
leader. Dr Cheng always accompanied Sir YK on his trips to China.
When, in the early 1990s, Beijing sought Sir YK's advice on whom to select
as the first group of Hong Kong advisers, it was Dr Cheng whose name went
forward. In 1992, when the first tranche of 44 advisers was announced, Dr
Cheng was one of the youngest. 'The stock exchange is an extension of that
relationship,' he says. 'If there is anything they (Beijing) need to know
I'm in the best position to let them know.'
He says he is confident about China's ability to get right its relationship
with Hong Kong. On a recent visit to Beijing he left with the strong sense
that the Chinese leadership sees Hong Kong facilitating economic development
on the mainland; moreover, Beijing will let Hong Kong run unhindered its own
financial affairs. 'China knows that Hong Kong's financial system is good
for them to tap,' he says. 'They look at us as a partner and that was very
comforting to me.'
Unlike his brothers in law - Mr Peter Woo, who runs the Wharf-Wheelock
group, or Dr Hulmut Sohmen, who runs World-Wide Shipping - Dr Cheng does not
have much of a public profile in Hong Kong. For most of his professional
life Dr Cheng was a specialist in gastro-intestinal cancer. In the US he was
teacher, researcher and clinician.
The pull of family was strong, however, and since his return to the colony
in 1987 he has kept to himself and applied himself to his business.
Initially this was working alongside Sir YK in managing a vast portfolio of
private investments, which he was later to inherit, in the World-Wide
Investment Company.
Looking back on those early days, he observed: 'My job was to look after the
family money. Helmut (Sohmen) got the shipping and Peter (Woo) the public
companies. But the chunk of family money was looked after by my late
father-in-law; he didn't believe in fund managers. So working with him I got
to learn a lot about the world economy, currencies, bonds, and equities -
mainly US and European.'
He also had to respond to the demands of his own family. As the eldest son
his decision to embark on a medical career in the US had been controversial;
ordinarily he would have been expected to stay and assist his father in the
family firm. Upon his return to Hong Kong his father insisted that he fulfil
Cheng-family obligations as well as those to his father-in-law. He did this
by assuming the chairmanship of Wing Tai, a textiles and property company
listed on the Singapore stock exchange.
At the beginning of December he relinquished this job to his younger brother
Edward, who until then had been finance director at Wharf. He has also put
in Edward's care a USDollars 100m investment project in Ningbo, the coastal
city of Zhejiang province. In 1992, Dr Cheng decided to make his first big
independent foray into business on the mainland. World-Wide and Wing Tai
have put up 60 per cent of the capital, and various agencies of the
Singapore government the remaining 40 per cent.
Ningbo was the home town of Sir YK It is one of China's leading coastal
cities with the country's deepest port. 'My late father-in-law had donated a
university there, and relations were very good with the city,' Dr Cheng
said. 'I thought that with our connections in Singapore and Hong Kong
entrepreneurialism we could do something.'
Singapore lent its city planner, who set about to do a new plan for Ningbo
city. Dr Cheng knew Prof Lester Thurow of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and got the institute to do a study of Ningbo and its economic
relationship to the Yangtze river delta. The results of the studies were
presented to the Ningbo authorities in November 1993.
The pay-off for Dr Cheng and his associates is a slice of the development of
a 50 sq km economic development zone in the city. In addition the consortium
is developing a multi-storey office development in centre of Ningbo. The
consortium also acquired a former state-run canned foods company which has
proved difficult to turn around. 'It is teaching me the lesson that
attitudes are hard to change,' he says.
It is this first-hand experience of doing business in China which Dr Cheng
believes will help him in his new job at the stock exchange. Under his
predecessor the exchange defined how to accommodate the capital-raising
needs of Chinese state companies. Dr Cheng is a believer in the exchange's
slogan that Hong Kong can be the centre for capital formation in China.
'Where else do you have a developing country with a market place like Hong
Kong for their capital formation?'
The agenda for the coming year is one which he inherited. This foresees an
increase in the number of mainland companies quoted on the exchange, the
introduction of stock options during the summer of 1995, and the creation of
an 'off-floor' exchange. Out of reasons of habit, Hong Kong maintains a
central trading floor even though all trading is screen based and could
theoretically be conducted from members' offices. Many of the larger brokers
have wanted terminals in their offices and from 1995 this will be allowed
under the so-called 'second terminal' rules.
In Hong Kong share trading is dominated by the large brokers. It is
estimated that a third of the trading is spread among 14 houses (mostly
foreign), another third among 50 large local brokers and the remaining third
among 400 or more small family brokers. The pressure for rationalisation in
growing, especially as fixed commissions come under pressure from fund
managers no longer allowed to accept cash commissions from the brokers.
Dr Cheng may well find that his 'patient care' skills are needed as much in
his new job as they were when he was dealing with cancer patients. He is
aware of the need for change, but understandably cautious when pressed about
the need for giving the process a nudge along. 'The exchange cannot tell
small brokers what to do but it can provide an environment and advise them
on mergers,' he says. But then he adds: 'If you do not grow you will be left
behind.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: UBS denies it offered deal to
win 'shares' vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland has rejected 'unfounded rumours' that it offered a
special deal to a large shareholder to win his votes at last month's
shareholders meeting.
UBS confirmed reports in the Swiss media that it had purchased a 1.45m block
of registered shares, worth some SFr450m (Dollars 344m) at the time,
apparently from a retired German billionaire.
The UBS board sparked off a bitter proxy battle in September by proposing to
convert the bank's registered shares into bearer shares on terms that would
undermine the premium value of the registered shares. The two-thirds
majority needed at the shareholders' meeting to approve its proposal was
exceeded by only 65,500 votes, about 0.2 per cent of the 31.6m voted.
Shortly before the vote, rumours spread of UBS buying a large block of its
own shares under a forward contract.
Swiss law prohibits a company from voting shares that it holds in its
treasury. Under a forward purchase arrangement with the bank, the vendor
could retain and vote the shares, but would no longer be exposed to any
price risk.
UBS said the majority of the block was committed to cover warrants and so
could only be purchased on a forward basis.
The terms were set 'in conformity with market conditions', apparently at
about SFr310 per share, the price prevailing in mid October. However, the
transactions were not reported to the stock exchange until October 28 when
the spot price had fallen below SFr280. This has led to accusations that the
deal was backdated in return for the vendor's voting support.
UBS said 'no voting right agreements were negotiated'. It said the deal's
terms were agreed on October 18, but settlement was delayed until October 28
because of the need to ensure that the transactions 'were properly
executed'.
It also said that it did not vote any of the shares it purchased on a spot
basis.
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision, which is taking UBS to court over its
conversion motion, questioned again the use of shareholders' money to buy
large volumes of registered shares when the directors knew that the price
would decline.
UBS said that, as a market maker in its own shares, it tried to smooth the
fall of the registered share price. The appearance of a 1.45m block on the
market threatened to have a very negative effect.

FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: Euromercato supermarkets sale
hits legal problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last-minute legal problems are holding up the conclusion of the L950bn
(Dollars 584m) sale of Euromercato, part of Fininvest's supermarkets and
chain stores division.
The division has a total turnover of L5,200bn. The Euromercato supermarkets
disposal will cut turnover by about L1,200bn.
A deal was due to be signed yesterday selling Euromercato to a consortium of
the Benetton clothing group and Luxottica, the spectacles group owned by Mr
Leonardo Del Vecchio. However, a spokesman for Standa, the Fininvest stores
group that is hand-ling the sale, said lawyers would need 'a few more days'
to complete it.
The sale marks a major divestiture for Fininvest, Italy's largest private
business group owned by out-going premier Silvio Berlusconi.
The sale is necessary to reduce overall debts from L3,920bn to L2,800bn by
the end of this year.
It also signals an important expansion of Benetton-Luxottica's recent
diversification into retailing.

Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, intends to reduce its investment in
beer-making operations and reduce the number of employees engaged in brewing
operations over the next three years, a company spokesman said, agencies
report from Tokyo.
Japan's brewers' margins are being squeezed by competition from cheaper
foreign imports and discounting by large stores.
Capital spending will be cut to Y230bn (Dollars 2.5bn) in the three years to
1997, compared with Y270bn spent in the three years to 1994. Capital
spending in its beer division will be cut to Y130bn in the three years from
Y210bn previously.

Z Groupe Zannier, French manufacturer of children's clothing, has sold its
Kickers footwear brand to Flavio Briatore, the director of the Benetton-Ford
Formula One motor racing team, Reuter reports from Paris.
'This operation will have a positive impact, which it is not possible to
determine at present, on the extraordinary results of the 1994 financial
year,' Zannier, whose other brands include the Z children's clothing range,
said in a statement.
The sale price was not disclosed but gross annual royalties from Kickers
were about FFr20m.
Zannier, listed on the Paris bourse's main monthly settlement market earlier
this year, had net attributable 1993 profits of FFr64.14m (Dollars 12m) on
turnover of FFr1.97bn.
The company, which is based near Saint-Etienne, France, used to farm out
manufacture of Kickers to subcontractors. It bought the 1970s brand in 1988.

Peregrine Brokerage, a fully owned subsidiary of Peregrine Investments

Hong Kong Stock Exchange for breaching exchange regulations, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
The exchange said Peregrine Brokerage 'knowingly assisted substantial
shareholders of a number of listed companies to create a misleading
appearance of active trading'. This included sales or purchases of shares on
behalf of substantial shareholders that involved no actual change of
beneficial ownership of the shares.
'The substance of the above breaches related to the Member (Peregrine
Brokerage) having provided dealing facilities to clients during the period
from October 1991 to May 1992, which certain of the senior executives of the
Member knew were to effect share support at initial subscription and/or in
the after float market in the listed shares,' the exchange said.
The Exchange noted Peregrine Brokerage 'had since the relevant period made
significant changes in the management of the firm, including the appointment
of a Compliance Director at Board Level and that the Member has implemented
a new system of internal controls and procedures'.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tokyo seats on offer at bargain price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court and Paribas Capital Markets International are front runners
to buy seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at a knock-down price.
It is expected that the two seats will change hands officially early next
year. The seats for sale are those of Prudential Securities (Japan), the
Tokyo arm of US-based Prudential Securities, and that of Kidder Peabody
International.
The US-based parent companies of the vendors have faced financial
difficulties recently and are in the process of retrenchment.
A seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last changed hands at Y1.1bn (Pounds 7m)
when County NatWest sold its right, and it is expected that the buyers will
pay less than Y1bn. All prospective buyers must be vetted by the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
The prospective purchasers have both said they are interested in expanding
their Japanese equities businesses. UK and US investors have been recently
placing money in Japanese equities in expectation that economic activity
there will soon pick up.
Also, Tokyo Stock Exchange rules greatly disadvantage non-members which buy
and sell shares on behalf of customers. Non-members must execute business
through members, surrendering about 25 per cent of the commission they
receive. SNC and Paribas will immediately see a rise in revenues if their
bids to become members succeed.
In late October, Smith New Court, which has held a branch licence in Tokyo
since 1989, announced it was eager to purchase a seat on the Exchange.
However, the Exchange had made clear that it did not intend to expand the
number of seats beyond the existing 124. It could buy a seat only if an
existing owner wished to surrender membership.
Of those securities firms which own seats, 24 are non-Japanese, and of
these, five are British.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Creditors condemn ring-fencing - Jim Kelly
wonders whether Pentos' action will change the law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Pentos, the specialist retail group, to force its UK
subsidiary Athena Holdings into receivership with up to Pounds 15m owed to
creditors has produced a widespread sense of anger.
One creditor, claiming to be owed Pounds 60,000, said: 'To ring-fence a bit
of a business like this is morally reprehensible.'
The situation has not been helped by Pentos' own admission on the state of
its subsidiary. 'We couldn't give it away,' said the chief executive.
Pentos is forcing the subsidiary out of business because it believes that
the estimated Pounds 9m to Pounds 12m needed to make it break even is better
spent elsewhere in the group. Creditors, one of whom claimed he had been
asked to provide supplies worth more than Pounds 25,000 days before Athena
collapsed, have threatened legal action. However, whether or not they have a
case is arguable. British law does not require a parent company to bail out
a subsidiary.
'Each company stands alone,' says Mr Malcolm Fillmore, an insolvency
practitioner with the Paul Peters Partnership: 'There is nothing in the law
which says that a group has to stand behind you. There is no requirement to
back it at all costs. Legally you would be fooling yourself - unless you get
a guarantee or warranty from the holding company.'
The lack of legal redress for creditors has prompted attempts at reform for
more than 15 years.
During the passage of the 1986 Insolvency Act, a prohibition on the practice
was discussed. It was suggested that subsidiaries which trade as part of a
group should have the guaranteed backing of the whole group. The idea never
made the statute book.
A European Directive on the issue also foundered. The broad issue has never
been tested in court, according to Mr Fillmore, 'but the conventional wisdom
is that it would not succeed'.
Even so, the action taken by Pentos is not common in the UK. 'I have been
involved in many major public companies which had unviable subsidiaries,'
says Mr Fillmore. 'In almost every case they closed them down and paid off
the third party creditors and wound up the wreckage - primarily for goodwill
purposes.'
But it does happen. In 1991 Courtney Pope (Holdings), the shop-fitting and
engineering group, asked its banks to appoint receivers at six subsidiaries
in an attempt to rescue the good companies in the group from those
responsible for its losses and most of its debt. Trade creditors were not
pleased.
But they were better placed than the shareholders of British &amp; Commonwealth
Holdings, the financial services group which tried to save itself after
putting its Atlantic Computers leasing subsidiary into administration.
After six weeks of frantic salvage efforts, it was the withdrawal of support
from BC Merchant Bank that finally sent the parent down the same road as its
subsidiary.
The practice of ring-fencing is rare for four main reasons.
Loss of goodwill: at the time of the Courtney Pope case one insolvency
expert said that allowing a subsidiary to collapse should only occur 'under
circumstances that are pretty dire and when the parent company is in a
position where its reputation is no longer valuable. For instance, companies
with a substantial credit rating would not let a subsidiary go because of
the damage to that rating.'
Goodwill is at the heart of most companies' reluctance to set an insolvent
subsidiary adrift.
Ring-fencing a subsidiary sends out distressing signals to investors and
creditors. Creditors may seek broad financial guarantees from the group. 'It
leaves a nasty taste in the mouths of creditors who think they are trading
with a group of substance,' says Mr Fillmore.
Legal risks: Pentos insists that it has followed strict legal advice
throughout its problems with Athena. It is understood that the holding
company was hopeful of finding a buyer as late as the beginning of December.
However, if the directors of a subsidiary did not have financial guarantees
from its holding company, and continued to trade despite being insolvent,
they could be deemed to have been reckless and face court action from
creditors.
In contrast, a holding company could face action if a binding contract,
which could be oral, was made with the directors of its subsidiary to
provide financial assistance.
In such a case the receivers could pursue the holding company on behalf of
the creditors.
Corporate structure: groups divided into divisions are not able to take the
course followed by Pentos, which is divided into subsidiaries.
Financial guarantees: many suppliers and investors in subsidiaries have
their exposure to loss covered by agreements with the holding company. Such
a network of guarantees means the course followed by Pentos would make
little sense as these debts would still have to be met. In Pentos' case such
guarantees are not thought to be large.
The anger prompted by this latest example of ring-fencing an insolvent
subsidiary is understandable and may well bring about a public debate on the
issue. Only time will tell if the heat generated on this occasion is enough
to change the law.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Piggy-back race to replace the Topic
screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Topic, the London Stock Exchange's 10-year old electronic bulletin board,
was turned off last night, allowing fiercely competitive commercial
providers to enter the business.
The Exchange decided nearly two years ago that it no longer wished to sell
screens which would carry the prices of shares and company news
announcements.
Instead, it announced it would allow two firms to compete to replace its
Topic screens.
In the end, the battle has pitted one of the world's largest information
providers, Reuters, against both of the Exchange's chosen - and much smaller
 -successors.
Of these two, ICV, a London-based company owned mostly by its management,
has emerged as the apparent victor.
ICV has secured contracts for 6,000 positions of the 8,500 estimated Topic
users, giving it 70 per cent of the Topic screen replacement market.
It has placed screens at 80 per cent of UK equity market-making firms and 60
per cent of gilt-edged market-making firms.
By contrast, Telekurs, a consortium owned by a group of Swiss banks, has
about 1,500 screens.
Market users say that it was the relative simplicity and resemblance to the
familiar Topic that led them to choose ICV over Telekurs. Telekurs, they
said, developed a product which tried to incorporate too many features and
which appeared cumbersome.
'One of the things we found out was that a single product would never gain
universal acceptance,' said Mr David Joyce of ICV.
Instead, ICV has developed two products. One is a Topic lookalike and the
other, known as Topic 3, is a more sophisticated offering with the capacity
to produce graphics. This competes more directly with a new Reuters product.
Officially, the race to succeed the Stock Exchange's Topic screens was not
to be a race at all.
The Exchange chose two potential providers, each of which was to serve a
different end of the market.
While ICV was to develop a product catering for smaller, retail-oriented
firms such as private client stock-brokers, Telekurs was to cater to the
market professionals.
But it did not turn out that way. For one thing, Reuters, anxious to expand
its share of the equity market information dissemination business, quickly
came up with its own product, Equity Focus, capable of competing with both
ICV and Telekurs.
In addition, all three companies also realised that what was at stake was
far larger than simply replacing Stock Exchange screens.
That is because the company which leaves the most terminals in brokerages,
investment houses and banks across Britain has the best chance of being able
to 'piggy-back' other equity information services on top and become the
provider of choice for an expanding industry.
Mr Carl Kemp, of Telekurs, has stressed that 'Telekurs is in it for the long
term'.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Battling Stanhope expects verdict on future
in 'days'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope, the embattled property developer struggling to cope with its
banks' decision not to extend its credit facilities, has announced that a
decision on its future will be made within the next few days as intense
negotiations with creditors and potential rescuers continue.
At the group's AGM yesterday, Mr Stanley Honeyman, chairman, said: 'The
current position with our banks is that discussions are continuing and we
expect to make an announcement next week.'
'At the same time we are still in intensive negotiations with investors.'
Stanhope's banks are owed approximately Pounds 148m.
They withdrew their support on December 23 after protracted negotiations
broke down.
Two separate rescue plans - one by PosTel, the investment group, and British
Land, which has a 30 per cent stake in Stanhope - were discussed.
But they were rejected by the banks, which were not prepared to write off
more than 20p in the pound as demanded by the proposals.
Since then, Stanhope has been operating without credit facilities, although
the banks are said to be sympathetic while talks are continuing. In
particular, negotiations between Stanhope and British Land have been
resumed.
Mr Stuart Lipton, founder and chief executive of Stanhope, said yesterday
that the board was also talking to other investors, which may suggest that
the PosTel deal could also be revived. 'We are still talking to both banks
and investors and while these continue we are still in business,' he said.
Stanhope's chief asset is its 50 per cent holding in Broadgate Properties,
which controls much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the
City of London.
Mr Honeyman said that, given the group's precarious circumstances, the board
was postponing publication of the 1994 report and accounts, due out next
week.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi clients keep their options open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two big clients of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, said yesterday
they were still considering their relationship with the company, amid
continuing uncertainty over the future of Mr Maurice Saatchi, the deposed
chairman.
The clients - Mars and British Airways - are watching the looming deadline
of next Tuesday given to Mr Saatchi to decide whether he will stay with the
group in the largely honorific position of president and chairman of the
subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said yesterday that no decision on Mr Saatchi's future
remuneration had been taken. Commenting on reports that Mr Saatchi had been
offered a Pounds 100,000 pay rise to stay with the group, the company said:
'There have been no negotiations on salary. This story does not move on
until Maurice desides whether to take up the post with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide.'
Mars, the privately-owned confectionery and pet foods group, said a review
of its Dollars 1bn worldwide advertising expenditure would take 'weeks, if
not months'. Mr Bob Eagle, the company's UK external relations manager,
said: 'Clearly any decision that Maurice Saatchi takes will be taken into
account.'
BA said it was still 'considering' its account with Saatchi after Sir Colin
Marshall, the airline's chairman, had written to the group expressing his
concern about the board changes. BA indicated that it was unlikely to desert
the Saatchi group, but was keeping its options open.
Another client, Mirror Group Newspapers, said it would keep its account with
Saatchi unless it became unhappy with the agency's work. The account would
not be affected by Mr Saatchi's future.
Mr David Herro of Harris Associates, the Chicago fund managers which led the
campaign to oust Mr Saatchi, said yesterday he hoped the deadline of next
Tuesday would be adhered to.
'There is no desire among shareholders to keep prolonging this. We want to
get the whole thing behind us and be finished with it one way or the other.'
Mr Herro added: 'I'll be surprised if Mr Saatchi stays on, but it's possible
he might.'
He described as 'incorrect' reports that he had approved a Pounds 5m share
option package for Mr Saatchi after earlier opposing it.
'We (the US shareholders) objected to the options package as proposed by Mr
Saatchi. We were never opposed to a share option package being put to
shareholders for a vote.'
Mr Herro said that US shareholders controlling 30 per cent of the shares had
wanted Mr Saatchi removed because of unacceptable terms he proposed for an
options package. They were also angry about his opposition to dropping the
'Saatchi' name from the holding company masthead.
Mr Saatchi was on holiday abroad yesterday and unavailable for comment. A
friend said he would not be returning to the UK until January 2.
Mr Saatchi was forced to stand down as chairman of the advertising group he
founded in 1970 two weeks ago after the board succumbed to pressure from US
and UK shareholders.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Athena's debts 'closer to Pounds 15m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Athena Holdings' external creditors are owed between Pounds 10m and Pounds
15m, according to the administrative receivers appointed to the failed card
and poster shop group this week.
Mr Scott Barnes, one of the two receivers and a partner with Grant Thornton,
said yesterday that the figure was 'probably nearer Pounds 15m'. He was not
able to estimate how much of the debt was guaranteed by Pentos. 'There are a
number of creditors, and a number of landlords who are guaranteed by the
holding company - but we are not talking about a huge sum of money,' he
said.
The biggest creditors are likely to be the landlords of Athena's shops, who
are owed about Pounds 3.5m. Of the total 157 outlets, 127 are owned by
Athena Holdings and 30 held under franchise agreements.
Athena's suppliers, which include a number of smaller companies that are
unlikely to recover any of their money, could be hardest hit by the
receivership. They are angry about the timing of the decision to put Athena
into receivership and have sought legal advice about Pentos' action.
The Pentos management is understood to be sympathetic to the plight of the
smaller suppliers but insists that the timing of the decision to put Athena
into administrative receivership was dictated by the failure of talks with
potential buyers of the business.
Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive of Pentos, has said that the group was
willing to 'give Athena away'. However, it is understood that the talks
mainly foundered because of problems with assigning over the shop leases.
Meanwhile, the receivers hope to have developed a survival strategy by the
middle of next week. Mr Barnes said: 'Our strategy is that we want to get
our feet under the table and see which of the shops are viable. We will
probably be left with a rump that we will be able to do something with.'
One option understood to be under consideration is the closure of the 20 or
30 shops thought to be mainly responsible for Athena's losses. The company
lost Pounds 5m before exceptional items on sales of Pounds 16.2m in the six
months to July 2.

FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Coal sell-off marked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Energy Minister Mr Tim Eggar (right) yesterday donned hardhat and overalls
to put the seal on the transfer of British Coal's 15 English pits to private
ownership.
He was visiting the Ashfordby mine, a new 1.5m tonne superpit which, as of
yesterday, is owned by RJB Mining.
Earlier this month the group surprised its critics by raising Pounds 400m
from investors through a placing and public offer to help fund the Pounds
815m purchase. Mr Richard Budge, RJB's chief executive, (left) had been
attacked for the assumptions on coal prices and volumes used to devise his
offer.
RJB's investors were rewarded for backing the controversial bid with a 4p
rise in the shares over the 320p placing price.
However, the old RJB shares fell by 15p to 333p, reflecting the decline in
the mining sector since the shares were suspended at 348p in October. The
difference in price is due to the fact that the new equity is not eligible
for the promised final dividend of 7.3p.
Meanwhile, Coal Investments announced that public investors had taken up
more than half the shares available to them in the Pounds 26m placing and
open offer. The public has applied for 9.45m of the eligible 18.24m open
offer shares on the basis of 4-for-13 at 76 1/2 p.
Coal Investments announced the issue earlier this month to help it fund
capital expenditure and increase its holding in Mining (Scotland), which has
purchased British Coal's Scottish region.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Crunch for Big Bang: Clive Cookson explains why cosmologists
are stunned into silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hubble Space Telescope - previously derided as a Dollars 2.5bn white
elephant in orbit - is redeeming its reputation in spectacular fashion. The
images sent back this year, after astronauts repaired the telescope's
defective mirror, show a myriad of astronomical objects too distant to be
seen with the most powerful Earth-bound observatories.
Hubble's latest observations have thrown cosmologists into a spin, because
they appear to contradict the leading theory for the origin and development
of the universe. Most troubling is their implication that the universe is
only 8bn years old, when many astronomers are confident from other evidence
that the oldest stars have been shining for about 15bn years.
Of course the universe cannot be younger than the stars in it. So, if
further observations confirm these findings, cosmologists will have to
change their views of the universe's birth in a cosmic fireball - the Big
Bang - and its subsequent expansion.
The basic idea of the Big Bang - that everything has grown from an
infinitely small point containing an unimaginably large amount of energy -
is not under serious threat.
But other popular concepts of contemporary cosmology may not survive. One is
the 'flat universe' containing just enough matter for gravity eventually to
stop it expanding but too little to pull everything back together again in a
Big Crunch. The latest Hubble observations are likely to revive support for
the less dense 'open universe' model, in which things will fly apart rapidly
for ever.
They may even tempt scientists to reconsider the idea, originally put
forward by Albert Einstein, of a 'cosmological constant'. This is a fudge
factor, hated and rejected by most cosmologists because they cannot give it
any theoretical foundation, which would counteract the force of gravity and
push the universe apart more rapidly with time.
The Hubble observations are the first phase of an international programme to
assess the scale, size and age of the universe with the space telescope. The
research team found 20 individual stars of a type called Cepheid variables
in the distant M100 galaxy. Astronomers use such stars as 'standard candles'
for measuring interstellar distances, because they pulsate with a frequency
that depends directly on their intrinsic brightness.
By comparing this absolute brightness with the star's apparent brightness
when seen from Earth, the astronomers can estimate its distance - 56m
light-years in the case of the M100 galaxy. They combine this figure with
the star's 'red shift', which shows how fast it is moving away from us, to
calculate Hubble's Constant, the rate at which the universe is expanding.
Finally, to estimate the universe's age, they must adjust the rate for any
deceleration or acceleration since its formation.
The age of 8bn years is derived from the observations by standard
cosmological theory. It can be pushed back by another 3bn years by giving
the universe a very low density (though this might contradict other
astronomical observations). But an age of 15bn years to match the oldest
stars would require an accelerating force - Einstein's dreaded cosmological
constant.
Scientists have reacted very cautiously to the findings, published at the
end of October in the journal Nature - so cautiously that Nature attacked
their silence in an editorial a month later. 'Cosmologists had better say
something,' the journal said.
However, cosmologists themselves say they are waiting for more Hubble
observations, using 'standard candles' in other distant galaxies, to confirm
the first results and reduce their margin of error.
'Within a year or two, we ought to have a more definite measurement,' says
Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University, Britain's new Astronomer-Royal. 'If
it turns out that there is still a big discrepancy with the age of the
oldest stars, then cosmologists will have problems maintaining their
standard theory of the universe.'
The universe's age is the most controversial issue addressed so far with the
Hubble telescope. But the bus-sized instrument has taken many more
spectacular pictures through its new corrective lenses.
Some of the best shots, released this month by the US space agency Nasa,
show parts of the universe billions of light years away - and therefore
billions of years in the past. They reveal for the first time the shape of
galaxies emerging in the young universe.
'There is a menagerie of strange objects that have no counterpart in today's
universe,' said Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore. Most of the stars are arranged in disorganised groups that look
like torn fragments of present-day spiral galaxies but may in fact be their
precursors. Confusingly, mature elliptical galaxies also seem to have
existed within 2bn years of the Big Bang, very similar to today's.
Although it is far too soon for cosmologists to have made sense of the
primeval galactic menagerie, this new evidence suggests that galaxies
started to form very early in the life of the universe. If so, it will lend
more support to the idea of a low-density open universe with a less even
distribution of matter than the popular 'flat universe' model.
Yet another fragment of Hubble evidence in favour of a an ever expanding
universe came in November, when astronomers published the results of a
search for small dim stars, too faint to be seen from Earth, which they
thought might make up some of the universe's 'missing mass'. They found far
fewer than expected.
Unless a space gremlin strikes, Hubble will provide another stunning set of
observations during 1995. The age of the universe should be clearer a year
from now, but the telescope will probably have thrown up another conundrum
by then to silence the cosmologists.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece must show mature approach on
Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SZEMEREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Greece's crocodile tears about Turkey's membership application to the
European Union again being deferred cannot be taken seriously.
Mr Papadopoulos (Letters, December 28) forgets to mention that the reason
for Turkey invading Cyprus was to protect Turkish Cypriots in the event of a
Greek-sponsored terrorist campaign for Enosis (uniting Cyprus and Greece, or
rather making Cyprus a part of Greece) succeeding.
The Turks well remember how the Greeks treated the Turkish population on the
many little Turkish islands in the Mediterranean that were ceded to Greece
between the wars. It was with the very understandable objective of
protecting their kith and kin on Cyprus from being similarly thrown out of
their homes that the Turkish army invaded, scuppering Greece's hopes of
Enosis at the same time.
It is time to let bygones be bygones and for Greece to behave like a mature
member of the EU. It should work to help Turkey come closer to the EU as its
political leaders wish. If Turkey is not kept in the European camp, it may
well flip over and become a fundamentalist Islamic state (like Iran&gt;, which
would present far more problems and dangers to the European Union - and in
particular to its neighbour, Greece.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Some very hot irons in the fire: John Lloyd on the
challenges before President Yeltsin if the war in Chechnya is not to topple
him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin has not necessarily doomed either reform or his
presidency by making war on the leadership of Chechnya. There is a perfectly
feasible scenario that would see him retaining both power and the ability to
govern in the months ahead. But the longer the war continues, the more dire
are its consequences and the less likely become his chances of survival as
an effective, reforming president.
The scenario favouring Yeltsin's survival goes like this. The war is won in
the near future, as now seems more likely - in the sense that the Russian
army takes Grozny, kills or captures General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen
leader, and reduces the remaining fighters to partisan bands operating with
difficulty from mountain bases.
The Russian government then pumps enough money into the little territory to
give it at least the appearance (and probably also some of the reality) of
relative well-being. It contains the Chechens' armed hostility to Russia
within the borders of Chechnya. It finds leaders - such as Mr Salimbek
Khadzhiev, a former Soviet energy minister and presently 'prime minister' of
the Russian - backed Chechnya government in exile - who will command some
respect and support in the territory after General Dudayev's gruesome reign.
And the central government begins to weave Chechen life back into Russia
through a treaty that devolves at least as much power to Chechnya as has
been granted to the republic of Tatarstan.
This achieved, the financial cost is borne through increased oil exports
(which Chechnya has, albeit in modest quantities). Secessionists with
ambitions for other regions of the Russian Federation are taught a salutary
lesson, and politics in Russia returns to bumpy normalcy.
It is possible. But to become reality, the Russian government must deal with
the following consequences of the war, which are already evident.
First, the near-mutiny in the upper ranks of the army must be properly
addressed. At least half a dozen senior generals, and probably many more,
have refused to fight in Chechnya or give their support to the campaign
there.
The Russian armed forces are rich in generals and can afford to lose a few
(or a few hundred). But those who have signalled open dissent are
high-profile, sometimes politically active and popular men in their early
middle years with the ambition to do a lot of damage to the existing
authorities.
Mr Yeltsin and General Pavel Grachev, his defence minister, must
convincingly punish insubordination or defuse it. The indications are that
General Grachev probably lacks the force and subtlety to do either.
Second, the political base for reforms must be re-established. All the
reformist parties are now in full and open opposition to the president. Mr
Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice, the largest, had given him sometimes
reluctant support through tough times - but now excoriates him. While Mr
Boris Fyodorov's small Liberal Democratic Union supports the war (or at any
rate, he does), it continues to oppose the president on the grounds that he
has ceased to reform.
Mr Yeltsin's new best buddy is Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party; his only complaint is that Mr
Yeltsin is late in coming to a state of imperialist grace. The more
conservative and secretive presidential aides - such as General Alexander
Korzhakov, head of the guard - wield most power, and snarl menacingly if
challenged by the press.
It is still possible for Mr Yeltsin to abandon this network of supporters
and return to the reformers. After all, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev did just that
in the spring of 1991, after dallying with his own reactionaries. But even
for an active president (and Mr Yeltsin is no longer that) it would be hard,
and it may be too late - as it was for Mr Gorbachev.
Third, the economy is suffering from the war. The expense threatens to blow
a hole in a budget designed to be tough; and the president's attention to
economic matters, never great, is now even less.
And yet it is again a critical time. The budget depends on a phased series
of huge loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The
stabilisation of the currency - the main aim of the loans - depends in its
turn on making the budget even tougher than that approved by the state duma,
parliament's lower house, this month.
Moreover, the government will have to stick to its budget targets. Last
year, it squandered opportunities for economic reform by printing money when
the going got rough, while Mr Yeltsin showed he was increasingly willing to
initiate or approve expenditure to keep the social peace or to reward
loyalty.
Mr Yeltsin humbled his government after 'Black Tuesday' in October, when the
rouble lost a quarter of its value against the hard currencies. This
re-established his pre-eminence, but no international financial institution
or government will now find a stabilisation programme credible unless they
also believe he is committed to it. At present, however, he is committed
only to winning in Chechnya.
Fourth, the war is eating into Russia's still substantial reserves of
international goodwill. The leading Moslem states, especially Turkey,
protest at the action against the co-religionists in Chechnya. Non-Moslem
states say it is an 'internal affair', because they can think of no other
response, but they are increasingly concerned by the bloodshed. They are
even more worried by the way pretensions to liberalism are giving way, as
the war progresses, to a domestic authoritarianism, which also embodies
anti-foreign sentiments.
Already, the war has produced a threat from Russia that it will breach the
terms of the treaty it signed in 1990 on conventional armed forces in
Europe, because it considers the limits on armour in the southern part of
Russia too restrictive. Such a unilateral renunciation would sow more
distrust in a west already learning to be more wary than welcoming of
Russia's foreign policy moves.
Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, is spending part of this weekend
explaining Russia's cause in Chechnya to European Union ambassadors. He will
need high powers of persuasion to calm their alarm.
Finally, the war - with its attendant propaganda, lies and threats - is
destructive of public trust in the authorities. Mr Yeltsin promised to stop
the bombing when he addressed his nation on Wednesday, but on Thursday it
was stepped up.
Government propaganda says Gen Dudayev has enslaved his people, but the
defence minister told a meeting of the security council on Monday that the
general had widespread support. And one of the largest claims of this
administration has been a determination to protect the 25m ethnic Russians
who find themselves in other former Soviet states, but many of the
casualties in Grozny have been ethnic Russians with nowhere to go.
Mr Yeltsin may yet pull his irons from the fire. But they are heating up all
the time - and may soon be too hot to handle.

<TEXT>
Sir, Please forgive what might appear to be an unseasonally cynical
observation, but I always wince when I hear so-called insurance experts talk
blithely about underwriters only writing profitable business.
In your edition of December 22, Lex refers to '. . . the temptation for
Lloyd's underwriters to take on poor quality business'; in an adjoining
column, Lloyd's chairman David Rowland is quoted ('Names win in court as
Lloyd's unveils fall in capacity') as saying: 'Lloyd's underwriters are
still being selective in the business that they write. Present market
conditions indicate that there are good opportunities for underwriting
profitable business in 1995.'
If these visionaries know what constitutes 'profitable underwriting' and
'poor quality business' then perhaps luckless Lloyd's Names might rightly
wonder what happened to the underwriters' crystal balls in recent years.
Having recently moved into the area whence this letter hails, Mr Rowland
will soon find there are many here in horse-racing country who claim only to
back winners]

FT  31 DEC 94 / Shakin' off those Wall Street Blues: Philip Coggan on the
prospects in the world's main equity markets in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked to assess the outlook for the world's equity markets in 1995, fund
managers quickly resort to football-speak. 'It will be a year of two halves'
is the common refrain.
In the first six months, many expect worries about rising interest rates to
keep equity markets depressed. But in the second half of the year, they
believe the prospects of a US economic slowdown will allow interest rates to
start falling again, and share prices to rally.
Like defeated footballers, many fund managers and traders will be feeling
sick as parrots after 1994. Whereas in 1993 it was almost ludicrously easy
to make money, this year it has been simple to lose it. In most countries,
it would have been better for investors to leave their money in the bank and
take the year off.
Of the 24 main markets, only eight have seen their stock market indices
rise, in local currency terms, since the start of 1994. The most
substantial, Japan, is a market to which many fund managers have been
underexposed.
In bonds, the story has been worse. Of 21 leading government bond markets,
only Austria produced a positive total return in local currency terms in
1994, according to Kemper Investment Management.
The event that set the tone for the year was the US Federal Reserve's
decision to raise rates in February. While the US bond market had already
been weakening in the face of the accelerating pace of US economic growth,
the initial rise in rates was a watershed.
It signalled the end of a period when it had been possible to 'play the
curve' - borrow at a low short-term rate and invest in long-term bonds, for
a higher income and the chance of capital growth. Those who had speculated
on such gains lost heavily this year, with forced sales of bonds
exacerbating the price falls.
Equities were particularly vulnerable to a decline in bonds, since a fall in
bond prices results in a rise in bond yields. With the return on cash
deposits also rising, the attractions of highly-priced equities dwindled. In
the US, while the narrow Dow Jones Industrial Average has held up reasonably
well, the Russell 2000 index of smaller capitalisation stocks fell 4.5 per
cent over the year.
The rest of the world's financial markets found it impossible to escape the
backwash of US interest rate changes. In part, this was because US investors
had been significant buyers of other countries' equities and bonds in 1993
and moved money back home as US interest rates rose this year.
But in Europe, market weakness also reflected a fundamental change in the
outlook for economic growth. At the start of the year, most investors
expected European interest rates to continue to fall as governments
attempted to stimulate their economies.
By the end of the first quarter, however, it was clear that European
economies were recovering faster than expected and accordingly, the prospect
of interest rate cuts was diluted. Throw in the fear of renewed inflation,
aided and abetted by a surge in commodity prices, and the result was a bad
year for bonds and shares.
When looking at the prospects for 1995, the most important issue for
investors remains the outlook for the US economy and interest rates.
According to Mr Maxwell Ward, the manager of Scottish Mortgage, an
international investment trust, 'the key factor is how much further US
monetary tightening has to run'. He expects the Fed funds rate, currently
5.5 per cent, to reach 7 per cent.
The difficult trick that the equity markets hope the Fed will pull off is to
increase interest rates sufficiently to head off inflationary pressures
without pushing the US economy into recession. The difficulty of pulling
this off means that investors may start the year in cautious mood.
'Uncertainty about how much the Fed will raise rates means that it will be
appropriate to have plenty of cash,' says Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of
equity strategy at Goldman Sachs in London.
'If the US economy does start to slow down in the second and third quarters
of 1995, and bonds started to rally, then I would want to buy equities,'
says Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court. 'But I want to see
the economy slow down first.'
This could be bad news for a recent enthusiasm of international investors -
the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Higher interest rates and
slower economic growth in the US would hit the exports of both areas, and
their growth prospects.
More important in the short term, it might cause an outflow of US mutual
funds from the both regions, particularly after Mexico's recent troubles
highlighted the risks of emerging markets. Since most emerging markets are
small and illiquid, a sudden rush of sellers could lead to a sharp fall in
share prices. Asian markets have already shown signs of suffering at the end
of 1994.
Emerging markets enthusiasts, however, are still confident about the
long-term prospects. 'Developing countries will grow at 5-6 per cent this
year, twice the rate of the major economies,' says Mr Peter Scott, chief
executive of emerging markets specialist Beta Funds. 'While 1995 may see an
initial period of continued weakness, there is a secular trend among
institutions to increase the proportion of their portfolios in emerging
markets. A lot of investors are still very light in the area.'
For the UK and Europe, the early part of the year may simply be a struggle
to escape from the shadow of the US. 'The UK market looks pretty good value
but can't shake off the Wall Street blues,' says Mr Christopher Tracey, a
pensions fund investment director at Robert Fleming.
But Mr Tracey thinks that European corporate earnings will be growing faster
than in any big market except Japan by the end of 1995. That should support
share prices even though interest rates are at, or close to, their bottom in
Europe.
Japan remains an enigma for many western investors. In terms of
price-earnings ratios, Japanese shares look horrendously expensive by
outside standards, but foreign investors have been more enthusiastic about
the market this year than Japanese institutions. Economic recovery in 1995
should boost corporate earnings but investors remain cautious, rather than
bullish.
The most important role that Tokyo might play in 1995 would be if Japanese
investors resumed the substantial purchases of overseas securities that so
boosted international markets in the 1980s.
With all the world's big economies recovering, the fundamental issue for
investors is whether the economic recovery will lead to an inflationary bust
later in the 1990s, or whether there is the chance of a sustained period of
non-inflationary growth.
For much of this year, equity markets have been buffeted by the twin forces
of rising interest rates and higher corporate earnings. The former have been
dominant in 1994, perhaps because investors could not see where the peak of
the interest rate cycle would occur.
But the bulls hope that by the end of 1995, the picture will be clearer. 'My
view is that people will take on board that this is a long, strong economic
upswing in which the peak is several years away, rather than being visible
at the end of 1995,' says Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at broker James
Capel.
In the meantime, investors could face a bumpy ride.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Catholic Church is about faith,
not politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F KILLORAN

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on Pope John Paul II was markedly below par. The form of
the article was too close to that of a hasty, pre-festive rewrite of tired
quotes and cliches to appeal to the readers of the cultural section of your
newspaper.
As to the content, there seemed to be two main points. Contrary to what is
suggested, the Church is not '. . . all about politics . . .' because the
mission of the Church is exclusively supernatural, namely, the holiness of
its members. Second, the Church has not and never has had a 'problem with
birth control'. It has never approved of artificial birth control and,
probably, never will. Further, as its reasons for rejecting birth control
are not religious ones, they can be maintained by those of any religion or
none (as is often the case).
By any measure the present Pope is a giant with a prodigious intellectual
output. It is highly probable that he could have become a major figure in
whatever profession he had chosen.
Robert Graham and Paul Betts have done truth and themselves a disservice by
lending their names to this article.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (1): Catholic Church is about faith,
not politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Graham and Paul Betts make a fundamental error in their article
about the Pope: they refuse to see the Catholic Church with the eyes of
faith and, rather, interpret it as a modern democratic state ('Twilight
crusade of an obdurate Pope', December 24/25). Therefore their
interpretation centres on the idea of a right and left, two groups who could
alternate in their control of the seats of power. This is an attractively
simple approach, particularly when the present holy Father is seen as a man
of the 'far right'. This, however, is a view shared by many writers since
the days of Pope Pius XII and the dream of a dream ticket modern Pope who
would set things to right. The late Peter Hebblethwaite's biography of Pope
Paul VI describes him as the 'first modern pope', but it was Paul VI who
reiterated the Church's clear teaching (taught also by Vatican II) on the
intrinsically sinful nature of artificial contraception.
With the eyes of faith, the Church is not a democracy with majority opinions
ruling on doctrine. There is a clear corpus of doctrine on faith and morals,
which is taught in continuum through the tradition, in a living voice, of
the Church. This body of doctrine may be better explained and understood,
but it can't be explained away. This body of doctrine is held by those who
are faithful to the Church and is found in all the documents of the Church
and Popes. There are many matters in which there may be division from the
Church but not in the minds of these faithful to the Church. People all over
the world are looking for clear, simple explanations and reasons for
believing and they have found them in two best sellers: the Catechism of the
Catholic Church and Crossing the Threshold of Hope. People want their
beliefs to be authenticated and related to something outside themselves, and
perhaps here lies the appeal of the Catholic Church.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Triumph of style over substance: John Griffiths on the craze
for macho, gas-guzzling four-wheel drive vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month's motor shows in Detroit and Los Angeles are expected to confirm
a trend in car-buying that represents the triumph of ego over ecology, lust
over logic, and cult over commonsense.
The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America show that, in the
first 11 months of this year, Americans bought 5.6m of what are described as
light trucks - four-wheel drive cars such as the Jeep Cherokee and Range
Rover, multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) that seat seven or eight adults with
car-like handling, and pick-up trucks.
These 'cult' sectors of the US market have accounted for 43 per cent of
total passenger vehicle sales in 1994. 'It's been trucks, trucks, trucks -
we can't build enough,' according to Mr John Maciarz, a spokesman for market
leader General Motors.
This year, more than any other, light truck sales have outperformed the
conventional car market in the US by a large and growing margin. Sales are
nearly 15 per cent higher than in the same period last year, compared with
growth in car sales of just 5 per cent.
In some western US states and provinces of Canada, their sales now outnumber
those of ordinary cars. Indeed, the single best-selling vehicle in the US is
not a car, but a pick-up: Ford's F-series model outsells the country's best
selling car, the Ford Taurus, by a ratio of 3 to 2.
For most of their owners for most of the time, these vehicles are not ideal
choices: four-wheel drives and MPVs are usually much bigger than they need;
pick-ups have few passenger seats; and all three are simply irrelevant to
any kind of need other than the emotional. Most also consume far more fuel
than anyone needs for basic transportation.
US vehicle makers claim to be almost as nonplussed as environmentalists by
the gulf between the public support for energy and environmental
conservation and the purchase of eccentric gas-guzzlers.
This year, Chrysler has taken the pick-up cult to a new extreme with the
Dodge Ram Laramie SLT Magnum V10. Only three adults can squeeze into its
cab; its rear load deck is open to the elements; and under its bonnet is an
engine with 10 cylinders, eight litres and the ability to out-drag most
sports cars.
Such eccentricity is unlikely to remain confined to the land of Dollars
1-a-gallon gasolene, however. Chrysler's UK importer currently has one on
test, assessing it for a possible niche in the European markets.
Despite several attempts by manufacturers to promote them as both leisure
and utility vehicles, pick-ups have never really caught on in Europe. In the
UK, only slightly more than 3,000 are expected to be sold this year, almost
all to builders and other traders.
But four-wheel drive cars are another story. They have already provided the
beachhead through which Chrysler is re-establishing itself as a manufacturer
to be taken seriously in Europe, with sales of around 20,000 units a year of
its Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models, some assembled at a plant
in Austria.
Last year, according to statistics from market monitoring group Automotive
Industry Data, Europeans bought 300,000 leisure/utility four-wheel drives.
AID forecasts that sales should rise to around 500,000 by the end of the
decade.
Japan's choked roads provide the best support available for those who
contend that the European four-wheel drive market has a long way to grow.
Although the Japanese have even fewer opportunities than Europeans to take
their vehicles off-road, because of greater urban sprawl and tight controls
on the countryside, four-wheel drives account for 6 per cent of the new car
market. To date, their share in Europe is under 3 per cent.
According to AID, buyers justify their purchases by a desire 'to venture
off-road where the mountain goat tenacity of such vehicles is likely to be
needed'. AID's report on European four-wheel drive prospects to the year
2002 says that those interviewed claimed other features, such as styling,
were much less important.
But the report's research into how these vehicles are used showed that most
buyers had little or no need for an off-road capability. 'The overwhelming
majority of vehicle owners, around 95 per cent, are using their four-wheel
drives for nothing more demanding than driving to the office, or for the
daily school run.'
Embarrassed though most buyers might be to admit it, AID suggests, the real
reason for their purchase is simply 'to stand out from the crowd'. To
underline the point, it reports that four-wheel drive owners on average were
found to spend nine times as much as their car-buying counterparts on
appearance-improving extras.
In terms of both purchase and running costs, four-wheel drives can be a very
expensive way of being different. In September, the UK Rover Group's
subsidiary, Land Rover, launched the latest version of its flagship Range
Rover model, developed as part of a four-year, Pounds 300m investment
programme. Priced at up to Pounds 44,000, it has taken the vehicles into
direct competition with established luxury car producers such as
Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota).
The Range Rover, its cheaper stablemate the Discovery and the more
utilitarian Land Rover Defender have been big success stories in the world
market for four-wheel drives. The company's output at the end of the 1980s
was fewer than 50,000. This year the total will reach a record 85,000, and
the company expects to sell 100,000 units or more in the new year.
With so much at stake, Land Rover executives strongly defend their
four-wheel drive vehicles, maintaining they offer more than an ego trip. The
Discovery, they say, is gradually taking over the market for big estate
cars, typified by Volvo, because of its commanding driving position above
other traffic and multi-seat flexibility, as well as style and image.
Critics maintain that the perception of usable space is exaggerated. They
add that the current cult status of the vehicles could quickly be undermined
if there is a revival in concerns over the stability of these cars, which
have a high centre of gravity. Small Suzuki four-wheel drives faced a
barrage of criticisms over rollover safety in the 1980s. More recently, the
deaths of a woman and her two children in a motorway accident in the UK,
when their Range Rover rolled over the central barrier into oncoming
traffic, has revived industry unease over the safety image of four-wheel
drive cars.
Yet manufacturers continue to crowd into the sector, and the vehicles
themselves grow ever more varied. Volvo is reported to have developed a
four-wheel drive prototype; Ford may introduce its large Explorer model into
Europe; and Korea's SSangyong will introduce its first four-wheel drive to
Europe during 1995. Meanwhile, Japan's Mitsubishi has just launched a
Japan-only, 600cc mini version of its popular Pajero/Shogun vehicle.
Two of Europe's biggest carmakers, Peugeot and Fiat, stand out from the
trend, however, as absentees from this sector of the market. Both Peugeot's
chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Fiat Auto's director-general, Mr Giorgio
Garuzzo, maintain that four-wheel drives will end up in a market wilderness
and that the best growth prospects for niche vehicles lies with
multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). Their own efforts have gone into producing
such a vehicle jointly, already in production as the Fiat Ulysse, Peugeot
806 and Citroen Synergie.
But for 'green' critics of Europe's current modest craze for the
fuel-gulping, macho-looking four-wheel drives, the future looks bleak. The
latest vehicle sales statistics from North America suggest that, short of a
public outcry over their safety, there will be many more of these vehicles
on Europe's roads by the end of 1995.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Let good times roll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Happy days are here again, although grumpy voters seem hardly to have
noticed. Yet a wonderful opportunity for sustained and increasingly global
economic growth is waiting to be seized.
A year ago, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
thought the economies of its members would grow by 2.1 per cent. In the
forecast released just before Christmas, that had already been increased to
2.8 per cent.
In the case of the US, last year's forecast was for growth of 3.1 per cent,
but this is now expected to reach 3.9 per cent. Europe as a whole has
performed markedly better than expectations: last year's forecast was for
growth of 1.5 per cent, which is now expected to be 2.3 per cent. There is a
particularly big change in Germany, whose GDP was expected to grow by only
0.8 per cent in 1994 and is now forecast to grow by 2.8 per cent. Even
Japan's performance has exceeded expectations: growth was forecast at 0.5
per cent a year ago, but is now expected to reach 1 per cent. Meanwhile,
inflation - as measured by the GDP deflator, the broadest single measure of
inflation - is expected to be a mere 2.1 per cent in the OECD area as a
whole (excluding Turkey). This is, in sum, as close as industrial countries
are ever likely to come to the long-sought grail of non-inflationary growth.
In 1993, OECD countries enjoyed export growth of 8.7 per cent to non-OECD
markets, this being one of the reasons why wide-spread fears that the
recession would turn into a depression came to nothing. Overall, the volume
of world merchandise trade is now forecast by the OECD to grow 8.9 per cent
in 1994, followed by another 8.2 per cent in 1995. The global economy is
becoming increasingly integrated.
The benefits of growth are also increasingly widespread. One intriguing
piece of information provided by the OECD is that by 1993 the exports and
imports of what it calls the Dynamic Asian economies (South Korea, Taiwan.
Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand) were comparable in size to
those of the US.
US monetary policy
But, like a fragrant ointment, this one also contains several flies.
One is the probability of tighter US monetary policy. US equity markets have
held up surprisingly, given the rise in both short- and long-term interest
rates during 1994. As the Federal Reserve moves to tighten further, will the
price of equities continue to levitate? Another possible effect would be a
sharp reversal of flows of money into the emerging markets. Yet another
could be the long-awaited strengthening of the US dollar. But the latter
would also bring advantages, including a curb on US inflationary pressures,
now threatened by high levels of capacity utilisation.
Another fly is to be found in Europe. Higher short-term interest rates
cannot now be far away in Germany. While perfectly sensible for Germany
itself, any such tightening would be inappropriate for France. Further
exchange rate instability within Europe could not then be ruled out.
The three fattest flies of all, however, are fears of inflation, the state
of public finances and the risks of protectionism.
Inflation fears
Nothing suggests an immediate inflationary resurgence, but the ghost of
inflation past will take many, many years to forget. The decline in bond
markets this year was partly a correction of an earlier speculative bubble.
But it was more than that. Evidence from the UK, Canada and Australia, all
of which offer index-linked government bonds, suggests that there has been
both an increase in real yields and an increase in inflationary
expectations. Moreover, inflationary expectations seem to be almost
universally above announced targets. If monetary authorities were to deliver
on their promises, there could, once again, turn out to have been much
unsound borrowing and lending. If they were not to, the battle for
credibility would have to be refought.
The OECD notes that gross public debt is likely to rise as a percentage of
GDP in nearly all OECD countries between 1993 and 1996. The public sector
deficits are worrying for their effects on real interest rates. But there is
also some risk of a first-world debt crisis. Italy, Canada, Belgium, Sweden
and Greece all have ratios of public sector debt to GDP of close to 100 per
cent, or more. If these countries do not use the recovery to lower debt
ratios, a contagious crisis cannot be ruled out.
The integration of the global economy, for all its potential benefits, also
brings about politically disturbing changes. Global competition is one
reason (though not the most important) for the pervasive insecurity that has
made this such a joyless recovery. There is a risk, for all the success in
creating the World Trade Organisation, that the demagogues of protection
will become irresistible.
The flies are there. Nevertheless, 1995 should be a happy new year, followed
by many more. To ensure this, the recovery must be used to entrench the
conditions for sustainable growth. 1995 will be an ideal year for that.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Engineer of the electronic era: Bill Gates, chairman and
co-founder of Microsoft, is the FT's Man of the Year. He talks to Louise
Kehoe about his vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Microsoft in 1975, their slogan was:
'A personal computer on every desk and in every home.'
At the time, it was an outrageously ambitious proposition, since the
personal computer was little more than a toy for computer hobbyists. Today,
however, that vision is rapidly approaching reality, with more than 45m PCs
sold worldwide this year alone.
The vast majority of those PCs run Microsoft software programs such as the
Windows operating system and applications like Word and Excel, the
spreadsheet. This has made the company - based at Redmond, near Seattle in
the north-west Pacific state of Washington - by far the largest software
publisher in the world, with revenues of Dollars 4.65bn in fiscal 1994.
Microsoft's success has also made Gates the richest person in the US, with
an estimated net worth of more than Dollars 9bn (much of it tied up in
Microsoft shares).
These achievements alone make Gates a man whose every pronouncement is
scrutinised by the computer industry and analysed by investors. But in 1994,
he has added further to his stature, with plans for products that will bring
the information superhighway into every sphere of life.
Microsoft's planned acquisition of Intuit, announced in October, adds
Quicken, the leading PC personal finance program, to the company's software
portfolio. Gates recently unveiled plans to create the Microsoft Network, a
global online service supplying information, bulletin boards, electronic
mail and entertainment to PC users through cable and telephone lines.
The company has also fended off challenges to its business practices -
alleged to have been anti-competitive - from the Federal Trade Commission
and the US Justice Department's antitrust division. A cloud that has hung
over the company's future for four years has been lifted.
But it is as an architect of the next industrial revolution - the
convergence of computer, communications and entertainment technologies -
that we choose Gates as our Man of the Year for 1994. In an end-of-the-year
interview with the Financial Times, he predicts that such technologies will
soon have an impact on every sphere of life - commerce, education,
communication, medicine and entertainment.
Within the next decade, Gates says, information highways will link most
businesses to their customers and suppliers. Wallet or wristwatch PCs will
be able electronically to transfer funds directly to shop cash registers, as
well as store personal identification documents and even family photos.
Doctors will have direct video links to emergency response teams. Teachers
will have access to resources that enable them to bring multimedia lessons
to the classroom. Interactive television services will provide news and
entertainment in the home tailored to the user's personal interests.
'We are investing way, way, way in advance to create the software platforms
and tools for such services,' Gates says. Microsoft has 600 programmers
dedicated to this effort and many more working indirectly on his long-term
goals.
'It is a huge investment and it is based on our belief that these kind of
electronic applications will catch on in a very big way before the end of
the century. Our investment level is predicated on having millions of people
hooked up to broadband (high speed, multimedia) networks within the next
three or four years.'
The pace of computer technology change is accelerating, Gates warns. 'Every
company is going to have to avoid business as usual. The only big companies
that succeed will be those that obsolete their own products before somebody
else does.'
While others in the computer industry may consider Microsoft unassailable,
Gates says he is driven by a 'latent fear' that the company could become
complacent and allow itself to be overtaken by nimbler competitors. It
happened to other large computer companies such as IBM, he points out.
In pursuit of his 'information highway' strategy, Gates is reaching beyond
the computer industry to form partnerships with telephone companies such as
BT and France Telecom, with cable television networks such as
Tele-Communications of the US, and with publishers and Hollywood producers.
A partnership with Visa, the credit card company, could allow secure online
purchasing of goods and services.
Making computers more user-friendly is essential to the proliferation of
information highway services, Gates believes. Microsoft plans to create
easy-to-use, fun 'social interfaces' for the intelligent electronic devices
of the future.
The first product of these efforts will be launched next month. Code-named
'Utopia', it is a first attempt at anthropomorphism in the PC industry, a
program that endows the desktop computer with a 'personality'. Users will
choose one of 10 cartoon-like characters as a friend and helper, guiding
them through tasks, reminding them of things that need to be done and
finding information on other computers via telecom networks.
Gates views the new-found success of the CD-Rom - discs that can store large
amounts of information in the form of text, pictures, music or video - as
the most important development in the PC industry this year. For years,
Microsoft's attempts to interest the PC industry, software publishers and
others in the CD-Rom fell flat. As the publishing medium for computer games,
reference books, shopping catalogues and other PC programs, it is now the
key in creating a new generation of 'multimedia PCs'.
'Really to see that electronic publishing form take off is pretty
fundamental and it carries us into the next phase of computing,' he says.
That next phase is the development of online services. 'People are really
starting to see the PC as a communications tool,' says Gates. 'Look at the
explosion of electronic mail, the Internet and growth in online services.'
He acknowledges that Microsoft Network will face significant competition,
particularly in the US, from existing services such as Compuserve and
America Online. But he seems to relish the battle: the company will create
superior software technology, he claims.
'We have about 50 things that even in the first version will be far better
than the online services have. We will make it very easy for people to do
electronic mail, use bulletin boards, make purchases online . . .
'Even eight or nine months before we get into the business we have had an
impact. Established companies are starting to think: 'Oh, we had better get
more content, do better marketing.' Already we are making the market more
competitive.'
Such boasts give substance to the charge of his critics - and there are many
in the computer industry - that Microsoft effectively dampens competition
with its grandiose 'pre-announcing' of its planned products. Because of the
company's dominance and resources, few software groups can risk a
head-to-head market battle.
This was one of many complaints about Microsoft investigated in the past
four years by the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department's
antitrust division. The investigation ended this year with an agreement, due
to be approved in court next month, involving minor changes to Microsoft's
software licensing practices.
Gates is surprisingly sanguine about the investigation: 'It is to be
expected, when somebody is as successful as we are in an important part of
the economy, that regulators would review the situation to see if it is a
competitive market.'
He complains, nonetheless, that Microsoft is unique in having been
investigated by two government agencies. 'There are not many people who have
had every electronic mail message and everything that they have done
subjected to the kind of scrutiny that we had here.'
The end of the antitrust investigation has not, however, ended the barrage
of criticism and 'Bill bashing' from industry rivals.
One frequent accusation is that Microsoft is not an innovative company.
Rather than inventing new products, it copies the ideas of others, critics
maintain. Windows, Microsoft's PC operating system program, for example, is
still seen by many as an imitation of Apple Computer's Macintosh software.
Most of the criticism is sour grapes, says Richard Shaffer, president of
Technologic, an industry consulting group. 'Like the Japanese computer
companies, Microsoft may not be an inventor, but it perfects products. It is
more important to get the product right, than to be first.'
Getting the product right, however, is proving to be a drawn-out effort for
Windows 95, Microsoft's newest version of Windows. Recently the company
announced that the product will not be available until next August, three
months after its last 'due date' and almost two years after the product was
originally expected.
Gates says the delay is not significant. It is more important, he maintains,
that the product should be compatible with the broad range of PCs and
applications that are currently in use.
Fear of Microsoft's unbounded ambitions and envy of its success are
undoubtedly at the root of much of the criticism that the company receives.
But Gates's personal style does not help. While he can be charming and
friendly on a good day, he can be testy and abrasive, even in front of TV
cameras. At industry gatherings, he often seems condescending, dismissing
any challenge to his ideas. In company meetings, he is prone to outbursts.
'That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard' is a typical Gates line.
'Part of Bill's style of presenting, clarifying and challenging ideas is to
be very blunt and a little bit dramatic and some would say a little rude,'
says Steve Balmer, Microsoft executive vice-president, one of Gates's
closest friends for 20 years. 'But he is a lot less rude than he was 10
years ago]'
Apart from a Porsche sports car and a Dollars 35m mansion under construction
on the outskirts of Seattle, Gates is not conspicuous in spending his
wealth. One exception was his purchase in November of an illustrated
manuscript by Leonardo Da Vinci for Dollars 30.8m.
He likes to keep his private life private. Newly wed to Melinda French, a
Microsoft product manager, Gates bristles at any mention of his personal
life, which he does not consider a matter of public interest.
Said by some to be the computer industry's answer to Henry Ford, and by
others to be the most powerful US businessman since Rockefeller, Bill Gates,
at 39, still has plenty of time to outdo both.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Thorp's orders for phase two halved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cancellation this week of a second German contract means that British
Nuclear Fuels has lost nearly half its orders for the second phase of its
Thorp spent fuel reprocessing plant. But it will receive cancellation
penalties totalling nearly Pounds 100m from the two German utilities.
The company confirmed yesterday that the Gundremmingen nuclear power station
on the Danube has opted out of a contract for 425 tonnes of spent fuel. This
is more than three times the size of the 125 tonne contract that BNF lost
last week when the Hamburg-based HEW station also cancelled.
The combined loss represents just under half the 1,200 tonnes BNF had
secured for the 10 years from 2004 to 2014. Total capacity for that period
is about 7,000 tonnes.
Thorp, built at a cost of Pounds 2.9bn, received the go-ahead in 1993. Its
operating life has been divided into two 10-year periods. The first, known
as base load, runs to 2004, and also has a capacity of 7,000 tonnes which is
fully booked.
BNF said yesterday that the lost contracts represented about 4 per cent of
its total Pounds 9bn order book. But it emphasised that the loss would not
affect the economic viability of the plant, which was calculated on the base
load period only.
Although there had been concerns that more German utilities might pull out
before the year-end deadline, after which cancellation charges rise sharply,
BNF said it believed its other contracts were secure.
The power stations that pulled out cited a recent change in German law
permitting direct disposal of nuclear waste in an underground repository
instead of reprocessing. Both utilities are also believed to have come under
political pressure to use alternatives to reprocessing, which produces
plutonium.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Reform of quango recruitment urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should surrender its powers of appointment to public bodies
to an independent commission or parliamentary select committee, the British
Medical Association said yesterday.
There has been considerable criticism of appointments to bodies which run
the National Health Service at local level. The government has been accused
of favouring Tory party members, supporters of free-market economics and
people with business rather than health backgrounds.
There have also been complaints that the 1991 NHS reforms have made health
authorities less accountable to the public by removing local authority
representatives.
In a discussion paper, the medical association acknowledges that the
centralised NHS has 'never been a model of local democratic accountability
comparable with local authorities' but says that, in the past, the
authorities responsible for local decisions - though unelected - had public
confidence.
In 1994 a committee was set up to advise on appointments to Scottish health
boards after concerns about accountability.
Yesterday's paper says: 'We suggest that this development, which still
leaves the final decision with the secretary of state, be taken one stage
further and that responsibility for appointments. . . be given to an
independent commission, or placed under the jurisdiction of a body such as a
select committee.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Employers wary of a marriage made in Milton Keynes: Tecs and
chambers of commerce are set for a wave of mergers, reports Motoko Rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you call the private-sector, employer-led bodies which provide a
range of business services?
Business leaders could not be blamed for throwing up their hands in
confusion at the number of organisations which fit this bill.
Milton Keynes, for instance, had two - Milton Keynes and North
Buckinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council, and Milton Keynes Chamber
of Commerce. When they polled local businesses, they found many were not
sure of the difference between the two.
Now there is no longer a distinction. In December the chamber and the Tec -
one of the 82 employer-led bodies which administer government-funded
training in England and Wales - formed one organisation to provide services
such as training, export advice, political lobbying services and networking.
The merger, the first of its kind, follows the government's decision to
allow voluntary mergers between individual Tecs and chambers of commerce. It
is understood that more than 10 other Tecs and chambers are planning similar
partnerships.
Mr Michael Hind, chief executive of the merged Milton Keynes body, said: 'We
thought we had a responsibility to clarify marketplace confusion. There will
now be a powerful and unified voice for the local business community.'
Although the Tec National Council and the British Chambers of Commerce
support such mergers, some members of the business community are far less
enthusiastic.
The Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small Businesses have
warned that the merged entities could be a backdoor route to the
establishment of statutory chambers on the model of continental Europe,
where levies are charged to every business.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, which
represents 22,851 small businesses, said: 'Once the merged bodies are in
place, it will become more obvious that they are an extension of government
because the Tecs are an extension of government.'
The Tecs receive government funding, but are set up as private companies.
Any merged organisation must ensure that its structure prevents public funds
being used for the chamber's business lobbying purposes. The new entity must
also fulfil all requirements set down by the government in its contracts
with Tecs, and maintain the central functions of both organisations.
The government has emphasised that the mergers are voluntary and that a new
body must 'demonstrate that it is representative of the full range of
employers in its area and not just its membership base'.
The new Milton Keynes organisation will have a turnover of about Pounds
11.5m in 1995, a membership of about 1,300 businesses and a combined staff
of 90. No redundancies are planned. An interim board, with members from both
bodies, has been appointed.
Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National
Council, said the new organisations would be expected to boost their
membership and their accountability, expand membership services, and work to
increase their co-operation with Business Links - the trade department's
network of one-stop advice shops.
Mr Mendham said he wondered whether the merged entities would be responsive
to business needs. 'Tecs and the chambers are doing what they think is right
for the small-business community,' he said. 'But they do not have a clear
understanding of what the small-business community actually wants.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / North-south divide seen to narrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most UK regions prospered more than London and south-east England in 1993,
narrowing the north-south divide, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
In its first review of UK economic output and income by region in 1993, the
CSO reported that gross domestic product per head grew strongest in Wales
and the southwest while the north-west, Northern Ireland, and Yorkshire and
Humberside also performed better than average.
Because of slower growth, Greater London and the south-east saw their GDP
per head fall relative to the UK average for the fourth successive year
while the east Midlands also lost ground in the two years to 1993. Scotland
and Northern Ireland maintained gains won in the previous two to three years
mainly at the expense of the south-east.
Greater London's share of GDP fell 0.2 percentage points between 1987 and in
1993 to 14.9 per cent while the share of the rest of the south-east fell
more sharply to 20.6 per cent in 1993 from 21.1 per cent in 1990.
But Greater London and the south-east remained by far the most prosperous UK
regions. At Pounds 11,528 and Pounds 10,215 respectively, GDP per head in
London and in the rest of the south-east was 24.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent
higher than the UK average.
The south-east including London contained about 30 per cent of the UK
population in 1993 but accounted for more than 35 per cent of GDP.
South-east GDP per head, at Pounds 10,728, was 16 per cent above the UK
average of Pounds 9,248.
By contrast, GDP per head in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were all
below the UK and English averages. While Scotland came close to the UK
average with GDP per head of Pounds 9,104, Wales and Northern Ireland
trailed with Pounds 7,831 and Pounds 7,574 respectively.
Marked differences in industrial structures explained some of the variation.
The east Midlands were hit by coalmine closures in 1993 while increased oil
activity boosted Scottish output. Manufacturing output in Wales and Northern
Ireland grew at rates well above the national average in the year while
Northern Ireland also reported above-average growth rates in the
distribution, hotels, catering and repair sectors.

FT  31 DEC 94 / IoD chief outlines action for growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors,
yesterday backed Mr John Major's suggestion that the scene was set for
continued growth in 1995 but urged further steps to ensure prosperity.
He said that with inflation below 3 per cent, growth at 4 per cent, exports
rising strongly and unemployment falling, 'we have a very sound platform for
cementing the recovery'.
But in a new year message he stressed that other measures were needed to
take full advantage of the upswing.
A business-friendly tax regime to encourage investment and expansion and a
smaller proportion of the national wealth being spent by government 'would
put Britain back on the road to prosperity', he said.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Blair allies fear Clause IV fight will harm image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allies of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, are worried that the party's
modernising image may be undermined by opposition to plans to scrap the
party's Clause IV commitment to widespread nationalisation.
Amid growing evidence of unease among constituency activists, Mr John
Prescott, deputy leader, insisted yesterday that reform of Clause IV was an
important symbol of changes in Labour's approach to the economy.
He told BBC Radio: 'Whilst public ownership is a very important element of
Labour's political thinking, that clause does seem to suggest that
everything could be taken into public ownership.'
Mr Prescott said the leadership was not contemplating defeat at a conference
in April which will decide whether to replace the Clause IV commitment to
'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'.
The prospect of a leadership defeat was reduced earlier this month when the
party's National Executive Committee decided that the conference would vote
on only one alternative to the clause, ruling out compromise amendments.
However, Mr Blair is concerned that anything less than an emphatic victory
will be interpreted as an indication of a split in the party and uncertainty
over the direction of his leadership.
In an attempt to head off the critics, Mr Blair's senior allies are
supporting pro-reform groups, including the New Clause IV Campaign, set up
to argue for change in the constituencies.
Mr Kevin Barron, MP for Rother Valley and a leading member of the New Clause
IV Campaign, said the group would seek to prevent constituency parties from
mandating conference delegates to vote against change by passing resolutions
without debate.
However, in an indication of the strength of grassroots concern, 26
resolutions defending Clause IV have been tabled for the party's Scottish
conference in March, when activists hope to win an important symbolic
victory over the reformers.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Ashdown warns on Eurorebel 'success'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, warned in a new year message
to party members that the UK's commitment to the European Union was being
successfully undermined by the Tory party's Eurosceptic rebels.
He said: 'European Union is the most important political idea of our
century. But it is in danger of dying just when we need it most. Just when
the case for the European Union is strongest, the sceptics have the best
tunes to sing.
'Unless those who believe in the European project are prepared to stand up
and defend their vision, then 1995 could be the year when the idea of union
in Europe began to die for want of people with the courage to defend it.'
Mr Ashdown accused the government of being 'weak, diffident and uncertain'
in the face of Eurosceptic attacks on the EU, which was the best hope for
containing nationalism in western Europe and preventing war in the east.
'Britain now has a broken-backed government - a government that has lost its
way, its majority in the House (of Commons) and the trust of the country.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats had an opportunity to provide 'the
backbone for constructive change' in 1995, building on the party's victory
in the Eastleigh by-election in June, its gains in the May local elections
and two victories in the June European Parliament elections.
However, Mr Ashdown ignored the party's steady decline to about 13 per cent
of the projected vote in the opinion polls since the election of Mr Tony
Blair as Labour leader last summer.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Monks says tide has turned decisively for unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tide 'turned decisively towards trade unionism' in 1994 and 1995 will be
'crucial' for its continuing renewal, Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress
general secretary, says today in his new year message.
He says that unions must adopt four priorities for action in 1995: To win
the argument for a new legal system of representation and recognition for
all British workers.
To press home the case for minimum wage legislation to protect the low-paid.
To develop partnership relations with employers on a wider basis.
To make the case that competitiveness and performance at work depend
crucially on good training, career development and job security rather than
deregulation and insecurity.
Mr Monks also points to a wide range of issues on which he says unions have
made a comeback during the past year.
These include 'significant victories' to prevent Post Office privatisation
and government-imposed cuts in the level of criminal injuries compensation.
Mr Monks also points to the breakthrough in the European social agenda, in
spite of the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty.
He also draws comfort from a report by the Tory-dominated Commons employment
committee which recognised that unions had a positive role to play.
'Its language was light years away from the rhetoric of the 'enemy within'
and crude hostility to unions of the 1980s,' he said.
Mr Monks added that the standing of unions had never been higher than it was
now among the public, while job insecurity and concern over top executive
pay rises had heightened the attraction of belonging to a trade union.
In his new year message Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
general union, said union negotiators should seek a guarantee that workers
should share in the success of the companies they worked for with pay rises
that matched those being taken by chief executives.
He said: 'We have to break this cycle of only rewarding the bosses and
shareholders for increased productivity and profitability. Workers should
share success as well.'

The government yesterday stepped up pressure on health authorities to reduce
junior doctors' hours.
Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, urged authorities and health trusts to
act as soon as possible to set up the extra 300 consultant posts he recently
announced. He said: 'The sooner these new consultants are in post the sooner
we can achieve real and sustained improvements in hours.'
Mr Malone also announced that tougher checks on the hours junior doctors
worked would be introduced from February. The new system of checks would
require returns on hours of work and contracted hours to be collected and
validated in partnership with junior doctors, he said.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Labour prepares for minimum wage battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is to put proposals for a minimum wage at the centre of its attack on
the government's employment policies in a high-profile campaign planned for
the new year.
Party leaders believe that the campaign for a floor on earnings could hurt
the government as much as Labour's effective attack on tax increases since
the last general election.
In a further challenge to the government's employment policies, Labour
called for tougher job protection laws to prevent thousands of redundancies
in the privatised utilities.
Mr Ian McCartney, shadow employment minister, claimed that the privatised
utilities plan to cut 66,100 jobs over the next five years, in addition to
127,841 redundancies since the privatisations took place.
He said: 'This year will be remembered for the obscenity of huge pay rises
for top executives, paid for with the jobs of loyal employees. It is the
government's duty to defuse the job cuts bombshell waiting to go off in
1995.
'The government must make it plain that it is not acceptable for these
utilities to lay people off just to give a short-term boost to the balance
sheet.'
The thrust of Labour's minimum wage campaign is set out in a letter to
Labour MPs from Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, and a close
political ally of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.
According to the letter, Labour will argue that the UK's job creation record
is inferior to that of several countries which have a minimum wage,
including the US.
The party will also seek support from employers by arguing that
taxpayer-funded benefits such as family credit are subsidising low wages
paid by unscrupulous companies.
Ms Harman tells Labour MPs: 'We will be involving employers in the debate,
many of whom treat their employees fairly, and do not want to be undercut by
rogue employers.'
Labour strategists believe the campaign for a minimum wage can be built on
the party's successful defence of the Agricultural Wages Board, which was
rescued from abolition following a consensus between employers and trade
unions.
Ms Harman says: 'We will be linking our arguments on the minimum wage with
our concern that our economy can only prosper if we have a high-skill,
high-tech, high-investment, high-productivity economy.
'In 1993 and 1994 we turned tax from an issue which the Tories used against
us to one which is destroying them at the polls. We will do the same on the
minimum wage.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Kenyans go on equity buying spree: Leslie Crawford on the
build-up to the Nairobi bourse opening to foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to open Nairobi's Stock Exchange to foreign investors from
January was enough to send prices and trading volumes soaring in the last
two weeks of 1994.
The NSE's cramped trading floor saw business jump by 35 per cent as local
investors bought all the blue-chip shares they could muster. The NSE index
rose from 3,556 points in mid-December to 4,559.40 in the final trading
session of the year. But the speculative buying spree, ahead of an
anticipated avalanche of foreign orders for Kenyan equity, may yet leave
speculators high and dry.
Most analysts believe foreign investors are unlikely to make an early move
into Kenyan shares. Although Nairobi's 13 licensed stock brokers have been
bombarded with faxes from abroad, inquiries are still at an early stage.
Factors which make Nairobi less attractive than other emerging markets
include the strength of the Kenya shilling (which makes Kenyan securities
expensive in dollar terms); the expensive 2.5 per cent brokerage commission
fixed by NSE members; a lack of liquidity in the market - only 2.73 per cent
of the total listed number of shares are traded in a year; and relatively
high price-earnings ratios, ranging from 11 to 28 for the most actively
traded stocks.
In addition, the NSE has comparatively little to offer compared to its
larger sister in South Africa. The NSE's 52 listed companies have a total
market capitalisation of only Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.5bn), compared with
Johannesburg's market capitalisation of Dollars 250bn.
It is true that there are many well run and highly profitable listed
companies in Kenya, particularly in the financial sector and among the tea
and coffee estates. But most of these tend to be subsidiaries of big
multinationals - Brooke Bond, Barclays, Standard Chartered, BAT - and
analysts believe it may be wiser for foreign investors to buy shares in the
parent companies and avoid the country and foreign exchange risks of Kenya.
'This is a very small and a highly speculative market,' says one of
Nairobi's top stockbrokers. 'What worries me is that it might become a
casino with the entry of foreign capital. You only need Dollars 20m to
manipulate Kenyan shares any way you want.' The average daily trading volume
rarely exceeds Dollars 150,000.
New investment regulations aim to limit the impact of foreign capital on the
small bourse by restricting foreign investors to a maximum 20 per cent
shareholding in publicly quoted companies. But it is hard to foresee even
that amount of shares becoming available in such an illiquid market.
Many brokers believe the NSE should concentrate on attracting more local
companies and investors, before wooing foreign investment funds whose
individual portfolios dwarf the size of the entire Nairobi bourse.
'We have held a number of seminars on how companies can benefit by going
public,' says Mr Jimnah Mbaru, NSE chairman and chief executive of Dyer and
Blair stockbrokers. Since the liberalisation of interest rates last year, Mr
Mbaru believes it makes more sense for Kenyan companies to finance new
investments by issuing equity rather than borrowing from banks. He expects a
minimum of eight new companies to seek a listing on the NSE in 1995.
With much of East Africa adopting increasingly convergent economic policies
 -exchange rates are being freed, trade barriers are coming down, foreign
investment is being encouraged - Mr Mbaru also believes Kenyan manufacturing
companies will need fresh capital in the coming year to take advantage of an
expanding regional market.
Finance houses may also be tempted to go public, as the Central Bank is
raising their minimum operating capital requirements.
Such changes are expected to increase the relevance of the NSE as a source
of domestic capital for the Kenyan economy. But it may be wishful thinking
to believe that Nairobi's still-infant stock market will attract anything
more than a marginal interest from overseas.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Mexican president calls for new pay and prices pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE, STEPHEN FIDLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Attempting to calm fears about an inflationary spiral, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo claimed in a nationwide address on Thursday that any
devaluation-inspired economic problems would be 'transitory'. To get through
this period, the president said a new accord would be reached between
business and labour to prevent wages and prices from getting out of hand.
Attention has now turned towards intense negotiations to revise the Pacto,
Mexico's basic economic covenant among the leaders of government, business
and labour.
If the new Pacto can work, Mexico could yet emerge from the present crisis
on stronger footing. If it fails, the problems deriving from devaluation
will be much more lasting.
A senior government official said that the fight against inflation would
depend on heading off demands for higher wages and that President Zedillo
was working hard to convince labour unions to accept a short-term sacrifice
in real wages as the price for keeping the inflationary bubble small. 'The
president is spending a lot of political capital on the Pacto,' said the
official.
The Pacto began as a stop-gap measure in November 1987 when inflation hit
157 per cent and the Mexican economy was threatening to unravel. The
government mobilised its considerable political might, brought unions and
business leaders to the table and hammered out an agreement that was
critical in reducing inflation considerably and wages even more.
The Pacto was criticised by market-oriented economists for preventing the
establishment of market rates for labour and thereby increasing
unemployment. Nonetheless, under the administration of Mr Carlos Salinas,
the former president, the Pacto became the cornerstone of economic
decision-making, with every change in economic policy - wage and price
increases, changes in exchange rate policy, government economic projections
 -announced as part of a revised Pacto. It was Mexico's corporate political
system working at its finest, with new Pactos announced, on the average,
every nine months.
Mexico is different now, both politically and economically. The Pactos under
Mr Salinas brought inflation down using a tightly controlled exchange rate
policy as its main hinge.
That basic component is no longer an option. With a floating exchange rate,
controlling inflation is largely going to be a function of lowering
aggregate demand via a suppression of wages. If wages rise too rapidly, the
boost to competitiveness that should come from a devaluation will be lost.
'More important than prices, the government is going to have to find a way
to hold the line on wages,' says Mr Felix Boni, director of economic
research at Interacciones, a Mexican brokerage house. 'It is going to have
to be a throwback to the old corporatist days.'
But at a time when Mexico's corporatist structure is under threat from
continued political instability, controlling the unions may prove difficult.
Getting the leaders to sign should not be much of a problem - they are used
to being told what to do. But the fact that real wages only began to recover
in Mexico in 1993 after a 10-year fall may mean that keeping the unions'
rank-and-file from getting restless will be much tougher than in the past.
Mr Santiago Onate, labour secretary, said wages would rise no higher than
the 7 per cent already granted for 1995. But other officials said a larger
figure than this might have to be conceded.
Mexico's government and Maya Indian guerrillas appear headed for fresh talks
aimed at ending the year-old peasant rebellion in the southern state of
Chiapas, Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. Although there has
been no direct contact between Zapatista chiefs and the President Zedillo's
government, both sides have made concessions aimed at clearing the way for a
new round of peace negotiations.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Soaring inflation likely to stop China freeing prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Continuing inflation of more than 20 per cent is likely to forestall further
price liberalisation in China during the first part of 1995, a government
statistics official suggested yesterday.
The State Statistical Bureau, China's chief economic monitor, reported that
11.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 1994 lifted retail prices
21.7 per cent and the consumer price index by 24.2 per cent for the year.
That inflationary increase is more than double the government's target of 10
per cent for 1994.
Mr Ye Zhen, the bureau spokesman, said China's GDP was Yn4,300bn (Pounds
328.5bn) in 1994, the first time national domestic output has crossed the
Yn4,000bn threshold. The blazing growth rate substantially overshoots the
government's goal of 9 per cent, set in a bid to cool inflation.
In a reversal of a slight downward price trend recorded in November, the
spokesman forecast that inflation would continue to rage into early 1995. He
said it would begin to slow as control measures took effect and would
eventually show a 'big decrease' for the full year. He declined to provide
an inflation target for 1995.
This year, the Chinese economy suffered from 'excessive price rises', Mr Ye
said, as well as reduced grain output and mounting subsidies for state-owned
enterprises. He admitted the 1994 inflation target was unrealistic because
statistics officials underestimated the impact of the lifting of price
controls and had not anticipated the effects of floods and drought that
reduced grain production by 2.5 per cent. But even such setbacks were not
enough to destabilise supply and demand as the agriculture sector grew 3.5
per cent in 1994.
The government, reluctant to close thousands of loss-ridden state
enterprises because of fears of mass unemployment and worker unrest,
reported that these companies' losses as reflected in the state budget
jumped 27.6 per cent last month. Industrial output was reported to have
surged by 18 per cent in 1994.
With state industry and pricing reform stalled by economic and political
uncertainty, western analysts predict the bleak inflation outlook will not
improve soon, since the government seems ready to tolerate continued
subsidies to state-owned factories and sharply higher food prices to placate
struggling farmers.
With almost 200m rural Chinese in migratory flux between the countryside and
cities 'the government can ill-afford a greater flood to the cities where
there are no jobs for the existing workers, let alone newcomers,' said a
western economist.
A long commentary by the New China News Agency said over 40 large Chinese
cities reinstated controls this year to stop price exploitation and
profiteering. Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities reported rises
in food prices ranging from 27 to 30 per cent in November. The news agency
said: 'Macro-economic control will continue to play an important part in the
country's price control campaign'.
China, meanwhile, registered a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) trade surplus, the
first in three years. Exports rose 30 per cent to Dollars 120bn against a 10
per cent increase in imports to Dollars 115bn. At the end of November,
foreign exchange reserves stood at Dollars 48.9bn compared to Dollars 21.2bn
at the end of 1993. China expects more than a doubling of reserves for all
of 1994.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Loan shark attack in Taiwan: Illegal money lenders are
becoming increasingly sophisticated and disruptive, writes Laura Tyson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cash is the lifeblood of Taiwan's small businesses, which form the backbone
of the island's economy. But in a country where access to short-term
financing through legal channels is limited, the price of money is dear -
and often dangerous.
Tolerated by authorities, illegal money-lending has long been a fixture of
Taiwan's financial landscape, dominated by highly conservative state banks.
Despite reforms in recent years, gaping inefficiencies remain in the formal
banking system.
Black market finance operations in various guises are finding new, improved
niches and proliferating. Such lenders are becoming bolder and often place
advertisements in newspapers offering 'car loans', 'credit card loans' and
'housing loans'.
Small business people complain that as a rule existing financial
institutions are unwilling to extend loans for small amounts, especially
without some form of collateral. It takes at least a week to process an
unsecured short-term consumer-type loan from most Taiwanese banks, which
will usually require that two people serve as personal guarantors to the
borrower. Such barriers are insurmountable for many people in need of quick
cash.
A Taipei real estate agent explained: 'Say you have to meet a payment
deadline at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon. But one of your customers
failed to pay you on Monday, and you can't raise the cash until Friday. You
can either default or go to the underground banks. Unless you want to watch
your business go under you have no choice.'
Last week the government swooped on underground banks and netted nearly 100
illegal money lenders in an island-wide raid.
Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, was quoted as saying that their
activities were badly affecting the operations of legal financial
institutions. The widespread use of enforcers - often triad-linked - to
collect bad loans posed a threat to public order, he said.
Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the central bank, said earlier this week that
monetary authorities would seek to establish consumer finance companies.
Such financing remains scarce in Taiwan although Citibank has successfully
pursued consumer finance and car loans. Lending for mortgages and cars is
becoming more common among innovative local banks.
Most underground banks are loan sharks operating out of trading companies,
pawn shops, jewellery shops and car showrooms lending at interest rates
which start at 2.5 per cent per month and often escalate far higher,
depending on the creditworthiness and desperation of the customer. The loans
sharks are intermediaries; the ultimate lenders are said to be wealthy
individuals in politics, government or business.
One rampant form of illegal lending which especially worries authorities is
the use of credit cards to obtain loans. Twenty-five 'merchants' offering
such services were caught in last week's raid. Credit cards are a relatively
new phenomenon in Taiwan, and have become widely used only in the last two
or three years. Instead of goods or services, the merchant gives out cash -
for a minimum commission of 10 per cent. The credit risk is passed on to the
bank that issued the card.
Compared to black market rates, credit card cash advances are attractive.
Another advantage is that the Mafia is not involved.
It is feared such practices will lead to an increase in bad credit card
debts, affecting social stability, causing problems for banks and
threatening the development of the credit card industry in Taiwan.
The operations of underground banks are becoming increasingly sophisticated,
the Justice Ministry's investigation bureau has said. Records are
computerised and put into code, so investigators have difficulty finding the
names of the ultimate lenders and borrowers. In newspaper advertisements,
only a telephone number is provided and the call is then automatically
forwarded to the lender's cellular telephone. Credit cards are swiped and
loans extended by the roadside.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Gingrich gives up his Dollars 4.5m book advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I am not,' Newt Gingrich proclaimed yesterday, 'a normal politician.' To
prove it, the next Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced that
he was trading in a Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 2.9m) book advance for a single
greenback and the hope that he would earn royalties from whatever he
actually writes.
In a remarkable letter to fellow Republicans in Congress and in an even more
extraordinary press conference in Atlanta, Mr Gingrich, tieless but as
combative as ever, asserted that he was taking up his new duties next
Wednesday at 'a unique moment in time'.
'You can't just be legal and ethical,' he said, naturally claiming that he
had been both, 'but must think about what's good for the country.' Nothing,
he went on, could be allowed to weaken the Republican 'contract' to reform
America.
Although Mr Gingrich said he had not spoken about his book contract with the
incoming Senate majority leader, the reality is that Senator Robert Dole
pulled the rug from under him in a big way in year-end interviews published
yesterday morning.
Mr Dole said he 'did not want to pass judgment' on the book deal - and then
promptly did. 'It's not too popular around people who talk to me. They think
it's a lot of money.' It might also not look too good on the talk shows, the
senator suggested, 'when you start cutting programmes that might affect a
lot of low-income Americans.'
In the week before Christmas, it was announced that Mr Gingrich was about to
sign a Dollars 4.5m advance with HarperCollins, which happens to be owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, for two books - To Renew America, which he would
write himself, and a political anthology which he would edit.
The White House and every Democrat in sight jumped all over the news,
charging that he was cashing in before he had even taken office and darkly
wondering what it portended for the assorted regulatory matters Mr Murdoch
has pending with the government.
Mr David Bonior, the Democratic whip, brandished a large imitation cheque
made out to Mr Gingrich and signed by the Australian-born media magnate (who
later said that he knew nothing about the book contract).
Mr Gingrich said he had had five book offers in the million-dollar-plus
range, two exceeding Dollars 4m, before settling on HarperCollins. Invoking
in rapid order Winston Churchill, the three Kennedy brothers, Vice President
Al Gore and the 23 sitting members of the Senate who have written books
while on the job, he could not understand he was doing anything unethical or
improper. 'We are not rich,' he said, implying that the others did not need
the money.
Only one Republican - Jack Kemp, the highly moral former housing secretary -
had called him with reservations, Mr Gingrich disclosed. He said he finally
decided on Thursday morning to forgo jam today and to accept simple
royalties tomorrow after talking to his old congressional friend, Bob Walker
from Pennsylvania. 'Something you hadn't quite gotten suddenly becomes
clear,' Mr Gingrich said.
But he dismissed his other critics as 'bitter defenders of the old order'
that he was intent on changing.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Scalfaro rules out snap poll: Italian president's decision
to try to form new government angers Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday ruled out a snap election and
committed himself to finding a new government, albeit of brief duration.
The president announced his decision after consulting political leaders and
institutional figures following resignation of the Berlusconi government.
Under Italy's constitution, President Scalfaro has the power to dissolve
parliament and appoint prime ministers. His decision is a snub to Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the outgoing premier, who has insisted on an election in March
or April. The move is likely to make their already difficult relationship
even more tense.
President Scalfaro said his consultations had revealed 'a manifestly clear
conclusion: a majority of the chamber of deputies and the senate were
against immediate elections'.
His use of the word 'immediate' was significant. This underscored his belief
that it will be difficult to avoid elections soon. But it also emphasised
his determination to avoid Italy going to the polls with Mr Berlusconi
heading a caretaker government that had neither the authority nor the time
to tackle Italy's public finances and tidy up the country's imperfect
electoral laws.
President Scalfaro will begin a second round of consultations with the heads
of parliamentary groups on January 3. Within a week, he would then hope to
be in a position to see whether there was sufficient support for a
government headed by an independent premier. This government would have a
limited mandate centred round preparing the country for fresh elections.
With the present parliament a mere eight months old, President Scalfaro is
reluctant to dissolve it so soon. He is in particular concerned by the
plight of the lira on the foreign exchanges and by the unresolved conflict
of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as a politician and his ownership
of the Fininvest media and business empire.
The defection of the populist Northern League from Mr Berlusconi's
right-wing coalition has provided the opportunity for the president to say a
majority in both houses are against a quick election. And President Scalfaro
clearly interprets this majority as the will of parliament.
In contrast Mr Berlusconi continues to claim that he was given a mandate to
govern that remains valid. If its validity is questioned, says the media
magnate turned politician, then the electorate must immediately decide.
Mr Berlusconi is backed by his main ally, the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance and two minor partners, the Christian Democratic Centre (the
right-wing Christian Democrat rump) and the Reformists of Mr Marco Pannella.
Judging by his recent behaviour, Mr Berlusconi will do his best to discredit
President Scalfaro's efforts to postpone a spring election. Any delay in
holding elections is likely to lead to a loss of a sympathy vote for the
ousted premier. He also risks being deprived of his hegemony over the
television channels by tough new regulations on political coverage.
Mr Berlusconi has become increasingly belligerent as his options have
narrowed. As long as he is in the political limelight and is backed by the
votes of his Forza Italia movement, he stands a better chance of defending
himself against the corruption investigations of Milan magistrates and
protecting his television interests.
Equally he seems to have realised that having jumped into politics from
business, he cannot easily return to his Fininvest empire. Fininvest itself
is now run by a professional manager who is drastically restructuring to
reduce debt.

FT  31 DEC 94 / West tells Russia of concern over Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, JUREK MARTIN and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany, speaking as president of the European Union, told Russia yesterday
of the EU's strong concern over the bloodshed in Chechnya, and questioned
Moscow about what further moves it was planning.
'There was an expression of concern about civilian casualties, and a request
for information,' said a government official in Bonn, referring to
yesterday's call on the Russian Foreign Ministry by Mr Otto von der
Gablentz, Germany's ambassador to Moscow.
Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador in Moscow, also visited the Russian
ministry and discussed both Chechnya and Russian-American relations. Mr Igor
Ivanov, a deputy foreign minister, briefed him on Russia's intentions in
Chechnya.
The diplomatic initiative by Germany - which hands over the EU presidency to
France tomorrow - came at the end of a week in which western comment on
Chechnya has hardened, albeit without threatening Russia-west relations.
In both the US and western Europe, officials have expressed dismay over the
fact that Russian forces are killing civilians and have broken promises to
stop bombing soft targets.
In Washington, the State Department for the first time directly criticised
Russian tactics in Chechnya and urged an end to attacks on civilians. It
said it was 'deeply disturbed' by reports of the bombing of an orphanage.
This marks a change of emphasis from the west's initial comments on the
crisis, which held out the hope of a peaceful settlement and stressed that
the crisis was a domestic one.
However, most western commentary is still stopping short of any assertion
that Chechnya will affect the overall relationship between Russia and the
west. At the UK Foreign Office, diplomats said it was too early to say what
effect the conflict would have on broader ties.
Like most of his western counterparts, Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign
minister, stresses that the conflict between Moscow and Grozny is an
internal affair.
However Mr Kinkel faces mounting criticism from the opposition Social
Democrats, and the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner.
There are also senior members of the ruling Christian Democratic party who
want Bonn to take a far more critical stance towards President Boris
Yeltsin.
This week Mr Kinkel held an hour-long telephone conversation with Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart. But officials said Mr Kozyrev gave no
commitments on a political solution.
German and other western officials have expressed concern over the effect of
the crisis on Turkey, where sympathy for the Chechens - and fears of a
western 'sell-out' to Moscow - run high.
In a year-end interview with news agencies, President Bill Clinton took a
softer line, describing the conflict as 'an internal Russian political
problem'. Moscow, he said, was facing 'a secessionist movement and they are
dealing with it as best they can'.
In spite of its generally tougher tone, the State Department stopped well
short of linking the Chechen conflict to the broader US-Russian
relationship. This was markedly strained at this month's European security
summit, although since then the US has tried to limit the damage.
But domestic criticism that the administration is giving too much of a green
light to Russian action in Chechnya is mounting.
Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, has urged a
rapid expansion of Nato regardless of Russian sensibilities.
Also Mr Lee Hamilton, outgoing chairman of the House foreign affairs
committee, disagreed with the US description of the assault on Chechnya as
'an internal matter'.

Australia's federal government yesterday disclosed plans to toughen its laws
on 'refugee status', in an effort to stem the flow of boat people arriving
from southern China. About 950 boat people, predominantly Chinese, have
landed in northern Australia this year. Senator Nick Bolkus, federal
immigration minister, said the government planned to ensure that illegal
arrivals could not claim refugee status on the grounds of China's
restrictions on the number of children couples can have. He said that many
of the recent arrivals had cited this policy in claiming refugee status.

French unemployment edged up in November, rising by 3,000 to 3.337m, or 12.6
per cent, in line with expectations. Mr Michel Giraud, labour minister, said
the growth in unemployment was 'indisputably decelerating'. He noted a sharp
decline in the number of compulsory redundancies. The labour ministry said
unemployment should start to fall early next year. Private sector economists
endorsed this forecast. 'We have seen a stabilisation in the unemployment
and, more importantly, a big increase in the number of jobs created,' said
one economist at a French merchant bank. 'I expect we will see a fall in the
jobless rate in the first months of next year.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Brazilian banks taken over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's central bank yesterday took over two of the biggest state-owned
banks in the country, two days before a new government takes power, in a
move intended to stop the drain of government funds that were being used to
prop up the institutions. The troubled state banks of Sao Paulo (Banesp) and
Rio de Janeiro (Banerj) have been making losses for years, and have required
big financial support from the federal government to survive. Before the
takeover, the central bank was providing funds daily to keep the banks
afloat - which was weakening the government's anti-inflation strategy. Their
financial condition has deteriorated rapidly since the introduction of the
Real plan this year and the consequent sharp reduction in inflation.
In a statement yesterday, Brazil's central bank said the aim was to 'restore
the financial condition of those institutions and thereby pave the way for a
future transfer of their controlling interest'. The current central bank
president, Mr Pedro Malan, takes over tomorrow as finance minister,
suggesting the move is an initiative from the incoming government to avoid a
banking crisis such as that which beset Venezuela a year ago. Bankers said
the move, and the explicit suggestion that the banks will be privatised,
indicates an active approach in financial policy by the new government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb leaders last night said they would sign a four-month ceasefire
agreement today while the Moslem-led Bosnian government called in a senior
UN official for last-minute negotiations. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, and General Ratko Mladic, Serb military commander, at noon today
will sign the cessation of hostilities, on one side, and General Sir Michael
Rose, Commander of UN forces in Bosnia, on the other. However, in an ominous
note for the ceasefire, about 30 shells yesterday hit the Bihac town centre,
a UN 'safe area', slightly wounding a UN peacekeeper.
After talks in Sarajevo, Gen Rose said: 'The ball is in their court, not in
ours any more,' in regard to the Bosnian government, which urged him to put
more muscle into the ceasefire agreement. Fearing the truce will freeze Serb
military gains, the government is seeking the withdrawal of Serb forces
round the northwestern enclave of Bihac and the demilitarisation of
Sarajevo. Mr Yasushi Akashi, top UN envoy in former Yugoslavia, will travel
to Sarajevo in an effort to persuade the Bosnian government to endorse the
truce, which was due to come into force tomorrow.
It is calling for the opening roads to the city - a more ambitious proposal
than the deal negotiated earlier this month by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former

Serb leaders, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country, are unlikely
to lift their siege of the city, half of which Serbs lay claim to.

FT  31 DEC 94 / New year grapes of wrath for Gonzalez: Spain's premier is
being blamed for his country's political and economic malaise, writes Tom
Burns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spaniards, either gathered round the television or crowding into the plaza
before the clock of their local town hall, will tonight eat a grape with
every midnight chime that rings in the new year. Tradition holds that
downing a grape on each stroke, reflecting on the 12 months past with every
mouthful, will bring luck in the year to come.
As Mr Felipe Gonzalez performs the ritual he may be wishing that much of
1994 had never happened and conscious that he will need a lot of good
fortune if he is to eat his grapes at the end of next year among the
colonnades of the Moncloa Palace's main drawing room.
Most Spaniards will share such thoughts. A bad year for the prime minister
has left a widespread sense that an era marked by his 12 years in power is
drawing to a close.
Mr Gonzalez will reflect on the irony of his situation. There is a clear
consolidation of Spain's economic recovery. GDP grew at 2.3 per cent a year
in the third quarter compared to 1.7 per cent in the second quarter. The
second half of 1995, when Spain holds the presidency of the European Union,
promises him the full political spotlight he enjoys.
But the international markets have bracketed Spain with Italy as high-risk
countries of economic uncertainty and political instability.
1994 ends with the peseta at an historic low, with the Bolsa stock market
index plummeting, and with confidence severely undermined. Triumphs on the
European stage, such as Spain's entry, with Portugal, into the Common
Fisheries Policy, have taken a back seat to a string of domestic scandals
that increasingly rocked Mr Gonzalez as the year wore on.
Mr Gonzalez will ruefully recall how corruption allegations (one involving
his own brother-in-law) and sleaze charges (one of which put the former
governor of the Bank of Spain in prison for two weeks) have overshadowed
achievements that included a reform of a restrictive labour legislation, the
deregulation of telecommunications and the reduction of the budget deficit.
Two heroes of the Gonzalez years of economic bounty in the late 1980s, Mr
Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banesto, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the
architect of multi-million-dollar investment in Spain by the Kuwait
Investment Office, are in prison facing fraud charges.
The scandals hit a new climax this week with highly sensitive and well
publicised investigations into the Interior Ministry and the security
services. The investigations allegedly point to government involvement in a
dirty war against Eta Basque separatists during the 1980s and to
considerable embezzlement of public funds within the Interior Ministry.
In May the former head of the Guardia Civil, the 70,000 member paramilitary
corps that forms the backbone of the domestic security services, became a
fugitive of justice after being accused of illegally enriching himself. Just
before Christmas three former security chiefs were formally accused of
organising the anti-Eta death squad and remanded in custody.
Business leaders dismayed by the corruption and political instability,
compare Italy to Spain. 'There are two key differences,' said one captain of
industry, 'In Italy business carries on regardless without a government and
in Spain it grinds to a halt. In Spain Gonzalez has a replacement in
(conservative opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar) and in Italy it's (Mr
Silvio) Berlusconi or the abyss.'
On Thursday, Mr Gonzalez, breaking a week-long silence, said that he had no
intention of resigning or of calling early elections and that his government
bore no political responsibility for the dirty war.
He had wanted to instil confidence and he failed; by the end of the
afternoon the markets had taken a hammering for the fourth successive day.
The prime minister had argued that his government enjoyed sufficient
parliamentary support to remain in office. Elected for a fourth term in the
summer of 1993, he does not have to dissolve parliament until 1997.
Mr Gonzalez's contention was demonstrably true. There do not, for the time
being, appear to be any cracks in an 18-month-long alliance between Mr
Gonzalez's Socialist party, which lacks an overall majority, and the
right-of-centre Catalan nationalist party whose 17 seats in the Cortes
comfortably make up for the shortfall.
But the markets seem to reflect a deep-rooted and ill-tempered malaise
gripping Spanish society. Many Spaniards, not just business leaders, have
come to view Mr Gonzalez as the source of all ills.
Mr Gonzalez faces a serious popularity test just before Spain assumes the EU
presidency. On May 28 municipal and regional elections are likely to result
in a clear sweep for Mr Aznar's conservatives, the Partido Popular, and this
in turn could cause the Catalan nationalists to rethink their support for
the government.
Mr Aznar, who has for the past two years been on a continual campaign trail,
is now demanding that the general elections be brought forward to coincide
with the mid-term polls in May. 'Gonzalez can no longer guarantee the
necessary stability,' he said yesterday. 'The political crisis is costing
Spain a fortune.'
The conservative leader may not have to wait that long. As he gulps his
grapes tonight Mr Gonzalez knows better than anyone else that the legal
probes into death squads and backhanders will gather pace in the coming
weeks and that any further indictments of senior officials are likely to
force his resignation.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Swedes count the European costs of bananas and whisky: Hugh
Carnegy reports on a nation already unsettled by changes, violence and
unemployment as it takes on membership of the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the fiery debates of autumn when Sweden held its referendum on joining
the European Union, the occasion of accession tomorrow (with Austria and
Finland) will be notable chiefly for its effect on the price of bananas
(going up) and whisky (going down).
The Social Democratic government plans no special ceremonies to mark the
day. For most citizens, the biggest effect in the coming weeks will be a mix
of price changes; the price of bananas, rice and some clothing will rise
because of imposition of EU tariffs, while the prices of other food imports
and spirits will fall as local trade barriers come down.
The act of joining the Union, although a significant strategic shift for
Sweden, is causing little excitement among Swedes. Rather, the country ends
the year in a mood of introspection after a series of recent events have
combined to induce an unsettling feeling of change in a society which has
long prided itself on its stability, prosperity and social cohesion.
Most dramatically, this year has seen a spate of brutal violence that has
provoked an anguished public debate over such highly sensitive issues as
child care and immigration. In December alone a gunman shot dead four people
and wounded more than 20 outside a Stockholm nightclub; two former soldiers
lobbed grenades and opened fire on police in a Hollywood-style aborted raid
on an army weapons store in the Arctic Circle; and a Vietnamese immigrant
shot and wounded five relatives in a domestic row in south Sweden.
Although a quite different event, the sinking in September of the Baltic
ferry Estonia, with the loss of 900 lives, had an even more profound effect
on a neutral nation with very little experience in this century of violent
death.
In the meantime, the country has grown all too familiar with the
double-edged economic crisis of record levels of unemployment and a yawning
budget deficit which has left Sweden with the fastest growing public debt in
the industrialised world. To tackle the deficit, the government is having to
impose tough tax rises and public spending cuts that slice at the heart of
the welfare system.
'Even if some of the things happening don't have anything in common, lots of
things have happened in the last year that suddenly give us the feeling that
this is not the Garden of Eden any more,' is the wry comment of Ms Ursula
Berge, the political editor of the Norrlandska Socialdemocraten, the Social
Democratic daily newspaper in northern Sweden.
Certainly, the adjustments now under way in the economy involve a real turn
for the worse. Total unemployment has jumped since the turn of the decade
from about 5 per cent of the workforce to more than 13 per cent. The Social
Democrats, architects of the welfare state, are engaged in a painful
internal struggle to agree on the scale of cuts necessary in such core
programmes as universal child allowance payments to bring the budget deficit
under control. The vast majority of Swedish families will have lower net
income in 1995 than in 1994. 'People are having to realise that these
problems will not be solved overnight,' says Ms Berge.
To those who supported joining the EU, membership is part of the solution.
The hope is that being part of the Union will help cement the investment and
produce the coherent economic policies needed to secure growth and reduce
unemployment.
The question is, however, to what extent Sweden can return to the cosy
certainties of the past, as many Social Democrats clearly wish. With public
spending now accounting for 70 per cent of GNP, far above the European
average, a permanent reduction in the scope of the welfare state seems
unavoidable.
The nature of Swedish society is also undergoing a challenge, chiefly
through the effects of the country's own generous refugee policy, which has
led to a significant immigrant population. About 1.5m of Sweden's 8.8m
people were born outside Sweden, or their parents were. Although Sweden has
not experienced the scale of anti-immigrant reaction seen in Germany or
France, the issue of reconciling the integration of immigrants with the
preservation of traditional Swedish society is a recurrent theme in public
debate.
By no means everyone takes a pessimistic view of the way things are going,
however. Mr Lars Christiansson, formerly chief spokesman for Mr Carl Bildt,
the reformist prime minister from 1991 until September this year, says it is
a 'myth' to believe that Sweden had ever achieved a state of perfect
equilibrium.
Rather he stresses that since the late 1980s there has been a growing
realisation that Sweden has to adjust - particularly to swing back the
balance in the economy towards the private sector and halt a trend that has
seen Sweden slip since 1970 from third place in the world league of GNP per
head to 16th place.
'Swedish society is not that homogenous any more,' says Mr Christiansson.
'Change is inevitable. It is there and it will go on. There are bad social
effects - but they are exaggerated.'
The most powerful new recruit to the EU will be at home round the table in
Brussels, where its new colleagues have their minds on problems at home and
only half an eye for Europe.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Russian output halved in 3 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian industrial output fell 21 per cent in 1994 and is now at less than
45 per cent of its 1991 level.
Light industry, machinery, chemicals and pulp and paper sectors were among
the worst affected sectors although there are signs that the decline is
beginning to level off. Gross domestic product is estimated to have fallen
15 per cent.
Some economists have argued that the shake-out should ultimately benefit
Russia's economy because it stops companies using inflationary state credits
to manufacture goods nobody wants. In theory, this should enable capital to
be redeployed to more productive uses.
But overall capital investment fell 27 per cent between January and November
and by the end of the year it is forecast to stand at just 39 per cent of
1991 levels. A budget deficit of 10.7 per cent of GDP by November and
'grossly inefficient' tax collection also resulted in underfunding of
science and education.
The decline in production has swollen the ranks of the officially-registered
unemployed to 2.6 per cent. But this figure would possibly be five times
higher under the International Labour Organisation's methodology, which
takes account of 'suppressed unemployment'.
The statistics from the Economics Ministry also reveal how the gap between
rich and poor is widening sharply. The top 10 per cent of the population now
earn 14 times the income of the poorest 10 per compared with a ratio of 5.4
times three years ago.
The Russian statistics committee said inflation in December reached 16.4 per
cent, bringing price increases in 1994 to 320 per cent. Inflation has been
stoked by excessive credit in the summer and surging inflationary
expectations.
Pegging inflation back to a monthly rate of 1-2 per cent by the end of next
year is the central element of Russia's 1995 budget plans, although they
depend on up to Dollars 13bn of financial support from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.
However, the government's finances are coming under strain from the Chechen
crisis, which some estimate is costing Rbs100bn a day.
This week, Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the economics minister, said Russia could soon
face a stark choice between war or reform.
The rouble ended the year at 3,550 to the dollar compared with 1,247 at the
start. Since Black Tuesday on October 11, when the rouble lost a fifth of
its value, the currency has risen slightly against the dollar in real terms.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Mexico seeks to shape international support package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican government officials were yesterday in intense discussions to put
together an international financial support package for an economic
stabilisation plan aimed at limiting the damage from last week's peso
devaluation.
It would include more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) of credit lines
beyond Dollars 7bn in standby loans previously arranged with the US and
Canadian governments. With hard currency reserves that Mexican officials say
stand at Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn, the resources available to the
government could total some Dollars 25bn.
The enlarged package would include likely further support from the US and
Canada, a credit from other central banks arranged through the Bank for
International Settlements in Basle, and standby funds from international
commercial banks. However, the government has decided not to draw money from
the International Monetary Fund under a standby loan programme.
According to bankers, Mexico's new finance minister, Mr Guillermo Ortiz, on
Thursday phoned the chairmen of Citibank, Mr John Reed, and JP Morgan, Sir
Dennis Weatherstone, to ask them to arrange the credit line. Mr Reed and
Citibank vice-chairman, Mr William Rhodes, were seeking support from
international banks yesterday.
Bankers said there was still uncertainty about the exact nature of the
proposed bank credit, but a loan or standby financing of some Dollars 3bn to
Dollars 6bn was being talked about. Lenders hope the scale of international
backing for the new government of President Ernesto Zedillo would so boost
investor confidence that the credits would not need to be used.
Mr Zedillo is due on Monday to detail the government's stabilisation plan,
which is still under discussion. The government, among other things, is
considering basing its new budget on a peso exchange rate of 4.5 to the
dollar, though it hopes the peso will be stronger. An inflation target of 15
per cent for 1995 is being discussed.
The aim is to cut the current account deficit from close to Dollars 30bn
this year, to Dollars 14bn or less in 1995. Government economists have
downgraded their growth forecast to around 1.5 per cent next year from 4.5
per cent this.
Leaders of government, business and labour were yesterday seeking an accord
to hold down wages and prices. The labour secretary Mr Santiago Onate said
wages would rise by no more than 7 per cent next year, but the unions are
demanding more. Officials expect an agreement to be announced on Monday.
The peso closed yesterday at 5.075 to the dollar, slightly down from
Wednesday's close. The Mexican stock market closed down 1.47 per cent.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Campaign for clarity aims to end Eurospeak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Brussels it is widely recognised that directives - or EU laws - are
written in a prose so execrable that it violates all the languages of the
Union.
But from tomorrow Eurocrats in their multilingual drafting committees should
watch out. The Plain English Campaign, the linguistic pressure group which
is the self-appointed scourge of verbose British bureaucrats, is waging war
on Euro-obscurity.
The campaign is launching a lobby to ensure that all information released to
the public by the European Commission is easy to understand. Though it has
clashed with the Commission over incidents of verbosity, this will be its
first all-out assault on catastrophes of comprehension.
No longer should Article 8a of the Maastricht treaty, 'comitology', 'false
'B' points', or the ubiquitous Euro-grunt of 'Erf, erf' be daily currency in
Brussels, though making headway might be difficult.
The last, a violation of (French and English) language, could inadvertently
help the campaign.
'Erf, erf' means 'Off, off' - as in 'off the record', and is designed to
obscure the source of information.
Ms Chrissie Maher, head of the Campaign, said the EU had been singled out
for attack because many of its laws were 'so badly worded that no one knows
what they mean'.
The chief catalyst was the Maastricht treaty, which Ms Maher called 'so
impenetrable that, if it wasn't so serious, it would have been a joke'.
She wrote a letter of complaint to Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of
the Commission, which she sent together with 'the biggest Brussels sprout I
could find'.
Ms Maher received 'a very nice letter back' pointing out that Mr Delors had
not written the treaty himself. She was unimpressed.
One of the main targets of the campaign will be arcane new words - such as
'extensification' and the now-infamous 'subsidiarity'. Ms Maher sees them as
'a form of corruption that Euro MPs pick up over there and think it's clever
to use here'.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Blair prepares for fight on devolution and Lords' reform: PM
attacks opposition's 'dangerous' policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will today signal the start of a constitutional battle with
the Tories by setting out proposals for devolution - condemned yesterday by
Mr John Major as 'one of the most dangerous propositions ever put before the
British nation'.
The Labour leader plans to use a long-planned interview on BBC radio to
mount a strong defence of his plans to set up a Scottish parliament and a
Welsh assembly, reform the House of Lords and trim the monarchy.
Officials said he would reject Mr Major's demand, in a BBC radio interview
yesterday, for referendums on plans to establish the Scottish and Welsh
assemblies in the first year of a Labour government.
Mr Blair will argue that referendums are unnecessary because the legislation
will have been preceded by a general election in which the voters will be
offered a clear choice between the main parties' manifestos.
Labour officials dismissed the prime minister's attack on their +++++++ End
of Leg 1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ plans for Scotland and Wales as a
sign of his 'desperate' need to divert attention from the government's
problems over Europe.
However, leaders of both parties believe domestic constitutional issues will
be at the forefront of the next election campaign, alongside the UK's
relationship with the European Union. Mr Major, who sees his decision to
campaign for the integrity of the UK as a crucial factor in the
Conservatives' 1992 election victory, used his interview to attack Labour's
motives.
Claiming Labour leaders had failed to think through devolution, the prime
minister warned of a constitutional impasse if a Scottish National party
majority in the Scottish parliament sought to secede from the UK.
'It is done for short-term political advantage to the Labour party because
they are seeking to cash in on the innate pride in being Scottish that the
Scots feel, and they have given no thought whatsoever to the future unity of
the UK,' he said. The prime minister's playing of the constitutional card
prompted a derisive response from Mr George Foulkes, a Scottish Labour
frontbencher, who said Mr Major had 'gone completely off his rocker'.
Mr Menzies Campbell, a Scottish Liberal Democrat, said home rule would
strengthen the UK, and warned that 'blind refusal to acknowledge the need
for constitutional reform' played into the hands of the separatists.
Mr Major, in an attempt to douse the flames of Tory battles over Europe,
forecast an end to Conservative divisions on the issue.
The depth of hostility between the party's opposing factions was made clear,
however, by Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, who urged Tory
pro-Europeans to unite to prevent a Eurosceptic takeover.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary emphasised his Eurosceptic
views in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph. He suggested the European
Court of Justice should be reined back.

turnover for both UK and foreign equities. Turnover of foreign shares rose
by nearly 24 per cent and newly-listed companies raised Pounds 11.6bn,
nearly double the previous year's figure. Gilts turnover fell to Pounds
1.163bn compared with Pounds 1.598bn in 1993.

Mrs Sarah Hogg, out-going head of Mr John Major's policy unit, and Mrs
Elizabeth Smith, widow of former Labour leader John Smith, are made life
peers today in a New Year honours list that rewards 1,080 people for
political or public service.
The two women, who plan to play active roles on opposite sides of the House
of Lords, are among four new life peers, two Companions of Honour, three
privy counsellors, 53 knights and dames, and 1,018 commanders, officers and
members of the Order of the British Empire.
Downing Street said that 393 of the people on the list had been nominated by
members of the public under Mr Major's 18-month-old initiative to
democratise the honours system - 140 more than last year.
The identities of the publicly-nominated recipients were not revealed, but
are likely to include Joanna Lumley, star of the TV series Absolutely
Fabulous, who was appointed OBE, and Eric Clapton, the rock guitarist, also
made an OBE.
Other high profile recipients included Felicity Kendal, the actress (CBE),
Michael Bentine, the former Goon (CBE), Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United
manager (CBE), Jimmy Hill, the football commentator (OBE), and Jonathan
Davies, the rugby league footballer (MBE).
Knights include Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering Union, thought to be the first trade union leader to accept a
knighthood since Sir John Boyd, his predecessor, was knighted in 1979.
Also knighted are David Puttnam, the film maker, Robert Stephens, the actor,
Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of the Forte leisure chain, and Mr Ronald Hampel,
chief executive of ICI.
Other businessmen knighted include Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of
Bank of Scotland, Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, Mr Geoffrey Whalen,
former managing director of Peugeot Talbot, and Mr Gerald Whent, chief
executive of Vodafone.
Downing Street said 40 per cent of those honoured had been recognised for
their contribution to voluntary service, compared with 330 in the previous
list.
Officials pointed to awards to a range of 'ordinary people', including a
roadsweeper and blacksmith, as evidence that Mr Major's campaign to make the
list more open was succeeding.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Swissair criticises Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swissair, the quoted Swiss carrier, said Air France's partial ownership of
Sabena was hindering its plans to buy a large minority stake in the Belgian
national airline.
'A continuation of Air France's involvement would appear to make little
sense,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, said in the latest issue of the
employee publication Swissair News.
Swissair said yesterday that current negotiations depended on Air France.
'If they decide to keep their shares, then we will have to discuss a new
situation,' it said.
Air France owns two-thirds of Finacta, a holding company which has a 37.5
per cent stake in Sabena. It has been reluctant to dispose of its investment
in the Belgian carrier.
However, industry observers believe that Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air
France, may be leaning towards a sale or reduction of the stake.
'It would be difficult for Air France to muster any further capital for
Sabena, given its own need for financial resources,' said one airline
industry analyst.
Swissair also denied a report in a Belgian newspaper that it was seeking a
75 per cent stake in Sabena.
It said its aim in associating with Sabena was to obtain influence over an
operating entity within the European Union and thereby strengthen its
competitive position in Europe.
As Switzerland is unlikely to join the EU in the foreseeable future,
Swissair faces possible discrimination on EU routes. Its existing
co-operation with Austrian Airlines is helpful but insufficient.
'Expanding our group of hubs - Zurich, Geneva and Vienna - to include the
capital of Europe would do much to alleviate this serious shortcoming,' Mr
Muller said.
Swissair has not said how large a stake it is seeking in Sabena, but there
has been speculation that it would be as much as 49 per cent.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Green light for Cariplo in Rolo
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Italy has given the go-ahead for the L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) bid
for Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank, launched by
a consortium headed by Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank.
The bid still requires the approval of Consob, the stock exchange watchdog,
but this is unlikely to be withheld.
The main issue is whether Credito Italiano, the recently-privatised bank
that initiated a takeover battle for Rolo, will raise the stakes. Credito
has already improved its original offer, but it is still 18 per cent below
that of Cariplo.
The consortium led by Cariplo is made up of IMI, the partly privatised
banking institution; Carisbo, the regional savings bank covering the Emilia
Romagna region; and Reale Mutua, the insurance group. The bid, launched just
before Christmas, is for 70 per cent of Rolo's equity and would leave
Cariplo with 52 per cent of the shares at an anticipated cost of L2,400bn.
The official prospectus is likely to be released early next week, probably
on January 3.
Analysts believe Credito would find it difficult to improve the Cariplo
offer on its own. However, they consider it still possible for allies to be
brought in to help capture the prize of one of Italy's most profitable
regional banks.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Fininvest to sell supermarkets chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group owned by out-going
premier Silvio Berlusconi, is to announce today the L950bn (Dollars 579m)
sale of part of its retailing interests to a consortium of the Benetton
clothing group and Luxottica, the spectacles producer.
The deal involves hiving off the Euromercato supermarkets from Fininvest's
stores and retailing division which are grouped under the umbrella of the
Standa chain of stores. The division has a total turnover of L5,200bn. The
sale of Euromercato will cut turnover by L1,200bn.
The sale was indirectly confirmed last night by Mr Giancarlo Foscale, head
of the Standa group and a cousin of Mr Berlusconi who told Ansa, the Italian
national news agency: 'I can't say to whom we will sell Euromercato as there
are talks with Benetton and Luxottica; but the COOP could also come in even
though this is less likely since behind them were other partners including
Rinascente (the Fiat group).'
The sell-off marks an important stage in the reorganisation of Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest under the management of Mr Franco Tato. But it also
signals the rapidly expanding ambitions in the retail field of the Benetton
family and Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of Luxottica. Only two months
ago they broke into this field, teaming up with Switzerland's Movenpick, to
pay L2,100bn for the GS-Autogrill group being privatised by IRI, the state
holding company.
The cash proceeds from Euromercato will be used to reduce Fininvest's
overall debt burden which last year totalled L3,920bn on a turnover of
L11,552bn. Fininvest indicated three months ago that debt would be reduced
to L2,800bn by the year end.
Mr Foscale said yesterday the sale would also allow an extensive upgrading
of Standa. Some L500m of existing debt is concentrated in loss-making
Standa; but Standa's debts are believed to be considerably greater if long
unpaid bills to suppliers are included. Standa this year is expected to lose
L100bn.
Fininvest has been contemplating a partial or total withdrawal from
retailing for nearly eighteen months. Mr Berlusconi bought into this sector
in the late eighties paying high prices, financed by costly debt. This was
especially the case with Standa bought from the Ferruzzi group in 1988. Both
Mr Berlusconi and his cousin, the manager, are understood to have resisted
selling Standa. Standa alone provides more than 40 per cent of Fininvest
cash flow, an important consideration for the group's overall finances.

FT  30 DEC 94 / US takes lead over Japan in vehicle output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has overtaken Japan this year to become the world's top motor vehicle
producing nation for the first time since 1979.
According to data collated by Automotive News, the US weekly, vehicle
production in the US has risen by 13 per cent this year to 12.28m from
10.87m in 1993.
Vehicle output in Japan has fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993.
Production in Japan has fallen for four years in succession under heavy
pressure from the domestic recession and from declining exports.
New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first signs of recovery in
recent months, but, for the full year, vehicle output has fallen to the
lowest level for 12 years. Production peaked at 13.49m in 1990 after first
overtaking the US in 1980.
In the US, vehicle production has risen rapidly during the past three years,
matching the expansion in the domestic market.
Output dropped to 8.8m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. It has
risen by 39 per cent in the past three years to reach this year's level,
however, and is forecast to increase further next year to top the previous
record level of 12.899m, set in 1978.
The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes
much to the restructuring of the world automotive industry over the past
decade.
Japanese vehicle producers have contributed greatly to the shifting balance
by transferring more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first
to North America, and more recently to Europe and south-east Asia.
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the big three US car producers, have
restructured drastically to regain world competitiveness and their fortunes
have revived, but their domestic position is under challenge.
About 15 per cent of US vehicle production is now coming from Japanese
carmakers' plants - either wholly owned or in joint ventures - compared with
nothing little more than a decade ago. Honda was the first Japanese vehicle
maker to begin car assembly in the US in 1982.
Japanese vehicle makers now operate 11 assembly plants and three engine
plants in North America, and Honda is the leading US car exporter.
Since the early 1980s, the Japanese have built in the US an auto industry
larger than that of Britain or Italy or Spain.
With its improved competitiveness, the North American auto industry is
becoming a growing force in world auto markets, albeit from a small base.

Australia's federal government is being urged to step up pressure on China
in an effort to halt a sudden influx of illegal refugees reaching Australia
by boat from the southern Chinese city of Beihai. On Wednesday, a vessel
with more than 70 people on board entered Darwin, the fourth in six days
believed to be from the Chinese port town. This brought the number of boat
people, predominantly Chinese, arriving in northern Australia this year to
about 950, the highest annual total since the Vietnam war. More than
two-thirds of the arrivals have occurred in the last six weeks.

Crude oil and natural gas output from China's onshore oilfields will fall
short of projections this year but rebound slightly in 1995, according to
figures released yesterday by the China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC), the country's top oil producer. China became a net oil importer in
1993 and has struggled to maintain production levels for its maturing fields
as imports have increased sharply to meet soaring energy needs. Onshore
crude production in 1994 will stand at 139.4m tonnes and natural gas at
15.9bn cubic metres. 0.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent above state-set targets
respectively, CNPC said. The 1994 output is below CNPC's January projections
of 140m tonnes of crude and 16bn cu m of natural gas.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Israel economy grows by 6.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's economy outperformed all 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development nations in 1994 with a growth of 6.8 per cent in gross
domestic product, according to Israel's central bureau of statistics. Israel
also led the field with a growth in per capita income of 4.3 per cent,
although income remains low by western standards at Dollars 13,730. Fuelled,
among other things, by an influx of 600,000 immigrants from the former
Soviet Union over the past five years, the economy has expanded at an
average of 5 per cent a year since the beginning of the 1980s. Figures
released this week show unemployment falling from 10 per cent in 1993 to 7.6
per cent this year. This puts Israel ninth among OECD states with the lowest
rates of jobseekers.
On the other side of the ledger, however, Israel registered the highest
trade deficit and the second highest inflation rate. The trade deficit rose
to Dollars 8.3bn, compared with Dollars 6bn last year. The consumer price
index climbed to 12.3 per cent from 11.2 per cent in 1993. Private
consumption leapt 9.3 per cent, investment in machinery and infrastructure
by 17.3 per cent.
While celebrating Israel's economic health, independent analysts are
predicting a slow-down in 1995. Mr Ya'acov Sheinin, president of the
Tel-Aviv forecasting firm, Economic Models, commented yesterday: 'These
figures mean that the Israeli economy has huge potential. The problem is
that after so many years of growth, you run into bottlenecks. We predict
that next year the economy will slow down a bit, until the government does
something about the housing shortage and inflation.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb and United Nations commanders yesterday adjourned talks on a
proposed four-month ceasefire agreement but remained confident the truce
would be signed before the deadline on Sunday.
On the political front, Bosnian Serb deputies last night made a cautious
endorsement of a peace plan brokered on December 19 by Mr Jimmy Carter,
former US president. Bosnian Serb leaders had promised to restart peace
talks on the basis of the five-nation Contact Group plan to divide Bosnia
roughly in half.
'The parliament informs the Contact Group and the international community of
the readiness on the part of Republika Srpska to enter peace negotiations on
the basis of the agreement with Carter.'
The lukewarm statement, issued in the Serb mountain stronghold of Pale, fell
far short of accepting the map which would call on Serbs to hand over a
third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control.
Serb leaders still reject the maps, whereas the Moslem-led government had
insisted that the proposed division remains the same. But earlier Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, President of Bosnia, appeared to soften his position. Speaking
in his capacity as leader of Bosnia's main Moslem party, he said: 'We think
that the resumption of the war is a bigger injustice than an unjust peace.'
After meeting Serb military and political leaders in Pale, General Sir
Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, said: 'There is goodwill on both
sides. I hope we are going to get some conclusion by the weekend.
'Today it might be a little too soon (for the signing) because we were not
expecting it before January 1 and we still have two days to go.'
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, added: 'I agree with what
General Rose has just said. I hope the parties to the conflict will sort
details out.'
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems recently endorsed a temporary truce in order to
gain time to hammer out the details of a four-month cessation of hostilities
throughout Bosnia under the agreement brokered by Mr Carter.
Fighting near the northwestern Bihac enclave yesterday raised fears that
even the provisional truce would not take hold. Serb forces are encircling
Bihac. They used tanks, artillery and mortars to push back their Moslem foes
in nearby Bosanska Krupa, said UN officials.
The Bosnian government yesterday reiterated warnings that it would refuse to
sign the four-month ceasefire if Serb forces, backed by troops loyal to Mr
Fikret Abdic, the Moslem renegade leader, kept up their assault on Bihac.
Gen Rose on Wednesday won conditional support for a truce from Mr Abdic, but
the maverick chief refused to accept any deadlines.

Balancing act: an elderly woman makes her way cautiously along an

FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: French rise hits builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A late move by the leading French commercial banks to raise their base
lending rates sent shock waves through the building and construction sector.
The rise to 8.25 per cent from 7.95 per cent led to fears that recovery in
French construction could be nipped in the bud. Some analysts argued that
the move signalled a higher interest rate environment in Europe and could
stifle business in Germany where many of the UK construction and materials
groups are also heavily involved. However, others suggested that the shift
was purely domestic.
Speculation that something was happening leaked into the gilts market around
midday but the first announcement of a change did not happen until half an
hour before the UK market closed.
Share prices were already weak and when the news came dealers immediately
marked them down further. They cut the price of the FT-SE 100 stocks - RMC,
Redland and Blue Circle. RMC fell 15 1/2 to 940p and Redland, which is
heavily involved in the French road building programme through its
aggregates subsidiary Steetley, fell 9 to 460p. Blue Circle slid 9 to 284p
with dealers also citing the current BZW sell stance. However, BPB and
Pilkington, Europe's premier glass maker, escaped unscathed and remained
steady at 294p and 164p respectively.
Telecommunications group Cable and Wireless was one of the weaker spots
among leading issues as a large seller dragged down the share price amid
concerns over competition and overseas pressure.
A 72-point fall overnight in the Hang Seng market in Hong Kong, from where C
&amp; W generates around two-thirds of its operating profits, led to initial
weakness. This was compounded by news that competition had forced its
Mercury subsidiary to make big cuts in the cost of international calls.
Also, Mercury's Christmas promotion for its One-2-One mobile phone came in
for heavy criticism. The shares ended 12 lower at 378p.
Standard Chartered firmed a half to 282 1/2 p despite being exposed to the
frailty of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index. The bank is seen as a global
takeover candidate.
Growing concern over the state of the Mexican economy sent Lloyds Bank
shares down 5 to 553p. Though not directly affected by the crisis, the bank
is heavily exposed to secondary debt in Latin America and it has seen its
capital ratio come under pressure at a time when it needs its strength to
push though its proposed acquisition of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building
society.
Insurance stocks, highly geared to the performance of the market, fell as
they also came in for negative press comment on their prospects for 1995.
However, Prudential received support from the news that its was taking 25
per cent stake of a Thai life assurance group. The move was seen as securing
a toe-hold in the emerging market. The shares closed 5 1/2 lower at 316 1/2
p as two-way business took turnover to 2.1m.
Northern Ireland Electricity moved 5 ahead to 363p, as bargain hunters
turned their attention to the distributor. The shares were left behind in
the recent strong rally in the sector that was ignited by the bid for
Northern, 5 lower at 1005p, as the market awaits further developments on the
bid. Northern's predator Trafalgar House eased 1 1/2 to 73p, in strong
business of 7.3m. Speculation of a further bid boosted Yorkshire 11 to 718p.
Rank Organisation hardened a penny to 411p as Smith New Court struck a
positive note. Recommending the stock as one of its favourites for the
coming year, Smith believes the company will benefit from 'strong growth and
the benefits of cost cutting at Rank Xerox,' in which it holds a 49 per cent
stake.
Hopes of bumper sales over the festive season helped several retailers
survive the market slide. Kingfisher gained another 5 to 443p with sentiment
enhanced by a press recommendation.
High street retailer Boots was also in demand and the shares added 2 to
508p.

FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a poor day in the derivatives market with a lack of buying, combined
with dull sentiment after an overnight retreat on Wall Street, yesterday's
falls in European markets and weakness in UK gilts, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, signs that Wednesday's rally had run out of steam were seen at
the outset as the March contract on the FT-SE 100 began an early slide. A
greater number of independent traders was said to have returned to the
market but with few willing buyers many were left twiddling their thumbs for
most of the day. Sentiment was further dampened by a retreat in other
European markets which followed disappointment with the German bund auction.
In the afternoon, the setback in the UK gilts sector brought a further slide
and the contract fell to its low of 3,075 around the time of the
announcement of an increase in French base rates.
March finished at 3,077, down 41 on its previous close but at a 12-point
premium to the underlying cash market. Volume was 4,699 lots.
It was an equally poor day in the traded options sector and turnover slipped
to a mere 13,564 contracts of which 6,799 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and a paltry 244 in the Euro FT-SE option. Wellcome was the busiest stock
option at 1,006 trades. J. Sainsbury and Glaxo were the other active stock
options.

FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: International rate pressures unsettle
UK equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise increase in base rates by a number of leading French banks and
widespread disappointment across global markets with the outcome of the
latest auction of German bunds provided the real trigger for a global slide
in equity markets. London's equity market could not ignore such moves and
came under pressure from the outset, eventually closing sharply lower after
a session of thin and difficult trading.
The French shift was preceded by a surprising retreat from Wall Street
overnight and a stuttering performance by US equities at the US opening
yesterday. Adding to Wall Street's discomfiture was slightly worrying
economic data and renewed concerns over Mexico.
At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 index was at the day's lowest level,
down 30.2 at 3,065.6. Second liners fared only marginally better, the FT-SE
Mid 250 index ending the day 7.7 off at 3,498.4.
Dealers said there was always an element of uncertainty in gilt/bond markets
yesterday, and London had picked up the scent of trouble from the outset. UK
gilts opened easier and moved progressively lower.
One marketmaker pointed to the threat to French interests by terrorists from
Algeria and the increasingly disturbing news from Russia. With the German
bund auction said to have been badly received, there was only one way for
international bonds to go.
'It looks very much now that the cycle of lower European interest has
finally turned,' said an economist at one leading European bank in London.
'The chances of another reduction in German interest rates have virtually
disappeared and the markets will have to cope with a period of stable German
interest rates, which will be gently nudged upwards in the second half of
the year,' he added.
London began on a quiet note but down 14.4 at 3,081.4 in the wake of the
poor performance by Wall Street overnight and the opening falls in gilts.
A flurry of sizeable trades put through the market during the early part of
the session caused some consternation around the City's dealing desks but
these were eventually unveiled as 'bed and breakfast', or tax-related, deals
and had little impact of prices.
Thereafter, there was little institutional trading until mid-morning, when
gilts turned off again, along with German bunds, triggering small pockets of
selling pressure in equity leaders.
The FT-SE 100 began to weaken in the run up to Wall Street's opening when it
was down over 31 points. However, the US market came in level and began to
edge higher, shrugging off news of slightly higher than expected leading
indicators for November from the US.
London staged a minor rally, reducing the fall in the FT-SE 100 to 22
points, but then fell as the market picked up the scent of a shift in French
base rates.
Senior marketmakers, although rattled by the sudden and unexpected move by
the French banks, said it would be wrong to judge the mood of European
markets on such a day; 'Dealing desks in London were only half-manned and
no-one wanted to trade,' he said, adding that most big securities houses had
already positioned themselves with level books going into the New Year.
The expected surge of activity linked to over-the-counter option trades,
specially tailored to client needs, failed to materialise. But many in the
market are looking for a sudden burst of activity towards the close of
trading this afternoon when derivatives traders are expected to try to
influence some of the FT-SE 100's best and worst performers as the year
comes to an end.
Turnover, given a strong boost by 'bed and breakfast deals', accounting for
turnover of some 74m shares, reached 426m shares.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities vacillate in thin
year-end trading

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended mixed yesterday as investors adjusted their portfolios
to finish the year, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 6.06 to 3,833.43.
The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.31 to 461.17, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.74 to 431.36 and the Nasdaq
composite gained 7.07 to 749.53. Volume on the NYSE was 251m shares.
The market was volatile in light trading. The Dow moved up and down from
positive to negative territory several times during the day.
There was no apparent reason for market movements on the penultimate day of
trading this year because most economic data was generally within the range
of economists' forecasts. The index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3
per cent in November, according to the commerce department, although
analysts had expected an increase closer to 0.1 per cent.
Initial unemployment claims fell 3,000 to 322,000 for the week ending
December 24, according to the labor department. Although not considered
among the most important economic indicators, the figures are viewed as a
preview of all-important unemployment statistics due out next month.
The bond market, which fell on Wednesday, was mostly flat, in part because
it found some support from the dollar which bounced back from Wednesday's
lows.
Gibson Greetings, which dropped Dollars  3/16 at Dollars 14 9/16 , announced
that it would cut the full-time workforce at its corporate and greeting card
division by about 5 per cent, or 128 positions.
Apple Computer gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 1/2 after reports that a
company, partly-owned by Olivetti, had announced a clone of the
California-based computer maker's Macintosh model. Other technology shares
were also mostly higher. Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 102
1/4 , Dell Computer climbed Dollars 1 5/16 at Dollars 41 15/16 , Compaq
Computer was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 40 1/4 and Gateway 2000 rose Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 21 3/4 . Digital Equipment lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 34
1/8 .
Intel gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 64 3/8 after Merrill Lynch increased
its estimate of the company's earnings. The news brought up prices of other
semiconductor companies, as it suggested that there would be no long-lasting
implications from Intel's mishandling of public relations related to a flaw
in its Pentium chip. Micron Technology rose Dollars 1 at Dollars 45 1/8 and
Analog Devices was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 35 1/8 .
Telmex ADRs continued to rebound. The stock closed up Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 42 3/8 .
Canada
In the 10th straight session of gains for the TSE-300 composite index,
Toronto stocks managed to advance slightly in light trading today.
The TSE-300 added 1.13 points, or 0.03%, to 4202.65, with 381 winners over
303 losers. Volume of 32,970,000 shares was up slightly from yesterday's
figure of 32,660,000. The value of CDollars 368.1m was down from yesterday's
CDollars 420.7m.
Mexico
Equities closed up 3.14 per cent spurred by President Ernesto Zedillo's
address to the nation in which the replacement as finance minister of Mr
Jaime Serra Puche by Mr Guillermo Ortiz was announced. The market advanced
rapidly before he started to speak just before the market close.
According to preliminary official information, the Mexican market's key IPC
index closed up 73.34 points at 2,411.06. Volume totalled a moderate to
heavy 1.6bn new pesos, on 125.3m shares traded.
Brazil
Shares closed up 3.8 per cent in moderate trade on the Sao Paulo stock
exchange boosted by a strong buying spree by pension and equity funds
squaring their portfolios ahead of the New Year Day holiday.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active stocks ended up 1,586 at 43,539
points.
Turnover was 204.8m reais (Dollars 244.5m).
Brazilian markets will be closed today.
Argentina
The Merval index of most heavily traded shares closed 23.52 points, or 5.4
per cent higher. There was a late surge as the central bank said that it had
only spent Dollars 86m buying pesos on the foreign exchange market compared
with Dollars 353m on Wednesday.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
Taipei recoups 1.2%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small lot purchases by retail and overseas investors supported share prices,
and the Nikkei index posted moderate gains in light volume, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose 87.45 to 19,752.98 after a low of 19,509.15 and a high
of 19,763.78. Arbitrage unwinding depressed share prices in the morning
session, but arbitrage buying and blue chip buying by foreign investors
supported the index later.
Volume totalled 210m shares against 254m. Individual investors focused on
speculative favourites, while a European bank targeted blue chip
electricals. Institutional investors remained sidelined ahead of the New
Year holidays.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 2.55 to 1,554.34 and the
Nikkei 300 rose 1.12 to 286.36. Losers outnumbered gainers by 597 to 398
with 157 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.05 to
1,286.49.
The dollar weakened against the yen, falling below the Y100 level. Some
traders said that volatility on the currency market was a good test for the
underlying strength of the stock market, and that the Nikkei could rise
further in the new year if share prices manage to withstand the current rise
in the yen.
The consensus among most analysts, however, seemed to be that share prices
will hit a low in the first three months of the year, according to a survey
by the Kyodo News Service. Of 30 analysts surveyed, 27 said that they expect
the Nikkei index to hit a low of around 19,000 early next year, while 14
predicted that the average would rise to the 23,000 level in the second
half.
Speculative issues gained ground. Pacific Metals, the most active issue of
the day, rose Y27 to Y560 while Sakai Ovex gained Y33 to Y758.
Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y20 to Y1,630 on foreign buying as did
Nomura Securities, up Y20 to Y2,070.
Automobile makers were actively sought. Toyota Motor rose Y20 to Y2,090
while Nissan Motor gained Y15 to Y817.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 27.37 to 21,629.23 in volume of 23.6m shares.
Roundup
The holiday season continued to limit activity in the Pacific Rim, where
Seoul, Jakarta and Bombay were closed.
TAIPEI gained nearly 1.2 per cent in a rebound after two days of falls, led
by financials, textiles and some speculative shares. The weighted index
ended 79.60 higher at 7,027.43 in heavy turnover of TDollars 88.76bn.
Financials recovered after a recent consolidation, China Development rising
TDollars 4 to TDollars 144.50. Textiles responded to product price rises,
with Tah Tong Textile up by its 7 per cent limit to TDollars 42.30.
HONG KONG was lower on futures-linked selling but recovered from morning
lows after local and UK bargain hunters stepped in as the firmer US dollar
during the afternoon also helped sentiment. The Hang Seng index lost 72.20
or 0.9 per cent to 8,196.02 in turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn, against
Wednesday's HKDollars 1.51bn.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index finished 8.87 higher at 2,243.02
on last-minute advances by several key stocks but, overall, the session was
weak and mixed.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further losses as volume slumped to 50.3m shares, the
lowest this year. The composite index ended down 8.83 or 0.9 per cent, at
967.14, largely due to a 60-cent fall in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 17.00.
SYDNEY ended slightly weaker after being supported for most of the session
by institutional buying of stocks whose options expired yesterday. The All
Ordinaries index ended 2.7 lower at 1,932.8 after an intraday high of
1943.0.
Dealers said that institutions were caught short in BHP after its strong
rally in recent days. This, combined with the strong performance of golds,
underpinned a market which otherwise was weighed down by Wednesday's
profit-taking on Wall Street.
WELLINGTON's leaders, Brierley apart, dragged the market down after Wall
Street's overnight retreat, the NZSE-40 index closing 10.46 down at its low
for the day of 1,909.37.
MANILA indulged in some light window-dressing, institutional investors
picking up selected bargains in order to book higher values for their
portfolios. The composite index rose 8.03 to at 2,785.81 in moderate
turnover of 1.59bn pesos.
BANGKOK saw light selling after falls in key foreign markets and the
announcement of a Thai import tax cut. The SET index closed 10.35 lower at
1,352.89 in turnover of Bt7.1bn.
KARACHI fell on profit-taking by short-term investors, the KSE 100 index
losing 8.53 at 2,047.24.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Domestic fears depress Paris,
Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were weakened in the morning by overnight losses on Wall Street and,
in the afternoon, as the dollar and US bonds took over. However, the French
and Spanish markets had their own problems at the end of the day, as actions
designed to release fiscal and political tension had the reverse effect,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS opened to a Bank of France offer of overnight money, aimed to reduce
tension in the money markets. However, financials continued to lead the
equity market down, said Mr Frederick Sauvegrain at Ferri, and the weakness
in the sector over the past two days was justified at the close as
commercial banks increased their base lending rates from 7.95 to 8.25 per
cent.
The CAC-40 index dropped 33.68, or 1.75 per cent, to 1,894.15 in turnover of
FFr2.5bn. Falls were widespread; but in financials Axa was down FFr8.10 to
FFr250.80, BNP by another FFr4.70 to FFr249 and UAP by FFr4.30 more at
FFr139.50.
Mr Sauvegrain conceded that there were other reasons for the day's fall: US
influences; fears on the Algerian crisis; and a window dressing movement
involving the selling of underperformers to leave the remainder of a given
portfolio looking in better condition.
MADRID hit its third consecutive closing low, the general index ending 3.26
lower at 280.33, after 279.00. Bond markets dropped and the peseta hit a new
low against the D-Mark.
Prior to this the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, rejected either
calling early elections or resigning, saying that this would weaken Spain's
financial markets.
Turnover was strong at Pta45.31bn. One exception to the day's equity retreat
was Banesto, suspended for a time before the sale of its 50 per cent stake
in the Portuguese bank, Banco Totta y Acores, was confirmed, but requoted
later to close Pta34 higher on the day at Pta949 in volume of 1m shares.
FRANKFURT ignored comforting corporate and industrial news. The Dax index
extended Wednesday's post bourse losses, ending with a session fall of 31.98
to 2,077.03 as turnover rose from DM3.5bn to DM3.9bn.
The bourse did not like the weak dollar, or the fall in US bonds which
followed a higher than expected rise in November leading indicators. Bunds
and bund futures followed their US counterparts down, and the Ibis-indicated
Dax closed the afternoon at 2,074.68.
Carmakers dropped, Daimler by DM10.40 to DM752.10 and Volkswagen by DM10.30
to DM420, although VW produced a 7.9 per cent rise in car deliveries for
November.
The worst fall in the Dax 30 was reserved for Karstadt, the department
stores group, which shed DM21.50 at DM550. Analysts said that it was still
priced at a strong premium to Kaufhof, with German consumption, weak in
1994, facing further erosion from the solidarity income tax surcharge
starting next week.
AMSTERDAM dipped in response to lower bonds and the AEX index eased 0.34 to
414.47 in very thin trading.
Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, took an early 14 per cent tumble in
response to news of a management consultants report which concluded that the
company might not survive unless it cut costs drastically. Later the shares
picked up to finish 30 cents or 2.5 per cent down at FL 11.80 on speculative
buying by individual domestic investors.
Polygram gained 70 cents to Fl 80.70 on heavy US buying.
ZURICH was lower as bonds weakened and with the day's economic data from the
US triggering further late losses. The SMI index lost 27.4 to 2,628.8.
Among the financials, UBS bearers dropped SFr28 to SFr1,068 amid large sell
orders, especially from foreign investors, on worries about an investigation
into the price of packets of shares which changed hands in October.
Zurich Insurance was SFr10 down at SFr1,245 as the group said it was
confident that its agreement with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa, to bail out Trygg's
US subsidiary, Home Holdings, would stand, in spite of reports of revised
offers from a group of US investors.
Holderbank lost another SFr15 to SFr991 on continued concern over the impact
of the company's exposure in Mexico.
A SFr2,500 or 7.3 per cent rise in Kuoni to SFr36,500 was attributed to
speculation that there may be a change in the holding of the largest
shareholder.
MILAN, with politics on the backburner, carried its correction into a second
session after the strong run of the previous week, and the Comit index
finished 9.09, or 1.4 per cent lower, at 625.00.
Ferruzzi lost L41 to L1,235 as speculation faded that it would announce the
expected sale of Fondiaria by the end of the year.
Against the trend, Credito Romagnolo picked up L15 to L19,200 as the Bank of
Italy gave the go-ahead to Cariplo's bid.
STOCKHOLM was lower, the Affarsvarlden index losing 3.1 to 1,460.0 in quiet,
holiday conditions.
Trygg-Hansa, however, rose SKr2 to SKr82 as the insurer said that it had no
comment on reports that US investors were planning revised offers for its
Home Holdings subsidiary.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pattern of investment in the world's emerging markets throughout 1994
has been uneven, with many international fund managers turning cautious,
writes John Pitt. This is reflected in the flow of funds, which has begun to
slow down - from a peak of more than Dollars 205bn in 1993, direct and
indirect investment in emerging markets this year is expected to be about
Dollars 177bn. The recent trauma in Latin America has shown that even
markets perceived as being on the threshold of maturity can conceal a sting
in the tail.
Turkey has remained one of the worst performing markets in 1994, although
equities have clawed back some of their losses during the second half. Mr
Tim Lee of GT Management notes that the current environment of negative real
interest rates, easy liquidity and a currency still somewhat undervalued
should provide a stable background. 'However, this bull market should not be
expected to last much beyond the next six months,' says Mr Lee. 'The makings
of the next crisis are already in place: inflation is on the verge of a
sharp acceleration which will lead to much higher interest rates and a
monetary squeeze.'

FT  30 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political worries push peseta to record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern that political troubles could prompt the fall of the government
yesterday drove the Spanish peseta to a record low, writes Philip Gawith.
Spanish markets have been rocked recently by allegations of government
involvement in undercover operations against Eta, the Basque separatist
group. After touching a low of Pta 85.28 against the D-Mark, the peseta
closed in London at Pta 85.15 , from Pta 84.62.
The Italian lira was also a victim of political worries, and general D-Mark
strength. It breached the crucial level of L1,050 against the D-Mark, to
touch L1.050.10, from L1,045.
In Mexico, by contrast, markets rallied, with interest rates falling and the
peso recovering sharply. In New York the new peso rose 10 centavos to close
at 4.875 compared with 4.975 on Wednesday.
The Canadian dollar continued to weaken, despite reported central bank
intervention, finishing at CDollars 1.407 from CDollars 1.403.
The US dollar recovered from its sharp fall on Wednesday afternoon in New
York, where it touched lows around DM1.54 and Y98.6, to close at DM1.5507
and Y99.68.
Traders stressed again that liquidity was very poor, and this was
accentuating price movements.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, sought to calm markets by saying
he would not call an early general election. Arguably, this achieved the
reverse effect. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in
London, commented: 'This only added to the markets' nervousness because it
was seen as a sign of the depths of the crisis. There is a feeling this
could be a bit like the Berlusconi investigations which don't end until the
roots are traced right to the top.'
'The suspicion has been created that Mr Gonzalez and members of his
government knew what was going on, and that Gonzalez could be forced to
resign if any evidence came to light,' said Mr Barr. He said Spanish
economic fundamentals were also not that good, 'and this sort of development
forces the market to reappraise what is going on.'
Mr David Williams, European economist at Merrill Lynch, commented: 'The
basic problem for the peseta moving forward is that Spain's extremely high
propensity to import, coupled with a gradual loss of cost competitiveness,
points to a trend deterioration in the current account.'
The Bank of Spain has said it will defend the value of the peseta, and
economists believe that if it weakens to around Pta 86/86.5, the bank will
be forced to raise interest rates.
The catalyst for the peso's appreciation was news that that the US is
working with Mexico on a credit facility to stop the currency's recent fall.
A US Treasury official said also that Mexico had not drawn on the Dollars
7bn currency support line provided to it by the US and Canada to support the
peso.
The official comment followed market rumours which saw the dollar plummet by
around three pfennigs and two yen during afternoon New York trade on
Wednesday.
In France leading commercial banks raised their base rate to 8.25 per cent
from 7.95 per cent, but the Bank of France held its intervention rate at 5
per cent.
The intervention rate has been at 5 per cent since May 24. Analysts said the
central bank had sought to keep its intervention rate above the German repo
rate, which has been at 4.85 per cent since July.
French inflation is only 1.6 per cent, but the central bank wishes to keep
the franc stable against the D-Mark.
The franc closed unchanged at FFr3.455 against the D-Mark.
In the UK short sterling contracts fell by 10-15 basis points. They took
their lead from the collapse in gilt prices. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at
brokers, GNI said the tone had been set by heavy selling from two US hedge
funds. 'It has been a combination of extremely thin markets and some quite
lumpy orders.'
The March contract finished at 92.52, from 92.66.
Sterling had an erratic day, finishing more than a pfennig lower against the
D-Mark, at DM2.4183, from DM2.4309. Against the dollar it was up by 1 1/2
cents, at Dollars 1.5595, from Dollars 1.5447.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 706m assistance,
after declaring a Pounds 800m daily shortage.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper, aluminium and coffee
shine in an eventful year - The markets in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY, KENNETH GOODING and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For leading world commodity markets 1994 has been a year of mixed fortunes;
and for many commodity analysts a period to look back on with some
embarrassment.
Base metals prices, which were generally forecast to languish, remained very
strong throughout; and the gold price, for which strong gains were
predicted, languished. Coffee's expected modest rise turned out to be a big
bull run; while cocoa failed to build as expected on its strength in
late-1993.
At this time last year the prices of metals traded on the London Metal
Exchange were struggling to move away from historic real-term lows. Most
analysts were suggesting that the recovery would be long and arduous.
Nevertheless, they said, most prices would be higher in 1994 - the exception
being copper, which needed to fall a little more before moving back up. How
wrong most analysts were.
Base metals prices have boomed. Copper and aluminium, the most
heavily-traded metals, are 70 per cent above the levels ruling at the end of
1993 while even zinc, which most analysts agree has the worst near-term
prospects of the LME metals, has risen by 16 per cent.
Nearly everyone failed to predict the impact of two new elements in the
metals markets this year: the activities of the investment funds and banks.
The funds are estimated to have put USDollars 16bn (Pounds 10bn) into metals
so far this year. Meanwhile, the banks probably control 75 per cent of the
LME stocks - traders say that as much as 85 per cent of the exchange's
aluminium stock is controlled by four or five banks.
Consumers are complaining and producers, many of whom were almost suicidal a
year ago, do not wholeheartedly welcome the new element in the metals
markets either. High prices encourage substitution of other materials for
metals and volatile prices frighten off potential metals users. Also, some
producers are using the futures markets to lock in artificially high prices
either to fund further development or to bolster flagging operations - moves
that might bloat future supply.
Nevertheless, investment fund managers say they had good reasons for buying
metals: clients wanted to reduce their portfolio risk through asset
diversification and to hedge against unexpected inflation.
Some analysts still insist that metals prices have outrun the fundamentals
of supply and demand. But others suggest the funds' timing so far has been
perfect and there are solid reasons underlying this year's price rises.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, metals analyst at Bain &amp; Company, a Deutsche Bank
subsidiary, points out that demand for aluminium, copper and nickel rose 7
per cent in the first half of 1994, compared with the same period last year,
while lead and zinc demand was up by 4 per cent. Meanwhile, supplies have
fallen along with exports from the former eastern bloc - apart from those of
aluminium. Some producers have had to buy metal on the LME to cover
commitments.
The year started well for precious metals producers. Many analysts were
predicting a steady, if unspectacular, rise in the gold price well beyond
Dollars 400 a troy ounce and some of the same investors who had driven up
the gold price in the spring of 1993 attempted to push silver through
Dollars 6 an ounce. This attempt was unsuccessful, as was gold's attack on
Dollars 400.
The World Gold Council points out that rising interest rates are encouraging
more gold mining companies to hedge their future production and this appears
to be putting a 'cap' on any price rise above Dollars 400. North American
producers can now lock-in prices of about Dollars 410 an ounce for
deliveries one year forward, it says. In Australian dollar terms, forward
premiums look even more attractive.
Interest rate increases have pushed one-year gold contangos (premiums for
future delivery) to above 5 per cent. The WGC also points out that when the
gold price tested the top end of the Dollars 370-Dollars 395 range, in which
it has mainly traded this year, 'heavy trade selling was encountered and the
price fell back'.
Platinum was held back by gold's lacklustre performance - many investment
funds link all the precious metals in their computer-generated trading - and
supply was helped by Russia digging deep into its reserves to keep up with
growing demand in the western markets.
But booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones helped the price of
palladium (platinum's sister metal) to double in the past year. The precious
metal is needed for the multi-layer ceramic capacitors used in these
telephones, as well as in a wide variety of other electronic equipment such
as personal computers and the new wide-screen televisions.
Few coffee traders would have thought at the end of 1993 that a year later
they would regard London futures prices in the high Dollars 2,000s a tonne
as somewhat disappointing.
At that time the second position at the London Commodity Exchange was a
whisker below Dollars 1,200 a tonne, having already been boosted by a
producers' agreement to withhold supplies from the world market in an effort
to lift prices to a more remunerative level.
In fact, by the time that agreement - styled the 'export retention scheme' -
came into effect at the beginning of October its market impact appeared
already to have been discounted. Nearby LCE prices had rallied from the low
Dollars 900s in July to above Dollars 1,300 in August, in anticipation of
the retention scheme, before the downward reaction set in.
A renewed uptrend in the early months of this year - encouraged by crop
problems in various producing areas - quickly consigned the retention scheme
to history by carrying prices above its target level. But traders saw that
as a 'bubble' waiting to burst. They were concerned about the growing
influence in the rise of the US investment funds, which might pull out of
the market even more quickly than they had entered it.
There were signs that that might be happening late in May when a surge to
within Dollars 20 of the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne mark for the second position
was followed by a Dollars 400-plus plunge in the space of two days.
In the event prices stabilised, and by mid-June any thoughts of a
speculative sell-off had been dismissed following news that growing areas in
Brazil, the world's biggest producer by far, had suffered a damaging frost
that had severely hit flowering for the 1995-95 crop. That pushed the second
position price above Dollars 3,000 a tonne; and four weeks later it topped
Dollars 4,000 to reach the highest level for 8 1/2 years after a second
frost struck in Brazil.
After another retreat prices were driven to fresh 8 1/2 -year highs in
September by more Brazilian weather worries - this time drought. But that
proved to be the peak. Since the rains came in mid-October the overall trend
has been downwards and the second position closed yesterday at Dollars 2,876
a tonne, still 140 per cent up on the year but Dollars 1,260 off the peak.
With weather worries off the agenda for the time being analysts have been
taking a more sober view of crop prospects and turning their minds
increasingly to the demand side of the equation. At today's prices most see
consumption falling significantly next year, compensating to some extent for
the reduction in Brazilian supplies.
The LCE cocoa market put in a much more pedestrian performance this year.
The current three-year sequence of world supply/demand deficits is generally
expected to continue for another two years at least, so stocks should
continue to fall. But that has already been taken account of at present
market levels, analysts say, and it will take fresh bullish developments to
lift prices above the 6 1/2 -year highs seen briefly in July. At Pounds
1,116 a tonne the July peak for the second futures position was only Pounds
50 above the high seen in December 1993. And since then the price has
retreated by about Pounds 180. It closed yesterday at Pounds 984 a tonne, up
just Pounds 55 over the year.
Producer talk of a withholding scheme similar to that operated by coffee
producers does not seem to have worried buyers overmuch and prospects for
renewed price gains in the new year could depend on a return of the
investment fund money that was switched into the coffee market in the first
quarter of this year.
London white sugar futures surged to four-year highs late in 1994 as
increasing supply tightness was felt in the market. In late trading
yesterday the second position stood at Dollars 405.50 a tonne, up Dollars
118 overall but Dollars 9 down from the peak reached early this month.
Broker C. Czarnikow said recently that sugar prices were likely to continue
in a 'consolidation phase' for a while because big importers such as China
and Russia would probably stay out of the market until well into next year.
In its December Sugar Review, Czarnikow said: 'Although renewed strength may
well emerge during the course of next year, there is now less certainty
about the direction which the market might take in the short term and there
is likely to be a period of consolidation.'
A week earlier, however, ED &amp; F. Man, another broker, suggested that the
sugar market could move higher in coming months. 'In this situation,' it
said, 'even routine offtake is enough to reinforce the underlying support
for prices.'
The International Sugar Organisation, which represents the world's leading
producers, appears to go along with Czarnikow's 'consolidation theory'. It
said recently that it believed prices above 15 US cents a pound (just above
the current level) would 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive
importers which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade'.
Volatility has been one of the main features of oil prices this year, with
sharp swings between the year's low of just under Dollars 12 a barrel for
Brent Blend in February and a high of about Dollars 19.40 a barrel in the
summer. Some traders say the presence of hedge and commodity funds in the
oil markets has led to increased price volatility.
Oil prices have remained relatively weak even though the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has generally adhered to the 24.52m
barrel-a-day quota first set in September 1993. The continued expansion of
non-Opec production, particularly from the British and Norwegian sectors of
the North Sea, was one of the main reasons why Opec's strategy during the
past year failed to result in oil prices moving steadily upwards.
Non-Opec production is expected to expand even further in the first half of
1995. But Opec strategists hope that faster economic growth in the main
industrial countries will lead to sharply higher oil demand by the end of
1995, and the prospect of higher prices.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrailian market closed 1994 with prices about 50pc higher than when
the year began. The rise for wool growers was enough to mean a return to
economic production after the extremes of deep recession. The wool trade and
textile industry experienced a much more satisfactory year as prices took an
upward trend. The problem which developed during the latter half of the year
was that of passing on the higher raw wool prices. Lower levels led to
better business but when it comes to replacement retailers were reluctant to
pay prices up by 50pc to 100pc or for speciality fibres by more than that.
Wool is not the only commodity facing this problem of a rising market at the
primary end but resistance further down the line, closely related to
policies designed to check inflation. The outlook for 1995 is seen as
difficult largely for this reason.

refit plan

<TEXT>
Management at Russia's Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter has not yet decided
which of two rival modernisation proposals from foreign companies it will
accept, reports Reuters from Moscow.
The Siberian plant's deputy director, Mikhail Vasilyev, said this week,
however, that proposals by Alcoa (Aluminium Company of America) are less
expensive than those of France's Pechiney.
'According to our experts, the French proposal is about twice as expensive
as Alcoa's,' he said.
Earlier this year, Pechiney submitted to the Russian state metallurgy
committee a preliminary reconstruction plan for Krasnoyarsk.
A Pechiney official rejected the cost comparison. 'The two projects are
completely different,' he said.
Much more ambitious than Alcoa's proposals, Pechiney's Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars
1.3bn plan calls for the complete reconstruction of the plant in three
stages with modern, less polluting technology.
Mr Vasilyev said Alcoa, one of the world's biggest aluminium producers, was
considering acquiring a 20 per cent stake in the plant. But the decision to
sell these shares - held by the state - would not be taken soon.
The state property committee and federal property fund last week ordered a
temporary halt to selling shares in aluminium plants or registering new
owners pending an investigation into share ownership and registration.
This decision came shortly after Transworld, a British firm specialising in
metal trading, said its 20 per cent stake in Krasnoyarsk had been crossed
off the shareholders' register. But Mr Vasilyev said there was no link
between negotiations over Alcoa's modernisation plans and the share issue.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts fall as traders switch into bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bond prices fell almost 2 points yesterday after investors
switched out of gilts into bunds.
One trader attributed the volatility to the thin volume of trading. The
December long gilt future fell 1 31/32 to around 100 15/32 in late trading,
and the spread over bunds widened out to about 123, from 105 in the morning.
There were market rumours that US hedge funds had placed large sell orders
yesterday.
Talk that gilts had fallen on increased worries over inflation after prime
minister Mr John Major had promised tax cuts was dismissed.
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as the dollar bounced back from
Wednesday's lows. Late in the session the 30-year government bond was down
3/16 at 95 15/32 , yielding 7.842 per cent. The two-year note rose  1/32 to
99 19/32 , yielding 7.707 per cent.
Data released by the Commerce Department showed the index of leading
economic indicators up 0.3 per cent for November, slightly over most
economists' projections. Bond prices received some support from a rising
dollar, which bounced back from Wednesday's lows against the D-Mark and the
Japanese yen.
German government bonds slipped in line with Treasuries, and the March bund
futures contract on Liffe fell by around 0.96 on the day to 88.79 in late
trading.

<TEXT>
One of Mexico's biggest companies this week became the first in the history
of the New York Stock Exchange to trade 1bn shares in a year, writes Lisa
Bransten in New York.
In consolidated trading, 1.02bn shares of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the
telephone monopoly, changed hands as of December 27.
Throughout 1994 Telmex, which is generally considered Mexico's benchmark
security, was consistently among the most actively traded shares on the
NYSE, and Mexico's latest financial crisis created enough volatility to send
volumes into record territory.
Mr Gregg Schoenleber, a market analyst at the equity research firm Birinyi
Associates, attributed the high volume in the shares to volatility in Mexico
and the popularity of the company among holders of Mexican equities.
'If you own (stock in) Mexico, you own Telmex,' he said.

Valeo of France and Siemens of Germany are to merge their operations in the
growing market for automotive heating and air conditioning systems, writes
Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
The venture is a significant move in the restructuring of the European
automotive components sector, creating an alliance between two of the
industry's leaders.
Valeo, the leading French automotive components maker, planned to take an
initial 75 per cent stake in the venture, which would integrate the heating
and air conditioning systems activities of the two companies. Siemens will
have an option to increase its stake to 30 per cent.
The venture, which is expected to have annual sales of about FFr4.2bn
(Dollars 772.3m), should begin operations in the first quarter of 1995.
In a related deal, Siemens is to take a 70 per cent stake in Valeo's
electric motors business for climate control applications.

Oriental Press Group, Hong Kong's biggest newspaper publisher, suffered a 15

from HKDollars 307.5m a year earlier, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
Turnover rose 13.5 per cent to HKDollars 815.6m from HKDollars 717.5m.
An unchanged interim dividend of 10 cents a share is declared.
The company said all its businesses had put in a good first half, suggesting
most of the problems came from its new English-language daily, Eastern
Express, which continued to suffer large losses.
Mr Ma Ching Kwan, Oriental's chairman, hoped break-even would soon be
reached and that 'the paper will become a channel for the group to enter

The three parties to the deal, which cover two-thirds of the country and
account for 85 per cent of the national volume sold by the Kwality group,
will make ice cream for Brooke Bond, which will market the product.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Germany heads for calmer waters - A
fall in bund yields is expected in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a stormy year, German government bonds are likely to enter calmer
waters in 1995. However, the new year will not be all plain sailing, with
economic expansion gathering speed and expectations of interest rate
increases growing. Indeed, although most market analysts predict a decline
in bund yields during the year, many expect them to be little changed at the
end of 1995 from their current levels.
German government bonds, or bunds, began 1994 in a buoyant mood, boosted by
hopes of further interest rate cuts which had underpinned the market
throughout 1993. Amid this climate of optimism, the yield on the benchmark
10-year bund reached its lowest point at 5.5 per cent in early January.
Then things turned sour. First, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates
in February, fuelling fears of inflation and monetary tightening even in
those countries whose economies were clearly behind the US cycle.
This was followed by a rapid unwinding of speculative positions by leveraged
bond market players, most of whom had bet on a continuation of the previous
year's bull run.
In Germany, alarming money supply numbers - with January M3 data, released
on March 2, showing a growth rate of 20.6 per cent - sent further shudders
through the market on fears that, far from continuing its rate-cutting
campaign, the Bundesbank would start raising rates.
By early October, the yield on the 10-year benchmark reached its year's high
of 7.77 per cent.
Although bunds recovered some of their losses in the final months of the
year, helped by a more stable US Treasury market and a resumption of bund
purchases by domestic retail and institutional investors, they remain
vulnerable to weakness in the US market and fears of reviving inflationary
pressures.
While Bundesbank officials have been emitting a stream of cryptic statements
indicating that they are keeping their options open on the future direction
of monetary policy, most observers now feel that, although both inflation
and M3 money supply growth are near or at the Bundesbank's stated targets,
the only way for German official interest rates is up.
'In the face of stronger 1994 growth and the higher inflation risk in 1995
and 1996 associated with that growth, we now feel that there is no scope or
necessity for the Bundesbank to ease headline rates further in this cycle,'
said Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at UBS in Frankfurt.
Inflation in December stood at 2.7 per cent, compared with the central
bank's 2 per cent goal, and M3 in November fell to 6 per cent, the top of
its 4 - 6 per cent target range. But although inflation is expected to
decline further in the first half of 1995 - helped by a substantial base
effect improvement in January - and M3 may remain in its target range after
overshooting it for most of the last three years, there is evidence to
suggest that inflation pressures are rising.
'The output gap is virtually closed, capacity utilisation and pipeline
inflation measures are rising and economic growth is strong,' warn analysts
at IBJ International.
Moreover, recent positive M3 numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt,
dis-torted as they are by Germany's new money market funds.
Some DM19.5bn has flowed into these funds between August and November; if
this money had remained in the banking system, November M3 would have been
around 6.9 per cent, rather than the reported 6 per cent.
However, while few expect another cut in official rates, many say the first
increase may not materialise until the second half - and some say the final
quarter - of the year.
'The picture is of sustained but not runaway growth,' argues Mr Reid.
'We feel the market's expectation of imminent and extensive rate rises is
too pessimistic.'
Early in the year, the 1995 wage round may prompt market jitters amid fears
that the Bundesbank could fire a pre-emptive monetary 'warning shot'.
However, most expect the wage round to be relatively smooth, with trade
unions' concerns about unemployment and employers' continued drive to cut
costs indicating wage settlements of around 3 per cent.
On the fiscal front, bunds are likely to derive support from continued
budget consolidation, helped by the rise in tax revenues resulting from
economic recovery and the reduction in transfer payments by the federal
government to the eastern German states.
The federal budget deficit is projected at some DM59bn in 1995, little
changed from this year.
Mr Rutger Teuscher at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt estimates that
Germany's total public-sector deficit will amount to DM107bn, or 3 per cent
of gross domestic product, in 1995. That compares with DM142bn (4.3 per cent
of GDP) in 1994 and DM179bn (5.8 per cent of GDP) in 1993.
Meanwhile, politics could act as a sporadic irritant for the market.
Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl won his fourth election last October, his
majority in the upper house of parliament is sharply reduced and rifts in
his fragile centre-right coalition could unnerve the market.
However, bunds - often seen as Europe's 'safe haven' - could benefit from
political uncertainty in other European countries, such as France, Italy,
Spain and the UK, where imminent elections or political upheaval may scare
bond investors away.
Most forecasters expect the German yield curve to flatten substantially next
year. Ten-year bunds are seen trading in a rough range of 7.25-7.75 per
cent, to end the year around 7.5 per cent (up from 7.65 per cent at
present), while three-month money rates are seen rising to around 6-6.25 per
cent by year-end (up from 5.30 per cent currently).
'It will be largely a year of consolidation,' says one senior bund dealer in
Frankfurt. 'After being overbought in 1993 and oversold in 1994, bunds could
do with a period of relative calm.'

SCA, the Swedish forestry products group, is to sell Melka-Tenson, a leisure
and sportswear manufacturer, to William Baird, the UK textiles group.
The Pounds 14.5m (Dollars 22.6m) deal - Baird's second acquisition in 10
days - is expected to lift the UK group's sales in continental Europe from
about Pounds 20m this year to more than Pounds 80m by the end of 1995.
SCA's Molnlycke subsidiary is selling Melka-Tenson, which has three
manufacturing plants in Portugal, at a price 'slightly above' its net book
value, which stands at about SKr185m (Dollars 24.7m).
Baird, with annual sales of about Pounds 500m, produces chiefly for the UK
market. It said it intended to keep Melka-Tenson as a separate unit within
the Baird group, and maintain its present management.
Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman, said Melka-Tenson would have a beneficial
impact on next year's profits, although it would make only a minor
contribution in the first half. He said the acquisition would leave the UK
group with modest borrowings of about Pounds 3.5m.
The deal is the second strategic move announced this week by Molnlycke. The
company, with annual sales of SKr15bn, plans to strengthen its core
operations in absorbent materials, tissue and clinical products. As well as
disposing of Melka-Tenson, Molnlycke is looking to sell its toiletry
division.
Molnlycke's biggest operations are in so-called 'fluff products', disposable
baby nappies, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products.
On Wednesday, Molnlycke said it was spending SKr400m on buying up the
balance of Scott Health Care, a 50-50 joint venture with Scott Paper in the
US.

The Bank of Italy has given the go-ahead for the L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) bid
for Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank, launched by
a consortium headed by Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, writes Robert
Graham in Rome.
The bid still requires the approval of Consob, the stock exchange watchdog,
but this is unlikely to be withheld.
The main issue is whether Credito Italiano, the recently-privatised bank
that initiated a takeover battle for Rolo, will raise the stakes. Credito
has already improved its original offer, but it is still 18 per cent below
that of Cariplo.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bull back in black at operating
level

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the French computer manufacturer in the process of being
privatised, has achieved its aim of returning to profit at the operating
level, according to Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman.
Addressing a shareholders' meeting yesterday, he said he expected an
operating profit of between FFr100m and FFr300m (Dollars 18.3m-Dollars 55m)
for 1994, compared with a loss of FFr1.8bn in 1993.
Mr Descarpentries said the turnround reflected the restructuring and
cost-cutting measures implemented over the past year, and that the company
should break even at the net level by the middle of 1995.
The improvement in results follows a protracted period of significant losses
during which Bull has accumulated a net deficit of FFr20bn since 1989. The
weak financial performance pushed the French government to seek
privatisation through the formation of industry partnerships rather than
through a public offer for shares.
Potential bidders for stakes in Bull, which are thought to include NEC of
Japan, are examining the company before making a binding final offer. The
privatisation is scheduled to be completed before next spring's presidential
elections.
Mr Descarpentries said the improved prospects for the group should allow a
flotation of shares after privatisation. He said this could involve between
10 and 20 per cent of the equity in the company and would require the
agreement of its leading shareholders.
According to the Bull chairman, the recovery in results reflected a series
of factors, including a sharp reduction in costs. He said that non-salary
costs had been cut by FFr1.25bn in 1994, and that further reductions would
be made in 1995 and 1996.
The group also benefited from a sharp improvement at Zenith Data Systems,
its personal computer division. Mr Descarpentries said ZDS, which has a
strategic alliance with Packard Bell of the US, had returned to profit at
the operating level in the final quarter of the year.

volatility

<TEXT>
Shares in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, fell heavily yesterday
after a series of negative domestic media reports, but recovered strongly
towards the close of trading as the company repeated that it was working on
a new cost-cutting campaign.
In early trading, the shares fell by more than 15 per cent, to Fl 10.20 from
Fl 12.10 on Wednesday. Dutch television on Wednesday night reported that
management consultants believed the company's high costs made it
uncompetitive, raising the possibility of plant closures. A Dutch newspaper
said job losses might be as high as 1,000, while union officials said they
were expecting proposals for more than 500 job cuts.
However, the shares recovered after the company dismissed the reports of
1,000 further job losses and plant closures as premature speculation. It
reiterated its intention to draw up a new cost-cutting plan by the end of
February. It also said the management consultants' report was based on
out-of-date figures.
Fokker's shares closed yesterday at Fl 11.80, down 2.5 per cent from
Wednesday.
In mid-December, the shares fell to a 1994 low of Fl 9.50 after the company
revised earlier forecasts of lower losses and said the deficit this year
would be around the record Fl 460m (Dollars 261.4m) incurred in 1993.
The company has blamed the decline of the dollar and downward pressure on
the selling price of aircraft for its failure to pare losses this year.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Banesto agrees to sell
Portuguese bank holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank, agreed
yesterday to sell its 50 per cent holding in Banco Totta e Acores,
Portugal's third largest bank, for Es153bn (Dollars 944.3m).
The buyer is Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a 76-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur
who has been steadily buying back the industrial and financial empire
wrested from his family after Portugal's left-wing revolution in 1974.
BTA's return to Portuguese control marks a political victory for the Lisbon
government, which has pressed hard for the reduction of Banesto's stake to
25 per cent - the legal limit set for foreign holdings under the terms of
BTA's privatisation, begun in 1989.
The deal is also a coup for Mr Champalimaud, who remade his fortune in
Brazil after most of his assets, representing almost two-thirds of
Portugal's industrial capacity, were nationalised.
Buying BTA will give him control of Portugal's largest privately-owned
banking group, following his requisition of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor in
November. He is already Portugal's richest individual, with an estimated
personal net worth of Es170bn.
Banco Santander, which acquired control of Banesto in April to become
Spain's largest banking group, described the sale of BTA as a rational
business decision. Lisbon bankers said resolving the dispute with the
Portuguese government would facilitate Santander's operations in the Iberian
market over the long term.
Banesto is to sell both the 25 per cent of BTA it owns directly and the 25
per cent it controls indirectly through two Portuguese lawyers. A six-month
parliamentary hearing into the legality of the indirect stake proved
inconclusive. However, Banesto's sidestepping of Portuguese law has been
acutely embarrassing for the government.
The sale has to be approved by the Portuguese authorities.

Swissair, the quoted Swiss carrier, said Air France's partial ownership of
Sabena was hindering its plans to buy a large minority stake in the Belgian
national airline.
'A continuation of Air France's involvement would appear to make little
sense,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, said in the latest issue of the
employee publication Swissair News.
Swissair said yesterday that current negotiations depended on Air France.
'If they decide to keep their shares, then we will have to discuss a new
situation,' it said.
Air France owns two-thirds of Finacta, a holding company which has a 37.5
per cent stake in Sabena. It has been reluctant to dispose of its investment
in the Belgian carrier.
However, industry observers believe that Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air
France, may be leaning towards a sale or reduction of the stake.
'It would be difficult for Air France to muster any further capital for
Sabena, given its own need for financial resources,' said one airline
industry analyst.

<TEXT>
Unisys, the US computer company, said it would eliminate about 4,000 jobs,
or about 8.5 per cent of its workforce, as part of its transition from a
proprietary mainframe computer business to a provider of information
management services.
It said it would take a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of between Dollars
175m and Dollars 225m. In the fourth quarter last year, Unisys reported net
income of of Dollars 117.7m, or 53 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars
2.1bn.
The job cuts will be made in Europe and the US. 'The repositioning will
focus on our European business, our worldwide equipment maintenance
business, and on product areas . . . where we have significantly improved
our efficiency,' Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said.
In Europe, the company has suffered from slowing sales of mainframe
computers. Although Unisys has seen stronger European demand for desktop
computers, these carry a lower profit margin.
In March, Unisys appointed Mr Malcolm Coster, a former Coopers and Lybrand
consultant, to head its European operations. Mr Unruh said the new executive
would 'take steps to focus the business on growth opportunities and improve
programme execution'. The restructuring announced yesterday is, in part, the
result of this effort, the company said.
Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses.
The company has been attempting to expand its systems integration and
information services business to compensate for declining mainframe sales.
Mr Unruh said that during the second half of this year the company had
achieved revenue growth in information services and in the sale of
departmental computers and desktop systems. 'However, a slowing in the
traditional hardware sales and maintenance business and profit pressures in
our European operations have led to a disappointing financial performance in
1994,' he said.
Information management services represented 25 per cent of Unisys's total
revenue, Mr Unruh said, making it the largest business sector. Sales of
departmental and desktop computers are also increasing.
'Our plans call for these growth businesses to provide nearly half of the
commercial revenue of Unisys in 1995.
'As they become an ever larger part of the total company, the traditional
infrastructure must be far more streamlined and efficient,' Mr Unruh said.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hochtief barred from lifting
Holzmann stake

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hochtief, one of Germany's largest construction companies, will not be
allowed to increase its stake in Philipp Holzmann, its main domestic
competitor, after a preliminary ruling yesterday by the federal cartel
office in Berlin.
Hochtief, which is seeking to expand its domestic market share and
international profile, said it would examine the decision and possibly
challenge it by January 10, the deadline set by the cartel authorities
before they make their final ruling on January 16. It is expected to remain
unchanged.
Holzmann, Germany's biggest construction company, expressed relief at the
decision. It had been uneasy about the possibility of Hochtief's taking a
majority stake. 'The cartel office held the trump card, and we played it,'
Holzmann said.
Although the largest two construction companies in Germany, together they
account for only about 3 per cent of the total market. However, they enjoy a
dominant market position in their specialist area, large industrial
projects.
Mr Jurgen Kiecker of the cartel office said the increased stake by Hochtief
in Holzmann would have tightened both companies' hold on the sector. He said
the decision was made after examining contracts worth DM50m (Dollars 31.7m)
or more.
'Between 1990 and October 1994, Hochtief and Holzmann had 30 per cent of the
530 contracts of this size or over. Any merger would hinder competition,' Mr
Kiecker said.
Hochtief had intended to increase its current 20 per cent holding in
Holzmann to 30 per cent through the acquisition of a 10 per cent stake owned
by BfG, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. BfG acquired that stake last year.
Hochtief was also considering buying 5 per cent owned by Commerzbank.
Deutsche Bank remains Holzmann's largest shareholder with 25.9 per cent,
although recent reports indicate it wants to reduce that stake to 10 per
cent.
Hochtief last year had turnover of DM8bn, with foreign sales accounting for
20 per cent, and net earnings of DM122m. Holzmann reported larger turnover,
of DM12.4bn, but lower earnings of DM106m. RWE, Germany's largest
electricity company, owns 56 per cent of Hochtief.

EA-Generali, Austria's second largest insurance group, said its premium
income rose 7 per cent in 1994, to Sch36.5bn (Dollars 3.3bn), and reaffirmed
its intention to maintain its 15 per cent dividend.
EA-Generali is 80 per cent-owned by Assicurazioni Generali of Trieste and
operates in Austria, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic for Generali.
The Vienna-based group said premium income of its five Austrian primary
insurance subsidiaries rose 10 per cent to Sch23.7bn, and its four German
subsidiaries showed similar growth, to Sch10.5bn.
Premium income of the two Hungarian subsidiaries was up 11 per cent to
Sch1.6bn, while operations in the Czech Republic were in a start-up phase.
Reinsurance revenues from third parties fell 40 per cent to Sch800m
following the group's decision to concentrate on internal business.
Earnings per share were expected to rise from Sch105 in 1993 to Sch108.
Mr Dietrich Karner, chief executive, said that the group was satisfied with
its results in a year in which its operating environment had changed
drastically. Austria has liberalised its insurance markets ahead of joining
the European Union.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Jardine sets sail for Singapore
 -The Hong Kong market is losing two of its oldest listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's stock market today loses two of its biggest and oldest listings,
Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic Holdings.
Up to 85 per cent of trading in Jardine Matheson stock has passed through
the Hong Kong stock exchange, with London absorbing the remainder.
Jardine, listed in Hong Kong in 1961, hopes the share trading in Hong Kong
will shift to Singapore, where the company has arranged to facilitate it. If
the arrangements work - including paying the cost shareholders incur in
moving share registration from Hong Kong to Singapore - the transfer of
trading will have a big impact on the Singapore bourse.
Jardine Fleming Securities, the brokerage owned equally by Jardine Matheson
and Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank, estimates Jardine Matheson will be
the fourth biggest stock in Singapore by market capitalisation and the
second most liquid stock.
The defection of Jardine Matheson, which accounts for about 1.66 per cent of
the stock market's capitalisation, and Jardine Strategic, the investment
arm, which is also the linchpin in a protective crossholding with Jardine
Matheson, is the culmination of a decade-long tussle with the colony's
securities' regulators.
In spite of protestations from Jardine directors, it has also been seen as a
vote of no confidence in the post-1997 future of Hong Kong.
The saga began on March 28 1984, when the group said it was moving its
domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda.
Jardine thought this would put it beyond the reach of Hong Kong regulators.
The creation of the Securities and Futures Commission following the 1987
stock market crash changed that. The SFC's power to regulate the company -
especially in takeovers - prompted it to seek other ways to avoid Hong Kong
regulation.
This included moving the primary stock exchange listing to London in 1991,
and then, in 1993, getting the authorities in Bermuda to enact a takeovers
code - based on London's - that applied only to the Jardine group.
An attempt this spring to persuade the Hong Kong government to accept the
latest 'Bermuda solution' fell at the first hurdle.
Ironically, the SFC still claims the power to regulate the company. Its
powers extend to companies whose principle business and management is in
Hong Kong. About 60 per cent of Jardine Matheson's earnings came from Hong
Kong and China in 1993 which will remain the principal source of earnings in
the medium term.
The SFC took comfort from a decision this month by the FT-Actuaries World
Indices policy committee to retain the Jardine group in the Hong Kong
section of the FT-AWI indices. Morgan Stanley took a different view.
This month, Morgan Stanley Capital International restructured its Hong Kong
index to reflect the delisting of the Jardine group by deleting Jardine
Matheson, Dairy Farm, a worldwide retailer, Hongkong Land, the property
investment company which has a stake in Trafalgar House, and Mandarin
Oriental, the hotels group.
Jardine Matheson directors estimate 80 per cent of its stock is held by
overseas institutions, the vast majority of whom will not be obliged to sell
their holdings.

FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Santander snatches cellular
phone licence - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya edged out in bid for Spain's mobile
telephony system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander has delivered a second blow to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, its
chief domestic banking rival, in a little over six months.
In late April it beat BBV in a public auction to acquire Banco Espanol de
Credito Banesto, and now a Santander-backed consortium has edged a BBV-led
group out of the contest to develop a nationwide mobile telephony system.
The result of the contest for Spain's second GSM (global system of mobile
communications) licence ' the first is reserved for the government's
Telefonica ' also saw AirTouch, the US cellular operator, and British
Telecommunications, the technological partners of the winning Airtel-ASR
consortium, defeat the UK's Vodafone, part of BBV's competing group.
BBV's humiliation is considerable. In addition to Santander, Airtel counts
among its main shareholders Banco Central Hispano, a second big bank
competitor and one that had stood aside from the Banesto bidding process.
Determined not to be thwarted a second time, BBV's Cometa-SRM consortium had
made a bigger cash bid for the cellular licence, offering Pta89bn (Pounds
432m) against the Pta85bn from Santander and its fellow Airtel shareholders.
In April Santander took the Banesto prize when its sealed bid offered Pta762
per Banesto share against BBV's Pta667.
With its acquisition of Banesto, Santander put itself ahead of BBV in the
size of its branch network and in the volume of deposits, mutual funds and
loans to become the largest domestic banking group. BBV, which has
traditionally maintained a high industrial investment profile, had sought to
even the score by taking on the mobile telephony business.
In the event, the cash offer by BBV and its fellow Cometa partners was not
enough to obtain the GSM licence. The competing consortia were also required
to make a series of undertakings covering industrial investment, job
creation and research and development, and the bids were awarded points
under a complex adjudication system drawn up by the government and Lehman
Brothers, the US bank.
Full details of the two bids to develop what represents one of largest
single investment project to date in Spain will be released to parliament
next month but Mr Jose Borrell, the telecommunications minister, said
Airtel's bid had totalled 447.30 points out of a possible 600 against
Cometa's 432.67.
Mr Juan Berberena, banking analyst at AB Asesores, the Madrid securities
house, said BBV's failure to win the GSM licence was 'a psychological blow'
that weakened its image but added that its defeat could turn out to be a
blessing in disguise. 'The GSM business is potentially very profitable but
it represents a huge investment effort which will have to wait three to five
years to see any returns,' he said. 'BBV was making a very large bet and
carrying a very big implicit risk.'
A key difference between the two competing consortia was that Cometa's
financial burden was squarely placed on BBV, which had a 29.8 per cent stake
in the consortium, as well as on Vodafone, which had a stake of 23 per cent,
whereas the equity at Airtel is more widely distributed.
Santander has only 13.5 per cent of Airtel and it has syndicated this equity
to a 13.5 per cent shareholding in the consortium owned by BCH. Airtel's
spread of financial backers is further increased by a 16.7 per cent stake
that is jointly held by a group of five regional savings banks.
Analysts say Airtel's financial partners will stand it in good stead as it
embarks on investments that could total Pta200bn. Under the terms of the
tender the consortium has to provide GSM's pan-European digital network to
all towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants within five years.
The Spanish licence rounds off an acquisitive year for AirTouch, which has a
16 per cent stake in Airtel (BT has 7 per cent) and will be its dominant
technological partner. The US operator entered the cellular markets in
Germany, Portugal and Sweden in 1992 and those of Belgium, Italy and Spain
this year.
Airtel will share with Telefonica a Spanish GSM market forecast to have 2m
users and a turnover of Pta208bn by 1998. 'Telefonica will have to beef up
its marketing - in AirTouch and BT it will be facing two experienced and
tough competitors in the cellular environment,' said Mr Jonathan Lee,
telecommunications analyst at James Capel, the London broker.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Compensation for Brockbank underwriter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Brockbank, the Lloyd's managing agency, are expected today
to approve payment to the group's lead underwriter of Pounds 1.88m
compensation plus 500,000 new shares for cancelling a profit-sharing deal,
writes Ralph Atkins.
The package is being offered to Mr Mark Brockbank as the group seeks
shareholder approval to demerge its Lloyd's members' agency interests. Some
of the companies concerned face legal claims by lossmaking Names.
Under the original contract, Mr Brockbank, who owns about 18 per cent of the
group, received 15 per cent of the net profit commission retained by the
managing agencies. Brockbank said it now wanted to set up a new bonus pool
for key staff.
Brockbank's shares, which trade under Rule 4.2, currently stand at about
200p.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RJB ends 48 years of nationalised coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The age of the nationalised coal industry came to an end early this morning,
almost 48 years to the day after the government first took control of
Britain's collieries.
At one minute past midnight, RJB Mining became the owner of by far the
largest part of British Coal: its 15 operational English mines.
The deal will make Mr Richard Budge, RJB's chief executive who has been
criticised for the assumptions used to back his company's bid price, some
Pounds 50,000 richer. His contract allows for this bonus to be paid on
completion of the deal, as well as further profit performance payments of up
to 100 per cent of his basic Pounds 290,000.
RJB's shareholders approved the takeover at an uneventful and sparsely
attended EGM in London yesterday. Investors have already put up Pounds 400m
towards the Pounds 815m purchase price; the balance will be funded with
debt.
Mr Budge said he had no plans for substantial changes to the mines or to the
employment conditions of the 7,100 miners he was taking on. Previous
management had already got the business 'down to the operational levels it
should be at', he said. Furthermore, the enlarged company would be able to
cut 5 per cent from British Coal's operating costs almost immediately.
British Coal's Scottish assets were transferred yesterday to Mining
(Scotland) for Pounds 49m. Celtic Energy, which is purchasing the Welsh
mines, is expected to conclude the transfer today, leaving British Coal with
only non-mining assets to unwind. The deals end a five-year journey to
privatisation.
The National Coal Board was set up on January 1 1947 to own and operate
Britain's mines as an early part of the incoming Labour Party's programme to
nationalise basic industries. It was a Conservative government under Mrs
Margaret Thatcher which decided in 1989 to reverse the process.
Memories of the bitter miners' strike of 1984 - and public sympathy for the
mining communities - were still vivid when the government announced the
wholesale closure of 31 of its 50 pits in advance of privatisation. The
justification was that demand had dropped substantially and and productivity
improved, leaving little other option. Public outcry forced a compromise
with the immediate closure of just 10 mines.
In the end British Coal closed 34 pits, some of which have since been
reopened by private operators, including Mr Budge. Sixteen operating pits
are being transferred to private ownership today.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tide of interest faces many locks - Why
takeover talk in the water industry is tinged with caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Big Ben strikes midnight on December 31, the revellers in Trafalgar
Square's fountains will not be the only ones with water on their minds.
January 1 1995, heralds the expiry of the government's 'golden share' in
nine of the 10 regional water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.
The 'golden share' was devised to offer protection from hostile takeovers
after privatisation in 1989. Its expiry means the nine could become
vulnerable to bids. Welsh Water enjoys legislation providing greater
protection.
Takeover talk started bubbling well ahead of the deadline. This month's
hostile bid by Trafalgar House for Northern Electric, one of the regional
electricity companies, has sent speculative ripples into the water sector.
Investors have reacted to the apparent similarities between the two, such as
solid earnings and relatively high dividends. Companies in both sectors also
enjoy tax advantages.
Share prices in the water and sewerage groups have risen, after a period of
underperformance, in sympathy with the recs. Northumbrian, Southern, South
West and Wessex, the four smallest water groups - seen as the most
vulnerable - have outperformed the sector by about 3 per cent this month.
Speculation has been heightened by some previous activity in the sector,
albeit on a small scale. While the 10 big water and sewerage groups have not
changed since privatisation, consolidation has thinned the ranks of the
smaller 'water only' companies to just 21, from 29 in 1989. The smaller
companies have been attractive targets, mainly because they lack the vast
spending commitments, linked to sewage treatment, of their larger brethren.
The Trafalgar-Northern battle has shifted the takeover spotlight from the
minnows to the bigger fish. 'I wouldn't be surprised. I'm positively
expecting takeover activity,' says Mr Andrew Stone, water industry analyst
at Daiwa Research Institute in London.
Many analysts are already trying to pick the bidders and targets.
Northumbrian and Wessex top most lists.
Northumbrian's small size makes it relatively affordable in spite of its
high share price. It also stands out for strong earnings, according to Mr
Nigel Hawkins, the industry analyst at Hoare Govett. The company's decision
to raise its interim dividend by 16 per cent may have been a pre-emptive
move to butter up shareholders and fend off possible predators.
Wessex could be either a target or a bidder. Its deal to sell up to 20 per
cent of its shares to Waste Management International, the UK arm of
America's WMX, the world's leading waste group, has raised questions over
its long-term independence.
However, having a strong ally such as WMX could give Wessex a fatter wallet
to fund acquisitions. Bristol Water, a small 'water only' company inside its
territory, could be the first target.
Other possibilities include mergers between the bigger water companies, a
takeover of a water utility by an aggressive rec, or vice versa.
Despite all the takeover talk, some observers are cautious. 'One doesn't
hear a lot about this among the companies,' says Mr Don Ratledge of the
Water Services Association, which represents the 10 water and sewerage
companies.
'I don't expect any bids or mergers immediately. Possibly around the end of
the decade, or later,' reckons Mr Bill Dale, the water industry analyst at
SG Warburg.
Their scepticism stems from the fact that the similarities between the recs
and the water companies are superficial. Unlike the cash-rich recs,
virtually all of the water companies have negative cash flows. Even those,
such as Wessex, which have more cash than borrowings, will have to take on
debt to finance the investment needed to improve water and waste standards.
Mr Dale predicts that the water companies will spend between Pounds 6bn and
Pounds 7bn to meet tougher EU environmental rules. Such heavy spending will
hold back earnings growth for years to come.
New legislation poses an additional risk. A future Labour government, or the
European Commission, could tighten environmental standards further. Many
also fear that Labour could impose a windfall profits tax.
Regulatory regimes also differ. Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, has kept
the industry on a much tighter financial leash than Professor Stephen
Littlechild, his opposite number in electricity. Many analysts believe the
recs' fat profits derive largely from a relatively generous regulatory
environment. Life in the water sector has been tougher.
A merger or takeover would also face a virtually certain referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Byatt has given few clues of his views on deals. However, he has implied
he would expect any deal to offer substantial advantages to customers.
Analysts think he would oblige any bidder from within the water industry to
pass on most of the expected cost savings to the consumer. That would
strongly discourage intra-industry deals and, in any case, the companies are
so physically bound to their regions that operational savings would be
limited.
That leaves takeovers from outside bidders. The disincentives are strong,
however. The bidders would not be able to achieve the immediate cost savings
of combining utility businesses, and yet would still have to fund the costly
capital spending programme.
Even deals between water and electricity companies could be difficult to
justify. There is no strong reason for either grouping to expand into
another heavily regulated area.
'The uncertainty in the water sector means it isn't attractive for
outsiders,' says Mr Dale.
So while investors may be preparing for further shocks among the recs,
speculation among the water companies may turn out to be a damp squib.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 80% rise in value of M&amp;As
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of mergers and acquisitions in Britain has risen almost 80 per
cent in the past 12 months, according to an industry survey published
yesterday.
Figures compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the financial magazine, showed
that the total value of public and private takeover bids, along with
management buy-outs, rose from Pounds 10.5bn last year to Pounds 18.6bn in
1994.
Bids for public companies increased sharply from Pounds 3bn to Pounds
5.09bn, while the value of private deals almost doubled from Pounds 5.72bn
to Pounds 11.4bn.
Fees earned by merchant banks and accountants advising on these transaction
also rose - up from Pounds 100m to Pounds 120m, although still far behind
1989's record Pounds 800m earnings.
Among the banks, SG Warburg emerged as the leading financial adviser for the
second successive year, playing a role in deals worth more than Pounds 4bn.
Schroders was ranked second after advising on 28 deals worth Pounds 3.82bn,
and Baring Brothers rose from eighth place last year to third in 1994.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential buys 25% of Thai Sethakit Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has bought a 24.99
per cent stake in Thai Sethakit Life for about Pounds 13m cash, and plans to
bid for further shares.
Thai rules do not allow Prudential to acquire a stake of more than 25 per
cent in TS Life, and the tender offer will be made jointly with the Khun
Goanpot Asvinichit.
Prudential bought the stake from the Asvinichit family, which still controls
a significant part of the company following the sale of 7.72m shares.
The tender offer is expected to begin in February, and will involve a bid of
Bt65 per share - the same price as recently paid. Prudential is hoping to
acquire a further 10 per cent of the company through the joint offer.
At present, TS Life is the second smallest of the 12 Thai insurance
companies, with about 0.7 per cent of the market. Prudential believes that
in seven years this can be increased to a share of about 7.5 per cent
through organic growth, and that the market itself has great capacity for
growth. Only about 7 per cent of Thais are insured.
TS Life has set up a working team to decide how to maximise the benefits of
the alliance. It is likely that Prudential will provide TS Life with
technical support, international expertise, new product development,
computer systems, training, marketing and management skills.
Representatives of the UK insurer are intended to join the TS Life board
shortly.
Prudential already has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Mr
Mick Newmarch, chief executive, has highlighted the opportunities for growth
in the Asia Pacific markets, compared with Europe. He believes there will
not be a pan-European medium and long-term savings market until after 2000.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope takes advice on trading

Stanhope, the property developer headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, was last night
still in limbo - a week after its banks decided not to extend its credit
facilities.
The group is understood to have taken legal advice about continuing trading,
pending the outcome of negotiations with its bankers, advisers and other
companies which have proposed rescue schemes.
Stanhope appears to have benefited from the near-shutdown of normal business
over the holiday period, which will have reduced outgoings. Some liabilities
might also be met from funds held by the company.
The 16 banks, led by Barclays, appear to have taken a sympathetic stance -
at least temporarily.
'We are trying to be accommodating while there is a possibility of a
solution,' said a source closed to the talks.
Rescue proposals from British Land, the property investment company, and
from PostTel, the post and tele communications pension fund, were rejected
last week by the banks. However, talks with British Land have since
reopened.
Separately it emerged that Credit Lyonnais, France's lossmaking state-owned
bank, has held talks with possible buyers - including British Land - about
the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Forum des Halles, the landmark shopping
complex in the centre of Paris.
Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurer which holds 12.5 per
cent of Forum des Halles, is considered another possible candidate for the
stake.
Credit Lyonnais is in the midst of an aggressive asset-disposal programme,
aimed at strengthening its balance sheet and curbing losses which totalled
FFr6.9bn (Pounds 810m) in 1993 and FFr4.5bn for the first half of this year.
Industry observers estimated that its 20 per cent stake in Forum des Halles
is valued in excess of FFr200m.

FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bass chief's pay increases 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of Bass, the brewing group,
enjoyed a 17 per cent rise in total pay last year from Pounds 505,000 to
Pounds 593,000 - twice the rate of increase in group pre-tax profits.
The annual report shows that Mr Prosser's basic salary rose from Pounds
440,000 to Pounds 449,000, while his bonus jumped from Pounds 65,000 to
Pounds 144,000. Bass said this reflected stronger increases than in the
previous year in both pre-tax profits (8.7 per cent) and earnings per share
(10.5 per cent), compared with targets set by the remuneration committee.
Mr Prosser's pension contributions increased from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds
114,000.
The salary increase made Mr Prosser Bass's highest-paid director. The man
who beat him last year was believed to be Mr Bryan Langton, chairman of the
Holiday Inn subsidiary, who earned Pounds 531,000.
Bass has set out performance conditions for a new executive share option
scheme, which will be voted on by shareholders at the annual meeting on
February 9.
The first options will not be exercisable unless group earnings per share
over three years increase by at least 3.03 percentage points above retail
price inflation.
This is Bass's second reform in corporate governance this year, after moving
its directors from three to two-year rolling contracts in October.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Not on the rocks but it may still break up: Richard Tomkins
charts the transformation of ITT as the conglomerate nears its 75th
anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year about to begin will mark the 75th anniversary of ITT, the US
conglomerate once known as International Telephone and Telegraph. Will it
also be the year in which the company ceases to exist?
Wall Street is rife with speculation that ITT is about to be broken up. The
company itself does not deny it could happen; indeed, in March this year it
made what many analysts construed as a preparatory move by announcing plans
to turn its three main operating divisions into separate subsidiary
companies.
With or without a break-up, the company is being transformed. This week it
said it had found buyers for ITT Financial, its group of financial services
businesses, in deals that should bring in a net Dollars 3.3bn to Dollars
3.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn). Only a week earlier it announced that it was buying
Caesars World, the US casino group, for Dollars 1.7bn.
The company that will emerge from this transformation will be very different
from the one that Mr Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive, inherited
in 1979. During an extraordinary 20-year buying spree, his predecessor, Mr
Harold Geneen, had expanded ITT beyond its roots in telecommunications and
built it into one of the world's biggest multi-national conglomerates.
Under Mr Geneen, ITT snapped up any company it regarded as undervalued,
regardless of the business it was in. Its 250 acquisitions included
companies as diverse as Avis, the car rental group; Continental Baking,
maker of Wonder bread and Twinkies; W. Atlee Burpee, a seed company, and
Eason Oil, an oil and gas producer.
Something else ITT acquired during the Geneen years was a reputation for
pursuing profit without much regard for ethics. One of the more notorious
scandals it was involved in was in 1970 when, fearing the nationalisation of
its assets in Chile, it offered the Central Intelligence Agency Dollars 1m
to fund a campaign to block the election of the left-wing Allende
government.
When Mr Araskog took over at ITT, one of his first moves was to soften ITT's
image by emphasising social responsibility. But he was tough in other ways:
he ruthlessly hacked back the sprawling ITT empire, not only selling off
most of the businesses acquired by Mr Geneen, but even pulling out of the
telecommunications business on which the group had been built.
Rationalisation, however, did not succeed in transforming ITT's lacklustre
financial performance. During the 1980s, as profits bobbed up and down,
ITT's stock badly underperformed the market: from 1979 to 1991, it lagged
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-share index by 36 per cent. Investors fumed as Mr
Araskog and his executives rewarded themselves with lavish pay and perks.
Matters came to a head three years ago when activist shareholders pressed
the board to link executive pay to ITT's share price performance. Since
then, profits have continued unsteadily: last year's net earnings of Dollars
913m were an improvement on the previous year's losses of Dollars 260m, but
were lower than the Dollars 922m earned in 1990. Yet the share price has
rebounded on the prospects of what the future may hold.
Today, ITT is still diversified, but Mr Araskog has whittled it down to
three main areas of activity. Financial services, the largest division,
comprises ITT Hartford, a big insurance company; ITT Financial, now being
sold; and ITT Communications and Information Services, a publisher of
telephone and business directories.
The manufacturing division comprises an array of automotive, fluid
technology, and defence and electronics businesses. And the leisure
division, the smallest of the three, consists of ITT Sheraton, the
international hotel group.
Mr Araskog's recent strategy has been to strike a better balance between the
three divisions by selling the financial services operations, excluding ITT
Hartford, and using the proceeds to expand in the lodging, gaming and
entertainment industry.
In the past few months ITT has spent Dollars 400m to acquire a 70 per cent
controlling stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group; signed up with
Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company, to buy New York's
Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex for Dollars 1.1bn;
and agreed the acquisition of Caesars World, one of the best-known names in
the gaming industry.
Not all the moves have been welcomed by Wall Street. ITT's share price fell
by 8 per cent in the week the company announced the Madison Square Garden
acquisition because ITT had no experience in the sports business and Madison
Square Garden lacked any obvious synergy with ITT's existing activities.
'That seemed to scare investors,' says Mr Jay Cohen, an analyst at Salomon
Brothers. For the same reason, the market is uneasy about hints that ITT
would like to buy into television broadcasting.
Yet excitement has been provoked by the prospects of a break-up. Mr Phua
Young, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, points out that investors have
difficulty in valuing the ITT conglomerate because insurance companies are
typically valued on a multiple of book value, industrial companies are
valued on a multiple of earnings, and hotel and casino companies are valued
on a multiple of cashflow. Break the three up, Mr Young says, and ITT would
be worth at least Dollars 115 a share, compared with yesterday's Dollars 87
7/8 .
ITT has been careful not to confirm or deny the likelihood of a break up,
but it says this is not the main motivation for incorporating the three
divisions.
This is not the first time speculation about a break-up has arisen: Mr
Araskog spoke of splitting up ITT in an interview with the Financial Times
nearly three years ago.
But this time, investors see greater grounds for certainty because Mr
Araskog, 63, reaches the mandatory company retirement age in 18 months.
ITT insiders say Mr Araskog, has no inclination to retire. He also finds the
entertainment business particularly appealing because it gives him a high
public profile and allows him to travel the world, both of which he enjoys.
If ITT ceased to exist, so would the mandatory retirement age - and what
then would prevent Mr Araskog from staying on as chairman of the leisure and
entertainment company for as long as he liked?

FT  30 DEC 94 / Athena suppliers seeking legal advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Athena, the poster and card retailer forced into administrative
receivership by its parent Pentos, were yesterday seeking legal advice about
the company's action.
Mr John Allan, a director of Bod Prods, a Sheffield-based supplier of
novelty stationery, said he understood throughout he was dealing with Pentos
and that he agreed to supply Athena only after a Pounds 45m rights issue
came through for Pentos earlier this year. He said his company, which
supplied children's stationery decorated with spiders and slugs, was owed
Pounds 75,000.
Mr Allan, who received an urgent fax from Athena on December 19 for further
supplies worth Pounds 25,009, said last night he was told by receivers Grant
Thornton that he would not get any of his money. He added that in 16 years
in business he had never before had a bad debt of more than Pounds 5,000.
Mr Chris Marler of Davy Marler, also suppliers of novelty stationery who
said his company is owed Pounds 60,000, said last night he knew there was a
degree of risk but thought that Pentos plc would stand behind Athena.
Pentos, whose main company is Dillons the booksellers, said on Wednesday
that the board had decided that it should not inject further funds into
Athena's UK business because there was no prospect of its returning to
profit in the foreseeable future.
Earlier this week, Pentos had changed the name of the Athena subsidiary from
Pentos Retailing Group to Athena Holdings. The directors of the latter then
called in the receivers.
Mr Bill McGrath, Pentos chief executive, said in an interview on Wednesday
'We couldn't give it (Athena) away.'
Mr Marler said yesterday: 'To ring fence a bit of the business like this is
morally reprehensible'. Both he and Mr Allan asked whether Athena should
have been trading if the company was in such poor shape that it could not be
'given away'.
Both suppliers made clear that their potential losses would not threaten the
viability of their own businesses. Pentos declined to comment yesterday.
Camden Graphics, the greeting card publisher, is believed to be owed Pounds
200,000 by Athena.
The biggest creditors are the landlords of the Athena shops who are owed
Pounds 3.5m and, at least on paper, Cartel, the management buy-in which took
over the publishing, manufacturing and wholesaling businesses of Athena
International in June for a maximum of Pounds 1.9m.
Mr David Clipsham, who has in the past worked for both the Athena retail and
publishing businesses and for WH Smith, said yesterday that Cartel was
protected. The company had a five-year supply agreement with Pentos with a
minimum supply guarantee based on previous performance for three years.
Mr Clipsham declined to give a value for the agreement. Athena's turnover
was Pounds 12m at the time of the management buy-in and the company accounts
for about one third of Cartel's business.
The original legal agreement with Pentos, Mr Clipsham added, also protected
the company against any loss over goods supplied.

FT  30 DEC 94 / First Choice makes a 'new start' in links with WestLB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Choice Holidays yesterday abandoned two of the three legs of its
strategic alliance with Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a
21 per cent stake in it.
The group also announced that Mr Wolfgang Trube, chief executive of a WestLB
subsidiary, would be joining the board as a non-executive director. He will
replace Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, which is
90 per cent owned by WestLB.
Thomas Cook bought the 21 per cent stake in First Choice, formerly known as
Owners Abroad, last year, helping it to defeat a hostile takeover bid from
Airtours, a rival tour operator. The Owners Abroad management at the time
expected substantial savings to follow through co-operation with LTU, the
German travel company 34 per cent owned by WestLB.
First Choice will retain its retail agreement with Thomas Cook, but will end
attempts to realise economies through links with LTU. Mr Trube's task will
be to monitor WestLB's investment and to provide an informal channel for
links with LTU.
'I think it's a new start,' said Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief
executive yesterday. 'It's a new start on a very pragmatic, business
orientated basis, aiming to secure benefits for all our shareholders.'
Dr Johannes Ringel, chairman of Thomas Cook and a member of the WestLB
board, said that WestLB remained 'committed and supportive shareholders and
believed that the company has a bright future ahead'.
The alliance always promised far more than it ever delivered. At the same
time the management structure of First Choice changed out of all
recognition.
Shortly after defeating the Airtours bid, the chairman and managing director
of Owners Abroad resigned after disclosing that full-year profits would be
only half market expectations.
New management found that the strategic alliance was failing to win cost
savings on the airline side through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying
and spares purchasing, and on the tour operating side through greater buying
power in booking holiday accommodation. The commercial agreement covering
these two issues was terminated yesterday. Instead, a more informal
arrangement is expected through Mr Trube's involvement.
First Choice thanked Mr Rodrigues, who has a marketing background, for his
contribution to rebuilding the company. But it is understood that his
presence on the board was creating problems in the market place for
holidays, with other multiple retailers suspicious of the Thomas Cook link.
Mr Trube, 52, is now chief executive of Westdeutsche Spielbanken, which runs
several casinos in Germany. He has been with WestLB since 1970, and was
involved in the bank's acquisition of Thomas Cook.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Fininvest sells supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group owned by out-going
premier Silvio Berlusconi, is to announce today the L950bn (Pounds 375m)
sale of part of its retailing interests to a consortium of the Benetton
clothing group and Luxottica, the spectacles producer.
The deal involves hiving off the Euromercato supermarkets from Fininvest's
stores and retailing division which are grouped under the umbrella of the
Standa chain of stores. The division has a total turnover of L5,200bn. The
sale of Euromercato will cut turnover by L1,200bn.
The sale was indirectly confirmed last night by Mr Giancarlo Foscale, head
of the Standa group and a cousin of Mr Berlusconi who told Ansa, the Italian
national news agency: 'I can't say to whom we will sell Euromercato as there
are talks with Benetton and Luxottica; but the COOP could also come in even
though this is less likely since behind them were other partners including
Rinascente (the Fiat group).'
The sell-off marks an important stage in the reorganisation of Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest under the management of Mr Franco Tato. But it also
signals the rapidly expanding ambitions in the retail field of the Benetton
family and Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of Luxottica. Only two months
ago they broke into this field, teaming up with Switzerland's Movenpick, to
pay L2,100bn for the GS-Autogrill group being privatised by IRI, the state
holding company.
The cash proceeds from Euromercato will be used to reduce Fininvest's
overall debt burden which last year totalled L3,920bn on a turnover of
L11,552bn.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Russian army prepares for final push on Grozny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian army is grouping for a final push into Grozny, the Chechen
capital, to end a war that is straining the fabric of Russian society and
threatening the government's stability.
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, told the Interfax news
agency yesterday that Russian forces would 'push deep into the city to seize
weapons and liquidate armed formations'.
Commenting on the apparent contradiction between that intention and the
statement by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, that the city would
not be stormed, Gen Grachev said it would not be a 'storming in the classic
sense, using all means at our disposal and launching an initial bombardment
of shells and rockets for several hours'.
According to the Moscow daily newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which printed
what it said was the text of a report on Monday by Gen Grachev to the
security council - the state body that oversees all security matters - the
council has agreed to take Grozny no later than January 15.
It was clear that the Russian military, in spite of continued stiff
resistance, has advanced steadily and has largely blockaded the city -
although a fight for the town of Argun, which commands the road from Grozny
to the east, was raging fiercely.
Interfax said that General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, had
called for talks without preconditions - possibly a sign of growing
desperation, although one that met no response from Russia.
Having lost the support of Mr Yegor Gaidar, his long-time ally and former
prime minister, Mr Yeltsin is now receiving his most vocal backing from Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the neo-nationalist Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Zhirinovsky supplemented the president's call to the army to finish the
job in Chechnya with an appeal of his own: 'The motherland has called you at
a difficult hour to fulfil your noble duty. The time of serious trial has
come for Russia . . . as well as bandits, journalists and politicians are
shooting you (the troops) in the back.'
Editors of newspapers that oppose the war demanded an explanation from the
president of his allegation that they were financed by Chechens. The
government press service accused journalists covering the war of putting
soldiers' lives at risk.
Mrs Elena Bonner, widow of the physicist and human rights campaigner Andrei
Sakharov, resigned from the president's human rights commission saying the
conflict 'marks a return to totalitarianism'. Mr Emil Pain, an adviser to Mr
Yeltsin who has been the most outspoken of the liberal-inclined aides,
deplored the gap between the president's promise to end the bombing and the
attacks yesterday and the previous night.
That was also taken up by the French foreign ministry, which said that
'contrary to what has been announced (by Yeltsin) we have observed that the
fighting in Chechnya has intensified'.

FT  30 DEC 94 / N-fuel plant loses second German deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

British Nuclear Fuels has received another setback with the decision by a
second German nuclear power station not to send spent fuel to the Thorp
reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. Further cancellations may be on
the way.
RWE and Bayernwerk, the companies operating the 2,600MW Gundremmingen
nuclear power station in Bavaria, wrote to BNF last week informing it of
their intention to end the present contract and use domestic storage
facilities instead. BNF learned just before Christmas that the Krummel power
station in northern Germany was cancelling a contract with Thorp under
pressure from the nuclear lobby.
Because of changes this year to Germany's nuclear legislation, permanent
storage is now possible in Germany. This is much cheaper than the
controversial reprocessing method which produces plutonium. A storage
facility is being built at Gorleben in Lower Saxony.
Until the new site is completed, spent fuel from Gundremmingen, located on
the river Danube, will be stored at Ahaus in the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia (where RWE is based) and at interim facilities in Gorleben.
No details were available about the size or duration of Gundremmingen's
contract with Thorp.
Bayernwerk said the companies were ending the Thorp contract before December
31 to save on cancellation penalties. Other German utilities may cancel
before this weekend for the same reason.
The lost contract relates to the second 10 years of Thorp operation, from
2004 to 2014. BNF had offered German utilities cancellation clauses after
the law change.
BNF had no comment on the cancellation last night. However, the company had
estimated that it might lose 20 per cent of Thorp's orders in the second 10
years. That would not affect the plant's viability, as it was based on
revenues over 10 years.
The cancellation will hearten environmentalists who oppose Thorp's
construction and sought to have it cancelled last year.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Research spending at DTI lowest for a decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is spending less on research and
development than at any time for at least a decade.
Figures released by the department this month show that its R&amp;D expenditure
is about to fall to Pounds 245m in the present financial year from an
estimated Pounds 310m in 1993-94 and about Pounds 500m a year in the late
1980s.
R&amp;D spending is expected to account for just 17.8 per cent of total
departmental expenditure in 1994-95, down from 23 per cent in 1993-94 and
more than 33 per cent at its peak in 1987-88.
Labour pounced on the figures, saying they made a 'farce' of the
government's claims to be a supporter of British manufacturing and
innovation.
Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour frontbench trade and industry spokesman, said
nobody but the government believed cutting support for R&amp;D made sense. 'In
our competitor countries, R&amp;D is regarded as essential investment rather
than an easy target for spending cuts,' he said.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry
committee, said he was 'very concerned' about the downward trend which 'we
ignore it at our peril'.
'If we are going to claim to be competitive, then clearly we have got to
invest in R&amp;D and have good technology transfer,' he said.
He said he had asked Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury,
to answer questions from the committee on the competitiveness of UK
manufacturers.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the decline in R&amp;D
spending reflected fluctuations in the amount of aid provided by the
government in civil aerospace investment over the period in question.
In the first half of the decade, launch aid payments far outstripped
receipts, Mr Heseltine said. That situation had now been reversed.
From Pounds 32.9m in 1992-93, launch aid payments are expected to fall to an
estimated Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94, Pounds 6.6m in 1994-95, Pounds 25.3m in
1995-96 and Pounds 8.4m in 1996-97. The government's net receipts, which it
gets once projects reach a certain production stage, were an estimated
Pounds 58.1m in 1993-94 and are budgeted to rise to Pounds 80.9m by 1996-97.
Mr Heseltine said there had also been a 'substantial' cut in energy R&amp;D
spending. He said the principal factor was the decision to withdraw from
research on the prototype fast nuclear reactor at Dounreay.
Mr Wilson retorted that if support fell off in one area, such as the
Dounreay reactor, it was 'reasonable to expect a boost in some other needful
area'.

FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Derivatives accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives pose a challenge to those who devise accounting standards, not
least because part of the raison d'etre of complex financial instruments is
to circumvent existing disclosure rules. But derivatives have the power to
transform a company's risks - for little cash outlay  - in a way which is
not reflected in conventional historical cost accounting.
The UK's Accounting Standards Board, currently examining ways of improving
financial reporting in this area, is thus right to tackle the issue. The ASB
is likely next year to recommend increased disclosure so that users of
accounts get more information about the risks taken on by the company. Thus,
companies may be required to disclose the impact of fluctuations in exchange
or interest rates on balance sheet ratios. Some groups release this
information voluntarily now, as part of a review of treasury policy in the
operating and financial review which forms part of a set of accounts. The
ASB should go further, for example requiring companies to recognise
unrealised gains and losses incurred on derivatives.
Given derivatives' inherent complexity, though, there is a danger that
greater disclosure will sow confusion rather than understanding among users
of accounts. But if the process of complying with such rules helps companies
better to identify the risks they are letting themselves in for, neither
management nor investors should complain.

FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Australia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Australia about to embark on another vicious boom bust cycle? With bond
yields in excess of 10 per cent, investors appear to have reached their
conclusions already. The chief worry is inflation, even though it is running
below 3 per cent. Interest rates have been raised by 2.75 percentage points
since mid-August and tax increases are in the pipeline, but this may not be
enough to curb overheating. The drought has not prevented the economy
growing at 5 per cent. The reliance on commodities, which account for more
than 60 per cent of exports, limits the effectiveness of monetary or fiscal
policy as a way of controlling economic growth.
Memories of the last recession may have contributed to an over-reaction. The
current account deficit is a concern, but the drought has restrained
exports, while import growth has been partially stimulated by capital
equipment expenditure. This provides further evidence that industry has
learnt from previous cycles, and is increasing investment to retain
competitiveness. Inflation should peak at 5.5 per cent in late 1996, not
enough to justify current bond yields. Industrial stocks already look
undervalued on earnings estimates for the next two years. The Australian
dollar is tied to commodity prices, and is likely to strengthen steadily. An
excessive appreciation would, of course, erode industrial competitiveness in
the longer term, but a strengthening dollar should attract overseas cash,
providing further support for the markets. Shares, down 17 per cent since
February, look over sold.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If ITT's sale of its financial services arm is in shareholders' interests,
the reverse may be the case for Deutsche Bank, which is paying a net Dollars
900m for ITT Commercial Finance. True, Deutsche will be able to reap
benefits from putting together its existing north American asset-based
lending activities with those of the ITT subsidiary, and will gain access to
thousands of new customers in north America and elsewhere in the world.
But the bank will also have to write off substantial goodwill following the
acquisition. No figure for this has been disclosed, but analysts put it at
Dollars 700m. The acquisition adds Dollars 3.75bn of receivables to
Deutsche's balance sheet, but the net effect of the deal will be an
appreciable deterioration in the bank's core, tier one capital ratio. Other
recent acquisitions, both in Germany and abroad, have also involved a large
goodwill element. Given the bank's reluctance to sell the bulk of its
industrial holdings, the danger is that Deutsche will be obliged to turn to
shareholders to restore its capital base.
Investors may be reluctant to contemplate this, as the strategy behind the
acquisitions makes questionable sense. Recent purchases in Spain, Italy and
now the US enhance the bank's position in these countries, but do not
transform the bank's global competitiveness or its earnings power. The bank
should consider pulling out of peripheral markets - especially in Spain and
Italy - and concentrating its resources on developing a world-class
investment banking operation.

FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Prescription for takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost everything that could go wrong for Upjohn has gone wrong. Four of its
top drugs, generating combined sales of more than Dollars 1bn, have lost US
patent protection during the past two years. Its main hope for the
non-prescription market, an anti-balding treatment called Rogaine, was
refused a licence by the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.
Now, the most important drug in development, Freedox, a treatment from a
class of drugs called Lazaroids - because they are meant to help stroke and
head injury victims recover, as if from the dead - has proved a misnomer.
Enrolment for a trial has been halted when it was discovered head injury
victims were more likely to die taking the drug than an ineffective dummy
medicine. At best the Freedox fiasco means a delay in the drug's approval.
At worst it may never be launched.
Upjohn has a huge hole in its development pipeline, with nothing capable of
replacing the sales from the drugs that have lost patent protection. The
first inclination of Mr John Zabriskie, the youthful and recently appointed
chairman and chief executive, will be to soldier on. But the company is now,
more than ever, vulnerable to a takeover from a European drugs group. Much
depends on the attitude of the Upjohn family, which still owns a significant
stake. If the family has lost confidence in the present management, if it
can wring guarantees from a predator about maintaining a substantial
presence at the Kalamazoo headquarters, and if it waits for forthcoming US
legislation on capital gains tax, Upjohn's future as an independent company
is doubtful.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexican peso steadies on hopes for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican peso stabilised yesterday as investors were reassured by reports
that an emergency economic plan would receive backing from leading
industrial countries and international financial institutions.
President Ernesto Zedillo was expected to announce details of the plan late
yesterday, when there were widespread reports on local financial markets
that Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the finance minister, would be replaced.
Mexican reports suggested that the international backing might range from
approval from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations of Mr Zedillo's
proposals to funding of up to Dollars 10bn to ease fears over repayment
obligations.
US President Bill Clinton said he backed reform efforts in Mexico and was
looking into 'what we can do' to stabilise the peso: 'It is something that I
take seriously and we are looking at it very seriously. We're talking to the
Mexican government about what we can do.'
At midday, the spot rate for the peso was 4.925 to the US dollar, slightly
up from Wednesday's close of 4.975, while the Mexican stock market was up
1.53 per cent. Mexican equities in New York continued a slow climb that
began on Wednesday.
A delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Mexico City
late on Wednesday night and was reported to have met Mr Zedillo and Mr
Serra, who has been criticised for poor handling of the peso crisis.
'It is obvious that the president needs someone else to implement the plan,'
a senior aide to Mr Serra said.
Officials said the IMF mission was reviewing the economic stabilisation plan
and might act as an intermediary between the Mexican government and
international agencies. The IMF itself was unlikely to provide funds.
Commercial bankers say the Mexican government would need extra funds if
holders of government securities decided not to roll over their investments
and demanded dollars over pesos.
More than Dollars 10bn in dollar-denominated, short-term government
securities called Tesobonos come due in the next three months.
Backing from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations for Mexico's
economic stabilisation plan would increase the likelihood that investors
will remain in the market, reducing the need for an emergency injection of
international capital.
Meanwhile, the central bank said it was preparing 'new and attractive' debt
instruments to retain foreign investors.
Central bank officials emphasised that any new instruments would be
voluntary, squashing rumours that investors would be forced to buy
government paper.
Details of the complete package were expected to accompany Mr Zedillo's
announcement, the bank said.
Investors were also encouraged by signs that negotiations between the
government and armed rebels in the southern state of Chiapas might begin
soon.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Regulating derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the standards of today's unstable markets, 1994 will go down as a
year of unusual financial turbulence. Such has been the political fall-out
in the US that a powerful regulatory response is inescapable, carrying with
it the risk of over-reaction. Nowhere is this more true than with derivative
financial instruments such as swaps, forwards and options, which have
prompted feverish anxiety on Capitol Hill.
A sense of perspective is badly needed. At the risk of stating the obvious,
derivative instruments have not, despite the fiendish qualities attributed
to them, seriously threatened the stability of any banking system in the
developed world this year. The biggest loss incurred in the markets -
Dollars 2bn by Orange County in California - stemmed less from dealing in
derivatives than from the use of sale and repurchase agreements in the bond
markets. This was one of several examples of leveraged dealing where fund
managers borrowed to increase returns, only to find that leverage can
magnify losses as well as profits.
With Procter &amp; Gamble and other end-users of derivatives, losses have
highlighted potential conflicts of interest in the role of the banks. But it
is not the task of central bank regulators to protect large industrial
companies from their bankers or to monitor corporate governance
arrangements. So what should their priorities be?
The precise extent of the systemic threat is hotly debated. What is beyond
dispute is that while derivatives have great potential to increase capital
market efficiency, the gap between individual firms' knowledge of their
trading and risk management practices, and the information available to
outsiders, has sharply increased. Risks on and off the balance sheet can
change hourly in a business that is increasingly conducted in
over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than organised exchanges.
Lack of transparency
The resulting lack of transparency is such that risk may be mispriced, while
uncertainty over a bank's exposures could lead to a run on deposits. The
threat of contagion within the financial system is highly concentrated: in
the derivative markets in the US 10 banks account for more than 90 per cent
of credit exposures. Most important, banking supervision simply cannot keep
abreast of the quickfire changes in the risks that commercial banks now run
in the normal course of business.
This is a powerful argument for moving to a two-tier banking system in which
the safety net of deposit insurance is denied to the commercial banks'
derivatives trading activity. It also highlights the importance of a rapid
move towards real-time gross settlement to reduce the risk that the failure
of a counterparty will disturb the whole payments system.
Market fluctuations
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is amending its capital regime,
currently directed exclusively at credit risk, to cope with the impact of
market fluctuations. Yet capital is probably a less effective defence
against trouble than a sound approach to risk management. On this score a
recent BIS discussion paper has urged public disclosure of banks' internal
risk management systems, a proposal promptly taken up by JP Morgan.
A more radical suggestion, made by David Folkerts-Landau and Alfred
Steinherr in a recent American Express Bank prize essay, is that the
regulators should seek to divert business away from OTC markets into a
formal exchange or clearing house structure. This would have the advantage
of greater transparency and liquidity, together with the discipline of
collateral requirements that are tougher than a conventional capital
adequacy regime.
Critics of this approach argue that it ignores the efficiency of
private-sector decisions in this area and that a majority of business is
done in OTC markets for good reason: customised contracts provide
flexibility. The big banks also fear the loss of the competitive advantage
that they derive from high credit ratings. Yet the Amex authors claim that a
majority of OTC contracts are little different from standardised exchange
traded products. Moreover, the current capital adequacy regime contains a
bias in favour of OTC dealing. The private sector also faces high costs in
setting up a clearing house, where the returns on the investment are partly
social and public.
In the present fiscal climate few governments will look favourably on
subsidies for clearing arrangements. Yet they have good reason to look at
the case for a more level playing field between OTC and exchange-traded
derivatives, not least because financial stability is an important public
good. That is why increasing the transparency of the derivatives markets
should be a high priority in any reform of the regulatory framework.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Every picture tells a story: The CD-Rom revolution in
computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The CD-Rom disc is beginning to transform the home personal computer market
in much the way that its cousin, the digital compact disc, has come to
dominate the music business.
Their vast storage capacity - a CD-Rom disc can store about 650 megabytes of
data, equivalent to 450 ordinary 3 1/2 ' floppy discs - makes them ideally
suited for multimedia, the combination of digital text, video, still and
moving images and sound. And a CD-Rom disc costs just pence to make.
Multimedia machines with a CD-Rom drive, high-quality sound card, fast
graphics and powerful microprocessors are leading the assault on the
consumer market.
Tumbling hardware prices have put multimedia PCs within the reach of most
home PC buyers. As a result PCs equipped for multimedia have been among the
hottest selling items this Christmas.
According to IDC, the market research firm, about one in five PC systems in
Europe includes a CD-Rom drive and growth is accelerating. 'The CD-Rom
market in Europe started exploding in the second half of 1993,' says IDC,
which estimates 4.5m CD-Rom drives will have been sold in Europe this year,
up from 1.6m in 1993.
The surge in CD-Rom drive sales has coincided with an explosion in the range
of reference, entertainment and games titles available in CD-Rom format, and
a dramatic improvement in software quality.
In the early days of CD-Rom much of the software was criticised for being
slow and unattractive. But innovations, such as the introduction of faster
double-spin speed drives and higher-quality sound cards, have encouraged
publishers, including Microsoft and Dorling Kindersley, to be more
imaginative.
Today there are thousands of discs available with prices ranging from less
than Pounds 10 to several hundred pounds - or even thousands. But most
software aimed at the home consumer market is priced between Pounds 25 and
Pounds 70 - usually a modest premium over print-based equivalents.
The encyclopedia is probably the archetypal CD-Rom product - entertaining,
informative and helpful with homework. Indeed Microsoft's Encarta
encyclopedia is the benchmark for other CD-Roms.
It includes the full text of a traditional 29-volume print encyclopedia,
together with sound, photographs and graphics, interactive videos,
animations, maps and an illustrated time line. It is as quick to use as a
print encyclopedia and easier to jump from one subject to another.
The latest version, Encarta 95, costs about Pounds 85 and was released last
month. It has 26,000 articles and has been updated to include information on
some of the latest news events - including the ceasefire in Northern
Ireland. Despite its US origins, the articles easily meet the homework
demands placed on it by most junior and secondary school children in Europe.
Other encyclopedias worth considering include the New Grolier Encyclopedia
and the new Hutchinson Encyclopedia '95, the only fully British multimedia
encyclopedia, containing some 34,000 articles though in less depth and with
fewer video and sound clips than Encarta.
Red Shift provides 'a planetarium on your desktop' for Pounds 70. This
award-winning space simulation includes over 700 photographs and takes the
peruser on a voyage of discovery across the solar system.
For ease of use and superb presentation, five new titles from Dorling
Kindersley, the innovative British book publisher, are hard to beat.
Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science is a top-rated and brilliantly
illustrated interactive disc containing 1,700 entries and aimed at children
aged 10 and older. Like Encarta, this CD-Rom is good for answering basic
homework questions, or simply browsing. Dorling Kindersley's other CD-Roms
are also aimed at a younger audience, and include The Way Things Work and
Incredible Cross-Sections which provides a fascinating multimedia tour of an
18th century man-of-war ship. The Ultimate Human Body features
three-dimensional images, detailed micro-photography, animation and sounds.
It includes an interactive journey through the body to discover what every
part is called, where it is situated, what it looks like and how it
functions.
For a younger audience, My First Incredible Amazing Dictionary targets
children aged four to seven, including those who cannot yet read or have
never used a computer. This CD-Rom presents 1,000 words in context so
children can see and hear how they are used in speech and writing.
For older wordsmiths The Oxford English Dictionary is impressive on CD-Rom,
with over 2.4m illustrative quotations, but it is costly at Pounds 495. For
those with smaller wallets, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary is
available for Pounds 50.
Meanwhile Microsoft's Bookshelf 1994 includes the latest editions of seven -
mostly US - reference works including word dictionary, dictionary of
quotations, encyclopedia and atlas.
Microsoft's rapidly expanding library of home multimedia titles also
includes Ancient Lands and Microsoft Dinosaurs, which provides a tour of
prehistoric life, as does Prehistoria, originated by Software Toolworks,
which was renamed Mindscape after its acquisition this year by the Pearson
Group, owner of the Financial Times.
Other 'edutainment' CD-Roms for children include Interactive Storytime, also
originated by Software Toolworks - three discs of interactive stories for
children. In the US the hottest children's CD-Rom this Christmas is probably
Disney's recently released Lion King, an interactive animated story-book
based on the children's film. And Microsoft's Cinemania 95 is acknowledged
as the definitive multimedia film guide.
There is a wide range of CD-Rom titles covering the art world, including
Cameron's Fine Art, 450 works from leading artists and photographers;
Renaissance Masters, a two-disc series with 1,300 images on each title; and
Exploring Modern Art, a tour of the Tate Gallery conducted by the senior
curator.
Serious Music buffs may be interested in CD-Roms covering the lives and
works of great composers, which try to make the most of the CD-Rom's
multimedia capabilities by combining music extracts with analysis of the
works and the composer's life. Among these are Beethoven's 5th, Mozart: The
Dissonant Quintet and Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring.
For pop fans, Jump provides an insight into David Bowie's weird world while
Peter Gabriel has produced an extraordinary CD-Rom featuring his music
called Xplora 1.
Anyone wanting to improve their chess game should try Chessmaster 4000, one
of several sophisticated interactive chess games available on CD-Rom - a
Pounds 40 package including superb graphics but which, like even the best
CD-Rom package, complements a real board and human opponent, rather than
substitutes for either.
The audio CD has all but replaced its vinyl predecessor. Will the electronic
book, in the form of a CD-Rom, have the same impact on its paper-based
rival? Probably not, since text on screen is still much harder to read than
print.
Yet, as many new multimedia CD-Rom titles demonstrate, the combination of
moving and still images, sound and text is a potent mix, particularly for
the young. The growing list of publishers jumping aboard the CD-Rom
bandwagon shows this is a new market not to be ignored.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Corruption has no frontiers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For anyone who still believed that corruption was primarily a problem of the
developing world, and not the developed, the exposes of the past year should
have provided a belated awakening. Scandals ranging from petty 'sleaze' to
substantial bribery have broken out across the globe, from Japan in the
east, through Britain, France, Italy and the former communist states in
Europe, to the US, Brazil and Mexico in the west. It is clear that bribery
and corruption know no frontiers.
The rash of cases raises three questions: is the problem getting worse, in
spite of the trend towards market economics, open trade and deregulation? Is
it a problem that needs to be controlled with new rules, or will such
measures merely create new opportunities for corruption? And if more
controls are needed, what effective steps can be taken?
It is tempting to be cynical about the issue. Corruption has always existed,
wherever power exists. On occasion it may arguably be beneficial: where a
modest bribe can circumvent excessive and onerous regulations, it may oil
the wheels of economic activity. Or a bribe may simply redistribute the
profit of a transaction from a government to individuals: then the state is
the only loser.
Where governments are excessive regulators, where they have imposed penal
tariffs on trade, or where they have fixed unrealistic exchange rates, they
deserve to be punished by such subversion. The real solution is to reduce
the bureaucracy and scrap the bad rules, not to encourage corruption by
writing more.
Economic distortions
The danger of the spread of bribes is that, in the first place, they distort
rational economic decision making; and second, that they undermine the
legitimacy of the administration, indeed of the entire political system
which allows them to take place. Economic distortions may be difficult to
identify. But loss of political legitimacy has been evident in industrial
countries suffering from recent scandals.
The scale of the problem does not seem to have grown. Rather, the trend
towards deregulation, privatisation and more open government has exposed its
existence. That would seem to be the case in Italy, France and Japan.
Moreover, the end of the cold war has left electorates that were once
prepared to tolerate corrupt practices in the interests of stability less
inclined to do so.
Political favours
The common cause behind many of the recent cases has been the need for
ever-increasing campaign funds for political parties, rather than individual
venality. The soaring costs of campaigning for political office in a
televised democracy have put ever greater financial pressures on the
participants. In the US, as in Japan, the purchase of political favours with
campaign contributions has long been almost an accepted part of the system.
What is to be done? Clearly it is essential that political contributions
should be subject to maximum transparency. There is a case for strict limits
to be set on election spending. Cost-free party political broadcasts, on the
British model, rather than the commercial sale of television advertising
spots, could be another way of controlling expenses.
Another lesson is that both bureaucrats and politicians must earn incomes in
keeping with the responsibility of their jobs. If either are clearly
underpaid, it will provide a temptation to corruption, which would rapidly
outweigh the savings on their salaries. Above all, simple and transparent
regulations are the best defence against corruption. The less unnecessary
red tape a government imposes on business, and the more open and enforceable
the rules are, the less incentive or opportunity its employees will have to
extract private profit from their position.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Now for the hard part: Tony Blair, UK opposition leader, has
done well, but has not yet proved Labour is ready to govern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair has cause for satisfaction and for consternation. Labour has
an unprecedented lead in opinion polls. His own ratings are higher than any
achieved by the leader of the opposition in recent memory.
But his party is unprepared: expert in the skills of opposition, so far it
has offered only a shallow programme for government. Mr Blair's firmest
policy commitment - to radical constitutional reform - is fraught with
political dangers.
Let's start, though, with the satisfaction. It would be churlish to deny Mr
Blair his plaudits. He has led Labour for less than six months. In that
short time he has transformed the mood. He has begun to reposition the party
in the public's consciousness as value-based rather than class-based. He has
shown an appreciation of strategy as well as tactics. He is a politician who
means what he says.
His admirers are not confined to friends among the Islington intelligentsia.
Every opinion poll since his election in July has underlined the appeal of
this 41-year-old former public schoolboy to the aspirant working classes who
deserted Labour for Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. And the middle
classes of southern England now have a leader of the opposition whom they
can call One of Us. The electoral 'fear factor' which has haunted Labour
since 1979 is dissipating.
Mr Blair has performed well in the theatre of politics. During his
twice-weekly duels with Mr John Major in the House of Commons, he has added
a touch of gravitas to the boyish good looks. He has missed one or two
opportunities, but has not made any serious mistakes. He has portrayed the
Conservatives as terminally divided and out of touch. In so far as the
government has needed assistance in persuading voters of the veracity of the
charge, Mr Blair has provided it.
It is not simply style and image, although Mr Blair is as conscious as any
politician of his public relations. He has pointed Labour in a different
direction. His embrace of the 'dynamic market economy' was unremarkable to
those long acquainted with the realities of global competition. But within
his own party it marked a decisive step forward, even from the 'modernist'
policies presented at the 1992 general election.
When Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, raised interest rates in September,
Mr Blair eschewed the reflex, undiluted condemnation. Instead, he offered a
more subtle message. Mr Clarke was right in his own terms to pre-empt an
upsurge in inflation. But what an indictment of Tory policies, said Mr
Blair, that the economy risked overheating with 2.5m people unemployed.
Mr Blair's attitude towards the welfare state has revealed a similar shift.
He did not endorse without qualification the report of the independent
Social Justice Commission, established by his predecessor, the late Mr John
Smith. But he embraced its central themes: that universal provision of
benefits cannot be open-ended, that getting people back into work takes
priority over handing out more in benefits.
There have been other changes. Labour's policy towards Northern Ireland has
caught up with the principle of majority consent for any political
settlement. Even before the row over his choice of a grant-maintained school
for his own son, Mr Blair had begun to detach Labour from the politically
correct agenda of the teaching unions.
But the political drama came with Mr Blair's announcement at Labour's autumn
conference that the party must drop its most sacred shibboleth: Clause IV of
its constitution, enshrining a commitment to common ownership of the means
of production and distribution.
The pledge has been irrelevant almost from the day it was penned by Sidney
Webb in 1917. No Labour leader has ever suggested the state should run
Britain's corner shops. But Clause IV has been the standard behind which the
party's ideologues have marched for generations. Its replacement by a new
statement of values should provide a potent symbol that Labour is serious
about change.
Mr Blair is convinced he will win the argument, in spite of campaigns by
some grassroots activists to preserve Clause IV. The final decision will be
taken by a special conference in April. One or two of the big trade unions,
notably the TGWU general union, will cling to the past. So too will the
cadres of constituency party purists. But most individual members and a
majority of the unions will back the leader.
The glue holding together the strands in Mr Blair's strategy is a return to
first principles. His message is Labour must rediscover its ambitions, not
fight about the means of delivering them. Fairness is more important than
ownership, equality of opportunity more relevant than redistribution of
wealth. Values should replace totems.
To the derision of the traditionalist left, Mr Blair calls this New Labour.
In fact what he is offering is Old Labour - a spruced-up version of the
aspirational politics that guided the party in the immediate postwar period.
The voters backed Labour then because it offered a ladder of opportunity.
The ideological introspection of the party's activists took hold later.
But now for the consternation.
Acknowledging that Mr Blair has done well is not the same as describing
Labour as a government-in-waiting. Even after 15 years in the wilderness,
the forces of inertia run deep. So does the reflex suspicion of party
activists that the leadership is set on betrayal. At Westminster - in the
shadow cabinet as well as on the backbenches - there are many who want Mr
Blair simply to wait for the Conservatives to deliver him victory.
But there is no absolute guarantee that the Tories will not rediscover their
senses, that the economic upturn will not translate into a political
recovery. In any event, winning an election is not the same as being ready
to govern. Mr Blair seems to understand that. So, in his own way, does Mr
John Prescott, the traditionalist deputy leader of the Labour party, whose
support so far for the process of modernisation has been vital. Many of
their colleagues do not.
The quality of the shadow cabinet is uneven. There is a handful of thinkers.
They are counterbalanced by a group of indifferent, often lazy politicians
who see their role as denouncing the government. Then there is a third group
which tends to drift with the tide, offering grumbling assent to the
leadership but little conviction and less action.
Mr Blair has provided policy signposts: the party is no longer intent on
increasing the tax burden, it is in favour of public/private sector
partnerships, it is no longer hostile to allowing schools more independence.
But signposts do not add up to a persuasive strategy. What is missing is not
simply detail - at times Labour has been overly obsessed with the minutiae -
but a sense that it has formulated policies across the range of issues which
fit together as a coherent programme.
There are contradictions also. Its economic strategy promises to eschew
crude demand management and to maintain a target for low inflation. But it
offers also a target for growth. It does not explain which economic levers
it will use to meet the growth target, or how it will respond to the
inevitable conflicts between the two objectives.
It is the same with taxation. The increases imposed by the Conservatives are
roundly condemned, not just because they represent broken promises but
because of the additional burden on ordinary families. Yet any pre-election
reversal of the increases has been condemned in advance as no more than a
bribe. The voters will want to know if Mr Blair thinks the tax burden is too
high, is about right or is too low. They might also ask whether his party
agrees with its leader.
Then there is Europe. Few doubt that Mr Blair, who wants to take his party
into the social democrat mainstream of its Continental counterparts, is
serious about a commitment to keeping Britain in the European Union's first
division. But a reflex embrace for the social chapter and a hedged
commitment to joining a single currency do not add up to a European policy.
There is an exception to the general vagueness. In one policy area -
constitutional reform - Mr Blair has given an irrevocable pledge to
legislate immediately after the election for a parliament for Scotland and
an assembly for Wales. The judgment of some allies in the senior ranks of
the party who want much greater clarity elsewhere is that here the new
leader has made a serious mistake.
The Conservatives will make preservation of the union a central issue in the
election campaign. English voters may see devolution in Scotland as the
first step towards independence. That could cost Labour precious votes in
Tory-held marginals in the Midlands and the north-west.
And if Labour won the election, its first administration since 1979 could
become bogged down from the outset in a bitter constitutional battle. Dozens
of his own MPs might rebel. Those with longer memories than Mr Blair need no
reminding that it was a battle over devolution that crippled the last Labour
government.
Mr Blair defends the commitment, arguing that greater democracy is essential
to restore the electorate's faith in Britain's institutions and in its
political leaders. The voters may be forgiven for wondering why devolution
should take precedence over better health and education services, or action
to shorten the dole queues.
More generally, Mr Blair insists he is pacing himself ahead of an election
that may not take place before mid-1997. His first six months were occupied
with setting out the guiding principles for policy. The next few months will
be taken up with winning the battle over Clause IV. Then will be the time to
start formulating the 'flagship policies' on which Labour will base its
programme for government.
Mr Blair is fond of reminding those who doubt his determination that, since
becoming leader, he has not given in on a single policy issue. He promises a
simple statement of values to replace Clause IV which will cement the trust
of the electorate in new Labour. He cannot afford to make compromises with
his party's traditionalists. Nor can he afford to resist much longer the
pressure to produce clear and practical policies to sit alongside the
principles.

FT  30 DEC 94 / The fax war: A high-tech challenge in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a non-descript, three-bedroom apartment in north-west London a
traditional Saudi meat stew simmers on the kitchen stove, as Mr Mohammed
al-Massaari, dressed in a white caftan, stands over a row of modems.
This is the headquarters in-exile of the Committee for the Defence of
Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia, an organisation that every Tuesday spends
10 hours sending 800 faxes to Saudi Arabia and 200 to other embassies and
press centres.
Mr al-Massaari, a physics professor turned Saudi dissident, and his partner,
Mr Saad al-Faguih, a surgeon, were jailed for launching the CDLR - which
advocates greater government accountability and stronger adherence to
Islamic values - in Saudi Arabia in 1993. On their release, they fled to
London, applied for political asylum and went shopping - for fax machines,
modems, computers and a copier.
For the past eight months, they have bombarded Saudi government offices,
businesses and universities with faxes. 'We've sent faxes to the king
himself and his defence ministers,' says Mr al-Faguih. 'We have their
private numbers,' he adds, with the glee of the computer hacker who has
beaten the system.
The faxes they send are libellous inventories of alleged incompetencies and
corruption, spiced with accusations of sexual peccadilloes. Typical are
remarks such as 'prince X is fond of flogging people in his office. Sordidly
he often uses shoes on his victims', or 'X leads a group of sexual deviants
who have terrorised the people of the province'.
Last week's fax carried a warning that a leading hotel owned by the Treasury
department had installed hidden cameras to record the guests' 'very
intimate' moments with the intention of blackmail.
The CDLR's own fax machines, meanwhile, receive a barrage of grievances,
sometimes factual, sometimes fictional, from supporters in the kingdom.
Drawing such complaints has required ingenuity - in the form of telephone
lines that allow Saudis to call without being traced.
'We had two limitations,' says Mr al-Faguih. 'US telecommunications
operators, such as MCI, AT&amp;T and Sprint, do not have facilities to connect
Saudi Arabia with the rest of the world, and people do not have calling
(telephone credit) cards in Saudi Arabia.'
The CDLR solution has been a no-charge number, which connects callers, via
MCI, AT&amp;T or Sprint, to a number in the US. That Washington DC call is then
forwarded to the CDLR in London by a local telecoms carrier. The CDLR has
also purchased two calling-card numbers, issued by AT&amp;T and MCI, that can be
used only to dial its London offices, and disseminated the numbers
throughout the kingdom. The itemised bills for all these calls are seen only
by the CDLR.
For the sophisticated user, the CDLR promises a newsletter will soon be
available via E-mail. Mr al-Faguih says he is also negotiating with several
US companies for a contract to fax the newsletter on the CDLR's behalf. He
says he has received an offer from a US company to fax the newsletter which
would reduce by half his monthly costs of Pounds 30,000 (financed by
Islamist supporters within the kingdom).
Even without such advances, the CDLR faxes have presented a growing nuisance
to a sensitive government. Saudi rulers, when they comment at all on the
CDLR, adopt an air of haughty dismissiveness. 'They are nutcases,' says a
prince. 'These faxes don't represent any increase in the kingdom for their
point of view.' Nevertheless, members of the ruling family find them
irksome.
The government is used to controlling information sources. A team of censors
sits daily in an office in the Saudi information ministry ripping offending
pages out of foreign newspapers, blackening news pictures, or striking out
with a giant black X any advert for alcohol. The royal family has also tried
to prevent uncontrolled satellite TV broadcasts in the kingdom.
In a land where media sources are purged of anything deemed un-Islamic,
anti-Saudi, critical of the rulers or even just saucy, the faxes make
popular and gripping reading.
And the Saudi government is disconcerted by their political effect, although
officials claim that the problem is not that the faxes are galvanising an
anti-government mobilisation, but that they are damaging people's view of
the kingdom.
The faxes are also demonstrating the paucity of Saudi Arabia's information
policies. Many of the faxes are sent to western journalists, who, starved of
other information about Saudi politics, have given their allegations play.
For such journalists, there is no one in the kingdom who can be contacted
for an official rebuttal, or to put another side. Some of the princes admit
that the government has found no satisfactory way of responding to the
publicity that the CDLR has created.
Last month, the Saudi government offered visas to about a dozen western
reporters in an attempt to redress this problem. But this new openness did
not seem to have percolated far into the Saudi bureaucracy. After a
fruitless 45-minute interview, one FT correspondent's Saudi minder helpfully
said of the senior official in question: 'He doesn't really like talking to
journalists, so he was not going to tell you anything.'
Another Saudi response has been to urge the British government to get rid of
the troublesome Mr al-Massaari and his London fax HQ - a topic that was high
on the agenda of prime minister John Major's recent talks in the kingdom.
Mr al-Massaari's request for political asylum in Britain was refused last
month, though he is now appealing. But being forced to leave the UK is
unlikely to force him to abandon his modems.
The CDLR may long for the pure Islamic state of the 8th century, but it has
embraced the telecommunications revolution of the 20th century. Mr al-Faguih
says: 'Khomeini's was a cassette revolution, ours will be a fax revolution.'

FT  30 DEC 94 / The end of the sales: As the Treuhand winds up, Judy Dempsey
looks at its record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, vowed to
complete its operations by the end of 1994. Mrs Birgit Breuel, the agency's
combative head, is proud that the organisation, the world's largest holding
company, will keep its promise and cease operations tomorrow.
'We stuck to our mandate. There was no other alternative,' she says.
Mrs Breuel, who joined the Treuhand in October 1990, succeeded Mr Detlef
Karsten Rohwedder in April 1991, after the agency's first president was
murdered by unknown assassins. The agency had been set up in March 1990 to
privatise the state-run economy of former communist east Germany.
The Treuhand's small staff of west German industrial managers had no idea of
the scale or cost of the task. The agency had no reliable accounts or
balance sheets for the Kombinate, the giant state-owned enterprises that it
started dismantling in late 1990.
Once figures were available, the magnitude of the problems became apparent.
The Treuhand had 13,781 industrial enterprises on its books, plus 10,652
small shops and other retail businesses. It employed about 4m people, 3.5m
of them industrial workers.
In the past 56 months, the Treuhand has quickly privatised the retail
outlets. Of the industrial enterprises, 3,527 have been closed. Almost all
the rest have been sold, 2,679 to management buy-outs, 855 to foreign
investors and the rest to west German investors.
In all, the Treuhand has attracted investment commitments of about DM206bn
(Pounds 85bn) and earned DM64.9bn from sales. The remaining 100 companies
will be placed under so-called Management KGs run by west German managers
with the aim of preparing them for privatisation.
Impressive though this record is, the Treuhand has been the subject of acute
criticism in both parts of Germany.
One cause is its cost. Instead of realising a positive balance for the
German exchequer from the sale - once casually estimated by Mr Rohwedder at
'around DM600bn' - it will leave a debt burden to the federal government of
at least DM275bn.
When the Treuhand decided to save some sections of the
industrial/manufacturing base, it did so at enormous expense to the
taxpayer. In the east German shipbuilding sector, for instance, 7,000 of the
original 40,000 jobs have been saved at a cost of more than DM700,000 for
each job. The subsidies for saving jobs at Eko Stahl, east Germany's
loss-making steel company, will cost even more.
'These industries will become competitive,' says Mrs Breuel. Treuhand
officials admit, however, they were trapped between privatising quickly and
saving jobs through what amounted to transitional subsidies.
The agency's record in preserving jobs has also been criticised. Six out of
10 employees at Treuhand enterprises lost their jobs. The Treuhand has
secured job guarantees for just 1.5m workers, only 700,000 in the
manufacturing sector.
IG Metall, the steel and engineering trade union, and the governments of the
five east German states believe the way the Treuhand closed large sections
of industry hindered the growth of the Mittelstand, small and medium-sized
enterprises. 'The Treuhand's policies virtually destroyed the region's
industrial base,' says Mr Karl Rohring, an official of the union's
Berlin/Brandenburg branch. 'The Mittelstand depends on an industrial base.
East Germany cannot live off services alone. It will never become a
self-sustaining economy without industry.'
IG Metall also attacks what it describes as the absence of an economic
strategy to help the newly privatised companies survive. 'That was up to the
politicians,' says Mrs Breuel. 'That had nothing to do with our mandate.'
And Mr Otto Schily, head of the parliamentary investigation committee set up
to scrutinise the Treuhand, has accused the agency of making decisions
behind closed doors, in particular of selling companies too cheaply to
managers who wanted only to pick up the subsidies or the property.
'We were open at all times,' says Mrs Breuel, adding that negotiations are
never carried out in the public domain.
There has also been criticism of the agency's methods from foreign
investors. 'We were often passed from one Treuhand official to the other. We
never knew the rules of the game,' a UK investor complains.
But Mrs Breuel rebuts any notion that the Treuhand tried to keep foreign
investors out. 'About 10 per cent of our portfolio has been sold to
foreigners,' she says. 'All along, we applied the same philosophy to each
sale. We wanted to buy management, buy knowhow, buy expertise, buy
technology - even more importantly, buy marketing skills.'
As the Treuhand prepares to end its operations, however, its pace and
methods continue to evoke as much admiration as criticism. 'I have spoken to
people who have done mergers and acquisitions, and they said you needed
about 10 years for this kind of work. They are truly surprised at what the
Treuhand achieved,' says Mr Horst Siebert, head of the Institute for World
Economy at Kiel University.
The agency has had to cope with obstruction from east German factory
managers, many of them former communists opposed to privatisation. They were
often loath to co-operate, fearing for their jobs if the true financial
condition of their enterprises were discovered.
'I remember when I was carrying out an inventory of the enterprise, one of
the department heads, a former member of the Stasi (east Germany's secret
police), simply refused to hand over some records,' says one US consultant.
'In the end, he locked me into a small room and allowed me to look at the
books. I was not allowed to take them away.'
More fundamentally, there was no precedent for privatising an entire
economy, particularly when monetary union between the two Germanys had made
the east's exports uncompetitive in its core markets of eastern Europe.
Mrs Breuel recalls the early days as 'truly extraordinary times. After
starting from virtually nothing, we built up a network of experts and a
financial picture of the enterprises.'
And despite the criticisms, few economists believe there was an alternative
to the way the Treuhand operated. 'I looked at how some of the east European
countries were introducing the voucher system in which ordinary people could
trade in their coupons for shares,' says Mr Siebert. 'But in the case of
east Germany, this system would not have had the effect of bringing in
capital very quickly, as well as bringing in new management. These two
aspects were the most promising ingredients of the Treuhand's methods.'
The benefits of the Treuhand approach can now be seen in the investment
record: some DM140bn of private investment has been used to modernise the
capital stock of east Germany's enterprises and to improve the quality of
distribution. For the first time last year, investment per capita in the
east exceeded that in the west.
The true worth of the Treuhand's work will be measured by the performance of
the east German economy in coming years. It is now showing real signs of
recovery, with growth expected to be 9 per cent this year and a further 10
per cent in 1995 (though this follows a fall of 30 per cent in 1991-1992).
Much of this growth is fuelled by the non-tradeable goods sector, including
the construction and food-processing industry. Exports by privatised
companies remain miserable, partly because of high labour costs and low
productivity. Gross domestic product per employee in eastern Germany last
year was 46 per cent of the level in the west, while per capita wages and
salaries rose to 70 per cent of the western level, making eastern German
unit wage costs 44 per cent above those in western Germany.
Despite these more optimistic signs of growth, Mrs Breuel declines to
speculate what the east German economy will look like in 10 years. 'I am no
Delphi. But I have no doubt that the kind of management skills we have
bought and investment decisions we have made will bear fruit.'

FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Zimbabwe tobacco growers diversify by
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P W RICHARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your excellent article, 'Zimbabwe's flower exports take to
the sky' (December 21). It is incorrect to say that 'the (flower) industry
took off when white tobacco farmers decided to diversify, fearing the
strength of the anti-smoking lobby in the west'.
Traditionally, tobacco production has been the mainstay of farming in those
areas of Zimbabwe suitable for this purpose. However, generations of tobacco
farmers have recognised the danger of having all your eggs in one basket and
have attempted different forms of diversification.
I well remember the governor of the Reserve Bank, when opening the annual
tobacco congress in 1961, exhorting tobacco growers to diversify and
suggesting ground nuts as a possible crop. This diversification has ebbed
and flowed over the years, depending on the prevailing economic return of
tobacco vis a vis that of alternative crops.
Horticulture is presently the most popular alternative source of income for
tobacco farmers. Not because of a fear of declining tobacco fortunes due to
the anti-smoking campaign but because horticulture currently enjoys a
satisfactory return on each dollar invested. To achieve such a return does,
however, require a massive initial capital investment. Tobacco is the only
crop which can significantly carry that investment until the first return is
realised.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to achieve a better balance in
social policy in Europe and the UK (3)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS POND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your call for a debate about worker rights is welcome ('Time to debate
worker rights', December 22). The UK is almost the least-regulated of the
OECD economies, without legal pay protection, limits to working hours or a
statutory right to paid holidays. Yet recent evidence provided by both the
European Commission and the employment department has demonstrated that the
deregulation strategy has not created significant numbers of new jobs.
Indeed, the UK's record of job creation is rather poorer over the medium
term than that of other economies with far higher levels of social and
employment protection.
Employment secretary Michael Portillo's decision earlier this month to opt
out of a European directive providing improved rights for part-timers and
temporary workers is a case in point. While other EU governments consider
that improved rights for part-timers will increase flexibility by
encouraging more people to accept part-time employment, the UK insists that
fewer such jobs will be created.
The same arguments were used against the Equal Pay Act. If companies had to
pay the same wage for women as for men, it was said, they would cease to
employ people full-time if they were required to provide the same rights to
part-timers.
Your editorial calls for 'a framework of employment rights, which could make
the two demands - flexibility and fairness - more visibly compatible'. The
experience of the US, which pursued the same deregulation strategy as the UK
during the 1980s, provides an important lesson.
As Robert Reich, US labour secretary, has explained, the insecurity and
uncertainty that deregulation created made people less willing to accept the
changes that a modern economy requires. The lack of employment rights has
resulted in less flexibility, not more.
Fairness and flexibility are not incompatible: indeed, it seems unlikely
that the latter can, in the long term, be achieved without the former.

Sir, Peter Cooke's thoughtful letter was published in the same issue in
which you featured a report, entitled 'Germany 'ahead of UK on labour costs'
', detailing the Confederation of British Industry's concerns that Germany's
unit labour costs are reducing at the same time as the UK's are again
beginning to increase.
It would seem that the current policy of resisting the legal protection of
employee rights is no guarantee of maintaining comparatively low unit labour
costs, even when the comparison is with Germany, the European country where
those rights are most entrenched.

social policy in Europe and the UK (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBBIE GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Peter Cooke (Letters, December 29) maintains that 'the economic
value of EU membership should be shared partly in the form of improved
social benefits for workers where those can be delivered without prejudicing
competitiveness'. Few would argue with that. But the problem with many of
the social measures brought forward by the European Commission - including
the European works council directive - is that they do compromise
competitiveness, and at a time when Europe's share of world trade is
falling. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, has been worse
as a result.
The problem is that social policy has been too much concerned with the
rights of those in employment and too little directed towards what would
help the 20m out of work in the EU find jobs. The result has been both
inflexibility in labour markets and high social costs for every person
employed across much of Europe.
That undermines competitiveness and the creation of jobs. Employers are well
aware of this, but it is also being recognised now by other objective
observers, notably the OECD in its recent jobs study.
It was an inevitable consequence of the general approach of harmonising
social provisions at the most generous - and therefore the costliest and
most restrictive - level applying anywhere in Europe. The social chapter of
the Maastricht treaty, with its provision for majority voting in place of
unanimity on a wider range of topics, threatened more of the same - rather
than the radical rethink required. That affects British businesses and jobs.
UK companies value the social chapter opt-out accordingly.
Some welcome signs of a shift in the Commission's thinking have emerged
during the past 12 months, not least Commission president Jacques Delors'
recognition of the competitive challenge to Europe, and social affairs
commissioner Flynn's promise of no new raft of legislation. A better balance
in European social policy may now emerge. But whether that would have
happened - and whether it will yet prevail - without vigorous advocacy from
British ministers aimed at persuading their Continental colleagues must be
open to question.
There are, indeed, still ostriches hiding from the challenge of change and
arguing for the old approach, though they are more commonly found in
Brussels than Westminster.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Arts: Britain's opera houses move into the future - Richard
Fairman reviews a morale-boosting year of innovative productions, noisy
audiences and new theatres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nation may have lost its enthusiasm for moving house, but opera
companies are on the move as never before. In a round of keeping up with the
Joneses that puts Acacia Drive to shame, UK opera companies are all - with
one exception - in the process of redeveloping, upgrading, or building new
homes from scratch.
It has not gone unnoticed in political circles that the first new
opera-house to open its front door to the public was the only one in the
private sector. Glyndebourne did everything right. Having raised private
sponsorship during the boom years, it built its new theatre when costs were
low during the recession. Unveiled in May, 60 years to the day after the
first performance in the old house, this handsome building combines good
acoustics and international class, all at the very reasonable price tag of
Pounds 33 million.
Nobody will have begrudged Glyndebourne its year of triumph, not even those
who booed the new production of Don Giovanni. As well as the theatre, this
year's festival inaugurated a new artistic partnership between Andrew Davis
as music director and Graham Vick as director of productions, a team which
has ambitions to lead this rural festival into new pastures, more
challenging than the old.
Their own contribution to the season was Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin,
stylishly designed, well sung and played. This was self-evidently an evening
of quality, even to those (admittedly a minority) who found it cool and
calculated, as I did. Deborah Warner's uncompromising production of Don
Giovanni divided opinion more violently. The key question for Glyndebourne
is how far its core audience will be prepared to support this shift in
artistic direction. Seats used to be like gold dust, but not this year. What
will happen in 1995, when the new productions are Rossini's Ermione and
Janacek's The Makropoulos Case? Or in 1996 with Handel's rarely-heard
oratorio Theodora (in the hands of enfant terrible Peter Sellars) and Berg's
Lulu?
At Covent Garden any action on the rebuilding front remains on hold at the
moment. Westminster City Council approved the revised plans for the Pounds
100 million redevelopment scheme submitted by the Royal Opera House in June,
but that was probably little more than a formality. The phantom of the opera
waiting in the wings for the general director, Jeremy Isaacs, is public
opinion, which dislikes the idea of the poor man's National Lottery stake
going to pay for the rich man's opera-house.
For the time being, however, morale at the Royal Opera remains fairly high.
Nothing brings a company's artistic strategy more clearly into focus than
embarking on Wagner's Ring. After a couple of false starts in recent years -
one staging abandoned, another borrowed - this latest production by Richard
Jones looks set to run the course, guaranteeing front page news as it goes
its wild way. Either one loves Wotan as a traffic cop and the Rhinemaidens
as fat, flubbery, Michelin-girls, or one hates them.
To please its paymasters, the Royal Opera might think of making a gesture
towards the UK's balance of payments. A clear trend has emerged this year
for in-house productions - like Massenet's frothy Cherubin and the
recently-televised La traviata - to be sturdy examples of British
manufacturing, while those imported from overseas have been shoddy goods.
Did nobody notice that the Old Testament dust had settled on Rossini's Mose
in Egitto before it left Bologna, or that the kiss of death had long since
suffocated Toulouse's moribund production of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette?
The Royal Opera also hit the headlines when The Hecklers booed and jeered a
revival of Birtwistle's Gawain. Ironically their protest backfired: thanks
to the publicity the opera was a near sell-out, so 'boo' to them instead. In
musical terms it has been a good year, especially for the music director,
Bernard Haitink, who was praised for his Ring and showed himself a tender
Janacek conductor with Katya Kabanova. If the redevelopment becomes reality
and the Royal Opera House closes in 1997, what will he do? Surely he will
not be content to be conductor without portfolio?
One irony is that the arrival of the National Lottery could give us less
arts, not more. If English National Opera succeeds in getting the Pounds 40m
it requires for the refurbishment of the Coliseum, both London opera-houses
could be closed for building work at the same time. Restoring Edwardian
grandeur is the aim here: much of the splendour of Frank Matcham's Imperial
Rome interior is under a layer of grime at the moment (how many have seen
the mosaic floors proclaiming 'Salve' inside the entrance?).
The company spirit at ENO will have been buoyed by a rise in attendances to
around 78 per cent (up from 60 per cent) since the summer. Having inherited
a stock of productions that the Arts Council declared redundant, the new
regime has set about renewing the standard repertory at top speed. Sometimes
the haste was obvious. Productions such as Cosi fan tutte and Eugene Onegin
sought to offer novelty at the lowest possible dent to the balance sheet and
may be replaced themselves in a year or two's time. The disastrous Jenufa
will probably not last even that long. Perhaps the disposable opera
production has finally arrived.
Dennis Marks, the general director, will be aware that his successes have
been the most professional presentations, like Massenet's long-unseen Don
Quichotte and Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier with old ENO troupers Anne Evans
and John Tomlinson lured back from Bayreuth. Musorgsky's five-hour
Khovanshchina offered an epic lesson in Russian history to which the party
faithful turned up in large numbers. Even Judith Weir's slip of a new opera,
Blond Eckbert, was reasonably well attended, although Marks looked enviously
at the full houses for Birtwistle up the road. If only The Hecklers could
have visited ENO too, he opined ruefully.
Scottish Opera is lucky enough to have unveiled its new theatre already.
Although the company's base remains in Glasgow, it now has the refurbished
1920s Empire Theatre for its visits to Edinburgh. A highly-praised gala
performance of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde in June marked the transformation
of this ex-bingo hall into an opera-house of some style, blessed with
excellent sight-lines and lively acoustics - all for a mere Pounds 21m out
of the corporate sporran. The canny Scots spend their money wisely.
In artistic terms, more regrettably, there was no profligacy either. The
company enjoyed modest successes, such as a pleasing L'elisir d'amore and an
effective Peter Grimes, but Tim Albery's staging of Fidelio was the only one
to exhibit real flair and ambition. Perhaps surviving at all in the present
economic climate is as much as one has a right to expect.
Smaller companies did not enjoy a good year. Opera Factory made a
heartrending appeal from the stage for donations, but after their
cliche-ridden production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and the
premiere of Nigel Osborne's uncommunicative Sarajevo, sympathisers will have
put their wallets straight back in their pockets. Almeida Opera's two
premieres - Elena Firsova's The Nightingale and the Rose and Jonathan Dove's
Siren Song - were short and sweet. English Touring Opera kept ticking over
with La Boheme and Gluck's Orfeo. The exception (again]) was Glyndebourne
Touring Opera, which scored a monster of a hit with Birtwistle's King Kong
opera, The Second Mrs Kong.
Round the rest of the country opera managers were deserting ship. Ian
Ritchie had barely been with Opera North for a year before he was packing
his bags, apparently oblivious that he was running the only opera company
not moving to a new theatre. From its base in Leeds, Opera North continues
to seek out the operas that nobody else dares to play. This season included
a creditable attempt to resurrect Chabrier's seductive Le Roi malgre lui, a
newly-discovered version of Puccini's La rondine and Verdi's first opera,
Oberto, produced by John Tomlinson, laying aside his Wagnerian spear. In
addition, the company scored a popular goal with Benedict Mason's
footballing opera, Playing Away, when it arrived back at its home ground
after the premiere at the Munich Biennale. Opera North remains at the top of
the 'Adventurousness' league.
Matthew Epstein lasted longer at the head of Welsh National Opera - three
years out of his contracted five. Blaming cuts in subsidy, he left no doubt
as to the reason for his departure, adding ominously as he went that he
hoped 'WNO will be strong enough to move into (its new theatre)'. The plan
in Wales is for a wholly new theatre in the Cardiff Bay development area,
financed with a grant from the Millennium Fund. At a cost of around Pounds
43m the company hopes to have a striking 'glass necklace' building that will
become a local landmark, like the opera house in Sydney. With a bit of luck
it might be suitable for opera, too.
Epstein's talent-spotting eye was doubtless responsible for finding some of
WNO's promising young singers during the year, but there have also been
interesting productions, like the provocative Turandot and a heavenly
staging of Berlioz's Beatrice et Benedict, produced by Elijah Moshinsky. I
have left this until last, because it was the most outstanding opera
performance in Britain this year, near to perfection in every way. An
evening like that leaves one full of optimism for a future which sees our
opera companies installed in fantastic, state-of-the-art theatres. If any of
them fails to get the money, they could always try buying a ticket for the
National Lottery.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Arts: London's concertgoers spoiled for choice - Times may
be tough and tastes changing, but the city's music remains healthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London concert scene was neither noticeably richer or poorer this year
than before; which is to say, it has still been pretty rich. Shrunken state
support has not diminished the variety of the 'big five' orchestras'
programmes (I count the BBC Symphony among them, as one must). For every
plain, undisguised money-spinner on this year's menu, you could find two or
three in the South Bank brochures for, say, 1965 or 1970.
Which is only to remark: the notion of a 'money-spinning' concert is
elusive. A quarter-century back, Beethoven's Third, Fifth and Ninth
Symphonies, Tchaikovsky's Fifth and Sixth and two Rakhmaninov piano concerti
were supposed to be surefire draws, almost as safe as the '1812' Overture
with fireworks laid on. None of them now guarantees even a full-ish house,
not without a renowned conductor. The ageing audience for the traditional
middle-brow favourites has become unreliable - or, perhaps, just experienced
enough to turn choosy.
The only sure successes are (a) operas in concert form with famous singers,
(b) some performances of not-too-unfamiliar works - a much broader category
than it used to be - by very big-name conductors, and (c) just once in a
while, some especially ambitious piece (massive, or inordinately long or
fabulously complicated) by a currently trendy composer. Any of those latter
is difficult to plan with confidence.
Yet the average numbers for concert evenings remain healthy enough: down a
bit while the perceived recession continues, but not more so than the paying
audiences for other arts. Despite the fearful internecine competition
between them none of the major London orchestras has collapsed yet, nor
abandoned the capital for hand-to-mouth life in the provinces (though they
complain that every London concert costs them money). These days, opera
commands many more column-inches in the press than non-operatic music; but
audiences for the latter, night by night, are in toto larger by far.
We are admittedly short of great conductors. (So is everybody.) The
departures of Giuseppe Sinopoli from the Philharmonia and Franz Welser-Most
from the London Philharmonic have not incurred widespread grief, though they
both had their moments. The great Klaus Tennstedt, whose LPO concerts these
past years have been regularly announced, sold out and then relegated to a
substitute or cancelled, has finally thrown in the towel. The loss to the
London Symphony of Michael Tilson Thomas - at the gain of Colin Davis - we
can bear without pain; the Tilson Thomas career needed a move to America at
this stage, and will no doubt benefit by it. The Royal Philharmonic
continues to rotate any number of conductors, but can still rise beautifully
to an occasion.
Are so many orchestras a crazy London luxury? Well: not as long as they
survive. For one thing, the notoriously scant rehearsal-time that they often
get might not be improved in the least if they were fewer. Nor could we
expect them, if they took to the Continental and American routine of
repeating every concert several times in a week, to risk as many bold
programmes as they do.
The fashion for mini-'festivals' has somewhat declined. This year the main
ones have been Rostropovich's Schnittke conspectus at the Barbican, the
South Bank's celebration of Luciano Berio, and Tilson Thomas's continuing
Mahler cycle with the LPO; but nothing so unexpected and enlightening as the
Barbican's recent 'Tender is the North' conspectus of Scandinavian music,
let alone the exhaustive South Bank forays into Stravinsky, Webern and
Roberto Gerhard longer ago.
Though that is perhaps no more than happenchance, it may reflect their
promoters' concern that there is no longer a 'special' audience for anything
too special. Nobody can count upon younger ears eagerly zeroing into music
they want to know more about, because they come from too many different
places. There is no regular place appointed to classical music in British
schools now, unlike those of virtually every European country. To be
prompted toward knowing more of it you have to be lucky in your local
education, or divine extra possibilities in pop and rock and popular
minimalism, or be moved by fashionable meditators like Arvo Part and John
Tavener.
It is left to the Wigmore Hall to sustain crusty, dependable old
music-lovers. Chamber music, and piano and song recitals, sound better there
than almost anywhere (except when the artists' ears have been spoiled by
playing too much in grander venues). The Queen Elizabeth Hall, much improved
by narrowing the available space for a more intimate audience, remains
nevertheless too large for immediate communication - though Richard Goode's
inspired, ongoing Beethoven piano-cycle goes a long way toward refuting that
charge. The Wigmore remains the place to hear Dichterliebe, Winterreise or
Die schone Mullerin , the Beethoven quartets or Bartok's or the Schubert
trios; and its best artists are invariably sold out.
We have little room for complaint. Besides the many Wigmore series (which do
need advance booking) and the mini-festivals in the larger halls, there have
been plenty of rewarding one-offs this year - Maxwell Davies's lithe new
Fifth Symphony, and Boulez's knife-edge readings of Stravinsky's Symphony of
Psalms and his own Cummings ist der Dichter at the Proms; Louis Andriessen's
De Materie in the South Bank 'Meltdown' festival (not otherwise
distinguished), and Berio's opera La vera storia and the complete sequence
of his Sequenze; Chailly's Mahler Seventh with the Concertgebouw, and also
some electrifying moments in Tilson Thomas's Mahler series so far.
On the smaller Wigmore scale, I remember with acute pleasure concerts by the
steadily maturing Carmina Quartet, the Ysaye and the sumptuous Vogler. In
Lieder, Nathan Berg's beautiful sound - and intelligence, and flair, and the
even younger Matthias Gorne's precocious art; and at the Barbican, the
unequalled Borodin Quartet in Shostakovich, and peerless young Maxim
Vengerov's virtuoso fiddle. Times may be tougher than anybody likes to
acknowledge, but we are still spoiled for choice.

In the words of S. Sondheim, comedy tonight. On BBC1 Dawn French and
Jennifer Saunders resume the partnership they interrupted for solo careers.
Saunders has emerged as the more talented of the two, or perhaps the
shrewder judge of her own talents: Absolutely Fabulous has been
epoch-making, while French's forays into comedy and drama have shown her to
be less versatile and a less good judge of scripts. Never mind; they are
together again at 9.30, and the BBC's recent return to Dickensian costume
does not go unnoticed.
For some time Rory Bremner has been providing genuine satire, abetted by the
intelligent and incisive double act of Johns Fortune and Bird in the
isolated fastness of Channel 4. There is usually more pointed comment in
five minutes of his shows than the flailing spite of Spitting Image and
complacent juvenilia of Have I Got News for You put together. A BAFTA award
this year was well deserved. Rory Bremner's Christmas Turkey at 10pm should
provide plenty of stuffing and lots of sauce.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Management: Big ideas and big books - The FT canvassed
businessmen, consultants and academics for their thoughts on two questions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Percy Barnevik, president and CEO of ABB Asea Brown Boveri.
Big idea: Managers need to break their organisations out of the narrow
confines of national borders if they want to tap the opportunities for freer
global and regional trade opened in 1994 - such as the Gatt agreement,
Nafta, an expanded European Union and progress in the Asia-Pacific region.
This requires not only global management but also regional management with
full decision-making responsibility for total operations and product supply
in, for example, eastern and western Europe combined.
Reading: The Endangered American Dream by Edward N Luttwak (published by
Simon &amp; Schuster).
Luttwak has a lot of insight and is provocative. Having seen the end of the
European 'welfare state', the collapse of communism and the slowing of the
Japanese economic engine, you wonder after reading this book where the
world's one remaining superpower really is heading long term. While you may
not agree with all of his descriptions and recipes for change - reforms to
public education, taxation and industrial policy, and unprecedented trade
liberalisation - he gives you reason to think. The author's humour and
hands-on style also make it easy to read.
David Simon, group chief executive and deputy chairman, British Petroleum.
Big idea: Listen. Advice in short, punchy statements rarely seems to stick;
maybe people need their advice wrapped in academic paper. But a friend sent
me a simple card once: 'Listen first, think next and act after.' To that I
would add - look around you at other businesses as you listen to people in
yours. A continuous benchmark process, maybe?
Reading: Changing the Role of Top Management: Beyond Strategy to Purpose by
Christopher A Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal (Harvard Business Review,
November-December 1994).
Why? Because it reinforced many conversations with friends in BP about our
own path to performance. If vision seems like a little luxury - try purpose.
Once you have it, how to make it happen? Try process. Who? You and yours -
try people.
Professor Gary Hamel, professor of strategic and international management,
London Business School.
Big idea: 1995 should be the year of the 'numerator'. In the quest for
higher productivity, companies must focus relatively more on growing revenue
(the numerator in most financial ratios) and less on cutting headcount and
investment (the denominators). Today employees are often told, if you don't
get more efficient you'll lose your job. Yet workers know that if they
become more efficient, they'll still lose their jobs unless there is
top-line growth. Sitting atop the highest unemployment rates in the
developed world, growth must become the overwhelming obsession of Europe's
senior executives. And don't whine about short-term investors or a lack of
risk capital. Swatch, Nokia, Virgin Atlantic and International Service
Systems have all proven that it is imagination, far more than capital, that
powers growth.
Reading: Great companies fail when there is no way of mounting a successful
assault on the out-of-date beliefs, assumptions and prejudices of top
management. Perversely, the responsibility for crafting strategy typically
rests with the corporate 'politburo', whose intellectual equity is invested
more in the past than in the future. If it is to be of any use,
strategy-making must be a subversive activity. Hence my enthusiasm for The
First Dissident by William Safire (Random House), a contemporary study on
the Book of Job. If Job could challenge God's fairness, and live to tell the
tale, how much more hope for those seeking to challenge the far less awesome
interests that defend corporate orthodoxy.
Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of business administration, Harvard Business
School.
Big idea: The best 'big' idea is to look for lots of small ideas, some of
which will prove to be the breakthrough new idea that helps the business
leap in new directions. Put innovation back into the centre of the business;
in too many companies it has been displaced by internally-focused and
rigidly controlled quality and re-engineering programmes. Stimulate
creativity at all levels. Hold regular brainstorming sessions about new ways
to do things. Let a thousand small flowers of experimentation bloom.
Reading: A toss-up between Truman by David McCullough and No Ordinary Time
by Doris Kearns Goodwin about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.
These penetrating works of political biography show national leaders
successfully mastering mega-challenges of historical proportions. You see
them make tough decisions, invent imaginative new policies and programmes,
build support for operating in the public spotlight and lacking the singular
authority that most business CEOs have. The change problems in business
suddenly seem more manageable.
Joseph M Juran, a pioneer of total quality management and founder of the
Juran Institute.
Big idea: Set out to become the quality leader in your industry. Recall that
Japan, a country once notorious for its shoddy goods, became an economic
superpower, chiefly because it attained world quality leadership.
Reading: No answer.
Clive Williams, head of management consulting, Ernst &amp; Young (UK).
Big idea: Organisations are learning to live in a state of constant
transition. In these conditions traditional concepts of the managerial role
have ceased to exist. Instead of clinging to outdated practices managers
should concentrate on developing new business styles and shifting the
organisation's centre of gravity from a fixed line-based structure towards a
flexible, prospect-based organisation. In 1995 the challenge is to become a
genuine enabler of people and to focus on four imperatives - speed,
adaptability, responsiveness and innovation.
Reading: The Scottish Himalayan Expedition by WH Murray (excerpt from a
training manual).
Why? Because it ties in with the challenge in the fusion concept just
described. But most of all because I like it.
Hugh Dickinson, managing partner, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton International (UK).
Big idea: The one 'big' idea must be the rebirth of leadership - more
specifically, in establishing the vision for the business, in focusing the
organisation on the one or two central ideas that will shape vision into
reality, and in being ready to take the tough people and resource deployment
decisions that go with the territory. And leadership in recognising,
resolving and accepting the give-ups and trade-offs that will inevitably be
required.
Reading: Competing for the Future by Gary Hamel and CK Pralahad - in
particular, its last 20-page chapter, 'Thinking differently about the
organisation'.
Why so? Because of the book's eloquence in capturing the need to raise
growth once more to the top of the corporate agenda. And, in its final
pages, in its articulation of the significance of the complex interplays and
feedback loops between corporate strategy, business vitality and
organisational choice.
Mohamed Al Fayed, chairman, Harrods.
Big idea: Invest in success. If you are fortunate to have a brand that is
already admired and enjoyed, support it to the hilt and watch it take your
company forward. In the 10 years since acquiring Harrods, we have invested
Pounds 200m in refurbishment, in opening new departments and in improving
our standards of service. Even great national institutions need generous
capital investments if they are to be worthy of their customers' support
into the next century. As a 'big' idea this may not be new but as an
Egyptian sage I once knew put it: 'New is easy, good is hard.'
Reading: Harrods sells huge numbers or business books but I must confess I
don't read them. By the time a man can afford Pounds 24.95 for a hardback by
a former big name, usually looking back, he should be sufficiently sure of
himself in business not to need that sort of advice. It is better to buy
that classic work of fiction you always meant to read but never got around
to or a couple of CDs by a composer you don't know. Let your overworked
brain do the thing you never allow it to do: to idle. You will be surprised
by how many good ideas you come up with when you are not thinking.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Management: Healthy resolutions - Health Check / Tangible
benefits of giving up what one enjoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a doctor to suggest New Year's resolutions and the answer is
depressingly predictable. Giving up what one enjoys and taking up what one
does not is hard until there are tangible benefits. So just how soon can one
expect returns from giving up smoking, taking up exercise and eating more
healthily?
In the case of smoking, it depends on the end-point you choose. At
post-mortem, no ex-smoker's lungs ever match the healthy pink hue of the
life-long non-smoker's. But lung function usually improves within weeks or
months of stopping, while shortness of breath and coughs gradually recede.
The risk of lung cancer falls gradually once the habit is ditched. However,
new research from Hope Hospital, Salford, shows that the risk of lung cancer
in ex-smokers, even if they gave up years ago, remains higher than in those
who never smoked.
On the other hand, some benefits are seen quickly. Personal freshness
improves almost immediately, while giving up smoking in early pregnancy
reduces the risk of miscarriage, growth retardation and stillbirth.
Taking up exercise is demoralising if stiff muscles result, but there are
many later benefits in cardiovascular fitness, mobility, muscle strength and
even mood. Exercise may also help prevent cancer of the prostate, breast, or
bowel, though data are inconclusive.
Exercise has a well-documented effect on blood cholesterol, increasing the
good fraction known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and therefore reducing
the risk of coronary heart disease.
How much exercise? The usual advice is to take 20 minutes of brisk exercise
three times a week, checking first with your doctor if unused to activity or
worried about fitness.
Recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine and others
suggest that less vigorous exercise five times a week is enough. A brisk
daily walk of 2km may do the trick.
Exercise usually takes weeks of commitment to make a difference, but
improvements continue for months or years. Studies even show that, in some
people, coronary artery changes are reversed after a year's regular exercise
(but see your doctor first).
November saw the publication of the Coma (Committee on Medical Aspects of
Food Policy) report on cardiovascular disease. Its recommendations for
healthy eating include eating more fibre and starchy carbohydrate - as a
nation we still take too much fat and sugar. It also recommends eating oily
fish twice a week, replacing the breakfast fry-up with cereal and/or toast,
and eating more fruit and vegetables.
Fortunately, no single food is wholly good or bad. Variety and moderation
are important.
Although they did not feature in the Coma report, anti-oxidants are worth
knowing about. They include vitamins C and E, folic acid and beta-carotene
(the precursor of vitamin A), and combat free radicals, which probably cause
cell mutations, and the changes of ageing. Collectively, anti-oxidants are
found in green leafy vegetables, carrots, whole grains and fruits, and there
is some evidence that a diet rich in anti-oxidants does help prevent cancer
and heart disease.
How quickly does a healthy diet work? In most people, changes in fat intake
result in measurable effects from three weeks. The consequences of taking
more anti-oxidants are less clear. Crash diets should not be part of the
plan. Rapid weight loss does not usually stay off, and those whose weight
fluctuates seem to be at greater risk of heart disease than those with
stable weights.
A final recommendation for 1995 is based on evidence that people who enjoy
life are healthier and may even have better immunity to infection. So above
all have a Happy New Year.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Upturn brings record fall in business failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures fell sharply this year as economic recovery gathered
strength and lifted the fortunes of small as well as large businesses, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, the business information group, reported today.
Its latest annual tally of business liquidations and bankruptcies showed a
record 16.3 per cent drop in failures in England and Wales to 40,255 this
year from 48,066 in 1993.
The drop for mainland Britain, including Scotland, was more pronounced at
21.8 per cent to 43,598 in 1994 from 55,733 last year.
This reflected a sharp 56.4 per cent decline in Scottish business failures
over the year to 3,343 from 7,667 in 1993, following changes in Scottish
bankruptcy regulations which reduced the financial incentive for companies
to be placed in bankruptcy.
The news was hailed by Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, who said this
largest recorded drop in the failure rate of businesses would boost
confidence in job security and job opportunities.
He said that an increasing number of small businesses, which account for
most of the growth in employment, could look forward to a more prosperous
new year.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's senior analyst, said the last time the
number of business failures in Britain fell as sharply as this year was in
1987, before the recession.
However, at that time the number of companies going out of business was far
smaller, at less than 20,000 in England and Wales.
Mr Mellor said that 'perhaps the most encouraging part' of this year's
figures was that they showed small businesses were now participating in the
recovery.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet takes the view that the bankruptcy figures are a good proxy
for small-company failures, while medium and large companies go into
liquidation.
After stripping out the exceptional Scottish figures, the statistics for
England and Wales showed a 15 per cent drop in bankruptcies to 24,505 this
year from 28,846 in 1993.
This was only slightly below the 18 per cent fall in liquidations to 15,750
this year from 19,220 last year.
Earlier in the recovery, the drop in the failure rate of medium to large
businesses was much bigger than the drop for small businesses.
In Scotland, the number of bankruptcies dropped to 2,758 this year from
7,215 while liquidations increased to 585 from 452.
Mr Mellor said the relative strength of the small-company sector was
highlighted in a sharp 28 per cent fall for both bankruptcies and
liquidations in the west Midlands, where the export-led recovery was
benefiting both large companies and their suppliers.
Elsewhere, company failures fell sharply - by between 17 per cent and 18 per
cent in the north-west, north-east and south-east, excluding London, where
the fall was 14.7 per cent.
Liquidations were concentrated in London - with just over 29 per cent of the
British total in 1994 and 1993 - and south-east England, with slightly more
than 22 per cent in both years. Bankruptcies were concentrated in south-east
and south-west England, and Scotland.
