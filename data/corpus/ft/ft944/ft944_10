Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher and chairman of the CBI's
distributive trades panel, is to switch retailing horses. After nearly seven
years on the CBI panel, he is now to take up the position of chairman of the
British Retail Consortium.
His replacement at the CBI is Alastair Eperon, director of corporate affairs
at Boots, and a previous chief executive of McAvoy Bayley, the public
relations firm.
Whittaker's new job as non-executive chairman is largely an honorary one.
However, it may have help to improve the BRC's links with the CBI's panel.
James May, the director general of the BRC, has admitted in public that he
remains distinctly unconvinced by the accuracy of the CBI distributive trade
survey. Whittaker, however, is - naturally enough - a great fan of the
survey he has presided over for the past seven years.

The Confederation of British Industry's determination to take tourism
seriously received a further boost this week when four new members joined
its tourism action group. This brings the membership of the group, which
aims to boost tourism's standing in the UK, to 22.
The most prominent of the four new members is Denis Tunnicliffe, managing
director of London Underground, which frequently receives better reviews
from foreign visitors than it does from the capital's regular users.
The other members are Rowland Hardwick, managing director of English Country
Cottages, whose ravishing brochures boast some of the best UK self-catering
accommodation; Neil Chalmers, director of the Natural History Museum; and
Henry Head, md of Norfolk Lavender, which grows lavender and whose farms are
a tourist attraction in their own right.
The action group is chaired by Sir John Egan, chief executive of airports

FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: British science sells well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International investment in UK science amounts to an 'invisible export'
worth about Pounds 1.4bn a year, the House of Lords science committee says
today.
In 1992-93, the last year for which figures are available, overseas
companies paid Pounds 1.1bn for industrial research and development in the
UK. In addition, universities received Pounds 135m in research grants and
contracts and Pounds 130m in fee income from science students.
The Lords found that overseas funding of British science rose sharply during
the 1980s and reached a peak of Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91.
The decline over the following two years was partly due to 'increased
competition from other countries, particularly Pacific Rim countries which
are rapidly building up their R&amp;D facilities', says Lord Walton of Detchant,
committee chairman.
International investment does not normally feature in science policy
discussions, and the Lords found it difficult to gather reliable evidence
for their inquiry. In particular, they failed to come up with a
corresponding figure for UK spending on science abroad, though, Lord Walton
says, 'our feeling is that investment coming in from overseas is greater
than the amount going out'.
The Lords found the issue to be controversial. 'There are those who say that
by locating R&amp;D facilities in the UK, making research contracts with British
universities, and placing sponsored professors and research students in
leading departments, foreign countries and companies are engaged in
'overseas exploitation of UK brains'.'
The report rejects that argument and concludes that foreign investment in UK
science should be encouraged, with more programmes to encourage scientific
links with Asian countries in particular. 'The future of British science
lies in free trade, not protectionism,' it says.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: Whispers from the runway - A transport system
that will be propelled by magnetic attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 10 years a 90-tonne machine has been tearing around an elevated
concrete track in north-west Germany, reaching speeds of up to 450kph but
making none of the noise made by aircraft travelling at that speed. It is
the Transrapid high-speed train, also known as the whispering arrow.
Now, after years of debate, the German government has approved plans to
build a 284km track between Berlin and Hamburg, Germany's two biggest
cities, in a move that is expected to take passengers away from those
airlines flying the route.
The Transrapid will be the world's first long-distance transport system
propelled by magnetic levitation, a technology that Thyssen, the German
conglomerate, has been developing. Instead of conventional engines, the
Transrapid is propelled by magnetic fields. It has no wheels and rather than
run on conventional railway tracks it clutches a concrete runway rather like
the runner on a curtain rail.
The technology dates from the 1920s when Hermann Kemper, an electronic
engineer who ran a meat packing business near the present 32km test site in
Emsland, began poring over papers about the theory of magnetic levitation.
Kemper developed a model in his cellar where objects were fired along
runways by passing mains electricity through electromagnets mounted on the
objects and on the runway.
In 1934 he registered his patents and tried unsuccessfully to persuade
Siemens, the electronics company, to take up his ideas.
What was missing, according to Hans Georg Raschbichler, an engineer from
Thyssen Henschel, the locomotive builder, was the means to produce and
transport large amounts of electricity at split-second intervals. 'They
didn't have the sort of high-tech electronics which exist today,' he says in
his office in Munich.
Now that large amounts of electricity can be passed around a grid and
engineers can regulate the 10mm gap between the runway and the vehicle, two
key bits of technology are available which mean that Kemper's model can
become a real ity.
The Transrapid operates on different principles from the maglev technology
used elsewhere in the world. Conventional magnetic levitation works by using
the repellant force of superconductive magnets of opposite polarities. In
the Transrapid, propulsion comes from the force of magnetic attraction.
By passing electrical current through a stator pack, the stationary part of
an electric motor which is laid out on the underside of a concrete runway, a
wandering magnetic field is created. This magnetic field - called wandering
because it moves down the runway - is attracted or excited by levitation
magnets mounted on the underside of the Transrapid, so propelling the
vehicle forward.
The Transrapid picks up speed proportional to the increase in electrical
current; the opposite happens when the frequency is reduced. If there is a
power failure, batteries on board the Transrapid are used to power the eddy
current braking system and to guide the vehicle to an emergency stop on the
runway.
The vehicle glides about 10mm above the concrete runway, a gap which is
measured by a computerised sensor: if it becomes smaller, the computer
orders more electricity, less if it becomes bigger. The process is repeated
thousands of times, keeping the gap constant and enabling the magnet to pull
the Transrapid.
Raschbichler heads a team of engineers at Thyssen Henschel which ran the
Transrapid 07, the seventh prototype, up to a maximum speed of 450kph last
year. They are now putting it through 500,000km of tests before it can be
licensed to operate.
Tests have shown that the vehicle uses less energy and is quieter than the
French TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) or the German InterCity Express (ICE),
the two high-speed trains which are its main competitors. Stand 25m away
from a Transrapid passing at 300kph, and the maximum noise level recorded is
87 decibels - less than a freight train travelling at 100kmh. Tests by
independent engineers recorded about 100 decibels for a TGV travelling at
the same speed.
Because the Transrapid glides above a concrete runway it does not need to
overcome the resistance between track and wheels which traditional railway
technology still has to grapple with. That means, according to Thyssen
Henschel, that the Transrapid uses around 30 per cent less energy than a
high-speed train travelling at the same speed.
The government hopes that by 2004 a runway - similar to the present test
track - will be built and that more than 14m passengers a year will be
hurtling between Germany's two biggest cities. A journey that now takes more
than three hours by train will take just 55 minutes by Transrapid.
The DM5.6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) needed to finance the runway and infrastructure
will be put up by the federal government, and Thyssen has created a company
together with Lufthansa, the national airline, and Deutsche Bahn, the state
railway, which have to find DM4.8bn to operate the service.
The Japanese are working on similar technology but opted in the early 1970s
for an electrodynamic levitation system - where magnets repel rather than
attract each other. The different system also creates a 10cm gap, rather
than 10mm, between the vehicle and the runway which the Japanese say is
better suited to deal with earthquake risks.
The Transrapid technology creates magnetic fields of about 40 amps - no
bigger than those created by an electric razor - while the Japanese have to
grapple with big magnetic fields of up to 700,000 amps. About four times as
much electricity is needed to control the movement of the Japanese train
across such big magnetic fields and Thyssen says they are so powerful it is
thought people wearing pacemakers will not be able to use the trains.

FT  15 DEC 94 / People: Coutts calls Post to account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many US investment bankers are more anglicised than Lehman Brothers'
Herschel Post (right). An Oxford Rhodes scholar and deputy chairman of the
London Stock Exchange, Post has been given the ultimate establishment job -
chief operating officer of Coutts, the frock-coated bankers to Britain's
royal family.
Not that Post, currently chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers in
London, will be donning a frock-coat himself. He is joining a new management
team being put in place by Coutts' parent, National Westminster Bank, and
frock-coats are no longer de rigeur. After years of leaving Coutts to its
own devices, NatWest is intent on turning it into a truly global private
bank.
Post, 55, who joined Lehman Brothers after spells with JP Morgan and
Euroclear, will be the effective number two to NatWest's David Went, 47, who
was installed as chief executive of the Coutts Group in June. Traditionally,
Coutts &amp; Co, which accounts for roughly half the group, and Coutts' overseas
businesses have been run independently.
However, NatWest has set up a new management team to pull the two parts of
the business together. Post will be 'responsible for all issues relating to
Coutts' global operations' and will oversee the investment management side.
Coutts has also recruited Lorraine Trainer, 42, the former director of human
resources at the London Stock Exchange, to be director of human resources
and organisational development, and Richard Wise, 37, joins from Mercury
Asset Management to be Coutts' chief financial officer.
The new appointments just about complete the clear-out of Coutts' old top
management team which began three years ago when Ian Farnsworth, a NatWest
general manager, took over from Julian Robards as managing director; though
it is understood that Coutts is still looking for a new marketing director.
Virtually all the top positions at Coutts are now held by either NatWest
personnel or outsiders drafted in.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Accountancy: 'Cookbook' may be put on the back burner - The
debate about the future role of auditors in the wake of the 'expectation
gap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks like 1995 is going to be the year of the auditor - and about time
too. The role of auditors, the scope of their duties and responsibilities,
are issues too long left to the almost glacial pace of change in the
accountancy profession.
Auditors and audits captured the headlines during the corporate scandals of
the late 1980s and early 1990s. The public expected them to spot fraud and
were disappointed when they failed. The so-called 'expectation gap' began to
widen.
The auditors were slow to take up a public defence of their part in these
cases. By default they let the public think that they were the only
culprits. They failed to educate society about the constraints they faced in
unearthing fraud and fraudsters.
In recent days, several developments in the field of auditing point to a new
vitality in the debate. A common thread appears to run through all of them:
the auditor is being encouraged to move away from the 'cookbook' approach,
based on extensive rules and programmed procedures, towards a reliance on
individual judgment.
Last week the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
announced the foundation of a new Auditing Faculty - to be run alongside its
existing faculties in tax, information technology, and finance and
management. Its first chairman will be Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG
Peat Marwick.
Mr Acher marked his arrival on the scene by announcing a conference in the
new year on The Future of Accounting: Principles or Rules? Mr Acher made it
clear that while the conference might debate the matter, as far as he was
concerned the profession was over-burdened with rules and regulations and
this was its 'last chance' to avoid being swamped by the 'cookbook'
approach.
He accepted that the profession had retreated behind the rules, using them
as a defence, following the bruising failures of the past. Litigation, and
the threat of it, had made auditors wary of using their judgment. Reliance
on the rules had led to further failure as dishonest directors used
loopholes in them to defraud shareholders.
Mr Acher acknowledges that one of the reasons the regulations are so long
and appear so tortuous is that auditors often pester the Accounting
Standards Board to make them specific. Many auditors feel safer with
detailed rules rather than vague principles.
There is little doubt that many auditors find the weight of accounting
standards oppressive. A senior partner in one of the Big Six firms has a
pile of current publications on the corner of his desk merely as a visual
reminder of the body of work involved.
There were distinct echoes of Mr Acher's argument in the publication of
draft proposals by the Auditing Practices Board on the audit of related
party transactions. The Accounting Standards Board is preparing to toughen
up on the requirements on directors to disclose links between various
related parties - for example between the immediate family of directors and
a related pension fund.
David Lindsell, the chairman of the working group which produced the draft
proposal, thinks that if auditors had to trail through all the possible
related party transactions in a large company, the resulting audit fee
increase would be huge. He saw no point in a 'make work' system based on
ticking boxes.
The result was a recommendation that audit procedures in this area should be
based on risk assessment. 'The APB is proposing a risk based audit approach
in preference to a procedural one.' No cookbook here, and no rules to hide
behind. The statement from the APB continued: 'This requires auditors to use
their judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures rather than
prescribing a list of mandatory procedures.'
The movement towards judgment found a further echo in the publication last
week of The Audit Agenda, the APB's comprehensive proposals for the future
of the auditing. Prof Ian Percy, the chairman of the working party which
produced it, talks enthusiastically about the 'psychology of auditing' and
the need to train auditors in the behavioural sciences.
While the report rejects extending the responsibilities of auditors in
detecting fraud, it calls for 'greater realism both within and outside the
profession about the possibilities of finding fraud, whether material or
not'.
The report called for regular seminars on fraud and for training for
auditors in detection and the 'behavioural aspects of individuals under
pressure'.
Beyond the annual audit, the report also called on boards to consider
periodic 'forensic audits'. These would be undertaken by special teams
trained to find fraud and complimented in some cases by ex-police officers.
The forensic audit would be to the annual audit what de-bugging the
boardroom is to corporate security.
Prof Percy wants a more open debate on fraud in the profession. He is tired
of the argument that talking about fraud only gives fraudsters fresh impetus
to offend. He wants an auditing profession alive to developments in fraud
and willing to use this skill and judgment in spotting fraud and - more
often - spotting areas of potential fraud.
The publication this week of Fraud Watch, by Ian Huntington and David Davies
at KPMG Peat Marwick, is therefore a happy coincidence. The authors start
their work with a quote: 'Fraud and deceit abound in these days more than in
former times.' That was the view of Sir Edward Coke, lawyer and politician,
writing in 1602.
Luckily the rest of the book is much more up to date. It records scores of
detailed examples of real frauds and then lists the warning signs which go
with each one. As an aid to Prof Percy's enquiring auditor it would be
difficult to think of a better text book.
On example should suffice. A chief executive of a bank approved a loan to a
company for the development of a golf course and country club. He entered
into a secret joint venture agreement to be paid 30 per cent of the profit
from this project. The profit was paid into a private company in which he
was a shareholder. All the files on the joint venture were kept in the chief
executive's office.
Warning signs in this case could have included:-
'Thin' loan files.
Sketchy information, but management claim 'creditworthiness of the borrower
is undoubted'.
Borrowers with common or like-sounding names.
Photocopied documentation and missing detail.
Funds paid before necessary formalities completed.
Significant numbers of borrowers introduced by the same source.
File handled exclusively by senior official.
Inconsistent jottings on file.
Repayments made by persons other than the borrower.
Of course, there is one big drawback to the auditing profession talking so
much about fraud. The 'expectation gap' which has spurred it into action may
well widen if auditors continue to 'fail' to catch fraudsters. Many auditors
are sceptical about ever seriously restricting fraud.
Not so Ian Huntington, one of the authors of Fraud Watch. He once uncovered
a fraud by noticing that a series of depositors at a bank all used the same
coloured masthead on their stationery. In fact the bank was laundering its
own money and the depositors were fictitious.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Clout of a
specialist - The advantages of centralised media buying in a fragmented US
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shake-up in the way television and press advertising is bought and sold
across the US is likely following last week's announcement that Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi's UK media-buying company Zenith is crossing the Atlantic.
From January, Zenith will be trying to persuade US advertisers to act more
like Europeans - consolidating their vast advertising budgets and placing
responsibility for the purchasing of airtime and press space with media
specialists, away from the 'creative' side of the advertising business.
Zenith, already well established across Europe, will instantly become the
US's single biggest media buyer, with billings of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn). This will be achieved by bringing together the media-buying
functions of the Saatchi group's three US advertising networks - Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising, Bates USA and Campbell Mithun Esty.
Further ahead, Zenith's intention is to attract third-party custom from
outside the three networks, as it has done, for example, in the UK - where
more than half its business comes from non-Saatchi group advertising agency
clients.
Until now the US market has largely operated along traditional
'full-service' agency lines.
This has been partly because of the fragmentary nature of the US media - it
is easier to function as a specialist buyer when there is a single national
market, dominated by a handful of media owners, as is the case in most
European countries.
But John Perriss, Zenith chairman, argues that it is the complexity of the
US scene which justifies the media specialist's existence. The primary
advantage to advertisers of centralised buying with one specialist agency is
the price reduction obtained by making bulk purchases from media owners.
Perriss argues that his business is about more than just crude pricing. 'It
is about the complex new media environment. The average home in the US now
has 38 TV channels.'
Zenith's function will be to advise advertisers on the optimum mix of
channels to deliver the required audience at the lowest cost, and to guide
them on new media opportunities, as well as providing clout in price
negotiations with network owners, says Perriss.
Zenith is emphasising its investment in state-of-the-art information
technology: all 250 employees in its eight offices will be linked by PCs
capable of working in multimedia formats, so that advertisements and
programme clips can be viewed while negotiations with media owners are
taking place.
The Saatchi group has not been the only organisation to invest in specialist
media buying in the US. Last month, for example, the US advertising group
Interpublic announced it was buying Western International Media, the
country's largest independent buyer, although it said it had no plans to
combine the media operations of its constituent agencies, which include
McCann-Erickson, Lintas and Lowe. Other individual agencies have been
establishing arm's-length media outfits.
Clients have also started 'unbundling' media buying from the creative side
of their advertising purchasing, for which two or three agencies could be
used. Indeed, it is movement from clients which has finally persuaded the
Saatchi group to press ahead with Zenith's entry into the US: Procter &amp;
Gamble took its network TV buying away from the US Saatchi agency, while
Bates lost TV buying for Mars - in both cases the work went to agency DMB&amp;B.
The move to specialist media buying in the US will undoubtedly be good for
clients, says Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs. But he
wonders whether it will turn out to be the 'start of a slippery slope' for
the advertising agencies and their investors. The moment that 'unbundling'
begins, agency remuneration comes under intense scrutiny and margins are
eroded.
If an advertiser is paying the traditional 15 per cent commission to an
agency, and can suddenly get media buying for 3-4 per cent as the market
becomes more competitive, that leaves the 'creative' side of the job costing
11 per cent. Blackley says the advertiser may decide that looks too steep,
and commission may be cut to say 8 per cent.
This erosion of margins and cannibalisation of existing business has been
the pattern in Europe.
The real advantage to Zenith will come when it starts to pull in third-party
business and win new clients among those advertisers who are in the process
of media consolidation. Blackley says: 'The first person into the market -
as we've seen with Murdoch and his price cutting on newspapers in the UK -
takes the major benefit. If they can demonstrate they're getting a real
advantage for their clients, then they're going to start winning more than
their fair share of consolidation business and their third-party billings
will go up. It's bound to create a response from other agencies.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cashing in the
Kwanzaa way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed of December shopper is hitting shops in the US, searching for
gifts and cards for Kwanzaa, as opposed to Christmas or Hanukkah.
The popularity of Kwanzaa, created in 1966 by pan-African studies professor
Ron Karenga as a black American alternative to Christmas, has snowballed in
recent years. Kwanzaa, which means 'harvest' in Swahili, is a seven-day
celebration that includes fasting, family dinners, candle-lighting
ceremonies and group discussion on topics such as unity and co-operative
economics. About 5m Americans now celebrate the holiday, which begins on
December 26. Retailers have started to cater specifically to Kwanzaa
shoppers.
Book stores do a brisk business in Kwanzaa publications. Because the holiday
is relatively new, many participants are still unsure of the traditions, so
books explaining Kwanzaa customs are popular.
Kwanzaa cards are also in demand. The greeting card maker Hallmark, for
instance, retails 16 versions of cards for the holiday. 'It's a growing
market, especially in urban centres,' says Rashena Lindsay, marketing
co-ordinator for the group. 'We may offer a new line of Kwanzaa gift bags
and wrapping paper next year.'
A number of stores sell Kwanzaa decorations and ceremonial items, such as
seven-place candelabras - participants light one candle each day. Flower
shops, which once carried decorative corn husks and gourds only for the
American Thanksgiving Day holiday, now offer them in December.
But Kwanzaa gifts are tricky to pitch. The holiday is supposed to reject the
commercialism of Christmas, and Kwanzaa presents were meant to be simple,
homespun items such as candles. However, stores say that an increasing
number of shoppers are looking for Kwanzaa presents. The chain store
Learningsmith, for instance, says its African stone game is a best-seller
during the holidays. 'We get quite a few people looking for Kwanzaa
presents,' says Ellie Hendrie, who runs the Vilunya Folk Art store in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. 'They buy things like baskets, jewellery,
blankets, anything that comes from Africa.'
The success of Kwanzaa is an enigma to some, who thought a holiday promoting
group discussions on abstract subjects would not become popular. But many
black Americans are looking to African themes to cultivate a sense of pride
in their heritage.
And Kwanzaa has become more flexible with the years. Some Americans have
started to bend the strict gift-giving rules.
The result may not be the anti-commercial alternative to Christmas that the
holiday's founders had in mind, but for the retail market it is a lucrative
bonus.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Publishing to a
prescription - A new chapter in brand loyalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early next year, Boots The Chemist will become Boots the publisher when the
Nottingham-based cold-cream to corn plaster giant dips into the glamorous
world of women's magazine publishing.
The Boots Magazine, which begins life as a quarterly, will 'aim to apply
Boots brand values to a publication, rather than to a product,' says Michael
Potter, managing director of Redwood Publishing, drafted in by Boots to
handle the new venture.
While Boots has no direct publishing experience, it already has a potential
readership in the 27m customers who use the store each month - the core of
them women aged between 25 and 40.
According to the company's own research, a large proportion are looking for
advice and information on anything from glossier hair to staving off heart
disease.
While the new title will inevitably contain information on and advertising
for Boots products, it is not intended simply to be a marketing platform for
the company, but a readable glossy magazine - 'a genuine health and beauty
title', says the company.
The magazine will not only carry advertising for rivals, among them
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals companies, but it will also have a cover price
of 95p.
Although distribution of the 250,000 print run will initially be restricted
to 500 of the chain's bigger branches, the intention is that it could one
day earn a place on newsstands.
A decade ago, so-called customer magazines were thinly disguised company
puffsheets, about as welcome to credit card or bank customers as the bills
they invariably accompanied.
But today, as everyone from supermarkets to car makers seek to build
customer loyalty by adding publishing to their portfolios, the quality of
the magazines continues to improve.
Last month, J. Sainsbury's monthly title, The Magazine, with a cover price
of 95p for more than 200 pages of good eating and aspirational lifestyles,
earned the Magazine of the Year award from Media Week magazine, against
stiff competition from more traditional publishers.
This glossy title, whose previous contributors have included Michael Palin
and Beryl Bainbridge, has in 18 months achieved a 325,000 circulation,
making it the UK's seventh-biggest selling consumer magazine.
While distribution thus far remains limited to Sainsbury's own retail
outlets, few industry observers would dismiss it as just another company
magazine.
'One of our aims in launching our magazine 18 months ago was to enhance the
company's image with its customers, and this has certainly been achieved,'
says the company.
According to the Association of Publishing Agencies, which represents
contract publishers such as Redwood (which has contracts with the AA, Marks
&amp; Spencer and American Express), there are now at least 110 customer
magazines in Britain, ranging from airlines and department stores to
computer firms and building societies. They are primarily communications
vehicles.
Barclaycard, for instance, will launch its first customer magazine at the
end of January. The title, yet to be named, will be sent free to all card
customers, making it one of Britain's largest customer magazines with a
circulation of 3m.
The magazine will inevitably be an advertising platform for the card giant,
as well as for third-party advertisers keen to establish a presence with
Barclaycard's affluent audience.
The real value of such a customer magazine, says Neil O'Brien, whose
company, The Publishing Team, also produces Open Door (the Alliance and
Leicester magazine), is as a loyalty builder.
'The magazine won't make a fat profit for Barclaycard, and all the costs
will come out of the marketing budget,' he says.
'But if it generates loyalty to Barclaycard, and acts as a genuine
communications forum between the company and its customers, then it will be
a wise investment.'

CAF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charities Aid Foundation, which works to increase the resources
available to charities, is to lease a new 35,000sq ft building at the Kings
Hill business park, close to the M20, in Kent.
The CAF's new headquarters (pictured here in model form) has been designed
by the architect Nicholas Hare. Kings Hill developers Rouse Kent say it will
incorporate the controlled use of daylight and natural ventilation, avoiding
the use of air-conditioning.
The Pounds 5.25m project is being funded by Liberty Property Trust, the
American parent of Rouse Kent. Work started this month on the building,
which is expected to be ready for occupation by the autumn.
Initially, 170 staff from the CAF's offices in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells
will move to Kings Hill, and occupy two-thirds of the building. The extra
space will allow the CAF to expand, and will be sub-let until needed.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (10): Irish
precedent casts a shadow - Many charity leaders fear the effects of the
National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Lottery was launched last month amid criticism that charities
are unlikely to receive any allocation of the proceeds until late next year.
Leaders of many charities, however, remain more worried about the lottery's
possible effect on the voluntary sector's overall long-term finances than
delays in the distribution of funds.
Charities will gain an estimated Pounds 100m share of the first year's
lottery proceeds. Mr David Sieff, chairman of the National Lottery Charities
Board, has pointed out that a distribution of this size would make the board
bigger than any existing UK grant-making foundation. Yet the voluntary
sector is not rejoicing.
There are fears that many people will come to regard lottery tickets as
their standard form of charitable support, and will be less inclined to
respond to other fundraising appeals - even though charities will receive
only a small share of total lottery revenue. To compensate for this, many
voluntary-sector leaders believe charities should get a greater proportion
of the overall lottery distribution.
Such feelings were intensified by the reduction in pools betting duty in
last month's Budget. This will produce a gain for sport and the arts  -
which will both share in the lottery - of an estimated Pounds 100m a year.
But there was no response in the Budget to the voluntary sector's lobbying
for improved tax reliefs to encourage charitable giving, or help with the
annual Pounds 330m bill for unrecoverable VAT paid by charities.
The Irish voluntary sector had similar concerns to those being expressed in
the UK when a state lottery was introduced in 1987. Research on the
lottery's impact during its seven years of operation in the republic remains
open to varying interpretations.
An assessment commissioned by the Irish national lottery organisers in 1992
concluded that, while the lottery's absence would increase the potential
fundraising base for voluntary organisations, it was not clear that their
actual income would go up once the loss of lottery disbursements was taken
into account. However, a survey of a sample of Irish charities last year
found that 87 per cent of those that had been affected by the lottery
regarded its impact as negative.
Whatever effect the UK's lottery subsequently has on charities' own
fundraising efforts, there will be no shortage of applications for a share
of the proceeds.
The National Lottery Charities Board will handle funding requests from both
registered charities and other organisations set up for charitable,
benevolent and philanthropic causes. This means that about 700,000
organisations, from national charities to small local groups, could all
apply for funds. The board is working on estimates of 150,000-250,000
applications a year.
Separate committees of the board will be set up for England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, with allocation of funds based on population weighted
to take account of levels of deprivation. Consultations are under way to
establish local advisory panels, which will respond to variations between
the English regions, and devise methods of funding UK-wide organisations.
*****
The National Lottery revenue is divided roughly as follows: prize money (50
per cent), beneficiaries (28), tax (12), retailers' commission (5),
operating costs and profit (5). Groups of beneficiaries designated by the
government to receive equal shares of funds are: the arts councils and
sports councils of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
National Lottery Charities Board, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and
the Millenium Fund.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (8): Aiming for a
sectoral 'CBI' - Profile, Stuart Etherington, the new director of the NCVO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Influential figures in the voluntary sector feel that it has been badly left
behind in the current public and political debate over the future of welfare
services.
That may be about to change. Mr Stuart Etherington became director of the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the sector's umbrella body,
last month with a mandate to clarify its role and raise its profile.
Although Mr Etherington comes from a charity background, his appointment to
one of the sector's top posts represents a break with tradition - the NCVO
employed head-hunters and considered candidates with a wide variety of
experience before selecting him. This reflected a recognition by its council
of the need for clear leadership during the watershed that charities are
facing.
'It is not good enough for the voluntary sector to have its position formed
by other people's agendas, whether of the left or the right,' says Mr
Etherington. 'The sector must speak for itself.'
He has a vision of turning the NCVO - which, in spite of a long and
successful tradition of research and innovation, carries minimal political
influence - into a voluntary sector CBI.
Doubters say that, since not all the NCVO's member charities share common
interests, it would be difficult for a central organisation to speak with a
strong, clear voice on sensitive issues. But neither do all CBI affiliates
share common interests; and there is, the new director points out, a greater
spirit of co-operation in the voluntary sector, even among 'competitor'
charities, than in industry.
Mr Etherington, a qualified social worker recruited from the Royal National
Institute for Deaf People (RNID), where he had been chief executive for
three years, is part of a new managerial tradition that is gradually
developing in the voluntary sector. A London Business School MBA, he is
proud of the businesslike innovations - like running customer and staff
satisfaction surveys - that he introduced at the RNID.
The charity flourished under his leadership, with staff doubling to 850 in
three years. Growth was fuelled by the fact that the RNID has made a clear
choice in favour of delivering services under contract to public bodies -
probably the most sensitive single issue to face the voluntary sector in
recent years.
Etherington acknowledges that the question of whether charities should put
their energies into providing contract services to health and local
authorities, and if so on what terms, raises difficult questions.
'Do you use charitable funds to subsidise market entry? At a time when there
is pressure on public finance, are contracts likely to be set at levels
which are adequate enough to enable charities to fully recover their
overheads? To what extent can charities continue to innovate with new forms
of services if they are bound by contracts? 'All these are issues to which
we must give attention. But the biggest potential downside is the danger
that charities will lose legacy income, from which many meet their core
costs, if benefactors believe they are simply agencies delivering public
services.'
Etherington had practical experience of this difficulty while at the RNID.
Some people told him 'this place is run just like a business' - and used
this as an argument for refusing to donate money rather than as a tribute to
the charity's efficiency.
If the government wants charities to take on public services, he says, it
must ensure that contract fees are sufficiently high to meet overhead costs.
'But at the moment it is going the other way - residential home fees, for
example, are being squeezed down.'
The NCVO is setting up a high-level commission on the future of the
voluntary sector, intended to stimulate new thinking about its role and
priorities. In the shorter term, Mr Etherington intends to convene a panel
of charity chief executives in the spring to thrash out a set of immediate
strategic priorities. 'There is not enough strategic thinking. It is
difficult because the voluntary sector is so fragmented, but we must try to
get better at establishing our priorities.'
His own include 'putting quality and all the things that relate to it high
on the agenda' - his efforts at the RNID to ensure that both its staff and
those who use its services shared common objectives is an illustration of
this.
'I detect a growing public anxiety about charity efficiency,' he says.
'Still tighter regulation would not be the answer - that would push smaller
charities over the edge - so the solution must be through self-regulation
and the setting of quality standards.
'But we must remember that the sector has real strengths. The private sector
is currently much occupied with issues like corporate governance, the social
responsibility of business and the management of knowledge workers - these
are all subjects where the voluntary sector has something to teach others.'
At last month's Charities Aid Foundation conference Mr Etherington, in his
first big speech as NCVO director, called for the voluntary sector - in
spite of its legendary diversity - to identify common ground.
'That common ground is surely our purpose, and that purpose has an almost
lyrical simplicity: we are driven by our stakeholders, not shareholders. We
are motivated not by party politics but by our beneficiaries. We are value
driven, not money driven.'
The language will have reassured voluntary sector traditionalists, who fear
that the arrival of Mr Etherington, with his business school ideas, could
lead to a further blurring of the edges between the public, private and
voluntary sectors. He now faces the task of convincing those traditionalists
that, while the voluntary sector may be value-driven rather than money
driven, there is no virtue in amateurism for its own sake. It is not a
business, but success still depends on efficiency, probity and high quality
services.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (5): Income from
legacies falls - In a competitive fundraising market, no one is secure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund, one of the most familiar household-name
charities, announced in September that it was cutting back on research and
jobs because of a fall in income.
It came as a powerful warning that, although big charities are tending to
fare better than smaller ones, in a highly competitive fundraising market no
one is secure.
The fund - one of the 10 biggest fundraising charities - will have to
operate in 1995-96 on a spending limit of about Pounds 54m, which is Pounds
6.5m less than it had planned. A decline in legacy income made a significant
contribution to the problem. The charity relies on legacies for 71 per cent
of its voluntary income, and income from this source has fallen by nearly
Pounds 2m this year.
Legacies have, as Sir Walter Bodmer, the fund's director general, pointed
out when announcing the cuts, become a more competitive area of charity fund
raising than in the past. They form an immensely important element of total
income for those charities that are good at attracting them. Fundratios, a
study of 20 leading charities completed last month by the Centre for
Interfirm Comparison, shows that legacies typically produce nearly 40 per
cent of big charities' voluntary income. This compares with only 3.7 per
cent raised from house to house collections.
The study also shows, however, that the value of typical legacies has been
in decline since 1992. So, according to the report, have corporate donations
and response rates to cold direct mailings - the latter down to its lowest
level in four years at 1.1 per cent.
The research, carried out for the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers,
contains some better news as well - income raised by local support groups is
rising, charities are getting better at recovering tax on covenants, and
charity shops are performing well. But the overall picture is one of a
difficult time for charity fundraisers.
According to the survey, the 20 big charities covered, with a combined
annual income of more than Pounds 600m, achieved an overall growth in
voluntary income of 5 per cent last year - little more than half 1992's 9
per cent rise.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, charities and the government waited for
an explosion in charitable giving that never happened. Innovations like Give
As You Earn and Gift Aid were established to promote tax-efficient giving;
ministers urged the public to recognise the importance of charity by
becoming more regular and generous donors. While some individual causes have
been outstandingly successful, giving in general has failed to expand in
line with a growing demand for the services of charities.
Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the Charities Aid Foundation, says
that, in spite of tax incentives, the proportion of the population that
supports charity in a planned, systematic way has remained stuck at around
10 per cent for the past six or seven years. Donors are, he says, giving no
more in real terms now than at any time over the past five years. Yet if the
public wanted low taxes and less state provision, they needed to contribute
to voluntary organisations and charities 'by a decimal point more than they
presently do.'
The CAF - which assists charities with their investments and fund management
 -this autumn made its own contribution to stimulating giving with the
launch of CharityCard, a debit card which enables users to take advantage of
tax-efficient means of making donations.
Faced with the evidence of recent years that individual giving is not going
to suddenly multiply, however, the CAF is also exploring fresh ideas for
raising finance for charity. These include the possibility of attracting
investment in charitable organisations from mainstream financial
institutions and, perhaps, the eventual creation of a charity bank. There is
a need, says Mr Brophy, for investments 'under banking rules' to be made in
the not-for-profit sector for use as capital, bridging funds, mortgage funds
or venture capital.
As well as trying to stimulate individual support for charity, the
government has encouraged business to become more active. This has proved
largely successful, with corporate community involvement developing into a
mainstream and planned business activity.
It has not, however, become an extensive new income stream for charities.
Corporate donations are tiny compared with other sources of funding, since
many companies regard advice, expertise and staff time, rather than money,
as their most valuable and appropriate contribution.
A report on corporate giving, produced this month by Ashridge management
college for the charity Action Research, suggests that, like individuals,
companies often fail to support charity in the most tax-efficient manner -
use of company trust funds was the least popular method of corporate giving.
The survey found that, while national charities were popular with very large
companies, small businesses were twice as likely to support local causes as
national ones. Medical and health charities were particularly popular with
large companies - 95 per cent of businesses with more than 10,000 employees
had supported such causes. Other popular areas for corporate support were
children and youth, and charities active in the disabilities field.
According to the survey, businesses employing fewer than 200 people gave an
average of Pounds 2,351 to charity in 1992, while the average value of gifts
in kind was Pounds 1,736.
Nearly half the companies responding to the survey - 46 per cent - said
charities needed to be more businesslike to gain greater corporate support,
while only 17 per cent disagreed with the statement. The importance of
charities having good communications was stressed by company representatives
interviewed for the survey, although the report warns that some business
decision makers are 'likely to be put off by over elaborate presentations'.
Appreciation of a good personal touch also emerged from the study. When
faced with competing causes, says the report, some company decision-makers
are likely to say: 'We will support this charity, because I get on well with
their fund raiser.'

There is an alternative to giving money to a favourite charitable cause  -
giving it to a favourite community.
Community foundations and trusts, in existence in the US since early this
century, are now becoming a feature of charitable support in the UK. Their
task is to build substantial, permanent funds from which grants are made to
local charitable and community organisations.
There are still relatively few community trusts in the UK, but their
development received a substantial boost from a recent decision by the US
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, acting in partnership with Britain's
Charities Aid Foundation, to finance a Pounds 2m challenge scheme. Three
established UK trusts - the Tyne &amp; Wear Foundation, Greater Bristol Trust
and Cleveland Community Foundation - submitted successful bids to share the
Pounds 2m challenge prize.
To get its one-third share of the prize money, each trust had to top it up
to Pounds 2m locally by adding Pounds 1.33m from its own fundraising
efforts. All three trusts succeeded in doing so by the deadline at the end
of the 1993-94 financial year.
The Association of Community Trusts and Foundations (Actaf) - which was set
up three years ago to support the work of Britain's fledgling trust movement
 -is now trying to maintain the impetus generated by the challenge
programme, and is seeking funds to repeat it.
'It is still early days for the community trust movement in the UK, and one
of our most important tasks is to make the public more aware of the value of
trusts as a way of supporting local causes,' says Ms Gaynor Humphreys,
co-director of Actaf. 'But new trusts are being formed, and most of the
established ones are growing.'
Tyne and Wear Foundation, one of the recipients of the challenge fund Pounds
2m, is the largest of 15 trusts affiliated to Actaf. Launched at the end of
1988, it had endowments of Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94 and made grants of Pounds
544,000. It is fundraising with a target of building a Pounds 10m endowment
fund by the end of the century.
The social deprivation that exists in much of the foundation's area is
reflected in many of its grant-making decisions, from Pounds 24,000 for work
among homeless young people in Hexham to Pounds 500 to help publish a
newsletter on Tyneside's deprived Meadow Well estate. An important
attraction of trusts is that, since grant decisions are made by local
committees, it is easier and less intimidating for small community
organisations to approach them than to seek help from national trusts or
distant corporate sponsors.
First, however, the money must be raised. Mr George Hepburn, the Tyne and
Wear Foundation's director, says his trust was helped by the remarkably
strong attachment to the north east felt by its business and civic leaders.
'Wealthy people were quickly attracted to the idea of the foundation as a
means of making a lasting contribution to the region as a whole. . . It can
be rather like having a private family trust fund without going to the
trouble of setting one up. If people give substantial amounts, we are happy
to involve them in discussions about how the money should be distributed.'
A frequent criticism of big national grant-making trusts is that they are
usually located in London, with a disproportionate amount of their support
going to causes in the south east or national organisations. Mr Hepburn is
currently managing Pounds 1.5m, which the London-based Henry Smith's charity
has decided to invest in projects tacking social deprivation in the north
east. He sees this approach - with community foundations acting as agents of
national grant-making trusts and contributing their knowledge of local needs
 -as a way of overcoming concerns about London bias.
While a strong, supportive sense of local community is an advantage in
establishing a trust, not all the current ones are in deprived inner-city
areas. Wiltshire Community Foundation is an example of a successful trust in
a predominantly rural county.
One of the Wiltshire foundation's first initiatives was to produce a report
on rural needs which showed that poverty and social problems are often
disguised by the area's conventional image of affluence. The foundation is
running a strong campaign to build corporate support in Swindon, the
county's main business centre. It has also been selected to manage the
Pounds 1.6m Wiltshire Independent Living Fund, a new project to give people
with disabilities more control over buying the care needed to live
independently in the community.
Community foundations are in a particular segment of the fundraising market:
they want wealthy individuals and corporate donors to give them very large
sums of money. Achieving this is never easy, but the justification - to
build up funds that will be of lasting benefit to communities, rather than
simply financing single projects - is a powerful one. Growing political
interest in the concept of community should help consolidate the community
foundation movement in the UK, and encourage its development.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (6): Phone
collectors receive a code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 1.4m telephone calls were made by a group of 65 charities last year,
as part of their fundraising efforts.
Attempts by charities to solicit pledges of money over the telephone
represent one of the fastest growing areas of fundraising. But it can expose
potential donors to the risk of high-pressure techniques and other abuse,
and the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers last month issued strong
guidelines on its conduct.
The 1.4m calls by the 65 charities included in a survey by the institute
raised Pounds 10.7m. Many fundraising calls are made by external agencies,
rather than a charity's own staff - 63 per cent of charities included in the
survey use agencies.
The institute's code, designed to ensure that telephone fundraising is
conducted in a 'professional and sensitive manner', applies to both directly
employed and agency staff. When charities use agencies, says the institute,
they should be engaged on the basis of service fees agreed in advance,
rather than commission related to the amount raised.
For each telephone contact, agencies must supply their names and addresses,
and the fee paid by the charity they are representing, if potential donors
seek such information.
'In all instances, fundraisers should be able to quote a specific figure,'
says the code. 'Any accompanying explanation or rationale for the
expenditure should be in addition to, not in place of, a clear statement of
the costs.'
The code says telephone fundraisers must give their names and that of the
voluntary organisation they represent, and make it clear that the purpose of
the call is to request support. Tone, content and style of calls must comply
with the requirements of the Advertising Standards Authority.
Fundraisers must accept the right of potential donors to terminate a
conversation at any stage, and must be able to disclose the name and address
of a 'properly authorised person' to whom complaints can be made.
Charities are advised that, where possible, householders should be sent
advance letters warning them to expect a telephone fundraiser to call. These
would give recipients the opportunity to write back saying that they did not
wish to be called.
Mr Karl Holweger, who chairs the institute's telephone working group, says
he expects telephone fundraising to 'increase dramatically' in the next few
years. It should be a cost-effective way of matching donors with causes they
wished to support, but must be conducted in a responsible way by charities
and their agents.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (3): 'Distorted'
returns criticised - The changes to the Trustee Investments Act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trustee Investments Act of 1961 was, by all accounts, drafted with the
best of intentions.
Trustees of charities were to ensure that donations were invested prudently,
and that scarce assets were not wasted on high-risk ventures, or used to
line the pockets of those who managed the money.
But now, charitable organisations say, recent modifications to the act
simply do not go far enough. The act is having the unfortunate effect of
pushing charitable investment into relatively lower yielding securities,
depriving them of badly needed investment returns at a time of shrinking
donations.
Moreover, it encourages certain distortions in investment which a 'prudent
man' would never choose of his own accord.
As a result, there is growing pressure from charities and those who invest
on their behalf to alter the Trustee Investments Act so that funds may be
managed in a more sensible fashion.
In 1961, the terms of the act called for those who managed charity assets to
place 50 per cent of funds into 'narrow' investments and the remainder into
'wider assets'. Narrow assets meant government stocks and cash, while wider
assets meant certain UK equities. One criterion for equity investment
specified that charities could only buy shares which had paid dividends for
at least the five previous years.
Mr Martyn Bensley, head of Fleming Investment Management's charity division,
notes that the criteria have served charities badly. A Pounds 2m sum
invested in 1961 would have earned Pounds 14m on the equities portion and
just Pounds 700,000 on the 50 per cent of assets invested narrowly, by the
end of last year.
In 1992, amendments to the Charities Act brought some improvements. The
category of narrower investments was broadened to include government bonds
of European Union member states and unit trusts which invest in gilts.
Meanwhile, the category of wider investments was broadened to include the
shares of companies based in the EU. Investment in companies outside the EU
can only be made through recognised unit trusts.
Mr Bensley points out that even this broadening of definitions distorts
investment. 'As a charity, you still cannot invest directly in shares of the
US or of Japan, although you can invest directly into Greece or Iceland.' He
describes the effect of the rules as 'crackers, just crackers.'
However, changes to the act's section 24 authorised the creation of common
investment funds (Cifs) and common deposit funds (CDFs), and these allowed
professional investment managers to skirt some of the Act's more restrictive
aspects.
Apart from the rules creating these categories of pooled fund, other
amendments to the act place greater emphasis on the fiduciary duties of
trustees and make them personally liable for carrying out those duties. The
effect of these legislative changes has been to create a surge in pooled
funds offered to charities by leading UK fund management companies.
For example, concern about trustees' duties under the act prompted Buzzacott
Investment Management, a firm of chartered accountants which also manages
funds for charities, to turn over Pounds 60m of client funds to Mercury
Asset Management for investment through its pooled funds. The 1992
amendments also bar those who audit charity funds from managing them as
well.
However, the act is anomalous in that regulation of these pools falls to the
Charities Commission, a body which may be well aware of the needs of
charities but knows relatively little of the complexities of investment. For
example, it recently dithered for seven months over whether it would be
proper for the UK's largest charity, the Wellcome Trust, to invest in
venture capital through limited partnerships.
Investment in partnerships could have been deemed to constitute trading, an
activity from which charities are banned, the commission feared.
Investment professionals note that self-regulatory bodies in the financial
services industry are probably better placed than the Charities Commission
to consider issues of this sort.
Thus, alterations in the regulation of pooled funds is one of the goals of a
charities and voluntary organisations task force. 'The burden of regulation
as it currently stands can, for smaller organisations, be so onerous and
costly that it threatens to stifle the enthusiasm of volunteers and
sometimes even the existence of the organisations themselves,' according to
a Flemings' update on the charity investment regulations.
Instead of the Charities Commission, one of the self-regulatory bodies for
the financial services industry should be charged with overseeing the
regulation of pooled funds, it is being argued.
The task force, whose members include representatives of the Home Office and
the Treasury, as well as charitable organisations and fund managers,
produced a report earlier this year setting out 189 proposed changes to the
regulation of charities. It is understood that the Treasury is considering
the case for reform, although no legislation is considered likely for at
least two years.
In particular, the group is seeking deregulation of investment powers.
Currently, charity trustees cannot lawfully designate the management of
their investments to a professional manager or appoint a nominee company
unless their own trust deed specifically permits them to do so.
Also, as far as the scope for investment discretion is concerned, the task
force had recommended that the concept of 'wider' and 'narrower' investments
be scrapped altogether. Privately, this suggestion has been rejected by
government ministers, but the group is still urging that the category for
wider investments be broadened to cover 90 per cent of the funds under
management.
The task force is also urging that the choice of permitted investments
should be considerably broadened.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (2): Capital
growth matters, too - Investment management / Routes to market exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finding the right home for one's money is a difficult enough process for the
average individual, but it is doubly nerve-racking for charity trustees who
are responsible for the proper management of other people's money.
Putting it safely on deposit at the bank may rest easiest on a trustee's
mind, but more charities are realising that in fact investments further
along the risk scale can be the most responsible choice, to provide some
capital growth as well as income.
Once a decision has been made that at least some of a charity's funds need
to be invested in stocks and shares, the next choice is between collective
funds, such as unit trusts or specialised common investment funds (Cifs) for
charities, and segregated management, where fund managers construct an
individual portfolio of investments to meet a charity's specific needs.
The choice may be dictated by the size of funds available. A charity with
less than Pounds 50,000 will not be able to afford the personal touch of
segregated management, while large national charities with Pounds 10m or
more to their names will be welcomed by any segregated fund manager. Between
those extremes, either option may be possible, if you research the market
thoroughly.
The big-name London managers tend to steer any charity with less than Pounds
2m towards collective investment vehicles, as their fee levels make
segregated management of smaller amounts uneconomic. But charities with more
modest funds to look after do have an alternative.
Some of the medium-sized stockbrokers and fund managers, particularly
outside London, accept much smaller funds for segregated management at fees
comparable with the charges on collective funds. This may be an appropriate
choice if a charity has specific investment needs, such as ethical
constraints or perhaps a temporary need for higher-than-usual income from
its assets.
Manchester-based stockbroker Henry Cooke, Lumsden, for example, offers
charities a full individual portfolio management service with no minimum
investment amount, though the minimum fee of Pounds 1,500 a year would deter
any fund with less than about Pounds 100,000. The standard annual charge is
an all-inclusive 0.7 per cent.
Most managers still use collective funds for part of the portfolio - for
example, to provide overseas exposure, as direct investment would be too
expensive with small amounts - but the UK portfolio will usually consist of
direct shareholdings.
If collective funds seem like a more appropriate solution, then charities
can choose from a wide range of unit trusts, or a smaller number of common
investment funds designed specifically for charities.
According to the WM Company, which produces comparative performance
statistics for charity funds, there are currently only nine equity-based
common investment funds and nine fixed-interest funds on the market. Those
not shown in the table are funds launched within the past year by Foreign &amp;
Colonial and Kleinwort Benson, which do not yet have a long enough
performance record to be included.
Shona McLeod, of WM Company, says more management groups would have launched
common investment funds by now, if it were not for the considerable
bureaucratic obstacles which have to be overcome to set up a fund. But
demand for Cifs is growing fast, so managers who can offer them are
attracting steady streams of new money.
One important factor in the growing demand for Cifs is the steady process of
divestment being carried out by the official custodian for charities. Small
charities whose assets were managed by the official custodian are gradually
having their money returned to them, and are having to find other homes for
it. Most have only modest sums to deal with, so the most obvious choice is a
Cif, particularly if they are constrained by the Trustee Investment Act.
The choice of manager - whether you opt for the collective or segregated
route - is wide, from the famous City names to smaller regional or
specialist firms. Even among managers of similar size and reputation, there
can be considerable differences in investment approach and charging
structure. So how should a charity go about finding the right manager for
its particular needs?
Michael Rimmer, of Schroders, says: 'Historically, a lot of introductions
have been effected by word of mouth. The charity world is still
comparatively small and self-contained - trustees talk to one another.' This
is particularly the case with medium-sized and smaller charities.
However, a word-of-mouth recommendation does not necessarily hand the fund
manager a new client on a plate. More often, it speeds the manager into a
short list, from which the final selection is made on more objective grounds
of cost, performance and so on.
But there are signs that the informality of that process may be changing.
Increasingly, charities - particularly the larger ones - are turning to
independent consultants for advice on choosing an investment manager.
Some people in the industry see the charity fund management business
following the example of pension funds over the past few years. Consultants
have become central to the pension fund manager selection process, and an
emphasis on performance statistics has concentrated a very high percentage
of funds in the hands of a very small number of managers.
The charity sector is more diverse, with more very small organisations, than
the pension sector, so concentration of funds is unlikely to go quite so
far; but trustees' growing awareness of their responsibilities is creating a
trend in that direction.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (4): Businesslike
but not a business - Will competition with the private sector lead to less
public funding?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

The Women's Royal Voluntary Service this week became the first voluntary
organisation to win the prestigious national category of the National
Training Awards.
Announcing its success, the charity said that it had 'beaten off stiff
competition from the commercial sector' to gain the award. Competition from
the commercial sector was also part of the stimulus for the WRVS's
investment in training - voluntary organisations and private companies are
both seeking to take over welfare services under contract to public
authorities, and this is forcing charities to examine the quality and
efficiency of their services.
The WRVS is Britain's largest voluntary organisation. With 140,000
volunteers - one in 200 of the adult population - it is bigger than the
Army. Its volunteers, who, in spite of the charity's name, include men, are
familiar figures running hospital shops, delivering meals on wheels and
assisting at emergencies. The financial environment in which such voluntary
activity takes place, however, has changed dramatically during the 1990s.
Managers of National Health Service trust hospitals, under pressure to
generate extra money from non-medical activities, today view hospital shops
as potential sources of income. In some big hospitals, this has led to
commercial retailers or facilities management companies taking over shop
activities that were once left to volunteers. Last year's community care
reforms, designed to shift funding from residential care to support in
people's own homes, are turning meals on wheels and home help services into
more businesslike activities which, in some areas, are attracting the
interest of the private sector.
In the face of this more competitive market, the WRVS is restructuring and
modernising under Mr Gerry Burton, a chartered accountant brought in as the
charity's first full-time chief executive. He inherited an organisation
which, among a series of other activities, runs 1,100 shops in 800 hospitals
and delivers 15m meals on wheels a year.
'Our hospital shops turn over Pounds 21m, and we donate Pounds 3m a year
back to the hospitals,' he says. 'But in the current climate of income
generation, hospital managers are asking if a better return on shops is
possible, so we are responding positively by improving shop design and
product mix.'
It is a similar story with meals on wheels. Some local authorities have
entered into contracts with frozen food companies to deliver meals on a
weekly, rather than daily, basis. Mr Burton has reacted by moving the WRVS
and its bulk-buying power into the frozen food market - it won the National
Training Award for a food hygiene training course for 66,000 volunteers.
But, the WRVS says, it can offer a more humane service than commercial
competitors by arranging for its volunteers to maintain contact with
housebound people between weekly food deliveries.
Mr Burton says he is not afraid of commercial competition. 'We do not have
the big wage bills of commercial organisations, we are not taxed on profits
and we do not need to pay dividends. So, provided we are well organised, we
should be able to withstand competition.'
But the success of the voluntary sector in winning and keeping public
contracts depends on a further, more imponderable, question - will
volunteers continue to give time to charities that are in businesslike
competition with the private sector to provide publicly financed services?
Mr Burton believes they will. 'Being efficient is not the same as being
commercial. Our volunteers are concerned to ensure that they are able to
offer the proper quality of caring service that people require. We are
improving our training facilities to make the work of volunteers
increasingly valuable and satisfying.'
Another important question is whether charities, with their tradition of
voluntary effort, will be adequately rewarded under public sector contracts.
Warnings from a number of local authorities last month, that their community
care budgets had run low only two-thirds of the way through the financial
year, have revived charity managers' concerns in this area.
A survey by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations last month
showed that charities received Pounds 672m in local authority grants and
fees in 1993-94, an increase of Pounds 84m on the previous year. The growth
reflects the effects of increased contracting with the voluntary sector as a
result of last year's community care reforms.
The NCVO says, however, that, in spite of the additional Pounds 84m,
charities are still subsidising community care services; and that the
1993-94 increase in spending on care services was accompanied by a Pounds 7m
reduction in local authority funding for the voluntary sector in other
sectors such as education.
Charity managers are particularly worried by suggestions in the survey that
some councils might expect them to subsidise community care services,
although local authority leaders deny that there is any concerted policy of
trying to do this. A total of 38 per cent of councils taking part said the
willingness of voluntary organisations to subsidise contract prices with
income from other sources, such as donations, would be a very important
factor in encouraging them to use charities rather than private-sector
providers; a further 42 per cent regarded it as fairly important.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (1): Sector seeks
new sources of income - As smaller charities follow large ones in seeking
professional financial advice, all wonder how much they may lose as a result
of the National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the less noticed accompaniments to the frenzy leading up to last
month's launch of the National Lottery was a complaint to the Advertising
Standards Authority by the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers.
The institute objected to the extent to which advertisements promoting the
lottery had linked the purchase of tickets with notions of doing charitable
good. 'Every time you play the National Lottery, someone else gets a better
chance,' they read.
Charity fundraisers fear that the public, induced by the possibility,
however remote, of winning a fortune, will buy lottery tickets in preference
to alternative forms of charitable support. Yet when prizes, tax, profits
and allocations to other causes are accounted for, charities will receive
only 5.6p for every Pounds 1 lottery ticket purchased.
Even so, the sums raised for charity will be substantial - an estimated
Pounds 100m in the first year, perhaps rising eventually to three times this
level. Unfortunately, however, estimates of possible losses commissioned by
the voluntary sector point to broadly similar figures of between Pounds 190m
and Pounds 270m a year.
Finance directors of charities will be watching anxiously for signs of the
lottery reducing their income. Even if fears about its impact prove to have
been exaggerated, however, it is clear that the lottery will be no
substitute for charities pursuing sound, efficient investment management and
fundraising policies.
The stimulus of recent changes in charity law, as well as pressure for the
best possible return on investments, is encouraging a growing number of
smaller charities to join big ones in seeking professional investment
advice.
Although small by pension-fund standards, the charities sector is a well
established specialist activity for fund managers. A number of the biggest
operators have several decades' experience of handling charity assets, and
in some cases now have approaching Pounds 2bn of charity funds under
management. Most have teams of charity specialists, and often offer
facilities such as telephone helplines, which can make investment issues
less intimidating for inexperienced trustees.
Charities can, depending on the size of their investments, choose between
common investment funds or individual portfolio management. Big London
investment managers are likely to seek minimum investments of Pounds
1m-Pounds 2m to justify individual management, but are willing to accept
charity accounts as small as Pounds 1,000 for common investment funds.
About Pounds 2bn is currently held in common investment funds, and this form
of investment is being stimulated by a phased process under which the
official custodian, a public official, is returning to smaller charities
money that had been held on their behalf.
Fund managers remain concerned about the restrictive impact of the 1961
Trustee Investments Act, under which charities must maintain a 50-50 split
between wider-range investments in equities and narrower-range gilts.
Earlier this year, the government introduced some changes, largely to extend
opportunities for investment in Europe, but it did not relax the 50-50
requirement.
Ministers have rejected a call from a government-appointed task force on
charity deregulation to abolish the requirement. The Treasury is, however,
currently reviewing the position. As an alternative to scrapping the 50-50
rule, the task force proposed a revised division, enabling charities to
invest up to 90 per cent of their funds in the wider-range category. This is
supported by Mr Martyn Bensley, head of the charities division at Fleming
Investment Management.
'The government could change the 50-50 division quickly by Order in Council,
and should do so,' he says. 'There are other questions, like definitions of
appropriate investments, that could then be considered over a longer period.
If a charity had invested Pounds 2m on a 50-50 split when the act was
introduced in 1961, its wider-range Pounds 1m would have been worth Pounds
15m in absolute terms by the end of last year, and its narrower range Pounds
706,000. In real terms, the wider range would be worth Pounds 1.4m and the
narrower Pounds 65,000. That seems to make the case for a 90 per cent split
in favour of the wider range.'
Mr Bensley and some of his fellow fund managers would like the Charity
Commission, still largely occupied with matters of charity law and
accounting, to give more attention to investment issues. He has proposed the
establishment of a panel of practitioners to advise the commission on
investment questions.
Questions about charity investment lock into a wider debate about the
financing of Britain's voluntary sector and, more broadly, its future.
Financial support from individual and corporate donors has remained
generally flat for several years. Public funding, on which somecharities
rely for much of their income, is tight, and the future holds fresh
uncertainties. The Scottish Office, for example, has turned down proposals
that new councils be required to retain existing levels of voluntary-sector
funding when local government in Scotland is reorganised.
Last month's Budget brought no relief on the issue of unrecoverable VAT paid
by charities, although Mr Mike Fountain, partner in charge of VAT at Coopers
&amp; Lybrand, chartered accountants, says that, because charities face a more
complex VAT regime than the average business, some pay the tax unnecessarily
on items such as building purchases, rent, equipment for research and
advertising.
Given the difficulties, therefore, in stimulating big increases in
traditional sources of income, the voluntary sector is beginning to look to
alternatives.
A local investment fund was launched last week by Business in the Community
with Pounds 2m from the private sector, including Pounds 500,000 from
National Westminster Bank, and a Pounds 1m grant from the Department of the
Environment. The fund will provide loans of between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds
250,000 to launch community enterprises, helping voluntary organisations to
overcome their frequent difficulties in raising loans on the conventional
financial markets. Elaborations of this idea, including a fully fledged
charity bank, are emerging from work on the future of charities being
undertaken by Demos, the think-tank.
Demos's work is part of a flurry of examination about to burst upon
charities. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations is setting up a
Commission on the Voluntary Sector, to stimulate thinking about future
priorities. The Central Statistical Office has commissioned a survey of the
sector's sources of funding, expenditure and assets. A study of the
financial governance of charities is about to begin, financed by the
Charities Aid Foundation, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
So, during the next two years, there will at least be a flow of new source
material to fuel the debate about the future of the voluntary sector. It is
a debate about absolute fundamentals. Changes in welfare service provision
and government funding may be pushing some big charities to the point where
they will look more like NHS trust hospitals, local-authority social
services departments or private-sector residential care companies than the
conventional public image of voluntary organisations.
If this happens, it will leave a growing amount of traditional, campaigning
charitable slack to be taken up at local level. But small, local voluntary
organisations tend to face greater financial problems than their bigger
counterparts, particularly when it comes to meeting core costs - donors
prefer supporting specific programmes to paying electricity bills. As a
result, staff of under-resourced smaller organisations often spend as much
time fundraising in order to survive as on providing services.
Charity's share of the National Lottery proceeds might be better spent on
tackling the sector's infrastructure problems - for example, by financing
top-quality management and staff training which would be available to the
sector as a whole - rather than simply generating another lottery among
700,000 voluntary organisations that will be scrambling for a share of the
prize.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Major unveils training scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday unveiled a jobs training scheme
for Northern Ireland, signalling a refocusing of the government's economic
strategy for the province to target the areas of highest unemployment.
The announcement came as both the US and the European Union reaffirmed their
commitment to support the Northern Ireland economy.
In an address to the 300 business delegates at the Belfast conference, the
prime minister argued that there were five reasons for investing in the
province - the educated labour force; its competitive business costs; one of
the most attractive incentive packages on offer in Europe; a strategic
location as a bridgehead for US and Asian investors; and its technology
infrastructure.
Outlining plans for new investments totalling about Pounds 75m, Mr Major
reiterated the government's commitment to fair employment.
In apparent response to reservations voiced by some US executives about
sectarian discrimination in the jobs market, the prime minister said the
government was determined to 'correct this legacy'.
He added: 'Everyone in Northern Ireland must have equal access to jobs and
indeed to all the new opportunities of peace.'
The prime minister devoted much of his speech to outlining the new community
work programme, aimed at providing work for up to three years for people
aged between 26 and 60 who have been out of work for more than a year.
The objective was to break the 'vicious cycle of declining skills and
motivation which long periods of unemployment can so easily create'.
He said: 'Northern Ireland has a new beginning. I want people to see, with
the minimum delay, the benefits peace is bringing - to commerce, to
industry, to everyday life.
'Peace is giving rise to prosperity. Prosperity in turn will consolidate
peace.'
The need to underpin the ceasefire through economic measures was a theme
echoed by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. 'At this decisive and hopeful
moment, it is essential to create greater economic opportunity in a region
whose prospects have been too long dimmed by bloodshed and enmity,' he said.
Mr Brown said his presence at the conference was 'only part of a larger
ongoing US commitment to Ireland'.
The US, he said, was preparing a 'strategic plan' for the economies of both
Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic. The plan would be
presented at President Bill Clinton's investment conference in Philadelphia,
scheduled for April, as part of a series of administration initiatives aimed
at 'preserving the peace and engendering economic progress'.
Mr Carlo Trojan, deputy secretary general at the European Commission, giving
further details of the EU's Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) package announced last
week, confirmed that the European Investment Bank would extend its interest
rate subsidies to help investors in the province.
Mr Trojan said the province would require 'significant and sustained
investment over the coming years'. Mr Trojan also stressed the need to
address structural problems. He said a challenge was 'the redirection of
redundant skills especially in the security sector'.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Delegates warm to PM's theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until the last moment it looked as if Mr John Major could have a flop on his
hands.
The International Investment Forum had been too hastily organised, it was
said. It was too close to Christmas and executives would not want to visit
Northern Ireland. There had been a poor response from potential investors.
Mr Major would find himself preaching to the converted - businesses which
had already invested in the province and any members of the local great and
good that the Industrial Development Board, the organisers, could manage to
attract.
To make matters worse, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, which had
been prevaricating all week on whether it would attend the conference,
threatened to boycott it and badger delegates on their way in to the forum
venue - the much bombed but now renovated Europa Hotel.
In the event, the conference was judged by the delegates to have been a
great success. A US official accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the US secretary of
commerce, who represented President Bill Clinton, said: 'It has gone
extraordinarily well. There were some last minute panics and some glitches
over Sinn Fein. But they were not going to be allowed to wreck the
conference. There was more than a reasonable turn-out.'
Mr Brown was involved in a marathon of speechmaking in the province before
attending the conference.
He was also thought to have been instrumental in persuading Sinn Fein to
attend.
Six Sinn Fein councillors were there, ostensibly to put their point of view
to delegates. Though they staged a walk-out, there were no Sinn Fein
demonstrations outside.
Mr Brown's involvement in the conference was important - but it was Mr
Major's presence that sealed its success.
More than 300 delegates finally agreed to attend, more than expected. Many
were local, with delegations from the US, the Far East and Continental
Europe. With their partners they packed the banqueting hall for the
pre-conference, black-tie dinner on Tuesday evening.
Mr Major made a bland speech, keeping his powder dry for the conference
yesterday. But it brought the house down. Half the gathering gave him a
standing ovation.
The Duke of Abercorn, the chairman of Laganside Development, a local quango,
summed up the upbeat mood. 'The people of Northern Ireland are deeply
grateful and appreciative that Northern Ireland tops his personal agenda,'
he said.
Mr Brian Carlin of Shorts, the Belfast aerospace company, said: 'It is very
important Mr Major is personally involved in this. He has given his personal
imprimatur and that is the highest recommendation you can get.'
Mr Don O'Callaghan, an executive with the Australian Meekaharra Minerals
group which has interests in Northern Ireland, said: 'The IDB has done an
exceptionally good job. It has paid attention to detail, and organised the
presentations superbly. There were not too many speeches and they were not
too long.
'It is of major importance that the prime minister is involved. His presence
gave great comfort to overseas investors.'
Perhaps most encouraging for the organisers is that the message that
Northern Ireland is a safe place for investment seemed to be getting
through.
Mr Alan Lewis, chief executive of the British textiles group Illingworth
Morris, said: 'While the violence was going on I had my doubts about
Northern Ireland. But now it looks a likely place for investment. The
competitive wage rates and incentives on offer mean you must pay it
attention.'
Mr Chung Sung Moon, managing director of Shin Ho Paper Manufacturing of
Korea, agreed: 'There are definitely possibilities for investment here now.
We have looked at Scotland but this is a better possibility.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Mood that makes peace process
hard to derail - Enthusiasm bodes well for talks on the province's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics was never far from delegates' minds during the conference.
The hardline Democratic Unionists made an appearance. Even Mr Gary
McMichael, a representative for the loyalist paramilitaries, was spotted in
the bar. And the walk-out by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, although a
clear disappointment to the government, failed to overshadow proceedings.
In the end, the event attracted prominent members of parties from across
Ulster's political spectrum, which could augur well for the prospects of the
round-table talks which it is hoped will eventually be convened on the
future of the province.
The sheer buoyancy of the mood and the enthusiasm of the welcome given to Mr
John Major and the US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown suggest the peace
process is building to a point where it is increasingly difficult for the
main participants, including Sinn Fein, to contemplate staying outside.
The conference came at a vital time after long delays in the forming of a
new Irish government. This has raised questions about the the nature of Sinn
Fein's relationship with the Republic and cast doubt over the progress on
the framework document, which the two governments envisage as the basis of
all-party talks on the constitutional arrangements for the province.
More than anything, the conference has demonstrated Mr Major's personal
commitment to maintain the momentum of the peace process. It has also served
to underline the practical benefits that will flow from a durable
settlement.
In outlining a plan for a job creation scheme, Mr Major seemed keen to
counter criticism by Sinn Fein that their supporters in the deprived areas
of Catholic west Belfast were being ignored by the conference.
The programme will do much to underline the government's commitment to
address the long-term structural problems of the economy, widely seen as
having inflamed community relations.
Attention now turns to the talks with the paramilitaries with an exploratory
session due to start with the loyalists in Belfast today. On Monday, British
officials will meet Sinn Fein for the second time and both sides are
expected to draft a more detailed agenda for future exchanges.
Observers do not expect the talks to broach any of the contentious issues
until at least February - but Mr Major yesterday again stressed the issue of
the IRA's large stockpile of weapons and explosives.
For the future, much will depend on the outcome of the search for a new
coalition in Dublin. Last night, a new three-party coalition seemed about to
be announced led by Fine Gael, a broadly conservative party, with Labour and
the Democratic Left, replacing the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition which
collapsed last month over a judiciary appointment scandal.
Traditionally, Fine Gael has been more sympathetic than Fianna Fail to the
unionists in Northern Ireland.
In exchanges in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week, Sinn
Fein is said to have expressed disapproval for Fine Gael's presentation on
the problems of the province.
One concern is that Sinn Fein may feel increasingly isolated from
politicians in Dublin, which may strengthen the position of hardline
republicans opposed to the ceasefire.
Equally, Sinn Fein has poor relations with Democratic Left, the successors
to the Official IRA, from which the Provisional IRA split in the 1970s to
pursue the armed struggle.
Sinn Fein has already voiced concern about the likelihood of a Fine Gael-led
administration in Dublin and it is clear that any new coalition will still
require the support of Fianna Fail if it is to steer vital changes to the
constitution through a referendum, as demanded by northern unionists.
The recent political crisis has left so much bad feeling between the parties
that many observers believe Fianna Fail deputies will be in no mood to
co-operate with a Fine Gael-led coalition even on issues as close to their
heart as the settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Happy in the shadow of De
Lorean - Jimmy Burns visits a components manufacturer whose managing
director has grown to like the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Montupet, a French car components manufacturer, announced plans to set
up a Pounds 90m operation near Belfast in December 1988 it promised to give
the local economy its most significant boost in recent years.
It was the biggest single project secured by Northern Ireland's Industrial
Development Board, and the biggest initial investment by an overseas company
in Northern Ireland.
Yesterday the manufacturer's Belfast subsidiary was among a select group of
companies shown off to delegates as an example of the benefits that peace
can bring.
The challenges and potential pitfalls that Montupet has had to meet typified
the problems faced by inward investors in the province.
What made the investment particularly significant was its location at the
Dunmurry site near Belfast where Mr John De Lorean, the flamboyant the US
entrepreneur, had planned to build a luxury sports car.
De Lorean's closure in 1982, with a net loss of Pounds 50m of taxpayers'
money, was one of the most spectacular failures in the British government's
long-running campaign to attract overseas investment to Northern Ireland.
Overcoming that legacy has not been easy for Montupet, as its managing
director, Mr Georges Senninger, admits. 'Ever since we started up in
Dunmurry, people have been asking the same question: how long are you going
to last? Are you going to pack up like De Lorean?' he says.
Far from it. Mr Senninger has grown to like Belfast, a city he admits he
once found 'depressing'. And he is not merely wedded to the place - a few
months ago he married a local woman.
Like other foreign companies, Montupet was lured to Northern Ireland by a
generous package of incentives offered by the IDB. This covered 30 per cent
of capital investment, 50 per cent of training costs, and wage subsidies
amounting to a one-off bonus of Pounds 6,000 per employee.
Mr Senninger insists the package - less than the 70 per cent to 80 per cent
of costs which can in theory be made available by the IDB - was not the most
important factor behind the investment decision.
The main short-term attraction was the availability of a cheap factory site
capable of integrating Montupet's European operations, and the low cost of
industrial land - Pounds 60,000 per acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in the
East Midlands.
Longer-term considerations included the availability of a skilled workforce
which would work for lower rates than on the UK mainland or in France.
Since starting up in March 1990, Montupet - like a number of other companies
given generous grants by the IDB - has failed to meet promised production
and employment targets. Output is now at the level it should have been at
the start of 1992, while the workforce is 500, rather than the 900 expected.
Mr Senninger rejects the suggestion that generous grants contributed to lax
management attitudes and poor investment strategies. He blames the crisis
that affected the world car industry in the early 1990s: 'The market shrank
and that was it.'
But the company has weathered the crisis and still projects itself as an
example of how businesses can survive in Northern Ireland in spite of
adverse circumstances.
The Dunmurry site now produces cylinder heads for Ford's Bridgend and
Cologne plants, and wheels for Peugeot and Renault. It has secured further
orders to supply engine blocks to Volkswagen. Production lines are running
nearly at capacity and recruitment has started again.
Located between staunchly Protestant and Catholic areas, Montupet has
recruited equally from both communities.
Only occasionally in the past four years has Mr Senninger, a French-born
Catholic, been reminded that Northern Ireland is not quite the tolerant
haven that the IDB's image makers try to portray to first-time visitors.
Soon after the plant started up, it was attacked by youths throwing stones
from the nearby Catholic Twinbrook estate. The security forces blamed the
IRA.
Mr Senninger thinks the authorities overreacted and regrets that he was
obliged to spend more on private security than he would have liked.
'The kids had got used to using the disused De Lorean testing track for joy
riding. They didn't like us taking away their playground,' he says with a
shrug.
On a personal level he was more affected by a row with the Royal Ulster
Constabulary which led to a court appearance. 'They arrested me just because
I had a foreign accent. It was absolutely unbelievable.'
More disturbing on a personal level is the fact that his wife - a local
Catholic - is afraid to use her Christian name in some Protestant areas of
Belfast.
Such experiences leave Mr Senninger cautious about the future. 'The
paramilitary ceasefires are a good start, but only a start. The province
needs a total cultural change and that's going to take time. I think the
government has some hard selling to do.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Five large investments in
Ulster confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday announced new investment in
Northern Ireland amounting to Pounds 74m at the international investment
forum he hosted in Belfast.
Although some of these investments have been in the pipeline for some time,
their announcement - timed to coincide with the conference - served to
underline the forum's success.
The organiser, the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, said
it was well pleased with the event. More than 300 delegates attended,
including a large delegation from the US accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the
country's secretary for commerce, who addressed the conference.
The investments confirmed yesterday were:
Du Pont of the US is spending Pounds 13.5m on developing prototype
technologies at its Lycra facility in Londonderry, bringing its investment
in research there to Pounds 38m in the past three years. Du Pont employs
1,000 production staff in Londonderry.
Ford, the US motor group, which has had a presence in Belfast for 30 years,
is to invest Pounds 15m in the production of new engine components.
Nacco Materials Handling of the US will be investing Pounds 11m at
Craigavon, consolidating the plant's position as a source for its new range
of Hyster and Yale forklift trucks. More than 100 extra jobs will be created
by 1996.
British Telecommunications is to invest Pounds 30m in a new office block at
Laganside in Belfast and a further Pounds 1.5m in expanding its customer
services centre at Enniskillen, providing 113 new jobs. Sir Iain Vallance,
BT chairman, said the investment would be in addition to the Pounds 30m BT
expects to invest in Northern Ireland in the coming year.
Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, which is already established in
County Antrim, is to build a Pounds 3.5m factory at Springvale Business Park
in west Belfast which could create 100 new jobs.
A shadow hanging over the conference in the shape of a possible boycott by
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, evaporated when Sinn Fein
councillors arrived at the Europa Hotel early yesterday morning and began to
lobby delegates over the province's economic future. They subsequently took
seats in the conference hall and listened to some of the speeches before
walking out.
One potential US investor, however, criticised the treatment of Sinn Fein.
Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller - who controls a Dollars 50bn
(Pounds 30.4bn) pension fund - said that Mr Gerry Adams, the president of
Sinn Fein, should have been invited to the conference.
He said that exclusion of 'a representation of a substantial portion of the
population' from the conference was 'a mistake on the part of the British
government'.
After the conference Mr Major visited the site of the new BT office block in
Laganside.
He later went with his wife Norma to the centre of Portadown, which was
devastated 19 months ago by an IRA bomb.
The Majors were given a warm welcome as they walked through the central
shopping district. They then visited the local Royal Ulster Constabulary
headquarters.

FT  15 DEC 94 / National Power plans fuel switch: Plant would burn
controversial Orimulsion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity generation company, is to apply for
government permission to build equipment which will enable it to burn
Orimulsion, the controversial bitumen-based fuel, at its Pembroke plant in
west Wales.
The company's application, expected to be lodged within weeks, is a blow to
providers of other fuels including coal and gas. Burning Orimulsion at
Pembroke could displace up to 5m tonnes of coal a year.
National Power is already discussing with the pollution inspectorate its
plans to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke to allow it to
generate electricity there.
The likely submission for section 36 (planning) approval by the government
to fit the equipment indicates the company is intent on going ahead.
'We are going ahead with the project because we believe it has the potential
to provide clean electricity at a significantly lower cost than competing
fuels for generation,' National Power said.
Before it could go ahead and burn Orimulsion, National Power would need
permission from both the pollution inspectorate and from the govern-ment.
National Power also believes there may be potential to burn Orimulsion at
other oil-fired power stations.
Orimulsion is the trade name of a natural bitumen dispersed in water. It is
produced in Venezuela from the Orinoco Belt by Bitor, a subsidiary of
Petroleos De Venezuela, a state-owned company.
Bitor Europe, which markets the fuel in Europe, hopes to sell Orimulsion
throughout the Continent - but believes the UK is among the strongest
potential markets.
The pollution inspectorate provoked a controversy last year when it gave
permission to PowerGen, another generator, to burn Orimulsion without
desulphurisation equipment at its power stations at Ince on Merseyside and
Richborough in Kent.
The use of Orimulsion is opposed by the coal lobby since it displaces
indigenous fuels, and by the environmental lobby which points to what it
says are high sulphur emissions from the fuel.
Bitor Europe says the fuel emits no more sulphur than some coals already
being used to generate electricity in the UK. In addition, it says
Orimulsion emits less carbon and nitrous oxide than coal.
Should National Power win regulatory and government approval to fit
desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke, the effect on coal would be
considerable. Coal burn for generation is forecast by some analysts to fall
below 30m tonnes in England and Wales by the end of the decade.
RJB Mining, the coal company taking over British Coal's English assets, has
however made generous provision for Orimulsion burn in its calculations. It
believes Orimulsion could displace 6.5m tonnes of coal in 1998-99 and 8.3m
tonnes in the following year.
PowerGen burns about 1m tonnes a year of Orimulsion at Ince and Richborough
and has no plans to increase this amount.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Delays on defence projects attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About 80 per cent of important defence equipment projects are running behind
schedule and there are 'large cost overruns' on a significant number of
projects, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday.
The date by which the projects were due to be in-service had slipped by 32
months on average, according to a committee report.
It added that the bill for the Eurofighter 2000 programme had spiralled to
slightly less than Pounds 1bn. The MPs warned that a cost overrun on any
project entailed cuts elsewhere in the programme.
They also expressed concern at a National Audit Office report on five
'mid-life update projects' by which equipment is modernised. All five missed
deadlines or ran over budget.
More than Pounds 500,000 has been spent on regimental swords, it was
disclosed yesterday. There have been 560 new swords bought in the past five
years at a cost of Pounds 365,700, and 576 swords have been 'refurbished' at
a cost of Pounds 156,700.

International Business Machines has sold its manufacturing plant at Havant,
Hampshire, to its management in a deal worth about Pounds 50m.
The management group has formed a company, Xyratex, which has been running
the plant since the beginning of the month. It will continue to produce disk
drives, flexible circuits and networking equipment for IBM.
Last year IBM said the plant - one of the company's best-known European
facilities, which manufactures disk drives for personal and medium-range
computers - was one of three in Europe that was 'surplus to requirements'
because of industrial restructuring.
Two months ago it became known that IBM was planning to sell the plant and
that several manufacturing groups had been invited to bid.
The management buy-out was led by Mr Ken Wilkie, former managing director,
and 30 managers. Finance is being provided by Murray Johnstone, the venture
capital company. Senior debt has been provided by Midland Bank.
The plant employs more than 2,000 people and will have revenues of about
Pounds 300m a year.
It has recently signed contracts to make about 1m units a year of an
innovative drive design for JTS, a Californian company, and about 100,000
units a year for Nomai, a French removable drive company.
It will continue to develop recently launched lines of business in removable
data storage, test systems, network consultancy and applications software.
IBM has been cutting manufacturing capacity as it comes to terms with an
industry which that has shifted to personal computers and networked systems.
Mr Wilkie said yesterday he was confident that Havant's engineering
expertise and manufacturing prowess were a sufficient counter to Asia's
lower manufacturing costs. Computer makers, he said, were increasingly
looking for European sources of key components.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Tribunal reform is intended to boost efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Streamlining rather than radical reform is the aim of the government's
proposals for Britain's overburdened industrial tribunals, set out in a
consultative document yesterday.
The government also announced that it was preparing a bill for the current
parliamentary session to consolidate all existing employment rights
legislation.
A further measure will be needed in the 1995-96 session to implement any of
the measures set out yesterday.
Industrial tribunals are independent judicial bodies chaired by legally
qualified people appointed by the government's legal officers. They sit with
two lay members - one drawn from a panel of employer members, the other from
a panel of employee members - who are both appointed by the Department of
Employment.
The document, aimed at making tribunals more efficient and improving service
to employees and employers, is part of the most comprehensive review of
industrial tribunal activity since they were formed 30 years ago.
Among radical options that appear to have been rejected is charging users of
the tribunals. It is estimated that 80 per cent of employees who go to
industrial tribunals are unemployed. Also, charging users would undermine
the need for tribunals to remain open to employees seeking justice.
The government's main proposals include the suggestion that the tribunals be
called employment tribunals, rather than industrial tribunals.
Among measures to improve procedures, it is proposed that tribunals would
have discretion to dismiss cases judged to be hopeless at a pre-hearing
review, and to dismiss a case during a hearing if its eventual failure
became evident.
To encourage the voluntary settlement of disputes, the document suggests
that tribunals be required to take into account whether an applicant had
sought to resolve their dispute with the employer before going to the
tribunal. An employee should notify the employer in writing of his or her
grievance and expect a reply within a 14-day period.
The consultative document also lays out 'further possibilities' for reform,
seeking comment from interested parties. These would involve:
Provision of independent binding arbitration as a voluntary alternative to a
tribunal hearing, where the parties agree.
A statutory requirement on an employee to pursue a remedy of a grievance
with the employer before a tribunal complaint can be made.
Allowing chairmen of tribunals to sit alone - without the lay members, who
represent employers and employees - for all except discrimination and unfair
dismissal cases, with the discretion to sit alone in unfair dismissal cases
as well.
Giving powers to tribunals to set time limits on proceedings.
Responses have to be sent to the Department of Employment by March 10 next
year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Toyota to cut output as demand weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker-than-expected demand for new cars in Europe means Toyota will not use
the 100,000-a-year capacity at its Burnaston plant near Derby next year,
contrary to plan, the company said yesterday, John Griffiths writes.
It now plans to produce 90,000 cars next year, compared with a projected
85,000 this year. 'However, as we have seen this year, which started
strongly but then slowed more recently, the market is very changeable and
our production levels next year may be amended accordingly,' said Mr
Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of Toyota UK.
The announcement, added to Nissan's failure to meet output projections for
its plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, and relatively slow growth in output
at Honda's plant in Swindon, Wiltshire, may indicate that European carmakers
have overstated fears about potential strong growth in sales of Japanese
cars.
Mr Hirano rejected speculation that Toyota had decided to delay plans to
double its Burnaston capacity.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Nuclear waste project faces delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for a Pounds 2bn underground nuclear waste repository project may
face further delay, after a recommendation to Cumbria county councillors not
to approve the scheme's next stage.
In a report published yesterday, Mr David Cole, the county council's
director of economy and environment, advises councillors not to grant
planning permission at a special meeting next Tuesday for an underground
rock laboratory near Sellafield.
Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste agency, wants to construct the Pounds
120m rock characterisation facility (RCF) 650 metres underground, to gather
geological and hydro-geological data before deciding final plans for a
repository.
Nirex has already spent more than a decade searching Britain for a suitable
disposal site for intermediate-level and low-level nuclear waste - arousing
fierce opposition.
In mid-1991 it decided to focus its investigations on a site near the
Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant where 60 per cent of the waste
is produced. It had hoped, if geology proved suitable, to have the
repository operational by 2005. Technical changes and planning wrangles
about test boreholes have set back this target to 2010.
If, as seems likely, Cumbrian councillors decline or defer permission for
the RCF, a long public inquiry may result.
In his report, Mr Cole says that the RCF application conflicts with Cumbria
County Council's strategic planning policies as a result of its adverse
environmental and amenity impact on the surrounding rural area and also the
impact on the nearby Lake District National Park.
Nirex, he says, has not to date provided sufficiently convincing reasons to
override these policies.
The outcome of the government's review of the UK's nuclear industry,
including waste management policy, is still awaited, says Mr Cole. Further
geological information from Nirex on the site is also expected shortly.
Nirex, he says, has not provided information to convince the council there
are 'compelling reasons' for choosing the Sellafield site in preference to
alternatives.

A public inquiry - which would last two to three years - had not been
expected unless Nirex went ahead with a planning application for the
repository. All parties on the county council have been pressing the
government, so far without success, for a public inquiry into the RCF.
Nirex yesterday said it saw no strategic planning grounds for the refusing
or deferring approval on application which it described as purely a research
facility. Mr David Brown, Nirex's Cumbrian director, said: 'It cannot be
stressed too often that this is not a nuclear facility.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / IBM sells 'surplus' plant to managers

IBM has been cutting manufacturing capacity as it comes to terms with an

from mainframe computers.
Analysts question whether there is a future for disk drive manufacturing in
Europe when most electronics companies are transferring production to Asia
and the Pacific Rim. A contract awarded to Havant by Western Digital of the
US for 2m drives annually was cancelled earlier this year as a consequence
of changes in manufacturing strategy.
Mr Wilkie said yesterday he was confident that Havant's engineering
expertise and manufacturing prowess were a sufficient counter to Asia's
lower manufacturing costs. Computer makers, he said, were increasingly
looking for European sources of key components.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Defence projects 'late and over cost'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About 80 per cent of important defence equipment projects are running behind
schedule and there are 'large cost overruns' on a significant number of
projects, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday.
The date by which the projects were due to be in-service had slipped by 32
months on average, according to a report from the cross-party committee of
MPs.
It added that the bill for the Eurofighter 2000 programme had spiralled to
slightly less than Pounds 1bn. The MPs warned that a cost overrun on any
project entailed cuts elsewhere in the programme.
They also expressed concern at a National Audit Office report which examined
five 'mid-life update projects' by which equipment is modernised. All five
missed deadlines or ran over budget. For example, the Tornado GR1 mid-life
update had slipped by five years and had a cost overrun of about 50 per
cent.
Delays to the updating of the Sea Harrier meant the modernised aircraft had
entered service only recently. The upgrade remedied deficiencies identified
during the Falklands War in 1982.
More than Pounds 500,000 has been spent on regimental swords, it was
disclosed yesterday: 560 new swords have been bought in the past five years
at a cost of Pounds 365,700, and 576 swords have been 'refurbished' at a
cost of Pounds 156,700.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Construction body hits at Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading forecasting body in the construction industry has warned that the
government's private-finance initiative cannot meet the shortfall in
public-sector expenditure.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, which represents more
than 2,000 companies, yesterday forecast that the Budget had damaged
recovery prospects for the construction industry over the next two years.
Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the forecasting panel, said the chancellor's
decision to cut the national road programme and support for local
authorities' road expenditure would reduce infrastructure work by 8 per cent
next year and by 5 per cent in 1996. Lower third-quarter orders, a hiatus in
water industry investment and budget cuts, together with delays in the
timetable for the Channel tunnel rail link, meant infrastructure output
could fall by 10 per cent this year.
Central government funding of the Housing Corporation will also fall and the
council predicted that housing starts would decline from 43,000 this year to
36,000 in both 1995 and 1996.
The government hopes the slack will be picked up by its private-finance
initiative. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that
contracts for some Pounds 5bn of private-sector investment were expected to
be placed next year. He failed to give the immediate go-ahead for any new
projects, pointing to the long lead times which are necessary to get large
projects up and running.
Mr Roberts said that as a result, private initiative projects would not come
through fast enough.
The Building Employers Confederation, the biggest industry trade
association, said it continued to support efforts to raise private finance
for construction projects, but stressed this should not replace existing
planned public expenditure.
It said progress on the initiative would be closely monitored and strong
representations made to government if future public-sector capital
expenditure slipped below an acceptable level.
The council believed the private sector would provide growth in construction
over the next two years, saying the strong upturn in industrial and
commercial construction was encouraging.
Nevertheless, it expressed concern at the fragility of the recovery in the
private housing market and was disappointed that the sharp cuts in
infrastructure and social housing programmes would undermine growth in 1995
and 1996.

Two surveys based on different aspects of the housing market gave a mixed
picture of the state of mortgage lending in November, though there was still
no sign of a vigorous recovery.
Barclays Bank's mortgage lending index suggests gross mortgage lending rose
by 0.3 per cent compared with October, to be 2.5 per cent higher than
November last year.
At the same time, however, a gloomier impression emerged from the property
sales figures released on behalf of corporate estate agents. These showed
sales had fallen by 10.3 per cent in November compared with October.

Pressure is growing within the insurance industry for an end to unlimited
liability motor policies, according to a leading Lloyd's of London motor
underwriter.
Mr Peter Routledge, chairman of a working party on public relations set up
by the Lloyd's Motor Underwriters' Association, said unlimited liability was
increasingly seen as nonsensical because no insurance or reinsurance company
has unlimited assets.
Any move towards capping exposure from motor liabilities would require a
change in UK road traffic acts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday promised to alter the finance bill to exclude
charities and their subsidiaries from provisions announced in the Budget
aimed at closing a loophole used by some foreign companies with subsidiaries
in the UK.
Charities expressed their concern after the Budget that they appeared to be
caught by the provisions and could face big tax bills as a result of new
rules on 'thin capitalisation'.
Under the new rules UK subsidiaries would no longer be able to avoid
corporation tax by using profits to make interest payments. These have not
previously been taxable. The plan to tax such payments would affect UK
companies only where the company receiving the interest was not paying
corporation tax.

FT  15 DEC 94 / All-items retail prices index rise surprises City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of household goods and clothing rose last month, as retailers tried
to push prices back up again after heavy discounting earlier in the year.
Food costs also rose slightly, partly due to higher milk prices stemming
from reform of the Milk Marketing Board.
However, motoring costs continued to fall, largely as a result of cheaper
petrol prices.
Overall, the Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the all-items
retail prices index rose to 145.3 in November from 145.2 in October, with
1987 taken as the base year of 100.
This was 0.1 per cent higher than in the previous month, and 2.6 per cent
higher than last November.
Measured without mortgage interest payments, the 'underlying' index - the
Treasury's preferred measurement of inflation - rose 2.3 per cent in the
year to November, compared with rises of 2 per cent in September and
October.
The increase surprised the City, which had been expecting that the
underlying index would barely rise as retailers sought to boost sales by
more price cutting. Analysts had predicted that the all-items index would
fall by 0.1 per cent in November, compared with October.
However, economists yesterday pointed out that though the data suggested
that the inflation trend was now turning upwards, the size of last month's
rise appeared to have been slightly exaggerated by some special factors.
The start of the supermarket price wars last November, for example, meant
that the annual inflation in food prices this November looked particularly
high. Food costs rose 0.3 per cent between October and November, and by 2.1
per cent in the year to November. This accounted for 0.14 percentage points
of the 0.2 percentage annual rise in the all-items index.
A 3.6 per cent monthly rise in milk prices due to the reforms of the Milk
Marketing Board accounted for 0.04 percentage points of this overall
increase.
Non-seasonal food prices also rose, although there was heavy discounting on
soft drinks and turkeys.
Clothing and footwear prices rose by 0.5 per cent in the month, after
recording a surprise fall in October. However, heavy discounting throughout
the year meant that prices remained 0.1 per cent lower than last November.
Prices for furnishings, electrical appliances and other household goods also
rose sharply, after a bout of mid-season sales in the autumn. Household
goods were 1 per cent higher in November than October - the sharpest monthly
increase for at least 20 years.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Record fall in costs of labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers recorded their sharpest fall in unit labour costs in October
since records began in 1970, figures released yesterday by the Department of
Employment showed.
The improvement in competitiveness has flowed from productivity gains
outstripping the pace of earnings increases.
Manufacturing output per head was 6.5 per cent higher in the three months to
October than in the same period of 1993. Output has been growing rapidly
while employment has been largely flat.
Meanwhile, average earnings in manufacturing rose by an underlying 4.75 per
cent in the year to October. This followed an upward revision in the
September figure from 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent.
The net effect was that manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output
were 1.7 per cent lower in the three months to October than in the same
period of 1993. In September, the fall was 1.5 per cent.
The increase in manufacturing earnings bumped up the whole economy earnings
annual growth rate to 4 per cent in October from 3.75 per cent in September.
The Department of Employment said that overtime and bonus payments, rather
than a general rise in the level of pay settlements, prompted the pick-up in
the October figures.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Show of resistance disguises unity of business purpose: The
postal strike masked broad agreement between management and staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Post Office dispute, which closed more than 100 main offices,
caused a predictable spat.
The UCW communication workers' union said that Monday's walkout, over
'backdoor privatisation' of main offices, was a tremendous success.
Management dismissed it as a flop.
One might conclude that the UCW, which campaigned so successfully to stop
the government's privatisation plans for the Post Office, was still at
daggers drawn with senior management, which had lobbied strenuously for a
sell-off.
However, appearances can be deceptive. Last month the UCW recommended that
its members accept a 2.8 per cent pay rise from November 1 to rise to 3.4
per cent from anuary 1.
Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said that closure of main
offices and their transfer to franchised stores or supermarkets had been
happening since 1987. This week's walkout was merely an attempt to give the
issue a higher profile.
Although the counters side of the business employs about 9,000 UCW members,
the union stressed that 'this dispute does not epitomise our relationship
with the Post Office'.
But Mr Johnson said industrial relations were 'very tense' in the much
larger Royal Mail letters business, which employs 130,000 of his members.
The union is in the process of conducting about 40 strike ballots on local
disputes over hours and conditions.
The union said the Post Office's own attitude survey showed that employees'
morale was 'abysmal'. It said it would be pressing in forthcoming
negotiations for shorter working hours - and in particular for an end to
routine six-day working by most delivery staff.
Mr Johnson said: 'Seven-day working was stopped in 1849. So delivery staff
came into this century working on six days a week. We don't want them to go
into the next century still doing the same.'
Mr John Roberts, the Post Office's managing director of group services, took
a more relaxed view of the group's industrial relations. 'This is our
busiest time of year - disputes over overtime are almost traditional. Five
years ago we lost 5 per cent of man-days because of industrial action
between April and Christmas. Since April this year we have lost less than
0.1 per cent.'
However, Mr Roberts said: 'We had two-and-a-half years of total uncertainty
 -that certainly had an impact on morale. It is difficult to run a business
when you don't know which way you are heading.
'Now that it is clear we will remain in the public sector - at least for the
foreseeable future - we can focus on longer-term issues.'
Management is not unsympathetic to the UCW's complaint that low basic pay
means that postal workers rely too much on overtime to achieve reasonable
average pay. In the new year negotiations, the union will be seeking reduced
working hours, enhanced job security and a productivity scheme.
Mr Roberts said: 'Now is a very good time for us to take stock. We are going
to have a period of stability - we have got to make the most of that. There
is a lot of common ground on which to build.'
Mr Johnson is also anxious not to overstate the degree of industrial unrest,
and agrees with management that most of the present local disputes in Royal
Mail are likely to be settled without industrial action.
He said: 'We realise we're better off than in a lot of industries. We have a
fairly sophisticated industrial relations environment. While there might
have been some hawks passing through, most managers realise they need to
work with the unions.'
One goal that both the UCW and the management will press for is the
achieving of more commercial freedom for the Post Office, now that the
government has backed away from immediate privatisation.
There is some resentment on the union side that Mr Bill Cockburn, Post
Office chief executive, and Mr Michael Heron, chairman, both pressed so
vociferously for privatisation. Post Office leaders apparently felt they had
little choice, given the conditions with which the government seemed intent
on hedging the option of staying in the public sector.
Mr Roberts said: 'The issue for us was always commercial freedom - not
ownership. But the government said ownership within the public sector would
condemn us to slow decline. The key thing is that we must not let go of the
argument for commercial freedom.'
The union plans to launch a Postal Forum - to include consumer and industry
associations, charities and disability groups - in the new year to campaign
for greater commercial freedom.
Union and management will again press for a cut in this year's Pounds 226m
government levy on post service profits.
Mr Johnson said: 'We're dealing with the art of the possible - trying to
build a coalition. Our members are not naturally militant - we take the
brunt of any industrial action. Many of my members meet more members of the
public every day than senior management do all year.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Clarke denies plan for more VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday that he did not intend to
use the lower 8 per cent value added tax rate - which now applies to
domestic fuel and power - to broaden the VAT base in the tax system.
'I have no intention of building on the lower rate,' he told the Commons
Treasury and civil service committee.
He said he did not choose to have the lower 8 per cent VAT rate - which was
forced on the government by last week's Commons defeat of its plans to lift
VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent - and he did not plan to rush back into
broadening the VAT base. He had not, for example, considered levying VAT on
newspapers or magazines when preparing the Budget.
The chancellor also said:
He hoped that after the supply-side reforms of recent years, the economy
could sustain growth at a faster annual rate than 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent
without risking inflation.
He had acted promptly last week to plug the hole in his Budget caused by the
VAT revolt because it was dangerous for a nation to borrow heavily in
financial markets.
Political considerations had reinforced his decision last week to raise base
rates to 6.25 per cent from 5.75 per cent. However, the rate rise had been
justified on economic grounds.
Mr Clarke stressed that he was pleased with the present monetary regime in
which there was more openness over policy and the governor of the Bank of
England played a more prominent role than previously. But in a cryptic
remark, he hinted that the rate rise might be reversible if conditions
warranted it. It was 'possibly one of the few reversible decisions I have
taken', he said.
Mr Clarke was upbeat about the economy. Britain as an industrial nation was
'now quite spectacularly good' compared with 15 years ago.
He cited Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing president of the European
Commission, as having said that the UK would be one of only three EU
countries to meet the economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty
in 1996. The UK would meet them easily, while Germany would need 'good luck
and a following wind'.
This meant that Britain was on course for the 'ideal situation' of being
able to decide if it wanted to enter the third and final stage of economic
and monetary union with a single currency and European central bank. His
main aim was to keep Emu as a 'genuinely open option' for the UK.
He was less forthcoming about future tax policy and refused to name the
conditions under which he would or would not cut taxes in a future Budget.
He admitted that taxes could not be cut when the public finances were
unhealthy but said that chancellors had to look at 'the overall situation'
when making decisions on fiscal policy.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Portillo welcomes employment figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, yesterday welcomed signs that
the figures measuring employment were moving in the right direction.
Unemployment had been falling steadily since December 1992 but the figures
for the workforce in employment, compiled from a survey of employers, had
previously been showing declines.
Yesterday's Department of Employment figures showed that employment rose by
146,000 in the third quarter, the largest quarterly increase since 1989.
This brought the measure into line with the Labour Force Survey, which
produces statistics on the basis of interviews with individuals, and which
has been recording steady employment increases.
The LFS, which is conducted on a slightly different timescale from the
employers' survey, found an increase in employment of 64,000 between the
spring and the summer.
Mr Portillo said he felt the employers' survey followed the LFS with about a
six-month lag, which mainly reflected the delays between the establishment
of new businesses and the reporting, via the Inland Revenue, of job creation
to the Department of Employment.
The main increase in employment was a rise of 126,000 in the services
sector, according to the employers' survey, while self-employment rose by
40,000. About 52,000 of the services increase came from the banking,
insurance and financial services sector. Employment in the manufacturing
sector rose by just 2,000 in the third quarter, but this gain was wiped out
in October.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally
adjusted 43,400 in November to 2,470,600, or 8.8 per cent of the workforce.
This was the lowest total since September 1991; unemployment has now fallen
by 501,000 since its peak in December 1992. Last month, unemployment fell
among men and women in every region.
Following a revised fall of 48,400 in October (the previous estimate was
45,800), the unemployment total has now dropped by an average of 31,800 over
the last six months. However, the Department of Employment still estimates
the trend is for a monthly decline of 25,000.
Unadjusted, the number of unemployed people fell 32,031 to 2,423,013, or 8.6
per cent of the workforce.
The LFS shows that growth in full-time employment outstripped that of
part-time jobs between the spring and the summer. In many previous quarters
part-time work has predominated.
Meanwhile, the stock of unfilled vacancies at jobcentres rose by a
seasonally adjusted 3,400 in November to 180,600, the highest level since
June 1990.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Manufacturers report record labour costs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers recorded their sharpest fall in unit labour costs in October
since records began in 1970, figures released yesterday by the Department of
Employment showed.
The improvement in competitiveness has flowed from productivity gains
outstripping the pace of earnings increases.
Manufacturing output per head was 6.5 per cent higher in the three months to
October than in the same period of 1993. Output has been growing rapidly,
helped by buoyant export demand, while manufacturing employment has been
largely flat.
Meanwhile, average earnings in the manufacturing sector rose by an
underlying 4.75 per cent in the year to October. This followed an upward
revision in the September figure from 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent.
The net effect was that manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output
were 1.7 per cent lower in the three months to October than in the same
period of 1993. In September, the fall was 1.5 per cent.
The increase in manufacturing earnings bumped up the whole economy earnings
annual growth rate to 4 per cent in October from 3.75 per cent in September.
Production and service sector earnings rose at unchanged rates of 4.5 per
cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.
Underlying earnings figures are calculated using a three-month rolling
average, and this helped push up the October annual rate, despite the fact
that the sector increases were unchanged from September. The seasonally
adjusted annual rise showed a fall to 3.8 per cent in October from 3.9 per
cent in September.
The Department of Employment said that overtime and bonus payments, rather
than a general rise in the level of pay settlements, prompted the pick-up in
the October average earnings figures. However, a number of higher
settlements will feed through into the November figures.
Mr Chris Trinder, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, said there were substantial discrepancies between
the average earnings figures and other official information on pay.
National accounts figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated a
level of pay growth nearer to 3 per cent than 4 per cent.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Post Office triples its profits for half year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office yesterday reported half-yearly pre-tax profits up more than
threefold on last year, and announced that there would be no early increase
in stamp prices.
In spite of uncertainty about the future status of the industry, Post Office
pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 198m in the six months to September 25, from
Pounds 59m for the same period last year.
This puts the Post Office on course to meet its government levy of Pounds
226m, taken from its post-tax profits for the full year 1994-95, without a
stamp price rise. However, Mr Michael Heron, chairman, refused to rule out a
price rise for the whole of 1995.
Mr Heron continued to insist that decline was in prospect unless the
government gives the Post Office greater commercial freedom to run the Royal
Mail, the letter delivery division which accounts for most of the industry's
turnover and profits.
The government last month backed away from its plan to privatise the Post
Office, fearing that the steadfast opposition of about 10 Tory MPs would
lead to defeat in the Commons.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to decide the
future status of the industry within the public sector. The Post Office
board is anxious that its healthy financial performance does not reinforce
the case for the status quo, yet the Treasury appears intent on resisting
moves to reduce the government profits levy and other commercial
constraints.
The half-yearly results showed a rise of 1m in the number of letters
delivered a day by the Royal Mail over the past year, taking the figure to
64m. The division's turnover increased from Pounds 1.96bn to Pounds 2.15bn
and its pre-tax profit from Pounds 55m to Pounds 199m.
The counters division, which has responsibility for high street and village
post offices, also reported a sharp increase in profit, from Pounds 10m to
Pounds 14m.
Overall productivity continued to improve, with employee numbers down by
1,500 to 191,200 over the year to September.
However, Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcel delivery division, went
deeper into the red, reporting pre-tax losses up from Pounds 17m to Pounds
28m.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, blamed Parcelforce's problems on the
intensity of competition in the parcels market, where the Post Office
competes with more than 400 private companies.
The Post Office told the government it needed to invest Pounds 400m this
year to modernise its plant, but was allowed only Pounds 320m.
Referring to the increase in the government levy on the Post Office, from
Pounds 66m two years ago to Pounds 226m this year, Mr Heron said: 'The
government should be ashamed of taking this level of profit out without
allowing us the necessary investment for the future.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Toyota hit by falling demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker-than-expected demand for new cars in Europe means Toyota will not use
the full capacity of 100,000 cars a year at its Burnaston plant near Derby
next year, contrary to plan, the company said yesterday.
It now plans to produce 90,000 cars next year, compared with a projected
85,000 this year. 'However, as we have seen this year, which started
strongly but then slowed more recently, the market is very changeable and
our production levels next year may be amended accordingly,' said Mr
Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of Toyota UK.
Toyota's announcement, the failure of Nissan this year to meet earlier
output projections for its plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, and
relatively slow growth in output of Honda's production plant at Swindon in
Wiltshire indicate that other European carmakers' fears about sales of cars
from Japanese 'transplants' may have been over-stated.
Nissan is expected to produce about 200,000 cars this year, compared with
earlier forecasts of 230,000 to 240,000.
Honda, which is preparing production of a second car at a 100,000
units-a-year capacity plant at Swindon, built 29,300 Accord models in the
first nine months of this year.
Mr Hirano rejected speculation that Toyota has decided to delay outline
plans to double capacity at Burnaston.
'As we have said from the outset, we will monitor the market as it develops
to determine when to move to phase two and 200,000 cars a year,' he said

FT  15 DEC 94 / Charities to get tax plan exclusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday promised to alter the finance bill to exclude
charities and their subsidiaries from provisions announced in the Budget to
close a loophole used by some foreign companies with subsidiaries in the UK,
Jim Kelly writes.
Charities expressed their concern after the Budget that they appeared to be
caught by the provisions and could face big tax bills as a result of new
rules on 'thin capitalisation'.
Under the new rules UK subsidiaries would no longer be able to avoid
corporation tax by using profits to make interest payments. These have not
previously been taxable. The plan to tax such payments would affect UK
companies only where the company receiving the interest was not paying
corporation tax.
Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, in a reply to a
written parliamentary question, said: 'The thin capitalisation proposals
were not intended to have an adverse effect on the voluntary sector.
'It is now apparent that, in some cases, they could do so. I therefore
intend amending the provision at the committee stage of the finance bill to
exclude charities and their subsidiaries from its scope.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Anonymity for lottery winners thrown into uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's High Court ruling that the Pounds 17.9m winner of the National
Lottery can be named has cast a cloud over the ability of Camelot, the
National Lottery operator, to protect the identity of jackpot winners who
wish to remain anonymous.
The ruling, by Sir John Wood, came just 24 hours after another High Court
judge imposed the gagging order on the press. It confounded some media
lawyers who had been predicting earlier in the day that the temporary
injunction was likely to be made permanent next week.
At a brief private hearing on Tuesday evening, at which the newspapers were
not present, Camelot is believed to have argued that publication of the
winner's name against his wishes would have amounted to a breach of
confidence.
Under the rules set by the National Lottery regulator, the identity of a
lottery winner is treated as confidential information. Camelot is prevented
from revealing any personal details about a winner unless it has that
person's prior written consent.
Courts have shown in the past that they are prepared to stop newspapers from
disclosing confidential information where it has been obtained in
circumstances such that the press knew it was confidential or private.
Lawyers said both the Sun and Daily Mirror knew the winner had requested
anonymity and therefore that his identity was confidential information
between him and Camelot.
In deciding whether to grant the injunction the judge had to weigh the
public interest in upholding the right to protect private information
against the public interest in knowing his identity.
The judge on Tuesday was persuaded that Camelot at least had an arguable
case and should be granted the ban. But at a two-hour private hearing
yesterday, Sir John Wood decided there was no legal basis for granting an
injunction.
Publication of details about the winner's job, family and the fact that he
lived in the north of England meant his identity was already 'substantially
in the public domain', the judge said. There was therefore no point in
continuing the ban.
Had the injunction been upheld the newspapers would have faced heavy fines
and the possible imprisonment of their editors for contempt of court if they
had decided to go ahead and publish the winner's name.
Now that the injunction has been lifted they are free to identify him. But
in view of the fact that they had already indicated before Camelot obtained
the gagging order that they would respect the winner's request for
anonymity, the judge ordered the National Lottery operator to pay the
newspapers' costs of challenging the ban. These are estimated at Pounds
5,000.
Camelot has indicated that it will not appeal. Lawyers said last night that
if the court ruling was allowed to stand it must cast doubt on the lottery
operator's ability to protect the privacy of winners who request anonymity
as it is required to do under the terms of its licence.
The court's decision also appeared to be a slap in the face for the lottery
regulator, Mr Peter Davis, who last night acknowledged he had no powers to
prevent members of the public or the media revealing a winner's identity.
He said he had no evidence that Camelot had breached the terms of its
licence but in view of allegations made against the company, he would be
carrying out an investigation of its handling of the affair.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Curbs on rogue traders planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director-general of fair trading may be given more powers to deal with
rogue traders, the government said yesterday.
A consultation paper from the Department of Trade and Industry outlines
proposals to speed up action against traders whose conduct is unfair or
detrimental to consumers.
The 1973 Fair Trading Act places the director-general under an obligation to
act against unscrupulous traders. But the legislation is widely thought to
be ineffective.
The proposals to tighten the law have been put forward by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, after a review of legislation.
Sir Bryan wants to change the requirement in the act that a trader must have
'persisted' in a course of conduct before action is taken against him, and
to amend the procedures for gathering information or documentation when such
action is contemplated.
He has also called for the law to be extended to cover deceptive, misleading
or oppressive conduct by traders, which may not in itself be unlawful. In
place of his duty to seek assurances, Sir Bryan wants the power to issue
warning notices to traders requiring that unfair conduct detrimental to
consumers be discontinued.
Sir Bryan welcomed the government's decision to consult on his proposals. He
said: 'I have been concerned for some time that many instances of deceitful
or oppressive behaviour cannot be tackled under my current powers. The
victims of such behaviour are often vulnerable or elderly people.'
Sir Bryan wants to stamp out such practices as using high-pressure
techniques to sell burglar alarms. OFT investigations have revealed that
salesmen prey on the fears of potential purchasers, submitting them to up to
nine hours of high-pressure selling.
The government said it recognised there were arguments for improving
consumer protection. But it was concerned that the concepts of deceptive,
misleading or oppressive behaviour might be unduly subjective as they would
apply to conduct which was not unlawful.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Eurosceptics set out poll plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party's Euro-rebels yesterday launched a new challenge to
the government by setting out plans for a private member's bill proposing a
referendum on the UK's future in Europe.
The bill, proposed by Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, would require
the government to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Union
before the 1996 inter-governmental conference.
Mrs Gorman's bill, which could be debated in the Commons within eight weeks,
may create new embarrassment for Mr John Major's government amid signs that
it will gain cross-party support.
In recent weeks speculation that there will be a referendum on the next
stage of European integration has grown because Mr Major has refused to rule
one out.
However, pro-European members of the cabinet, including Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, have reacted sceptically to the idea of a referendum, saying
that the agenda of the inter-governmental conference in 1996 is still
undecided.
The bill proposes a consultative referendum - which would not be binding on
the government - by the end of March 1996. Voters would be asked to endorse
one of three outcomes: that the UK 'remain in the Union, but only so long as
it remains an economic organisation of member states'; that it adhere to a
federal organisation with a common currency; or that it 'withdraw altogether
from the union'.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Yeo heads Conservative backers of energy bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government could face a new rebellion by its own backbenchers early next
year after five Tory MPs put their names to a controversial private member's
bill to improve energy conservation.
The MPs - who include Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister -
yesterday emerged as co-sponsors of a bill which would force local
authorities to improve energy conservation in residential properties.
The legislation is being proposed by Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat
MP for Christchurch, who came first in a ballot for private member's bills
earlier this year.
The bill is to receive its first debate - and second reading - in the
Commons on January 20. The Department of Environment has not yet announced
whether it will try to block the measure, but similar legislation - proposed
by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon Tweed - was
opposed by government whips last year.
Preliminary details of the bill were formally notified to the Commons clerks
yesterday. Apart from Mr Yeo, the four Tory MPs sponsoring the measure are
Mr Peter Bottomley, Sir Richard Body, Mr Peter Temple Morris, and Mr Gary
Waller.
The legislation would require local authorities to draw up energy
conservation plans for their areas and promote the more efficient use of
natural resources.
However, Treasury officials may insist that the government should oppose the
plans on the grounds that they will impose an unnecessary burden on public
expenditure.
Mr Yeo said last night that he had notified Mr Robert Jones, the environment
minister, that he would be supporting the bill.
He said: 'There was a bill in the last session which the government did
resist. But our hope is that the modifications this time will stop it being
obstructed.'
The Green party said yesterday that it would closely watch the debate to see
how the five Conservative sponsors voted.
Mr David Taylor, the Green party's principal speaker, said: 'We will be
scrutinising Hansard to ensure that those MPs that have promised
constituents their support of this bill will not be ratting on their
promises.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Former defence secretary to lead security committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tom King, a former Conservative defence secretary, was yesterday
appointed chairman of a cross-party parliamentary committee set up to
monitor the security services.
The committee, set up under the Intelligence Services Act, establishes a
measure of parliamentary control for the first time over the three security
services - MI5, the domestic intelligence service, MI6, its overseas
equivalent, and GCHQ, the electronic monitoring centre at Cheltenham.
The committee will scrutinise the expenditure, administration and policy of
the security services, but not operational planning or activities.
The committee, appointed by Mr John Major after consultation with Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader, comprises five Conservatives, three Labour MPs and
a Liberal Democrat.
The opposition members are: Mr Allan Rogers, a frontbench Labour spokesman
on foreign affairs; Mr Barry Jones, a former Labour Welsh office minister;
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader; and Dr John Gilbert, a
former Labour transport minister. The Tories are: Mr King; Lord Howe, former
deputy prime minister; Sir Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister; Sir
Giles Shaw, a former trade and industry minister; and Mr Michael Mates, a
former Northern Ireland office minister.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Concern at small business bank bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street banks may have overcharged as many as 10 per cent of small and
medium-sized businesses by up to Pounds 1.75bn, according to the Banking
Liaison Group.
The group of former bankers, which advises businesses on their relationships
with banks, called yesterday for each bank to appoint a senior executive to
work with the group and similar organisations to resolve complaints which
could not be dealt with at branch level.
Mr John Sillett, group chief executive, said banks often admitted their
errors but were more unwilling to accept responsibility for consequential
losses or damage to a company's reputation.
'With over 3.5m businesses in Britain, that means some 350,000 may have been
overcharged,' Mr Sillett said. 'Banks do make mistakes and should be ready
to admit them.'
Complaints by businesses made up about 20 per cent of the total complaints
to the banking ombudsman this year, according to the scheme's annual report.
The British Bankers' Association, which represents the sector, rejected the
group's figures.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Blair wins backing over Clause IV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's National Executive Committee voted overwhelmingly yesterday to hold
a special conference on plans by Mr Tony Blair, the party's leader, to dump
the Clause IV commitment to nationalisation, heading off the prospect of an
effective leftwing revolt.
The NEC agreed by 20 votes to three to Mr Blair's request for a special
conference in London on April 29, after five months of consultation with
party members by a team led by Mr John Prescott, the party's deputy leader.
The special conference will take place before most of the party's affiliated
trade unions hold their annual conferences, preventing union militants from
attempting to mandate their leaders to vote against Mr Blair's proposals.
The conference will be asked to vote on a single proposal for an updated
Clause IV to be drawn up by the NEC, which is overwhelmingly sympathetic to
Mr Blair's plans to modernise the party.
The proposal is likely to include a commitment to a dynamic market economy -
regarded by some leftwingers as a betrayal of Labour's history. Officials
said there would be no vote on alternative proposals.
As expected, the proposal for a special conference was strongly opposed by
Mr Dennis Skinner and Ms Diane Abbott, two leftwing MPs elected to the
executive at October's annual conference in Blackpool.
They were joined by Ms Clare Short, a moderate leftwinger, reflecting
widespread concern on the left of the party at the leadership's tight grip
on the reform process. Ms Short said the decision should be left to the next
annual conference.
Underlining the growing unease, the European Labour Forum yesterday sent a
questionnaire to all 634 Labour constituency parties in an attempt to
demonstrate lack of grassroots support for Mr Blair's proposals.
The forum, which groups leftwing Labour members of the European parliament,
described Clause IV in a letter as a 'landmark statement' and declared that
'capitalism is no less dangerous now to human freedom than it ever was'.
Mr Blair told the NEC that the government was preparing to launch a personal
campaign against him in the new year.
'It is vital in the next few months that we define our aims and values and
present them clearly to the electorate. The time is right to convert the
extensive opposition to the Tories into positive support for Labour,' he
said.

FT  15 DEC 94 / DIY chain faces kitchen refunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of an insurance company has left Texas Homecare, the DIY
retailer owned by Ladbroke group, facing the possibility of having to hand
money back to customers who bought kitchens from it in 1992.
To boost the sale of kitchens during the recession, Texas launched a
promotion promising customers their money back in 10 years' time if they
bought Wrighton kitchens worth up to Pounds 1,500.
A percentage of the retail price was invested in a trust fund in Jersey to
provide funds for customers who remembered to claim their money back in
2002.
However, Texas had insured itself against the possibility of claims
exceeding the proceeds of the trust fund with MGI, an insurance company
which recently failed.
Texas is now taking legal action against the trust fund - run by the Royal
Bank of Canada group - and brokers who advised it on which company to insure
with. It wants them to shoulder the cost of any excess claims at the end of
the 10-year period.
Texas said yesterday: 'The trust fund was based on a calculation by
actuaries of the number of people likely to come back in 2002 and ask for
their money back. But the insurance against excess claims turns out to have
been placed with a lesser-rated insurance company.'
The DIY retailer could not provide figures for the number of customers who
had taken up the special offer - although the then chairman Mr Ron Trenter
said at the time that kitchen sales had tripled. Texas said yesterday the
amount of money involved was 'not material as far as the company is
concerned'.
It said the offer, a promotional method which originated in the US, had run
for only a few months in 1992, and this was the only time Texas had used
this method.
It added: 'This was effectively just another deep discount offer.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Tube contract winner pledges efficiency rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC-Alsthom, winner of an Pounds 800m contract to supply new trains for
London Underground's Northern Line, has promised to provide an eightfold
increase in the reliability of its trains, it emerged yesterday.
If the conditions are not met, London Underground can reduce payments and,
in the worst case, demand that the Anglo-French engineering group take back
its trains.
The Treasury hailed the deal, announced last Thursday, as a considerable
success for the private finance initiative, because it transferred
significant risks to the company. GEC-Alsthom will supply more than 100
trains and maintain them for 20 years.
London Underground will pay between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m a year to
cover the capital cost of the trains and the maintenance charges. At the end
of 20 years it has an option to extend the contract for a further 16 years.
At present London Underground expects its Northern Line trains to break
down, on average, every 2,500 miles, or 2 1/2 weeks. GEC-Alsthom has said
its trains will only fail every 19,000 miles, or four months.
This is a near eightfold improvement on past performance and almost four
times better than the best results achieved on other Underground lines.
Maintaining this level of service would be demanding but it was regarded as
feasible, London Underground said.
If the new trains fall far below the promised reliability, London
Underground can at any time cease making lease payments and arrange for the
return of the trains to the manufacturer. After 12 years it can review the
performance of the trains and, if it is unhappy, return them to GEC-Alsthom.
At the end of the 20-year contract GEC-Alsthom will have received only
two-thirds of the capital value of the trains - though they will be fully
paid for after 36 years. This formula means that GEC-Alsthom has an
incentive to provide a good level of service to encourage London Underground
to extend the contract.
GEC-Alsthom will also receive a small payment related to the number of
passengers using the Northern Line although this is not significant in the
overall contract.

Mr Alan Milburn, a Labour MP who is a member of the Public Accounts

FT  15 DEC 94 / Political Notebook: Referendum herd runs risks of a stampede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The herd instinct has always been one of the most powerful forces in
politics. Nowhere is it stronger these days than in the Tory party. The
debate about a referendum on the next steps towards European integration
(whatever they might turn out to be) is a textbook case of how easily
fashion can displace reason.
It is fair to say that sometime in the next few years political imperatives
 -whether party divisions or the mood in the country - might demand a direct
test of the electorate's attitude to Europe. There are perfectly respectable
intellectual reasons for occasional referendums. No one can doubt that a
decision, say, to enter a single European currency would be one of
constitutional moment.
Nor should we be naive about the politics. The then Mr Harold Wilson used a
referendum on Britain's membership of the then Common Market to prevent a
schism in his Labour government. But the outcome - skilfully engineered by
one of most politically astute prime ministers this century - served the
country well.
Of course there are drawbacks. The hangers and floggers who still inhabit
the fringes of politics are forever looking for ways to mobilise the
electorate's instincts for revenge. Any precedent for a plebiscite will do.
Then there are the dreamers in the thinktanks. Unable to imagine a coherent
model for a modern parliamentary system of government, they see referendums
as a populist wheeze to redistribute political power. Press a button on your
remote control and, hey presto, you have instant democracy. Apparently in
the electronic age there is no need to worry about the tyranny of the
majority.
But back to the present debate in the Tory party. The idea of a referendum -
whether on the 1996 intergovernmental conference or on a subsequent move to
economic and monetary union - was born among the Eurosceptics. Now almost
everyone wants one.
Europhiles see a plebiscite as the way to mobilise the natural pro-European
majority in the House of Commons across party divides. The 'phobes insist
that it will tie Mr Major's hands at the 1996 intergovernmental conference.
Failing that, it would ensure that any concessions made by Mr Major to the
wicked federalists could be reversed by the voters. Finally, uncommitted
Tory backbenchers - a dying breed - see the government heading for
self-destruction. They venture that any straw is worth clutching at.
The clamour is in inverse proportion to the logic of the proposition.
Deciding now to have a referendum on a question that cannot yet be put is a
recipe not for a truce but for a still more protracted civil war. The
European Movement, home of the Tory Europhiles, has already fired the
opening shots of its campaign to secure a Yes-to-anything vote.
Mrs Teresa Gorman has done the same for the sceptics with the launch of a
private member's bill demanding a referendum before 1996. The choices she
offers as a test of public opinion - withdrawal from the EU, the full
federal package (whatever that is), or a simple free trade relationship -
are ample testimony to the difficulties of framing a useful question.
One or two have not joined the stampede. Mr Kenneth Clarke, once again in
powerful pro-European alliance with Mr Michael Heseltine, has applied the
brakes to the shift in the prime minister's stance. The chancellor thinks
the idea is barmy.
The thoughtful among the sceptics - notably Mr Michael Portillo - share his
doubts. The outcome of any referendum will depend more on the economic cycle
and on the popularity of the government than on the merits of the argument.
Nor it is likely that a Tory cabinet could be allowed the freedom of
conscience that Mr Wilson gave his ministers in 1975.
Mr Portillo understands that the promise of a referendum might strengthen
rather than weaken the hands of the pro-European camp. Much better for the
sceptics to nail Mr Major to a sufficiently minimalist line to ensure
Britain agrees to nothing worth putting to the electorate.
But most dangerously, the promise now of a referendum in the distant future
would entrench the factionalism which has taken hold in the Tory party. It
is already clear that Europe has become a convenient surrogate for a series
of private wars on the Tory backbenches. The depth of antagonism between
left and right, between pro- and anti-Europeans and between friends and
enemies of the prime minister has become more important than the issues at
stake.
Principles have been buried in personal animosities. To find a voice in the
Tory party these days it is essential to belong to one of these armed camps.
The parallel with the factionalism that destroyed Labour's hopes of
government in the early 1980s grows ever stronger. Pledging a referendum on
Europe might buy Mr Major a breathing space. It will not be enough to halt
the headlong rush of the Tory herd to the edge of a political cliff.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Aircraft project decision criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government decision not to support the European Future Large Aircraft
project could allow Germany to overtake the UK as the world leader in
wing-design technology, says a study published yesterday.
The project is the rival to the US Hercules C130J as the replacement for the
RAF's Hercules transport fleet.
The academic study, commissioned by the Western Development Partnership, an
economic regeneration agency based in Avon, examined the significance of
British Aerospace's 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus consortium.
It said the UK government's failure to take up the 37.5 per cent stake
originally on offer would, by 2010, have cost the country Pounds 18bn of
business and thousands of jobs.
BAe's design team, the study said, faced a wait of six years before the next
generation of Airbus required major wing development. The FLA design would
fill that gap and provide substantial work for other UK companies.

FT  15 DEC 94 / BR forecasts shake-out of train operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's railway network could be owned in 10 years by three or four large
companies that have made a speciality of acquiring and operating franchises,
Mr Roger Salmon, BR franchising director, forecast yesterday.
Mr Salmon, whose task is to auction off the franchises of the 25 passenger
train operating companies, unveiled details of the first eight companies to
be sold. He also explained the rules that would apply to the timetables,
fares and tickets to be offered by the privatised railway businesses.
Bidders will be allowed to acquire more than one franchise as long this does
not lead to a reduction in competition on the network, Mr Salmon said.
Companies specialising in running train services are expected to emerge to
bid for new franchises when existing ones lapse.
Mr Salmon insisted yesterday that his passenger service requirements would
maintain a level of services 'based on the current structure'.
Operators would be expected to maintain - and would be subsidised to run -
at least 70 per cent of existing InterCity services, 90 per cent of commuter
services and 'practically 100 per cent' of rural services.
However, sleeper services between London and Fort William and between
Plymouth and Glasgow/Edinburgh would no longer be guaranteed.
'We will subsidise a good level of service and above that leave it to the
market,' he said, adding that there would be a strong commercial incentive
to run more trains.
But Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, said Mr Salmon's
timetables would lead to cuts in services. 'When this government places a
minimum requirement you can bet it will be a minimum service,' he said.
Fears that the government subsidy of Pounds 1.7bn a year would be reduced
were dismissed by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary. 'I can confirm
that subsidy will continue to be available,' he said.
Management buy-out teams and commercial organisations wanting to bid for
franchises will be expected to pre-qualify by March and to make firm bids
next summer. The sale of the first six should be concluded by the end of
1995.
Midland Main Line, which runs services between London and Leeds, and Network
SouthCentral, which operates routes between London and the south coast, have
been added to the original list of six franchises announced last year.
Mr Salmon also invited proposals on arranging the franchising of the west
coast main line, the future of which has been complicated by plans for an
Pounds 800m upgrade.
The initial six to be franchised in the first round were Great Western,
Gatwick Express, East Coast Main Line, London, Tilbury and Southend,
ScotRail, and South West Trains.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Animal haulage laws reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, introduced fresh
legislation yesterday to improve the welfare of live animals in transit to
the Continent following the failure of European Union ministers to agree
controls on the trade.
The national measures, which come into force on January 23, make it a
criminal offence to breach journey plans that must accompany animals on
trips longer than 15 hours.
'We cannot do nothing because Europe cannot agree. That's why we are now
pressing ahead with our own measures to fill the gap,' Mr Waldegrave said,
after ministers abandoned plans on Tuesday to agree rules which could be
enforced throughout the EU.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said yesterday
that the legislation did little to remove its opposition to the
cross-Channel trade. 'It still leaves millions of animals with long journey
times,' it said.
The RSPCA wants the EU to introduce a maximum journey time of eight hours,
but Mr Waldegrave's new legislation states only that animals should be fed
and watered after 15 hours. The RSPCA's opposition to the transport of live
animals has convinced Britain's ferry companies to ban the carriage of
livestock for slaughter.
The ferry companies said yesterday that they were still studying the
legislation, but had so far found little in it to change their minds. 'The
issue is about what happens to animals on the . . . Continent and whether
this can be enforced over there,' said an official at P&amp;O.
Mr Waldegrave said he had agreements from the French, Dutch and Spanish
authorities to provide information towards the prosecution of offenders. But
the RSPCA believes it would be impossible to enforce the measures on the
Continent.
The new rules mean animal hauliers could be jailed or fined up to Pounds
5,000 if they break journey plans for trips of more than 15 hours.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Labour awaits Dudley's verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electors of Dudley West will today give the new Labour party of Mr Tony
Blair the first indication of how successful it has been in trying to
convince longstanding Conservative voters that it is the most reliable
guardian of their interests.
The result of the by-election in the West Midlands constituency will
indicate the depth of the loyalty of voters who turned towards the
Conservatives between 1979 and 1987, when the Tory majority increased from
1,139 to 10,224.
Opinion polls during the campaign have suggested that the Conservative share
of the vote could drop from 48.8 per cent, recorded at the 1992 general
election, to about 20 per cent.
But Conservative and Labour officials have responded cautiously to the
polls. One side is anxious to keep up morale, the other to dampen
expectation of a landslide. Both agree that their ability to bring out the
vote, at an unfriendly time of the year for a by-election, is crucial.
The constituency is one of the more prosperous in the Midlands with
owner-occupier rates in line with the leafy dormitory towns of south-east
England. It was 54th on Labour's list of seats necessary to win the last
general election. In the event, Dr John Blackburn, whose death in October
caused the by-election, held it with a majority of 5,789.
The campaign has attracted the participation of more senior members of the
Labour party than senior members of the government. They played their part -
twice in the case of Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott, his deputy - in the
usual by-election rituals: canvassing, leaflet-dropping, personal
appearances in the hope of attracting a television camera and political
argument by press conference.
The conduct of the rituals has been generally well-mannered. Both
Conservatives and Labour claim to have spent their time arguing the national
issues of the day.
This, with the exception of the Conservative attempt to pin the label of
militant on Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, and to bring specifically
local issues such as Dudley car-parking charges into the campaign, is a fair
claim.
But for the government Dudley West has been put in the shade by embarrassing
events at Westminster - the row over value added tax, the European
arguments, the mini-Budget. The constituency has been a local outpost of the
national debate. So the Tories inevitably looked for issues to spice the
campaign and to take themselves off the defensive.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Welsh agency's grant halved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has halved the grant in aid of the Welsh
Development Agency to Pounds 25m. The agency's budget for 1995-96 has been
set at Pounds 153m. For the next two years the agency will raise most of the
money it needs from sales of Pounds 180m of land and property sales.
Total standard spending for local authorities in Wales has been set at
Pounds 2.77bn, an increase of 2.7 per cent. The Council of Welsh Districts
last night forecast that this would mean council taxes would rise on average
by 10 per cent to 11 per cent.
Mr Redwood has ordered a 15 per cent cut in administrative costs at the
Welsh Office over the next three years and around 400 jobs are to be shed.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Amtrak plans to cut services and workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amtrak, the US government-owned passenger rail company, yesterday announced
plans to cut its workforce by a quarter and shut 21 per cent of its routes
in an effort to drag itself out of the red for the first time in six years.
The Amtrak board approved elimination of three main routes in the west and
midwest, shutdown of segments of 10 other routes and frequency cuts on other
routes - including even Amtrak's flagship Metroliner service between
Washington and New York.
Cuts will be phased in from April next year, and will lead to elimination of
about 5,400 jobs - including 600 management jobs which the company has
already said it would cut.
Mr Tom Downs, Amtrak's president, said the cuts would reduce revenue by
Dollars 66m (Pounds 42.3m) a year but cut expenses by Dollars 430m. Even
though phased in, he said, they should produce a balanced budget by the end
of this fiscal year on September 30. Without the changes, Mr Downs said,
Amtrak faced a Dollars 200m cash shortfall this year, despite an Dollars
822m federal government subsidy.
Amtrak was created in 1971 with what was intended to be a once-and-for-all
subsidy of Dollars 140m and a mandate to 'operate rail service on a
for-profit basis. It has since cost taxpayers about Dollars 16bn.
The company said yesterday its financial weakness was attributable to 'an
undercapitalised system being spread too thin, trying to provide more
service than the corporation is capable of providing, and to brutal price
competition from the airlines.'
This ought to be the best of times for Amtrak: frequent air crashes,
especially of smaller commuter airlines, should have presented a golden
opportunity to win passengers back - although Amtrak has had its own share
of crashes in recent years.
However, the number of travellers fell by about 300,000 last year to 22m and
it faces increasing demands from the freight companies over whose tracks it
runs.
Amtrak has also been obliged to keep open many unprofitable routes.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan trade barriers cost consumers
'Dollars 75bn a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade barriers cost Japanese consumers between Dollars 75bn and
Dollars 100bn at prevailing exchange rates in 1989 - or between 2.6 per cent
and 3.8 per cent of gross national product - according to a study by three
Japanese economists.
Without the barriers, Japanese imports of the most highly protected
products, such as food, cosmetics and chemicals, would have doubled and each
Japanese consumer would have been about Dollars 890 a year better off at
1989 exchange rates, the study says.
Complete trade liberalisation would have resulted in a fall in domestic
production of more than 20 per cent in certain sectors, including wheat,
oilseeds, leaf tobacco, canned fruit and vegetables, and cosmetics.
However, the authors say removal of import barriers would have only a small
impact on Japan's trade surplus, because a reallocation of resources and
macro-economic forces would cause its exports to rise almost as fast as
imports.
Liberalisation would also result in the loss of 180,000 jobs. Although
roughly 10 per cent of employment in the protected sectors, this is only 0.3
per cent of total Japanese employment.
Furthermore, the cost to the Japanese economy of preserving each job was
about Dollars 94,000 a year in 1989, almost three times the earnings of an
average salaried worker in Japan.
The estimates are much higher than those in similar previous analyses
because the study is the first to try to calculate the impact of non-tariff
barriers.
These are a far more important form of protection than tariffs in Japan and
raise prices by more than 400 per cent in some cases, the study says. It
says that although Japan has liberalised some trade barriers since 1989, the
restrictive effect of remaining protection appears to have increased in the
past five years.
The study is based on a comparison between the unit values on a cif
(carriage, insurance, freight) basis of imports landed at Japanese ports and
of Japanese producer prices for more than 40 categories of goods.
It puts the unit value differential for all products surveyed at 178 per
cent, and at 281 per cent for food and beverages.
The highest differentials for individual products are 737 per cent for rice,
718 per cent for tea and roasted coffee and 662 per cent for cosmetics and
toiletries.
In most cases, the study says, the differentials are largely caused by
non-tariff barriers such as import quotas, preferential government
procurement, price support programmes and restrictions on domestic sales.
However, it finds that a 607 per cent differential for radio and television
sets is mainly due to the superior quality and technological sophistication
of Japanese-produced products compared with imports.
Most of the value of the differentials is pocketed by Japanese producers.
After allowing for the losses to producers, importers, distributors and
government revenue, trade liberalisation would have benefited the Japanese
economy by at least Dollars 17.4bn in 1989, the study estimates.

FT  15 DEC 94 / US inflation tepid despite rapid growth
</HEADLINE>

   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer price inflation remains subdued despite further evidence of
robust economic growth, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Labour Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent last month and
by 2.7 per cent in the year to November - in line with market projections.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components and thus provides a better guide to underlying trends, rose only
0.1 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent on an annual comparison.
Over the past three months core consumer prices have been even better
behaved, rising at only 2.3 per cent a year.
The encouraging inflation figures were not expected to dissuade the Federal
Reserve from pushing short-term interest rates higher in coming months,
although they reduced pressure for a rise next week.
Separate figures from the Federal Reserve yesterday indicated the economy
was rapidly absorbing spare productive capacity. Industrial production rose
0.5 per cent last month, bringing the gain in the past year to 5.7 per cent.
Manufacturing output rose 0.8 per cent last month and by 6.7 per cent on an
annual basis. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose to 84.4
per cent, well above the long-run average. Production gains were broadly
based with output of consumer goods, business equipment and construction
supplies rising 0.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively
last month.
Figures yesterday also showed a small increase in the current account
deficit to Dollars 41.7bn (Pounds 26.7bn) in the third quarter from Dollars
37.9bn in the second period.
While agreeing that immediate prospects for economic growth and inflation
are excellent, many US forecasters have reservations about the outlook for
1995.

Canada and the US will soon announce a new 'consultative mechanism' to head
off potential disputes over softwood timber. Under the bilateral pact,
Canadian softwood construction timber exports to the US will not attract
import penalties and the US timber industry will be able to examine how
Canadian provinces, especially British Columbia, levy cutting royalties and
fees. The US industry has argued for years that some Canadian provinces
charge low royalties and give their producers an unfair advantage in the US
market. Canada exports more than Dollars 4bn of softwood timber a year to
the US, Asia and Europe. Government officials will meet regularly to monitor
bilateral timber trade. The pact will enable the US to return Dollars 600m
in duties collected after imposing a 6.5 per cent countervailing duty on
Canadian softwood in 1992.

Taiwan's motorcycle manufacturers, the world's second biggest, expect to
export more motorcycles to China to meet surging demand there. 'We plan to
export half of our annual production next year, and most of this to mainland
China,' said Mr Wang Shuang-ching, president of Kwang Yang Motor, Taiwan's
leading motorcycle maker, which expects sales of 700,000 motorcycles in
1995, up from 500,000 this year. Taiwan's motorcycle sales reached 1.49m in
1993, ranking second only to Japan. Of these 1993 sales, 20.9 per cent were
exported, considerably higher than the 3.9 per cent of the 1.1m sold in
1989. Motorcycle exports to China accounted for 69 per cent of motor cycle
exports last year. The rest were to south-east Asian and some European
countries.

BAT Industries and Turkey's state tobacco company, Tekel, are to form a
joint venture managed by the UK group to make cigarettes in Turkey. BAT will
invest a substantial sum to turn Tekel's plant at Akhisar into a modern
facility capable of supplying a large share of the market, according to a
memorandum of agreement signed by the two. The joint venture will make
several Tekel brands and a range of BAT's international brands such as Kent,
Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. In common with other international companies,
BAT has been pushing into countries opening their markets to foreign
investment. It has, for example, completed deals in five former Soviet bloc
countries. When investment in the five countries is completed in five years,
BAT's annual manufacturing capacity will rise by 100bn cigarettes from 540bn
now.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Collor written back into Brazil soap: Critics and reformers
see ex-president's acquittal as setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The case of Mr Fernando Collor, jet setting Brazilian president who quit in
1992 amid corruption allegations, has often been likened to one of the
country's novelas, or TV soap operas. With the Supreme Court's decision on
Monday to throw out the charges, Mr Collor has been written back into the
script.
The court's decision greatly increases Mr Collor's chances of staging a
political comeback and running again for public office. If successful, he
would provide a reminder to Brazil's Congress and judicial systems of how
much remains to be done for the country's political process to be modernised
and corruption weeded out.
Senator Dirceu Carneiro, who two years ago served notice on Mr Collor that
impeachment proceedings were under way, said the court ruling was a serious
setback in the country's attempts to tackle impunity: 'Brazil has always
suffered from an inability to punish the powerful. After several years of
progress, this ruling is very worrying.'
Mr Collor resigned just before Congress completed the impeachment
proceedings against him. He faced a single charge of 'passive corruption'
which alleged he and his campaign treasurer Mr Paulo Cesar Farias had
swapped political influence for financial gain. Although Mr Farias was given
a seven years' prison sentence for setting up false bank accounts through
which funds were channelled, the court decided there was insufficient
evidence to link Mr Collor to Mr Farias' activities.
Mr Collor has consistently claimed he was victim of a political plot. The
court's decision will let him maintain the claim, even though most
Brazilians remain convinced Mr Collor did use the president's office for
personal gain. In an opinion poll conducted before the trial, 60 per cent of
people asked said they thought he should go to jail for his actions,
although nearly 90 per cent thought he would not have to.
Mr Alexandre Barros, a political consultant, said: 'If you belong to the
elites, like Mr Collor does, you get judged by your peers and get off, while
people from outside the elites like PC Farias get punished.' Armed with the
court's ruling Mr Collor may appeal against a separate Senate ban on his
holding public office until the year 2000. Even If the appeal fails, Mr
Collor would still be young enough to compete in the 2002 presidential and
gubernatorial elections.
According to rumours in the capital Braslia, Mr Collor plans to visit New
York to meet his younger brother, Pedro, who first triggered the corruption
scandal with a series of allegations in a magazine interview.
The two brothers have not talked since, but Pedro is extremely ill with
cancer. Fernando, who has always been an expert at political marketing, may
want to use the reconciliation as part of a wider reconstruction of his
image in the Brazilian media.
'The 70 per cent of the electorate who lack a decent education will love it,
because it is straight out of a novela,' says Mr Luiz Pedone, a political
scientist at Brasilia University. He adds that Mr Collor's current high
unpopularity will fade. Although Brazil may never be ready to elect Mr
Collor as president again, he could easily win the governorship or a senate
seat in his home state, Alagoas.
The biggest casualty of the court's decision is likely to be the confidence
of those seeking to modernise Brazil's political system. Mr Collor's removal
from office was seen as the most important example of progress, under way
since the country's return to democracy in 1985. 'It now seems the optimism
that we had started to tackle corruption was false,' according to says Mr
Pedone.
The tide of pessimism triggered by the ruling may hide an important lesson,
that tackling corruption will take many years rather than one ousted
president. Observers say that while Brazilian corruption is no worse than in
many countries, what makes Brazil's version so corrosive is that the
country's institutions, still maturing after the years of military rule,
allow a sense of impunity to prevail.

A judge in New Orleans yesterday deferred a decision on a landmark lawsuit
against the US tobacco industry, saying he wanted more information about how
the plaintiffs would pursue their multi-billion dollar claims.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs are trying to create a class of present and
former smokers claiming to have been addicted to cigarettes at any time in
the last 50 years. Yesterday they said the damages could range from Dollars
30bn to Dollars 50bn.
Mr John Coale, representing one of the plaintiffs, said outside the court
that if the class included 30m smokers and each were awarded damages of
Dollars 10,000, the damages would reach Dollars 300bn. 'But I don't think
the courts will let someone bankrupt the US tobacco industry,' Mr Coale
said.
At the hearing, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana, the main arguments turned on whether there was enough common
ground between the cases of tens of millions of individual smokers to make a
class action feasible.

FT  15 DEC 94 / US budget drive fizzles out
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A high-powered commission set up to reform entitlement spending and taxation
fizzled out yesterday, unable to agree on a set of concrete proposals to
bring the US government's finances into balance in the next century.
The bipartisan commission, chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey and
retiring Republican Senator Jack Danforth, agreed in August on an interim
report painting a stark picture of spending on entitlements such as social
security pensions or Medicare and Medicaid health programmes. They forecast
that such spending would rise from 47 per cent of the budget in 1993 to eat
up all government revenues by 2030.
But Mr Kerrey and Mr Danforth were unable yesterday to win support for their
proposals, which included an increase in the social security retirement age
to 70, reduced subsidies for Medicare health benefits for the elderly, and
means testing for benefit payments.
Commission members shied away from voting for tough cuts in such politically
sensitive programmes in what congressman Alex McMillan of North Carolina
called 'the current rush to provide more free lunches which is now abroad in
the land'.
Senator Dale Bumpers, another commission member, said the political climate
was not yet right.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: And then there were four - Norway's vote
to stay out of EU has saved Efta from extinction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Free Trade Association (Efta), which next month will lose three
of its seven members and two thirds of its population to the European Union,
can survive in truncated form, ministers of the four remaining nations
decided yesterday.
The association, set up in 1960, was effectively reprieved from execution by
Norway's rejection of EU membership in last month's referendum. It will
nevertheless be a shadow of its former self after Austria, Finland and
Sweden join the EU on January 1.
The Efta population will shrink from 33m to just 11m, comprising two small
nations - Switzerland and Norway - and two tiny ones, Iceland and
Liechtenstein. Norway and Iceland will continue to be members of the
European Economic Area, which ties them into the EU single market, while
Liechtenstein hopes to join the EEA shortly. Swiss voters rejected the EEA
in a referendum two years ago.
Efta ministers meeting in Geneva also agreed yesterday that the Efta court
and the Brussels-based Efta surveillance authority set up to oversee
operation of the EEA will be retained on a smaller scale.
Surprisingly, however, they showed little enthusiasm in encouraging
Slovenia's expressed interest in joining the association. Ministers decided
first to restart negotiations on a free trade accord with Slovenia which
were interrupted when almost complete because of uncertainties over Efta's
future existence.
Consideration of possible Slovenian membership, which would require further
free trade negotiations, has been deferred until early next year.
Efta already has free trade agreements with half a dozen former communist
states as well as Israel and Turkey, and these will continue. There had been
hopes that Efta could find a new role as a 'half-way house' for central and
east European nations preparing to join the EU.
But Mr Kjartan Johannsson, Efta's Icelandic secretary-general, said this
week that apart from Slovenia, whose attempts at forging EU ties are being
blocked by Italy over a property dispute, these countries had shown little
interest in Efta. 'They are focused firmly on the EU and seem to think we
would only be a diversion,' he said.
A final decision on the future size and structure of the Efta secretariat in
Geneva will be made by mid-January, and put into effect by the middle of
next year.
But with finances heavily constrained many, and perhaps the majority, of the
270 staff in Geneva and Brussels look set to lose their jobs.

ready to elect Mr Collor as president again, he could easily win the
governorship or a senate seat in his home state, Alagoas.
Critics say Mr Collor's acquittal further undermines the reputation of
Brazil's prosecution system, which has never been highly respected. Attorney
General and prosecutor Aristides Junquiera was widely felt to have mounted a
poor case. Important evidence for his argument, based on taped phone calls
and computer discs, was ruled to be inadmissible because it had been seized
without a court order as the constitution requires.
Politicians said that the Supreme Court, by rejecting Congress's ruling that
Mr Collor was guilty, was 'divorced' from society. One of the eight judges
who heard the case replied: 'We listen to the law, not public opinion.'
But the biggest casualty of the court's decision is likely to be the
confidence of those seeking to modernise Brazil's political system. Mr
Collor's removal from office was seen as the most important example of
progress, under way since the country's return to democracy in 1985. 'It now

many countries, what makes Brazil's version so corrosive is that the
country's institutions, still maturing after the years of military rule,
allow a sense of impunity to prevail.
They point to the case of Senate president Mr Humberto Lucena who has been
barred from office by the Supreme Court for illegally using the senate
printing press to print calenders distributed free in his election campaign.
The Senate immediately granted Mr Lucena an amnesty for the offence and he
remains in office.
They also point out that outgoing President Itamar Franco, who called on
Brazilians to 'reach their own conclusions' about the court's capabilities,
last month overlooked several qualified jurists for a Supreme Court
nomination and instead appointed a friend, Mr Mauricio Correa. Mr Correa,
while justice minister, is best remembered for getting drunk at this year's
Carnival.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Drive to make cuts in budget fizzles out
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A high-powered commission set up to reform entitlement spending and taxation
fizzled out yesterday, unable to agree on a set of concrete proposals to
bring the US government's finances into balance in the next century.
The bipartisan commission, chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey and
retiring Republican Senator Jack Danforth, agreed in August on an interim
report painting a stark picture of spending on entitlements such as social
security pensions or Medicare and Medicaid health programmes. They forecast
that such spending would rise from 47 per cent of the budget in 1993 to eat
up all government revenues by 2030.
But Mr Kerrey and Mr Danforth were unable yesterday to win support for their
proposals, which included an increase in the social security retirement age
to 70, reduced subsidies for Medicare health benefits for the elderly, and
means testing for benefit payments.
Commission members shied away from voting for tough cuts in such politically
sensitive programmes in what congressman Alex McMillan of North Carolina
called 'the current rush to provide more free lunches which is now abroad in
the land'.
Senator Dale Bumpers, another commission member, said the political climate
was not yet right: 'We all know that the problem is not unsolvable, it is
just politically unpalatable to do it.'
Economists and Federal Reserve officials had hoped that the Kerrey-Danforth
commission might provide political cover for a Congress which has always
been unwilling to touch entitlement spending such as social security,
Medicare or veterans' benefits, which have large and politically vocal
constituencies.
Relatively modest changes to benefits and eligibility could, if launched now
and phased in gradually, have curbed the growth of entitlement spending in
the next century.
In the wake of last month's sweeping Republican election victory, Congress
is expected to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal
budget within seven years.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Europe's biotech sector 'is lagging US
through lack of investment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's biotechnology industry is falling behind its competitors in the US
because of lack of investment and unhelpful regulation, according to
Professor Horst Schlumberger, head of Biotechnology Co-ordination at Bayer,
the German chemicals company.
Mr Schlumberger said that if the current level of investment in Europe was
not reversed, scientific talent would be unable to renew itself. He told
delegates at the second day of a Financial Times biotechnology conference in
London that the consequence would be an erosion of the competitive strength
of Europe's research-dependent industries.
'Europe will become a net importer, not a producer and exporter of products
of modern biotechnology,' he said.
His argument was countered by Mr Jurgen Drews, president of international
research and development at Roche, the Swiss drugs company.
Mr Drews said that European governments spent more than the US on funding
basic research, which forms the foundation for the next series of medical
advances. This meant that the present US lead in biotechnology could be
'eroded over the long term', said Mr Drews.
In a lively debate, Mr Schlumberger said this was like having a modern
luxury limousine parked outside one's home, but the regulatory constraints
in Europe meant 'its fuel is of low quality and it cannot fulfil its
potential.'
In an earlier session, Mr Carl Feldbaum, head of the Washington-based
Biotechnology Industry Organisation, said that Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican
speaker of the House of Representatives, had stated his intention to
dismantle the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA controls which drugs are approved to sale in the US, the world's
biggest medicines market. The FDA has been criticised in the pharmaceuticals
industry and among conservative politicians for its slowness and
bureaucracy.
'Many in the biotechnology industry hope it (the dismantling) comes true,'
said Mr Feldbaum.
But Mr Feldbaum, a former chief-of-staff for Republican senator Arlen
Specter, advised caution. He said there was only a small window of
opportunity for substantive legislation before politicians' attention turned
to the 1996 presidential elections. In his opening address, Mr Drews
forecast that gene therapy, which uses DNA as a medicine, would take the
place of many conventional drugs.
He held out a vision of a drug which need only be taken once a year rather
than daily for diseases such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimers.

South Korea's trade, industry and energy ministry unveiled a draft plan to
reform its heavily controlled oil industry by liberalising prices,
distribution and both export and imports of oil products. Under the plan,
oil refiners, distributors and petrol stations would be allowed to set their
own prices for oil products including petrol, paraffin, gas oil and diesel
oil. 'The timing has not yet been decided. Talks are still under way with
related government offices,' a ministry official said. But Seoul media
predicted prices of oil products would be deregulated from the second half
of next year.

Bahrain police used teargas to disperse small groups of demonstrators two

that tear gas was used on Monday and Tuesday nights against demonstrators in
central Manama and at Qadim, a village about 5km to the west of the capital.
The cause of the demonstrations was not known. Residents said judging by the
authorities' actions at previous such incidents in the small Gulf island
state, most of those arrested would be released soon after questioning. The
residents variously estimated the numbers involved at between 50 and 100 in

Pakistan's ruling and opposition parties temporarily put aside their

in Karachi which has killed at least 93 people in two weeks. The National
Assembly unanimously decided to set up a committee to investigate the causes
and propose remedies to solve the ethnic, sectarian and political violence
in Pakistan's commercial capital.
The rare bipartisan accord came as a Moslem Shia leader warned of a
bloodbath in Karachi unless the government acted in the wake of Tuesday's
killing of three Shias in separate shootings. The violence has gained in
intensity since army troops ended two-and-a-half years of law enforcement
duties in the port city recently.

Japanese corporate collapses may be diminishing, according to the latest
bankruptcy figures. Defunct companies left Y398.8bn (Pounds 2.54bn) worth of
debts last month, down 61 per cent from November 1993, Teikoku Databank, a
credit research agency, said yesterday. Much of that big year-on-year drop
is artificial, due to the fact that November last year saw Japan's biggest
recorded corporate collapse, that of Osaka-based Muramoto Construction, with
debts of Y590bn. Bankruptcy debt also declined in the month from October to
November this year, by 52.8 per cent, though the October figure was also
unusually high, due to the Y518.5bn collapse of Nippon Mortgage, a
medium-sized non-bank financial institution. The number of companies to
collapse rose by 1.6 per cent to 1,195 in the year to last month, but fell
by 2.5 per cent from October to November. Construction continues to be hard
hit, with a 15.7 per cent year on year rise in bankruptcies, while collapses
in manufacturing industry were almost stable - a 0.8 per cent rise.
In another piece of moderately good news for the economy, department store
sales fell by 0.6 per cent in November, the smallest decline in the 33
consecutive months during which sales have fallen.

Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday asked Japan to
contribute Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 192m-Pounds 256m) of capital
for the planned Middle East development bank.
Mr Rabin, who is at the end of a three-day tour, the first official visit to
Japan by an Israeli leader, requested the contribution in talks with Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister. Mr Takemura was unable to give any
indication of further assistance from Japan, which has already pledged
Dollars 200m over the next two years for the improvement of Palestinian
self-rule areas.
Mr Rabin is keen to see wide backing for the bank, which is to fund regional
infrastructure projects along the lines of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Last month's Middle East and North Africa economic summit in Casablanca
agreed to study the establishment of such a bank, probably with capital of
Dollars 10bn, of which Israel has indicated it might provide Dollars 500m.
Israel wants the US - a supporter of the scheme - to provide 60 per cent of
the capital along with Europe and Japan, with the remainder coming from
Middle East countries.
In a separate meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese foreign minister, Mr
Rabin voiced concern over the growing strength of Islamic fundamentalism and
alleged official Iranian support for terrorist organisations.
His comments come at a sensitive time, as the Japanese government is
considering whether to disburse an overdue second tranche of an official
soft loan for a dam in Iran. Mr Kono was reported to have made no reply.
Reuter adds from Jerusalem: Mr Hikmat al-Masri, a leading organiser against
British mandatory rule of Palestine before 1948 and against Israeli
occupation later, has died, aged 88, his family said yesterday. Mr Masri, a
member of one of the most prominent West Bank families and a co-founder in
1964 of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, died on Tuesday in his native
city of Nablus.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle in which the most significant
move was seen as shifting emphasis from politics to economics in delicate
relations with China.
The moves were also seen as an effort by President Lee Teng-hui to
strengthen his position in advance of presidential elections slated for
early 1996 and subtly to raise Taiwan's level of representation at
international economic meetings. The last big cabinet reshuffle took place
in early 1993.
Mr Vincent Siew, economic planning minister, will head the Mainland Affairs
Council, the agency which shapes China policy. Mr Siew has advocated opening
direct shipping and air links with China, long banned by the ruling
Nationalist party but supported by Taiwanese business interests.
His successor as chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development will be Mr Hsu Li-teh, who will remain deputy premier.
Mr Hsu will represent Taiwan at next year's Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum. President Lee is barred by China's objections from
attending the annual trade summit of the region's leaders. China views
Taiwan as a rebel-held province and thwarts its attempts to join
international organisations.
On Tuesday, Mr Siew said Taiwan should consider setting up 'offshore'
shipping centres through which direct sea trade with China could be
conducted. 'We should actively review the current indirect trade and
investment policy and make some appropriate relaxations. . . under
conditions of national security, we should consider setting up a shipping
centre outside national boundaries,' he said.
All cross-strait trade must now by law be routed through a third location
such as Hong Kong. Earlier, similar proposals have suggested that one of
Taiwan's harbours be designated as the centre for direct shipping with
China.
However, Mr Siew cautioned yesterday against reading too much into his
appointment. 'I will not only focus on economic issues and there will be no
major policy change. . . don't expect too much from me,' he was quoted as
saying.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Elections catch up with India's slow reforms: Liberalisation
moves are seen as an irrelevance by most disaffected rural voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three days after his party suffered a serious defeat in state elections, Mr
P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has yet to utter a word in
public. In his usual quiet way, the 73-year-old veteran is taking stock of
the mood of the party and the country before making a move.
Mr Rao has at least one crumb of comfort: bad as the results were for the
ruling Congress (I) party, the prime minister's own job does not seem at
risk. Even though the party's worst performance was in Mr Rao's home state
Andhra Pradesh, a brief flurry of suggestions that he should quit has blown
away.
But Mr Rao's critics in the party want changes - and want them soon, in time
to influence another round of elections in five more states in February, as
well as the next general election which is due by mid-1996. As Mr Narain
Dutt Tiwari, Congress party chief in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh,
says: 'We simply cannot win any elections with our present image.' While Mr
Tiwari is a known opponent of Mr Rao, many Congress members echo privately
what Mr Tiwari has said in public.
Mr Rao's supporters counter that the state elections were fought mainly over
local issues and warn against over-reacting in Delhi. But even they concede
that adjustments may be necessary, particularly in the presentation of the
government's economic programme.
The prime minister's opponents believe that the pro-market reforms Mr Rao
has pursued for the past three years have insufficient appeal to the great
mass of rural Indians, who constitute 75 per cent of the total electorate.
As far as these farmers and labourers are concerned, liberalisation of
foreign trade and investment is an irrelevance. The biggest economic change
they have witnessed since reform started in 1991 has been a 90 per cent
increase in the prices of food and fuel, which have been pushed up by
government subsidy cuts.
Mr Rao's critics say the reforms are therefore seen as 'anti-poor' and must
be given 'a human face'. A few are even demanding the resignation of Mr
Manmohan Singh, the finance minister.
The mere suggestion that Mr Singh might be forced to resign or to launch a
drastic overhaul of economic policy has sent the stock market tumbling. The
Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares closed up 31.42 points
yesterday at 3,861.47 after five consecutive falls. It is still down 5.5 per
cent on a week ago.
This may be an over-reaction. A few grumbles about Mr Singh do not
constitute an attempt to dislodge him. Mr Rao has stood by him in difficult
times - notably last December when he declined Mr Singh's resignation after
parliamentary criticism of the way the finance minister handled the 1992
Bombay securities market scandal.
Moreover, even if Mr Singh were to go, there is broad cross-party consensus
about the need for economic liberalisation. So although there may be
arguments over presentation, the direction of pro-market reforms is not at
risk.
But what could be threatened is the fiscal discipline which has underpinned
liberalisation. In his first two years, Mr Singh squeezed public spending,
cutting the fiscal deficit from 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product to
5.7 per cent in 1992-93. But in the year to March 1994 it returned to 7.3
per cent as spending cuts slowed. This year's generous target of 6 per cent
seems attainable because of a recovery in tax payments. The danger is next
year when the political pressures to spend in advance of the general
election may be irresistible. The 1995-96 budget, due in February at the
time of the next round of state elections, will be crucial.
Apart from the economy, the Congress party is considering three issues which
may have lost votes this week - corruption, caste and the handling of the
1992 destruction of the Ayodhya mosque.
Opinion polls showed that many voters were angry at corruption in
government. Mostly they were concerned about corruption at the local level,
such as bribes paid to petty officials and commissions collected by district
politicians. But Mr Rao is under attack in Delhi over corruption in the
central government. Opposition parties have repeatedly urged him to dismiss
two ministers who were named in the parliamentary report into the Bombay
securities scandal - Mr B. Shankaranand, the health minister, and Mr
Rameshwar Thakur, the junior finance minister.
Also, the prime minister is under pressure in parliament to explain how the
government mishandled a sugar shortage earlier this year. Government imports
of sugar were delayed for weeks while prices rose to the benefit of private
producers and importers.
Mr A K Antony, minister for civil supplies, resigned yesterday, saying he
bore moral responsibility for the sugar scandal. An official report named
him and other senior officials in imports deals.
However, there are fears within Congress that even if the party acts on its
economic record and corruption, it will still fail to rebuild support it has
lost among India's lower castes and Moslems. Once the bedrock of Congress
party support, these communities have been fickle in recent years and
deserted Congress in droves in the two biggest of the four states in which
elections have just been held - Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Moslems have
been alienated by Mr Rao's failure to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque after it
was pulled down by militant Hindus. It is hard to see how Mr Rao can win
back their support without angering the much larger Hindu community.
With caste-based communities he faces a similar problem of matching
competing demands. Once Congress won favour with the poor with modest
hand-outs of subsidies and public works projects. But as the lower castes
have become more politically active so their demands have grown. The result
is that politicians become embroiled in increasingly bitter arguments about
sharing out the pie of patronage.
As Mr Singh has said, only increased economic growth can provide the means
to satisfy these competing demands. Until now he has persuaded the Congress
party to wait patiently for his policies to deliver growth. He says India
will see the benefits in the late 1990s. After these elections it is not
clear that his party colleagues are prepared to wait that long.

FT  15 DEC 94 / School bullying haunts celebrations: Questions raised about
the educational system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Christmas lights have gone up to add cheer to the Japanese year-end but,
far from being in celebratory mood, the country is gripped by concerns about
bullying in its state schools.
On Tuesday the nation, already deeply disturbed by the suicide last month of
a 13-year-old schoolboy who was the victim of bullying by classmates, was
shocked by a second young suicide of the same age, who had also been
tormented by his peers.
The public outcry over the increasingly cold-blooded bullying that is taking
place in Japanese schools has led the government to set up a special cabinet
council to look into the causes of and possible solutions to school
bullying.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, prime minister, has called on his ministers to review
the educational counselling system to determine whether it was functioning
properly.
Bullying is by no means a new feature of life at Japanese schools nor a
phenomenon peculiar to Japan. But the number of incidents which are thought
to have been responsible for the deaths of teenagers and the apparently more
vicious nature of the bullying has alarmed the public and raised questions
about the country's educational system.
In its annual white paper on education released on Tuesday, the ministry of
education cites that 12 per cent of elementary schools, 33 per cent of
junior high schools and 24 per cent of senior high schools reported bullying
in fiscal 1992.
While the figures show that incidents have been on the decline at elementary
and senior high schools, the ministry notes that there has been a rise in
incidents of bullying at junior high schools.
Mr Kazuhiro Mochizuki, a former headmaster of a junior high school who is
now an educational consultant, believes that the strong tendency in junior
high schools to judge students according to their academic achievements is
largely to blame for the bullying groups which have sprouted throughout
Japanese state schools.
'There is a lot of confusion in junior high schools over how best to get
students into high schools. In the shadow of all the confusion over academic
counselling, I believe 70 to 80 per cent of the children have an inferiority
complex and these are the ones who form groups and try to vent their
frustration by bullying others,' he says. In most cases victims are gentle
children who have an average or above average academic record.
At the same time, the emphasis at schools has shifted so much towards
academic work that moral instruction and non-academic activities have been
neglected.
Many critics of Japan's educational system who share Mr Mochizuki's concerns
about the weight given to academic achievement blame the system for creating
an environment in which children feel they cannot rely on their teachers.
'Teachers are preoccupied with conferences and other matters and have less
and less time to spend with the children. That is why the children do not
trust their teachers and do not tell them that they are being bullied,'
notes Mr Inada Nada, a psychologist and writer. 'If personal relationships
are weak, there will be bullying not only at schools but at the workplace as
well,' he adds.
In many cases where bullying has led to the suicide of young students, the
school authorities, including the victims' teachers, claim not to have
noticed the bullying.
Although some schools have set up special counselling facilities, children
who are bullied by their peers tend to keep the reality hidden from
grown-ups.
This is in part out of fear of retaliation from offenders but also because
they are not always taken seriously by adults. In both of the latest suicide
cases, the parents of the victims had suspected bullying for some time, but
the school authorities did not take any significant steps to try to stop the
aggression.
In a society where group harmony and conformity are valued over
individuality and self-assertiveness, it is often not only difficult for the
victim of group aggression to seek help but humiliating as well.
Another aspect that has raised concerns in Japan is the growing tendency for
bullies to extort huge sums of money from their victims. In the case of
Kiyoteru Okochi, who committed suicide last month, one of the most shocking
revelations was that his tormentors had forced him to give them a total of
more than Y1m (Pounds 6,380) over a period of about two years, according to
a letter he left.
The money, which Kiyoteru stole from his parents and borrowed from
relatives, was spent by the bullies at game arcades and on everything from
clothes to food and alcohol.
'Many children today cannot play without money,' laments Mr Mochizuki. The
problem reflects a deeper social disorder, he believes.
'Bullying is occurring in public schools which cannot reject any of the
children who live in the local communities. In many of these communities,
people who have lived side by side for more than ten years do not even talk
to each other and it's everyone for himself. In such an environment, how can
you expect children to develop a sense of concern for others?' Mr Mochizuki
asks.
'The government cannot hope to solve this problem with peremptory measures
like setting up councils but will have to look at it from the perspective of
local communities and of the educational system as a whole,' he points out.
Japan has always prided itself on its social harmony. But ironically, as the
country tries to define a new relationship for itself with the rest of the
world, it is having to reflect on the effects of deteriorating relationships
among its own people at home.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Japan plans to ease rules on funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a belated attempt to revive flagging interest in the nation's investment
trust business, Japan's ministry of finance has announced it plans to sweep
away most of the tight restrictions that are currently stifling demand for
such funds.
Many of the rules governing fund management and distribution of profits will
go in the widest ranging shake-up of the investment trust sector for
decades. The changes are likely to take effect before the end of the year.
The most significant of the changes will be the lifting of a ban on
investing in derivatives. At present, trusts are permitted to invest in
derivative instruments, such as futures and options, only for the limited
purpose of risk-hedging.
In a further effort to create a more investor-friendly environment, the
trusts will have to disclose their funds' performance in greater detail,
including publication of monthly performance data. More transparent
reporting will also be required to enable better comparison between trusts.
The Japanese equity market has fallen from its highs of the late 1980s and
savers have shied away from investment trusts. The ministry of finance
estimates that net assets of equity-based investment trusts have fallen from
more than Y45,000bn (Pounds 287bn) in 1989 to less than Y19,000bn at the end
of October this year.
Other principal reforms are:
Investment trusts will be allowed to invest in any foreign market.
Restrictions on the sale of foreign investment trusts in Japan will be
eased.
The ban on mergers between investment trust companies and investment
advisory companies will be lifted.
'Churning', excessive buying and selling of equities to increase brokers'
commission income, will be banned.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Australia aims to check surging growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government was aiming for 'more acceptable' annual growth
levels of between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent and would review fiscal policy
when it conducted its mid-year budgetary review in January, Mr Ralph Willis,
treasurer, said yesterday.
His comments came within hours of the decision by the Reserve Bank of
Australia to raise the country's official cash rate by a further one
percentage point to 7.5 per cent when markets opened yesterday, in an effort
to check the nation's surging economy.
This is the third rise in four months - the previous increases of 75 and 100
basis points were in August and October respectively.
Recent figures have shown that Australia's non-farm sector grew by 7.3 per
cent in the year to the September quarter, and Mr Willis said this momentum
had continued. 'It's clear the economy is growing very strongly in the
December quarter.'
'Clearly, in these cir-cumstances we need to give further consideration to
fiscal policy. . . we will do that in the context of the mid-year review,'
he said.
Although Mr Willis stressed that no decisions have been taken, many
observers believe the government is preparing the ground for tax increases
in the new year. These could mean a fight in the Senate, parliament's upper
house, where the government lacks a majority, and will be hard to sell to
the electorate.
In the meantime, many private sector economists suggested that yesterday's
rate rise would not be the last move on the monetary front for a while. 'The
overwhelming strength of the economy suggests to us that there is another
100 basis rate rise to occur in the next few months,' Bankers Trust said.
The Australian dollar seemed to reflect this view, finishing in local
markets at USDollars 0.7774, its highest closing level for three years.
The powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions sent a shot across the
government's bows when Mr Martin Ferguson, Actu president, called for less
reliance on interest rate rises to slow the economy and more emphasis on
taxing the 'top end of town'.
He added that any additional tax burden on the lowest paid could 'seriously
put at risk' the accord between the union movement and the government. Under
this, the unions pledge to seek wage deals which keep Australia's inflation
rate in line with that of its trading partners.

<TEXT>
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, expects to borrow DM55bn
(Pounds 22bn) - DM13bn less than he had earlier indicated - to finance this
year's budget following higher tax receipts and further savings. Mr Waigel
recently said net borrowing requirement had fallen by DM10bn, but yesterday
he revised this to DM13bn as he presented his 1995 budget to parliament for
the first time since it was re-elected in October. The net new borrowing
requirement for the 1995 budget will also be DM10.2bn lower than expected,
totalling DM58.6bn, Mr Waigel said. Expenditure in 1995 is expected to be
about 1 per cent higher than this year, totalling DM484.1bn. The biggest
item is the social security budget which is expected to rise by 1.9 per cent
to DM132.3bn.

Ministers from at least 45 countries plus a European Union representative
will meet in Lisbon over the weekend to sign the European Energy Charter,
which aims to establish a legal agreement for investment and trade in energy
between western organisations and those in central and eastern Europe. The
charter was originally proposed after the fall of communism to provide the
west with a vehicle for supporting Russian and east European industry.
However, its completion has been delayed by disputes over the legal
requirements that should be set and the pace of Russian reform. The US will
delay signing the charter until next year, while Norway's vote to stay out
of the EU casts doubt on its signature. Russia has said it will sign in
principle, but it is unclear whether they will do so as early as this
weekend.

FT  15 DEC 94 / EU packaging directive passed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European parliament yesterday passed the long-delayed directive on
packaging and packaging waste, setting targets for the recovery and
recycling of packaging waste. It will take effect in the new year. The
directive gives member countries 18 months to draw up legislation aimed at
recovering between 50 per cent and 65 per cent by weight of packaging waste
each year. Between 25 per cent and 45 per cent of packaging waste must be
recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent for each packaging material. Members
then have five years to achieve the targets. The targets, lower than
originally proposed two years ago, were agreed by European environment
ministers last year but the directive was delayed by opposition from Belgium
to an amendment which it feared would limit its ability to levy eco-taxes.
Following redrafting, the directive was passed by European agriculture
ministers on Tuesday. 'This is very good news for the industry,' said the
UK's Industry Council on Packaging and the Environment. 'Everyone can plan
for the future knowing what the requirements are.' The council called the
targets 'realistic and achievable', adding that the directive would prevent
members from introducing national packaging legislation.

<TEXT>
German carmaker Mercedes-Benz threatened to sue Greece's government
yesterday for shutting its main Athens office for eight days and posting a
sign outside branding the company a tax dodger. 'If the case is as we see,
it is most likely we will sue for damages,' Mr Hans Dieter Struck, the
company's managing director in Greece, said. Finance ministry officials
chained and padlocked the main entrance to Mercedes-Benz on Tuesday and put
up a sign next to the door announcing 'locked until 20/12/94 for tax
evasion'. Mr Struck said it was absurd to shut the company's headquarters in
Greece because of a disputed 300,000-drachma (Pounds 790) fine. Mr Struck
said Mercedes felt its row with the finance ministry had nothing to do with
tax evasion but with a dispute, which is still under review at the ministry,
over a missing 1993 receipt for spare parts worth 150,000 drachmas. Mercedes
has appealed to the highest administrative court in Greece and, if
necessary, will go to the European Court, Mr Struck said.

Ireland is expected to have a new government today, with Fine Gael set to
agree a coalition with Labour and the small Democratic Left party. Mr John
Bruton, leader of the conservative Fine Gael party, would become prime
minister with Labour leader Mr Dick Spring foreign minister and deputy
premier. The three parties have been in negotiations since talks broke down
last week between Fianna Fail and Labour, the coalition partners in the
outgoing administration, over a judicial appointments row. A joint programme
for government was due to be published by the parties last night and will be
put to the respective parliamentary parties for approval. Mr Proinsias de
Rossa, leader of the Democratic Left, said the coalition negotiations were
'making steady progress'. The three party leaders were due to resume talks
on a share-out of the 15 cabinet seats last night. Observers expect a deal
could be ready to be voted on in parliament today. Outgoing finance minister
Mr Bertie Ahern told reporters on Tuesday night that the new government
would inherit the best set of accounts any government had enjoyed for more
than 25 years.

Advent International, the Boston-based venture capital company, is expected
to confirm today that it has bought Deutsche Waggonbau, east Germany's giant
railway manufacturer and one of the last remaining industrial complexes
under the Treuhand privatisation agency. The sale will be announced during a
special meeting of DWA's board, according to Treuhand officials and the IG
Metall steel and engineering union.
The DWA acquisition will pose a considerable challenge for Advent and its
technological partners, who have yet to be named. DWA - which once employed
over 24,000 workers before German unification but now employs 6,600 - was
regarded as one of the most difficult cases for the Treuhand, which winds up
operations on December 31. To make the enterprises's five subsidiaries more
attractive to investors, the management will have to cut 1,835 more jobs
after next July. The Treuhand recently agreed to extend a further DM400m
(Pounds 163m) as part of DWA's restructuring programme and to find new
markets. DWA last year had a turnover of DM1.2bn, but this is expected to
fall to DM1bn on losses and debts of DM390m for 1994.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Economic upturn has revived Alphandery: A confident finance
minister discusses France's lead in Europe's growth league with David Buchan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France is set to record the highest growth of any large European country
next year, said Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, dismissing the
autumn's sluggishness in consumer demand as a natural pause after rapid
recovery.
'Don't confuse deceleration of the rhythm of recovery with a halt to the
recovery,' he said in an interview. 'After exceptionally fast growth,
especially in the second quarter of this year, we knew we couldn't continue
at that pace. But we have already registered growth of 2.3 per cent for the
first nine months of this year.'
He stuck to his official forecast of 3.1 per cent growth in 1995, but noted
that the European Commission predicted France would top the European Union
league, with 3.2 per cent growth next year.
Mr Alphandery flatly ruled out the return of the recession that saw French
gross domestic product contract by 1 per cent in 1993. 'No economist or
forecaster envisages the scenario of a double dip in the French economy,' he
said.
The economic upturn has clearly restored Mr Alphandery's confidence, shaken
in 1993 by the monetary crisis and by criticism that his supply-side focus
on improving companies' cash flow and promoting long-term savings and
investment, rather than pumping up consumer demand, risked prolonging
recession.
'The choices we made are now bearing fruit,' he said. Growth has returned to
the French economy without increasing inflation (running at an annual rate
of 1.6 per cent) and without diminishing the trade surplus (likely to be
FFr80bn (Pounds 9.5bn) for the second successive year). The synchronisation
of policy with Germany, enshrined in a joint convergence plan that Mr
Alphandery presented a year ago with Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart,
has created 'a formidable factor of stability' within the European monetary
system.
Mr Alphandery recognises that one consequence of French policy convergence
with Germany, and of 'the openness of our economy which is much more linked
than in the past to our neighbours', is to make 'the French economy more
cyclical'. But at the present, the cycle is moving in the right way. 'What
makes me optimistic that the recovery is definitely here for 1995-96 is that
the whole environment surrounding France is improving, with strong German,
Italian, Spanish demand for French goods.'
The other factor in Mr Alphandery's optimism is his pride in 'getting
ourselves out of recession with pretty sparing use of (public) resources'
and in inducing savers to switch 'the money they were hoarding in short-term
money market funds into long-term savings, helping private and public
investment.
'We have also systematically assisted the competitiveness of French
companies. For instance, we gave companies a FFr50bn cash reimbursement on
value added tax. President (Francois) Mitterrand criticised this, saying it
was economically inefficient not to give the equivalent of money to
households to support general consumer demand. We didn't do that. And it has
paid off. Look at the balance of payments surplus which, even with recovery,
has not shrunk. Exports have increased in line with imports.'
The 'sparing use' made of public resources took the form of 'targeted
incentives in favour of car purchases and housing investment', Mr Alphandery
said. 'We thus put 'super' into the two motors of the French economy.'
But it is on his restructuring of savings that he waxes most
enthusiastically. To a large extent what he has done is simply correct the
over-generous tax treatment given to French money market funds when, with
the lifting of all exchange controls in the early 1990s, it was feared these
funds would depart for Luxembourg and other tax havens.
Nonetheless, Mr Alphandery has wrought a significant change. When he took
office individuals had FFr800bn, and companies another FFr400bn, piled up in
short-term money market funds known as Sicavs. 'These were really false
savings, and counted as part of M3 money supply. Some FFr250bn of these
funds have now been consolidated into long-term savings.
'I was of course helped by the fall in short-term rates relative to
long-term rates.' But the minister also vaunts his reforms allowing money
from Sicavs to be switched, tax-free, into equity investment schemes, into
lending to the government in the form of the four-year 'Ballabonds' issued
in 1993 and into housing, as well as lowering tax exemptions on withdrawals
from Sicavs for any other purpose.
Mr Alphandery has one more big investment vehicle on his drawing board:
capitalised private pension funds. Far from being a threat to the shaky
state scheme, he argues that private pension funds could help buoy it, by
boosting investment and growth and thereby creating higher salaries and
pension contributions paid into the state scheme.
It is thus a much more confident Mr Alphandery who on January 1 takes over
chairmanship of the council of European Union economic and finance ministers
for the six months of the French presidency of the EU. Among his priorities
will be to put into effect the Commission white paper's recommendations on
general competitiveness and labour market flexibility, and to scrutinise
more closely international aid programmes.
On such issues, he said he found himself 'much in intellectual harmony' with
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. It is surprising to
hear a French centrist express such affinity with a British Tory. But it is
clear that 20 months of holding office have confirmed Mr Alphandery's fiscal
conservatism and supply-side instincts.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Berlusconi troubles deepen: President cancels engagements as
Northern League snubs coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night cancelled all immediate
engagements outside Rome to handle the deepening crisis facing the
Berlusconi government.
The worsening plight of the right-wing coalition of Mr Silvio Berlusconi was
underlined yesterday when the populist Northern League snubbed its partners
and voted with the opposition to defeat the government on a vote to create a
special parliamentary commission for broadcasting.
Mr Scalfaro alone has the authority to dissolve parliament or ask a new
person to form a government. He will play a key role both in determining the
length of the seven-month old Berlusconi government and its successor.
Financial markets also reflected this nervousness, even though the 1995
budget looked set to pass speedily through parliament. The lira was hovering
near its historic low against the D-Mark of L1,042.
The damaging conflict between the Italian government and the judiciary was
heightened by Milan magistrates' interrogation of Mr Berlusconi on Tuesday.
This view was echoed by politicians and in newspaper editorials yesterday
following Mr Berlusconi's defiant statement attacking the magistrates.
Mr Berlusconi took the magistrates to task for interrogating a serving prime
minister when, he claimed, they had no documentary evidence to incriminate
him. He also accused them of seeking to make the most of his being
questioned, creating 'a spectacle of justice or, rather, creating injustice
out of a spectacle'.
The Milan magistrates, who are conducting a corruption investigation and who
questioned him for more than seven hours about his running of his Fininvest
business empire, decided to observe an uncharacteristic silence. They
appeared anxious to avoid any suggestion that they were prejudicing their
case. For once, virtually nothing has been leaked to the media about what
the magistrates wanted to find out from Mr Berlusconi.
Most commentators focused on the length of time Mr Berlusconi was obliged to
spend at the Milan Palace of Justice. A spokesman for the prime minister
said only two hours were strictly interrogation - the bulk was taken up with
obtaining an agreed oral record.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Bossi backs away from allies: A possible regrouping of
parliamentary forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi yesterday marched one
further step away from its allies in Italy's rightwing coalition government.
The League voted with the opposition in the chamber of deputies to approve
the formation of a new parliamentary commission covering radio and
television. This was against the express wishes of the League's government
allies - the Forza Italia movement of premier Silvio Berlusconi, the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini and the small
Christian Democratic Centre (CCD).
It was the first occasion during this parliament that the League has
formally aligned with the opposition with the clear intention of
discrediting Mr Berlusconi politically. Some opposition members immediately
saw this as the beginnings of the formation of a new parliamentary majority.
However, Mr Walter Veltroni, a deputy for the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) and editor of the daily L'Unita, was more cautious:
'This vote does not prove the existence of a new majority, rather it
expresses the degree of concern in parliament over the problems of
information and the media.'
The vote was only a day after Mr Berlusconi had been interrogated by Milan
magistrates about corruption during the time he ran his Fininvest business
empire, and came when the future of the coalition was increasingly in doubt.
However, the significance of the vote lay not merely in the timing. The
motion to set up the new commission was moved by Ms Irene Pivetti, the
League speaker of the House. She has become a key figure in the growing
political instability and has established close links with President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro. Mr Berlusconi's supporters regard her as no longer impartial
and determined to undermine the credibility of the coalition to prepare the
way for a new government of national unity.
Forza Italia deputies issued a note accusing Ms Pivetti: 'This is a complete
expropriation of parliamentary procedure by Pivetti, creating a new
commission and effectively de-legitimising the work of three existing
commissions.'
Government domination of these commissions had enabled Mr Berlusconi and his
allies to take over management and editorial control of the Rai, the state
broadcasting organisation. Such a situation in turn exacerbated the conflict
of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his ownership
of three commercial television channels through Fininvest.
The problem of the control of television was further complicated by a
constitutional court decision ruling last week that a 1990 law granting Mr
Berlusconi three national commercial channels was unconstitutional. As a
result Fininvest may well have to divest one, if not two, of its channels by
the end of 1996.
Despite the background of genuine public interest behind the formation of
the commission, Ms Pivetti's move was intended to embarrass the government,
and the League's switch of support intended as a signal of its ability to
change sides. It followed the tabling of a motion by Mr Bossi in effect
censoring a wide swathe of government activity, including Mr Berlusconi's
handling of his dispute with the judiciary. The League cannot play this
spoiling role much longer without formally changing sides.
Without the League, Mr Berlusconi would have no other ally to make up a
working majority in parliament. Until now Mr Bossi has been content to
conduct guerrilla warfare without bringing down the government. This is
because he wants both to see the 1995 budget through parliament and avoid
early elections.
A budget, ineffectually dealing with Italy's public sector deficit, will go
through parliament next week. The League's hands would then be freed to
carry out Mr Bossi's long-threatened verifica - a parliamentary test of
whether the coalition has any interest in, and chance of, survival - and to
see what other coalition could form a government.
The new alliance of the type forged yesterday is the most obvious regrouping
of the forces in parliament. However, the PDS is far from united on doing a
deal with Mr Bossi.
For his part, the League leader is unsure that all his troops would back a
centre-left alliance that would inevitably leave the PDS as the dominant
parliamentary player. For this reason Mr Bossi has said a coalition could be
forged solely as a government of national salvation, one that excluded the
neo-fascists.
Mr Berlusconi will do his best to woo away the 40-odd League deputies
disenchanted with their leader's behaviour. And if the League's departure
from the coalition becomes unavoidable, he will make Mr Bossi appear the
person responsible for destabilising the government and the country.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Kohl ticks off MEPs for criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a staunch advocate of greater powers for the
European parliament, yesterday scolded the Strasbourg assembly for
criticising Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union.
MEPs had no right to belittle the results of the recent European Council
summit in Essen which had marked an historic step towards integrating the
former communist countries of eastern Europe into the EU, he said.
He noted pointedly that barely a fifth of the 567 members were present in
the chamber: 'If people could see this empty room, they would be horrified.'
Many MEPs appeared taken aback by Mr Kohl's touchiness. Mr Gijs de Vries,
the Liberal leader, said the chancellor had obviously been too long in
power.
'He's suffering from the Thatcher-Lubbers complex. It seems to happen to
everyone who has been in power for more than 10 years.'
In the debate on the Essen summit, MEPs piled up complaints about the delay
in concluding a convention to govern Europol, the Hague-based pan-European
police network, as well as the failure to cut high unemployment, tackle
poverty and stem the refugees from ex-Yugoslavia.
In particular, the Socialists, the single largest group, called for an
analysis of the effect on the EU budget and common agricultural policy of
enlargement to include the farm-intensive countries of eastern Europe such
as Poland and Hungary.
Greek representatives spoke up, still rankled by the way Germany effectively
took over the Greek presidency earlier this year by seizing control of the
EU accession negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway.
Mr Kohl is an irrepressible optimist about Europe, but his view that Essen
had achieved a broad consensus on employment, the financing of
trans-European infrastructure networks, and a balanced policy toward eastern
Europe and the Mediterranean was widely shared by EU governments.
Britain was especially delighted with the Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) aid
programme for Northern Ireland, the strong commitment to future labour
market flexibility, and the Council's decision to abandon efforts to force
through an EU-wide Co carbon energy tax.
The chancellor was clearly upset by MEPs' criticism about the delay in
setting up Europol, a project to which he attaches the utmost importance.
'Why criticise me? Go back home and speak to your own representatives. They
are rejecting Europol,' he said.
France, which takes over the rotating EU presidency in January, has blocked
a Europol agreement, although at Essen it offered a commitment to wrap up a
convention before the next European summit in Cannes in June.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Belgacom troubles cloud prospect of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Decorative marble is causing trouble at Belgacom, Belgium's state telephone
monopoly. The embattled company was also forced yesterday to deny local
newspaper reports that its entire board was about to be replaced ahead of a
planned privatisation.
The marble was hauled away from Belgacom-towers, the company's new
headquarters, but officials denied the decision was a matter of taste. 'The
decorations were removed for acoustic and structural reasons,' a spokeswoman
said yesterday, an operation which added to the BFr1.6bn (Pounds 31.6m) cost
of preparing Belgacom-towers for occupation.
News of the expensive refurbishment has not gone down well with the public.
Belgium's biggest state-owned enterprise is reputed to be one of Europe's
least efficient telephone monopolies. Furthermore, internal rows have
frightened off potential investors, delaying a long talked of privatisation.
A sell-off is unlikely before 1996 and so far details are sketchy.
The government plans to sell only part of the operation to a private
investor while retaining control of at least 50 per cent. No timetable has
been set and the government has not specified which sections of the company
it intends to sell.
But if it fails to act, the company risks being overtaken by the rapid
development of global telecommunications. In particular 1998 sees the
obligatory deregulation of Europe's telephone monopolies under EU law, a
date being eagerly watched by privatised telecoms operators.
Yesterday Mr Elio di Rupo, communications minister, did not deny reports
that Belgacom's board and chief executive would be dismissed soon. He merely
said such reports were 'premature'.
Belgium's francophone Le Soir newspaper said Mr Bessel Kok, chief executive,
and Mr Benoit Remiche, chairman, would be dismissed with large pay-offs. The
two men have been at loggerheads over the running of the company and have
fallen out publicly.
Mr Peter Drummond, a consultant working closely with Mr Kok, was forced to
resign after it emerged that he was being paid by both Belgacom and PA
Consulting group, advising Belgacom on setting up a mobile phone venture.
The row has further delayed progress towards privatisation by creating even
greater rifts within top management, already split along party lines.
On the question of refurbishment, Belgacom has spent the money on
modifications that include two outside lifts, a staff canteen and conference
rooms.
'Belgacom has rigorously respected the budgets approved by the board for the
refurbishment work which has been necessary for the instalment of about
3,000 employees who, for a long time now, have been owed a decent place to
work,' it said in a statement.

US defence secretary William Perry (pictured, centre, in Brussels with Nato
secretary-general Willy Claes, left, and UK defence secretary Malcolm
Rifkind) will try to reassure Russian officials about Nato's plans for
expansion eastwards in a visit to Moscow starting today. Despite concerns
about Nato and Chechnya, Mr Perry is in a mood to do business with the
Yeltsin administration. 'We look at this relationship very pragmatically,'
said a senior US official accompanying him. 'We have areas where we
disagree, and we have a lot of areas where we can and must co-operate.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Nato to study boosting UN mission in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain reacted coolly yesterday to French proposals for reinforcing the UN
mission in Bosnia, saying military experts would have to decide what was
feasible.
However, military commanders from the nine Nato members which contribute
troops to Bosnia, plus the US and Italy, will meet in the Netherlands next
week to consider ways of strengthening the UN's hard-pressed humanitarian
and peacekeeping mission.
The French suggestions - which include securing Sarajevo airport and
creating a secure route from the Bosnian capital to the Adriatic - would
serve the twin purpose of reinforcing the UN while it remains in Bosnia and
making a withdrawal easier.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said he could not comment on the
practicability of the French ideas until they had been examined by military
experts. He stressed that there could be no question of altering the UN's
mandate.
Yesterday's meeting of Nato defence ministers grouped the US, Canada and 13
of its European allies but not France, which has opted out of the alliance's
military wing. The meeting focused strongly on refining contingency plans
for a possible UN withdrawal from Bosnia, although diplomats stressed a
pullout was not desirable or imminent.
As sketched out in a blueprint drawn up by Nato military planners, a
withdrawal of UN forces from Bosnia would be much the most ambitious
military operation in which the alliance has been involved. Planners
estimate that up to 45,000 troops would be required, of which 25,000 would
be earmarked for combat roles, plus 70 combat aircraft, 80 tanks and 180
helicopters.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, yesterday reaffirmed Washington
would provide up to half the combat troops, with conditions:
command of any withdrawal operations would have to be transferred
unconditionally from the UN to Nato;
the total force would have to be large enough to intimidate any hostile
party; and
the US Congress would have to approve.
US officials said they hoped a new UN posture would be worked out and
approved by the end of next week.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Newspapers win court action over naming of lottery winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 17.9m National Lottery winner, who is married with three sons,
lives in a new terraced house in Blackburn, Lancashire, earns Pounds 240 a
week in a local chemical plant and is of Asian origin with a taste for
curries, will remain anonymous - even though half of Blackburn already knows
his identity.
National newspapers went to the High Court yesterday and persuaded a judge
to lift an injunction preventing publication of the winner's name. Then they
decided not to publish it.
'We said we would respect the winner's anonymity on the front page. To go
back on that would be sheer hypocrisy,' said Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of
The Sun. The paper had gone to court because Camelot, the lottery organiser,
'has no legal right to tell us how to do our job'.
The Sun said it would decide the issue on a case by case basis. If Myra
Hindley, the Moors murderer, or Prince Edward won the National Lottery, The
Sun would know where its duty lay.
At The Sun's rival, the Daily Mirror, editor Mr Colin Myler said he had no
intention of publishing the winner's name. The Daily Mirror's attitude was
praised by Sir John Wood, the High Court judge who heard yesterday's appeal.
'We went to court to protect the right to print or not as opposed to being
dictated to by Camelot,' said Mr Myler. 'What, for example, if the Queen
wins the lottery?'
Last night, Mr Peter Davis, lottery director-general and regulator, said he
would review Camelot's efforts to protect the winner's identity following
allegations about its conduct. Withholding a winner's name, unless consent
was obtained, was a condition of Camelot's licence as lottery operator, he
said.
Politicians immediately jumped into the row over the winner's right to
remain unknown.
Blackburn's Labour MP, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, wrote to
National Heritage secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell, accusing Camelot of laying
'a trail of clues about the identity of the jackpot winner'.
Camelot, which will not appeal yesterday's decision, said it released
limited details about the winner with his consent. The vice-chairman of the
Conservative backbench media affairs committee, Mr Michael Fabricant,
accused newspapers of being more interested in sales than a sense of
responsibility.
Most readers of The Sun who called the paper thought it should respect the
winner's right to privacy. People who rang Camelot were of a similar mind.
The Sun says it will continue to offer a reward for information on big
winners. Donations to charity will fall by Pounds 172m a year as a result of
the introduction of the National Lottery, according to a National Council
for Voluntary Organisations survey. The estimated Pounds 136m charities are
likely to receive from lottery proceeds will leave them Pounds 36m poorer,
it said.

FT  15 DEC 94 / IRA arms surrender 'not vital for start of peace talks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government will not insist on the surrender of IRA weapons as a
precondition for allowing Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into talks on
Northern Ireland's future.
But, speaking on the eve of a meeting between the government and loyalist
representatives, Mr John Major said he was determined to ensure paramilitary
arsenals were 'no longer available for use in terrorist attacks'.
In comments which may concern some unionists who are still suspicious about
the IRA's intentions, the prime minister said he was 'not pedantic about
whether those weapons are surrendered or whether those weapons are
decommissioned, destroyed with some form of verification - I don't mind'.
What was important was that a political party should not be able to 'go back
to a nice little stockpile of weapons if something went against them and
start using them again'.
His remarks came as he unveiled Pounds 75m of private investment in the
province in the textiles, telecommunications and automotive sectors.
The package was the highlight of a buoyant Belfast International Investment
conference, overshadowing a walkout by Sinn Fein representatives.
The prime minister told the 300 delegates at Ulster's biggest business event
since the troubles began 25 years ago that a 'virtuous circle' was taking
shape. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity; prosperity in turn will
consolidate peace,' he said.
Setting out the province's stall to potential investors, Mr Major announced
a new government work programme for the long-term unemployed. He said the
programme would help 1,000 long-term jobless over two years and would be
expanded 'substantially' if successful.
The programme is under-stood to be the first stage of a two-pronged
government initiative. The Northern Ireland Office's department of economic
development is thought to be working on proposals to focus its aid effort
more on areas of high unemployment, including politically sensitive west
Belfast.
After receiving a warm welcome from shoppers at Portadown, Mr Major
dismissed Sinn Fein's walkout from yesterday's conference, saying: 'I think
they have shot themselves in the foot rather badly.'
IRA weapons are top of the government's agenda in its preliminary dialogue
with Sinn Fein, which will resume next week when the two sides attempt to
draw up a more detailed agenda for discussions.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House considers bid for Northern Electric:
Regional power shares jump 5 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first hostile bid for a privatised UK utility loomed yesterday after
Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, announced it was
considering making an offer for Northern Electric.
Trafalgar House disclosed its potential bid after intervention from the
Takeover Panel following a substantial rise in Northern's share price during
the past few days.
Shares in Northern, which is based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, rose 100p to
1010p, valuing the company at Pounds 1.25bn.
Trafalgar House, the world's fourth-largest engineering and construction
contractor, owns the Cunard shipping line and a large property portfolio.
Earlier plans by Trafalgar to bid today appeared to have been shelved.
Trafalgar was said to be considering its position, although an attempted
takeover still seems likely in the near future.
Some observers believe that Trafalgar House's emergence as a predator makes
restructuring in the sector inevitable, with companies seeking mergers to
avoid an unwelcome bid.
Shares in all 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales rose an
average 5 per cent as investors considered the possibility of Trafalgar
House's announcement flushing out other prospective bidders.
At yesterday's close the regional electricity companies were valued at
Pounds 17.1bn.
Any attempted takeover will be politically contentious. The Labour party is
likely to say the regional companies are attractive to buyers because they
operate under a slack regulatory regime.
The government owns a golden share in each of the 12 companies, which
prevents any bidder from buying more than 15 per cent of a regional
supplier's shares.
However, the golden share expires at the end of March and some analysts
believe the government may be persuaded to allow a bid before then.
Northern is likely to resist a Trafalgar House bid, which its executives
believe is motivated by a desire to gain access to Northern's potential cash
pile.
The company said it had received no proposals from Trafalgar and advised
shareholders to take no action.
Some electricity analysts were puzzled by Trafalgar's motives. 'There is no
synergy apart from finances,' said one.
Some Trafalgar shareholders also expressed doubts about the move, arguing
that it had more to do with the strategic interests of Hongkong Land, which
owns 25 per cent of the shares, than with the interests of Trafalgar.
Hongkong Land is a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong
conglomerate which is trying to reduce its dependence on the colony before
the hand-over to China in 1997.
By funding the acquisition of Northern Electric, Jardine would channel Hong
Kong cash into a UK business, which would provide reliable profits.
Hongkong Land has effective control of Trafalgar after engineering its
financial rescue over the past two years.
Trafalgar's shares rose 1p yesterday to close at 72p.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Rapid growth adds to rate rise pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that UK interest rates may have to rise further were fuelled yesterday
by signs that recent rapid economic growth is creating new inflationary
pressures.
Official figures showed that inflation and average earnings are edging up.
Meanwhile unemployment is falling at an accelerating rate, suggesting that
with fewer people out of work, wage demands may rise.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday downplayed the inflationary
dangers by stressing that the overall economic picture was 'extremely good',
with plenty of spare capacity.
'(Inflation) is not a risk for the economy at the moment,' he told the
Treasury and Civil Service parliamentary select committee.
However, the Treasury yesterday said the inflation data provided a further
demonstration of the pressures that had prompted the  1/2 point rise in
interest rates this month from 5.75 per cent to 6.25 per cent.
'We have probably seen the trough of low inflation for now,' an official
said, pointing out that the Treasury forecast assumed inflation would rise
to 2.5 per cent by late next year.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the retail prices index rose
by 2.6 per cent in the year to November, up from 2.4 per cent in October.
The government's targeted inflation measure, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, rose by 2.3 per cent in the year to November, from 2 per
cent in September and October.
The increase was boosted by unusual factors such as a sharp rise in milk
prices after the recent reform of the milk marketing board. But price rises
also occurred in the clothing and household goods sectors which had seen
severe discounting earlier in the year.
Meanwhile, the underlying rate of average earnings growth edged up to 4 per
cent in October, from 3.75 per cent in September. The Department of
Employment said overtime and bonus payments, rather than higher pay
settlements, had led to the rise.
However, the rise in average earnings has yet to have an effect on UK
manufacturing competitiveness, since productivity is outstripping wages
growth. In the three months to October, manufacturing unit labour costs were
1.7 per cent lower than in the same period of 1993, the sharpest fall since
records began in 1970.
Unemployment fell below 2.5m for the first time in three years, with the
number of people claiming benefit dropping a seasonally adjusted 43,400 in
November to 2.47m, or 8.8 per cent of the workforce.
Employment, as measured by a survey of employers, rose by 146,000 in the
third quarter, the highest quarterly increase since 1989. Previous surveys
had shown it static, or falling.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Thai minister quits in land row: No-confidence vote avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's agriculture minister resigned yesterday, averting a no-confidence
motion that could have shaken the government anew just days after the
defection of a key party in the ruling coalition, Agencies report from
Bangkok.
The opposition had planned to call a no-confidence motion today against the
minister, Mr Niphon Promphan, and his former deputy, Mr Suthep Thueksuban,
because of allegations that Mr Suthep had manipulated a land reform
programme to favour rich landowners.
Mr Niphon submitted his resignation to Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, to
take responsibility for the scandal threatening to taint the government and
Mr Chuan's Democrat party. Both Mr Niphon and Mr Suthep, members of the
Democrat party, insist they are innocent.
Mr Suthep resigned as deputy agriculture minister last week, saying it would
allow him to defend his actions without being accused of trying to cling to
his position.
A no-confidence motion could have opened more divisions in the two-year-old
Chuan administration days after it was thrown into crisis by the withdrawal
last Friday of the New Aspiration party. The party, the second largest in
the coalition, pulled out after siding with the opposition to vote down
democratic reforms.
On Monday the Chart Pattana (National Development) party agreed to bring its
60 seats to the government, giving the coalition 201 votes in the 360-seat
House of Representatives.
Mr Chuan's Democrat party will take over the all-important interior ministry
in a cabinet reshuffle caused by last week's defection of the coalition
partner, party officials said yesterday.
Mr Sanan Kachornprasart, now industry minister, will take over the interior
portfolio, whose responsibilities include police and local government. The
interior post was vacated by General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the New
Aspiration party leader, when his party withdrew from the government.
Mr Sanan, who is also Democrat party secretary general, said Chart Pattana
would get 14 of the 45 government ministry portfolios, including deputy
prime minister and junior minister posts.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Hungary fails to appoint new bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's Socialist-led government was last night preparing to appoint a
temporary central bank governor after failing to find a replacement for Mr
Peter Akos Bod, who announced three weeks ago he would step down today.
Mr Bod, a political appointee of the former conservative administration, was
forced out midway through his six-year term. Government officials said Mr
Gyorgy Szapary, one of five deputy governors, would take over in a temporary
capacity.
The failure to find a new governor was a political embarrassment for the
government, analysts and western diplomats said. The appointment of a new
governor, who will have responsibility for monetary policy, is a litmus test
of the government's commitment to economic reform at a time when Hungary is
under pressure to reduce its large current account and budget deficits and
prevent its Dollars 26bn foreign debt from rising further.
Cuts in spending, however, are being resisted by trade unions.
In the summer Mr Gyula Horn, prime minister, said he favoured Mr Gyorgy
Suranyi, a highly-respected former central bank governor, as a successor to
Mr Bod.
But the issue has fallen victim to political infighting between the
Socialists, their Free Democrat partners, and factions of the Socialist
party.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Horn, who represents the left wing of
the Socialist party, will accept the pre-conditions set by Mr Suranyi, a
tough-minded technocrat who was sacked as governor by the former government.
He is believed to have demanded full central bank independence and a say in
economic policies and in appointing deputy governors.
Mr Suranyi is also a strong advocate of strict monetary policy and of a
reduction in the budget deficit, which is expected to exceed 7 per cent of
gross domestic product this year.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: OTC outstandings may top
Dollars 30,000bn - Derivative Instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The total value of outstandings in the over-the-counter derivatives market
seems likely to exceed Dollars 30,000bn by the end of this year, according
to Swaps Monitor, the specialist New York-based publication.
The projections - based on limited information currently available - imply
growth this year of at least 20 per cent.
Swaps Monitor estimates that the global market in interest rates swaps - one
of the most popular derivatives contracts - will be more than Dollars
12,000bn compared with Dollars 8,200bn in 1993.
The 1994 projections are contained in the publication's annual review of the
derivatives industry*, which consists of a comprehensive breakdown of
figures for 1993.
The survey shows that the outstanding value of OTC contracts increased by 20
per cent last year to reach Dollars 25,500bn. Foreign exchange forward
contracts - the biggest single class of business - increased to Dollars
9,500bn from Dollars 8,400bn.
The outstanding value of forward rate agreements and interest rate options
also rose, to Dollars 3,500bn from Dollars 3,300bn and to Dollars 2,000bn
from Dollars 1,200bn, respectively.
The survey also indicates that there is a high degree of concentration in
the OTC market with a few large players controlling large chunks of
business.

Airbus Finance, the finance company established by Airbus Industrie, the

The loan, arranged by J. P Morgan, which also advised the company, launched
as a Dollars 1bn deal but increased to Dollars 1.5bn after receiving an
enthusiastic response from banks. It was syndicated among banks that already
had a relationship with the company, which intends to return to the
syndicated loans market and also to eventually tap the international capital
markets.
Airbus Industries' four shareholders, Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz
of Germany, British Aerospace of Britain and Construcciones Aeronauticas of
Spain, have guaranteed the seven-year loan, which was launched with an
interest rate of 30 basis points above Libor for the first four years of the
loan and 35 basis points over Libor for the remaining three years.
Using Airbus Finance to raise the loan eases the strain on the balance
sheets of the four partners in the project, and eventually it is hoped the
company, which will provide finance to Airbus Industries customers for the
purchase of aircraft, will become a separately rated stand-alone company.

Two of Finland's leading industrial groups, Outokumpu and Tampella,
yesterday announced moves to restructure the country's mining technology
sector and enhance mutual co-operation, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm.
Outokumpu is selling two of its units to Tampella. In return it will gain 7m
Tampella shares worth FM126m (Dollars 26m), giving it a 7 per cent stake in
the company.
The units being sold are Rammer, which manufactures hydraulic hammers and
breakerboom systems, and Roxon, the world's biggest manufacturer of bulk
handling conveyor components. Rammer's 1994 sales are estimated at FM230m
and Roxon's at FM420m.

Shares in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group which is
majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc of France, fell 8 per cent yesterday as the
company's most promising new drug application was rejected by US regulators,
writes Richard Waters in New York.
The Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee on cancer drugs voted
to turn down an application to market Taxotere as a treatment for advanced
breast cancer and some types of lung cancer. The application had been made
under the FDA's advanced approval process, which is intended to by-pass some
of the normal time consuming late-stage trials for drugs which are believed
to have important medical benefits.
The shares fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 38, having risen strongly on Monday
in the expectation of a favourable outcome.

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the leading supplier of software for personal computer networks and
Microsoft's biggest rival in the personal computer software market, reported
a decline in fourth-quarter earnings.
Sales of PC applications programs fell, largely because of delays in the
introduction of a planned suite of office software. Novell said it would
launch the long-awaited product, Perfect Office, today.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter to October 29, totalled Dollars 20m, or
6 cents a share, after Dollars 61m merger and restructuring charges.
Excluding the charges, earnings were Dollars 61m, or 17 cents, below Wall
Street forecasts of about 22 cents.
In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 103m, or 28 cents,
before charges, and Dollars 88m, or 24 cents, after charges.
Revenues for the quarter declined 5 per cent to Dollars 486m from Dollars
509m last year.
The 1994 charges relate to Novell's acquisition of WordPerfect, a PC
applications software publisher, and Borland International's spreadsheet
products. Charges in 1993 were in connection with Novell's acquisition of
UNIX System Laboratories.
For the full year, Novell reported revenues of Dollars 2bn, up 9 per cent
from Dollars 1.83bn in fiscal 1993. Net income was Dollars 207m, or 56 cents
a share, compared with Dollars 41m, or 11 cents. The results include
non-recurring charges of Dollars 196m in 1994 and Dollars 357m in 1993.
Total revenue grew 9 per cent from a year earlier, although it varied across
product groups.
Sales of Novell's flagship NetWare program were up 11 per cent at Dollars
1bn.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Slavs] - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only does the playwright Tony Kushner take on the most difficult themes
of the era we live in, he also links them together. In his new 90-minute
Slavs] (Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness),
as in his widely-acclaimed two-part Angels in America, he somehow yokes the
collapse of Soviet communism to the new prominence of homosexuality and a
great deal else besides. And he manages to show the full seriousness of the
situation he is presenting while relieving it with humour and a range of
different characters. The sheer scope of his ambition is refreshing.
Yet to my mind Kushner is a lightweight. For all its massive historical,
political, socio-economic, psychosexual, and metaphysical range, I never
felt that Angels in America was any larger in spirit than a soap opera,
albeit vivid and touching and entertaining. (My reaction did not change even
when I had seen productions on both sides of the Atlantic).
Slavs] is not soap-opera but satire. It does not flit between disparate
narrative threads, as did Angels in America, and it has a less gossipy
concern with what will happen next to whom. But here again his characters
have both the vitality and the shallowness of cartoons, and here again he
interconnects them in a way that rings hollow. We see that he has assembled
them to illustrate strategically the contrasting symptoms of the State of
Things Today.
Thus the alcoholic and nihilistic Katherina Sesafina Gleb, a warden of the
Pan-Soviet archive (guarding the bottled brains of Lenin and other
ex-comrades) in 1985 (Act Two), is here the lesbian girlfriend of socialist
Doctor Bonfila Bezhukhovna Bonch-Bruevich, who in 1992 (Act Three) reveals
the disastrous medical effects of Russian nuclear and chemical pollution
upon Siberia and elsewhere. Lesbians, alcoholism, Leninism, socialism,
pollution, medicine, the past, the future: yes, what a nexus] And how
perverse that, for all the vehemence Kushner gives these characters, he
cannot give either of them much substance.
Slavs] begins with the kind of hilarious stroke that we expect to find not
in a play but in TV satire. Two Muscovite street-cleaners - brushing away
the snow as they talk - are talking to each other, in lengthy and perfect
sentences, of what political conclusions to draw from studying history from
Marx and Engels. Peculiar, however, is the way Kushner keeps this joke going
throughout the play.
It would be hard to make a better case for this British premiere of the play
than is being made at the Hampstead Theatre, where Matthew Lloyd directs a
generally superb cast. Design, by Ultz, is economical and effective. Lloyd
keeps Kushner's satiric tone keenly to the fore while stressing humanity
where he can. Imelda Staunton's performance is more real than the words she
speaks. She shows us the quiet, caring, troubled mind and nervous system of
the lesbian Doctor Bonch-Bruevich. A wonderful actress. Annette Badland is
just as fine as Mrs Shastlivyi Domik, blasting with great sincerity through
an oration that starts forcefully and climbs in intensity from there.
Paul Jesson is excellent as Ippolite Ippopolitovich Popolitipov, a Soviet
official who has the misfortune to be in love with the same woman as Dr
Bonch-Bruevich. Peter Copley and Richard Mayes are first-rate as Aleksii
Antedilluvianovich Prelapsarianov (the world's oldest Bolshevik) and Serge
Esmereldovich Upgobkin. Ron Cook has to play Yegor Tremens Rodent, the kind
of weak character whom Kushner needs in his plays so that every more
right-thinking character can worst him in argument. Only Aisling O'Sullivan
lets the side down as the alcoholic lesbian Katherina Gleb. Presence and
force, sure, but no coherent detail. (I never believed in her alcoholism.) A
cast like this should reach the West End; a play like Slavs] should not.
At the Hampstead Theatre, NW3.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Drop in liquidity hints at recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidity position of large UK companies worsened in the third quarter
of 1994, the first deterioration in almost two years.
But the statistics may show that British companies are now confident enough
in the recovery to invest in new plant and equipment.
'It is the first indication that companies are happier with their balance
sheets and will now attempt to take on debt to finance expansion,' said Mr
David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office released yesterday showed that
the liquidity of all large companies  - as measured by the ratio of total
current assets to total current liabilities  - fell from 147 per cent in the
second quarter to 142 per cent in the third.
The last time the ratio fell was between the third and fourth quarters of
1992.
Companies have substantially improved their liquidity position since the
peak of the boom in 1989.
In that year, the ratio dropped to 96 per cent.
Among manufacturing companies, the ratio dipped from 127 per cent in the
second quarter to 124 per cent in the third quarter.
Among non-manufacturers, the ratio dropped from 178 per cent to 167 per
cent.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Australia raises rates to 7.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Official interest rates in Australia were raised by a full one percentage
point to 7.5 per cent early today, the third upward adjustment since August.
The Reserve Bank of Australia made its move at 9.30 am local time, as
markets opened.
The action was widely expected a week ago, following the regular meeting of
the RBA board, and acknowledgments by both Mr Bernie Fraser, the RBA
governor, and Mr Ralph Willis, the nation's treasurer, that the surge in the
Australian economy needed to be moderated before it threatened the country's
inflation rate. Economists, puzzled by last week's inaction, welcomed
today's move, but suggested that a further increase might still be necessary
in the first quarter of 1995.
Figures published two weeks ago showed that the Australian economy grew by a
rate of 6.4 per cent, year-on-year, in the September quarter, and by 7.3 per
cent if the drought-depressed farm sector was excluded. This is the fastest
rate posted by any OECD country in the current global recovery.
Most economists believe that growth rates in excess of five per cent will be
destabilising in the medium-term, although the nation's inflation rate
remains under 2 per cent at present.
Ahead of today's move, the RBA had already lifted official interest rates by
a total of 175 basis points over the past four months - the first move
coming in August and the second, in late-October.
Mr Willis said today's rate rise reflected the government and Reserve Bank's
commitment 'to maintain a low inflation environment and encourage further
significant and sustained reductions in unemployment'. The government has
also hinted recently that it may use fiscal means to depress demand. Earlier
this week, in Sydney, Mr Willis indicated that higher taxes might be
considered as part of the mid-year review in January, although he gave no
hints about the type of changes which might result.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Orange County to liquidate rest of portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Orange County, the Californian local authority which filed for bankruptcy
last week, has decided to liquidate the remains of its battered Dollars 20bn
investment holdings, a move it said would cap its losses at Dollars 2.02bn.
The figure, which compares with an estimate of Dollars 1.5bn issued less
than two weeks ago, represents the biggest single loss suffered in this
year's collapse in the US bond markets. It rounds off a year in which a
number of hedge funds, financial institutions and companies have taken
well-publicised losses from speculating on bond price rises.
The move to sell off the remaining securities, which the county valued
yesterday at Dollars 8bn, follows a fire-sale of some Dollars 12bn of bonds
and other instruments by a number of US and foreign investment banks. These
securities had been held as collateral against loans made to the county
under so-called reverse repurchase agreements.
Mr Thomas Hayes, the former auditor general of California who was brought in
by Orange County last Thursday to sort out the investment mess, said the
decision to sell the securities was intended to protect the county against
further losses.
The county had said that a further one percentage point rise in US interest
rates, which have risen two and a half percentage points this year, would
have cut the value of its original Dollars 20bn portfolio by Dollars 300m.
Under the plan agreed yesterday, the county has authorised Salomon Brothers
to liquidate its holdings through an 'orderly sale' over the next 90 days.
However, with the Federal Reserve Board due to meet next Tuesday to review
interest rate policy, Salomon is believed to have moved immediately to hedge
the portfolio against any further rate rises.
Of the remaining Dollars 8bn of securities, some Dollars 5.4bn belongs to
187 different municipal authorities, school districts, transport authorities
and others who invested their money with the county authorities. The rest is
held by financial institutions as security against loans.
Some 60 per cent of the remaining portfolio is made up of financial
instruments which are highly vulnerable to rises in interest rates, the
county said.

Hungary's Socialist-led government was last night preparing to appoint a
temporary central bank governor after failing to find a replacement for Mr
Peter Akos Bod, who announced three weeks ago he would step down today. Mr
Bod, a political appointee of the former conservative administration, was
forced out half-way through his six-year term. Government officials said Mr
Gyorgy Szapary, one of five deputy governors, would take over in a temporary
capacity.

FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rec speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid speculation enlivened the regional electricity companies (recs) sector
as rumours that a takeover offer for Northern Electricity is imminent did
the rounds. The stock climbed 23 to 910p on 3.1m turnover.
The new speculation centred on international trading group Jardine Matheson,
with the talk suggesting it would be a way for the group to move funds out
of Hong Kong and into the UK. However, a bid from Scottish Power or Hanson,
both mentioned last week as possible predators, was not ruled out by some
observers.
Further buying of the stock was encouraged by a clutch of broker
recommendations. NatWest Securities advised clients to buy Northern but
warned: 'There is a possibility of corporate activity in the sector and
Northern looks as likely a target as any. However, with the (sale of the
National) Grid details not yet known, we believe the timing is wrong.'
Smith New Court recommended the recs as a whole, and Mr Kevin Lapwood at the
brokerage said: 'On fundamentals these stocks are cheap.' Scottish Power
hardened 1 1/2 to 331 1/2 p.
Interest rate concern appeared to spread rapidly across the building
materials sector, making deep inroads into a number of shares and leading to
heavy volumes.
Tarmac traded 12m shares, including a single deal of 4.7m, Caradon saw 3.3m
turnover, while plumbing specialist Spring Ram, boosted by the sale of a
block of family trust shares, soared to 30m trades.
Rugby was the stock most troubled by the industry's fears for an interest
rate led slide in demand, tumbling more than 5 per cent, with the shares
down 6 at 105p in 2.7m turnover. Blue Circle fell 6 to 274p on 2m traded,
RMC retreated 21 to 969p and Tarmac ended a penny adrift at 113 1/2 p.
Caradon finished 2 lower at 228p.
Behind the Spring Ram volume was a big deal by BZW, which sold 15m shares,
or 3.3 per cent of the group's equity, on behalf of the family trust of Mr
Bill Rooney, former Spring Ram chairman.
Favourable press comment and a general feeling that the recent concerns over
Christmas trading had been overdone boosted several of the leading retail
stocks. Marks &amp; Spencer rose 5 1/2 to 375p, but renewed doubts about the
trading picture at Kingfisher saw the shares relinquish an early lead of 10
to end just 2 up at 422p.
Bid excitement in the merchant banking sector faded slightly yesterday as
profit-taking saw all the major candidates retreat. SG Warburg, under the
scrutiny of Morgan Stanley, slipped 9 to 784p, while its 75 per cent-owned
fund management arm Mercury Asset Management dropped 32 to 718p.
Oil majors Shell and BP were firm ahead of BP's showpiece annual
presentation today and talk that one leading US broker had been recommending
the stock. Dealers cited CJ Lawrence, but veteran analyst Mr Charles Maxwell
said that with crude prices still under pressure it was premature to expect
a rally.
Paper group David S. Smith surprised the market with figures well above
forecasts but the shares barely moved. It appeared that an earlier sell
recommendation from one house had led to a line of 1.6m shares being placed
and not finding a home.
Consequently, interims of Pounds 40.4m, against Pounds 13.7m last time, and
a very upbeat trading statement saw the shares firm only a penny to 499p.
Nevertheless, analysts were upgrading forecasts, with a confident James
Capel boosting its prediction by Pounds 23m to Pounds 95m, believed to be
the top end of the range.
Elsewhere in the sector, James Capel turned seller on Arjo Wiggins Appleton,
cutting by Pounds 20m its figures for 1995 and 1996 to Pounds 260m and
Pounds 310m respectively. The house made the move to reflect the squeeze on
margins in the US. Arjo slipped 4 1/2 to 246 1/2 p.
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham moved ahead strongly as some of the
company's supporters stressed their enthusiasm following a positive global
conference on Monday.
Smith New Court reiterated its positive stance and edged up some of its long
term forecasts, analyst Mr Paul Woodhouse arguing that if the stock were to
return to an acceptable rating, then it had a 20 per cent upside from
current levels. The 'A' shares appreciated 11 to 434 1/2 p, with combined
turnover in the 'A' stock and Units hitting 11.6m.
Chemicals group BOC fell 9 to 707p in reaction to a sell recommendation from
Credit Lyonnais Laing. Meanwhile, BTP held steady at 285p, with Hoare Govett
presenting it as a buying opportunity.
Vague bid speculation was heard elsewhere in the recs. Talk that Southern
Electricity, which reported bumper interim figures, may be thinking of a
takeover offer for a water company in a neighbouring area checked a further
advance in its shares. They closed 6 up at 756p. In addition, Seeboard and
South West Electricity were mentioned as possible targets. The former jumped
21 to 421p, while the latter climbed 31 to 788p.
Transport group NFC moved ahead strongly in 5m volume on the announcement
that a board member was a big, personal buyer of the shares. Sir Christopher
Bland, who takes up the post of chairman next month, has purchased 500,000
shares at 146 1/2 p. The news pushed NFC up 6 to 153p.
Diversified industrial groups BTR and Hanson were again two of the most
active Footsie stocks, with a combined 19.4m shares traded as talk of
switching out of Hanson persisted. Hanson closed fractionally lower at 227
1/2 p after 10m turnover, while BTR shed 1 1/2 to 277p.

FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Keen buying of Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street retailing group Boots jumped 11 to 469 1/2 p, making it one of
the day's best performing FT-SE 100 stocks. Volume reached a healthy 4.6m
shares.
Part of the day's rise was attributed to buying from a number of
institutions that sold stock to the company last month as part of Boots'
Pounds 500m share buy-back scheme. Some gross funds feared that active
dealing in the shares would compromise prospects for receiving the related
Advanced Corporation Tax rebate from the Inland Revenue.
One market specialist said: 'Those payments have been received by some
institutions and they now feel able to move into the market and buy Boots
shares.'
A feeling that recent worries about Christmas trading had been overdone also
played a part in boosting sentiment.

FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early rise in shares eroded by sell
programme - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sizeable sell programme executed in mid-morning put paid to any chances of
the UK equity market maintaining an early strong rally.
Also affecting sentiment was another disappointing performance by the gilts
market ahead of this morning's crucial economic data, which sees the
publication of inflation figures for November, monthly unemployment details,
news of underlying average earnings for October and unit wage costs for the
latest three months.
There was no real pressure, however, from across the Atlantic, where Wall
Street was never anything but steady and marginally higher on balance well
after London closed. Strategists said US markets had given a steadfast
response to the day's economic news, which showed a surprisingly good core
rise in producer prices but worryingly high retail sales that were well
above consensus forecasts.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which had fallen more than 2 per cent over the previous
two sessions, managed to end the day 3.0 up at 2,946.4. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index never looked like matching the FT-SE 100's early performance and
eventually settled 0.8 firmer at 3,373.2.
Dealers said the market had also been restrained by various technical
factors affecting markets across the globe. The FT-SE future December
contract expires on Friday, as does a series of German derivatives
instruments. Friday also brings 'triple witching hour' in the US, where all
the major derivatives contracts expire. Such expiries are often the trigger
for exaggerated movements in international stock markets.
The Footsie kicked off yesterday morning in good shape, opening almost 20
points better at 2,946.4, thanks mainly to a solid overnight performance
from Wall Street, where the Dow index continued to confound the pundits by
closing some 27 points higher.
But there was little institutional business in London and prices quickly
began to trickle back, influenced also by a retreat by some European equity
markets, notably Germany, which was hit by a Morgan Stanley downgrade.
In mid-morning the full force of a sizeable sell programme saw early gains
entirely wiped out and the FT-SE 100 Index fell into negative territory,
eventually hitting a session's low of 2,938.8, down a net 4.6.
Thereafter, share prices embarked on a slow recovery, moving back to
positive territory after Wall Street delivered a reassuring opening.
The latest Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades,
although pointing to a continued slowdown in sales, failed to cause any
damage in the retailing sectors, which have underperformed the market by a
considerable amount this year. The stores sector provided two of the FT-SE
100's best performers on the day in Boots and Marks and Spencer.
Marketmakers mostly remained unconvinced with the market's performance and
were noticeably wary of Wall Street. 'I am still sure we will see Wall
Street upsetting the applecart,' said one senior dealer. He added that the
London market had been 'blown around in a light breeze' and fund managers
remained unconvinced about short term opportunities.
He did not rule out, however, the chances of a rerun of the big gains in the
market between Christmas and the new year when derivatives activity, mostly
featuring tailor-made OTC trades, reaches a peak.
Regional electricity stocks provided some of the sharpest action in the
market, with Southern Electricity continuing the long list of 20 per
cent-plus interim dividend increases and the takeover speculation in
Northern Electricity continuing to build.
Turnover in equities reached a healthy 685.7m shares, with activity in
non-Footsie stocks accounting for over half the total. Customer business on
Monday was worth Pounds 1.4bn.

FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the absence of leads from both the London and New York cash markets,
stock index futures traded narr-owly in thin volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 2,939,
up five points. The discount to the cash market was nine points, or around
10 points under fair value.
With the December contract expiring on Friday, dealers have begun to focus
more fully on the March counter, which closed at 2,952  - 10 points below
fair value.
Dealers said business was thin even by recent standards. Allowing for spread
trading into the March contract, the December contract notched little more
than 9,000 lots.
The morning session saw a smattering of medium-sized deals, with UBS in
evidence, but nearly all of the business was intra-dealer trading. Retail
investors were nowhere to be seen. The December contract traded within a
24-point arc.
By contrast, the traded option market was relatively busy, volume jumping to
39,329 contracts, from 28,048 on Monday. Call deals had a slight edge over
puts, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 23,000 lots.
Fisons was the star performer among individual options, with just under
4,000 contracts traded. Guinness (1,187 lots) and Hanson (987) were also
active.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico extends fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock prices extended their slide after peasant rebels threatened a
declaration of war in Chiapas.
The IPC index closed 59.80 or 2.42 per cent lower at 2,407.99 - at the end
of 1993 the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Turnover totalled a light 445m new pesos,
on 30m shares traded. Technical analysts said that if the market broke the
support level at 2,400, it could go into a freefall.
The leader of the Zapatista rebels issued a communique last night warning of
an 'imminent' return to war.
Last week the rebels announced that they were breaking an 11-month ceasefire
with the government which was signed shortly after they began their armed
conflict last January.
The move sparked a drop in the peso, which settled in Mexico City at an
historic low versus the dollar. The latter rose to 3.4555 new pesos, from
3.4485 new pesos on Friday. The market was closed on Monday. The dollar's
previous high was 3.4523 new pesos on November 18.
Brazil
The Sao Paulo bourse finished slightly higher after a last-minute scramble
over options pushed prices above their opening levels. The Bovespa index was
ahead 220 or 0.5 per cent at 48,351.
A stockbroker said trading was 'very weak' yesterday in low volume, with
shares down on the day until half an hour before closing, when one or two
big players pushed prices up in options trading. Options expire next Monday.
A speech by the president of Brazil's National Development Bank, who has
been nominated as the next president of the central bank, was well received
by the market.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Contradictory signals leave
Dow easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares fluctuated in a narrow range yesterday in the wake of
contradictory signals about the strength of inflationary pressures in the
economy, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.03 at 3,715.34. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.68 at 450.15, the American
SE composite eased 0.57 to 420.23 and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.36 to
719.48. New York SE volume came to 307m shares.
After falling modestly shortly after the opening bell, the market turned up
on the heels of soaring long bond prices and hovered near Monday's close for
the rest of the day. The 30-year bond gained more than half a point in
morning trading and some believed that the fixed-income market had now
factored in another interest rate increase later this month or early next
year.
Although the producer price index for November grew for the first time since
August, the increase of 0.5 per cent was well in line with economists'
expectations. A sub-index of intermediate goods was up 1.1 per cent, the
biggest monthly rise in four years, suggesting inflationary pressures at
work in earlier stages of the production cycle.
More signs of potential inflation came from strong retail sales figures
released by the Commerce Department. Throughout November, consumer spending
grew at an annual rate in excess of 10 per cent for the fourth quarter, more
than double last quarter's rate. And retail sales grew 1.2 per cent for the
month, more than double economists' forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth.
In spite of the signs of strong consumer demand, shares in retail stocks
were mixed. Sears Roebuck gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 45 1/8 , Woolworth
rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 14 1/4 , Federated Department Stores firmed
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 and the Gap was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
32. Retailers posting declines included Kmart, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars
14 1/8 , Dayton Hudson, Dollars  5/8 off at Dollars 77 7/8 , and the
Limited, Dollars  1/8 softer at Dollars 18 5/8 . Dillard Department Store
was unchanged at Dollars 26 5/8 .
Shares in commercial banks, which tend to be especially sensitive to
interest rate changes, rose sharply. JP Morgan gained Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 59 1/8 , Wells Fargo advanced Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 146 1/2 ,
Chemical Banking put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 37 7/8 , Bankers Trust moved
ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 and Citicorp was up Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 41 3/4 .
Philip Morris fell in the morning after a court ruled late on Monday that
airline crews could sue the company over the health effects of passive
smoking. By the close, however, the stock had rebounded to gain Dollars 1 at
Dollars 57 3/4 .
Canada
Equities in Toronto were relatively flat on the mixed economic data out of
the US yesterday. Strength in gold shares, posting their fifth straight
strong session after weeks on the downside, helped to offset a bad day for
metal mining issues and financial services stocks.
The TSE 300 index lost 0.68 point at 4,044.41, while rises led falls by 393
to 367 after volume of 58.7m shares. The golds group added 1.47 per cent.

Johannesburg saw mixed trade as bullion firmness helped to lift related
stocks, while industrials remained dull amid a lack of direction.
The overall index added 10.7 at 5,659.6, the industrials index ended 22.2
lower at 6,797.4 and the golds index was 21.9 better at 1,899.2.
Futures were steady after Wall Street gains, but also struggled to post
significant rises ahead of tomorrow's expiry of options.
Among individual shares, De Beers improved R1 to R90.75, Anglos moved
forward R1.75 to R222.50 and Gencor finished 10 cents better at R13.75.
SAB relinquished R1.25 at R94, while Sasol closed 50 cents cheaper at
R31.50.

Tokyo continued to slide as investors, taking little encouragement from
Monday's New York rebound and yesterday's gains in Hong Kong, stayed on the
sell side, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average declined for the third straight day, losing 99.62 at
18,875.48 in volume estimated at 220m shares, up from Monday's 192.5m. The
index moved within a narrow range, recording an early high of 19,017.10 and
a low of 18,822.56.
The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 6.11 to 1,497.67,
breaking 1,500 for the first time in about two weeks. Losers once again led
winners, by 741 to 219, with 85 stocks making new lows for the year and 186
ending flat. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 edged down 0.80 to 276.49, but
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.60 to 1,247.19.
Arbitrage buying, encouraged by futures gains, took the market slightly
higher in early trading but hedge sales by institutions undercut futures,
and underlying stocks followed futures down, until buying by public fund
managers and bargain hunters re-emerged late in the day.
Japan Tobacco reflected the bearish tone, as it reached an intraday low of
Y901,000 before picking up to finish at Y906,000, off Y14,000 and at its
fourth new low in as many sessions. Other privatised stocks moved up. East
Japan Railway put on Y2,000 at Y471,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
advanced Y3,000 to Y833,000. Odakyu Electric Railway gained Y7 at Y707 in
the day's second highest volume of 3.2m shares.
Steels were mixed: Kobe Steel, which on Monday announced plans to produce
semi-finished steel products in Venezuela, added Y4 at Y300. Nippon Steel
stayed at Y349 after 6.9m shares traded, the day's highest turnover.
Kawasaki Steel dipped Y4 to Y393 and NKK firmed Y3 to Y265.
Department store chain Yokohama Matsuzakaya revisited its 1994 high of Y600
before falling back to close at Y535, down Y10. On Monday, amid rumours that
overseas Chinese and Korean funds had targeted the stock, it had climbed
Y80, the maximum allowable in one day.
Toymaker Bandai, which revealed plans to market a CD-ROM player based on
Apple Computer's Pippin, a PowerPC-based multimedia platform, slipped Y10 to
Y4,160. Other game industry players also lost ground. Nintendo shed Y140 to
Y5,460 and Sega Industries Y90 to Y5,650.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 129.50 off at 20,757.69 in volume of 13.7m
shares.
Roundup
The region searched for direction yesterday.
HONG KONG bounced 1.8 per cent on short-covering after recent falls, the
Hang Seng index rising 141.97 to 7,849.75.
SG Warburg raised the market to neutral from underweight on a 12-month view,
but remained underweight on a three-month basis, noting that it would remain
sensitive to rising US interest rates.
Jardine Matheson topped net gainers, rising HKDollars 1.75 or 3.2 per cent
to HKDollars 55.75; HSBC added HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 81.75.
Property and banking stocks made gains throughout the day on switching. Hang
Seng Bank moved ahead HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 54.25, Swire Pacific 'A'
HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 43.70 and Sun Hung Kai Properties 80 cents to
HKDollars 46.50.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 17.46 or 1.8
per cent to 995.08. Chengdu Telecom H-shares dropped to HKDollars 2.425, on
their debut, from an offer price of HKDollars 2.80 on fears about the
Chinese economy.
SEOUL fell 1.6 per cent amid worries that higher interest rates would prompt
a liquidity squeeze. The composite index receded 16.89 to 1,025.89.
Profit-taking pressured bank, construction and trading shares, which gained
on Monday. The construction sub-index lost 1.6 per cent.
Korea Mobile Telecom, however, improved Won2,500 to Won425,000, its first
gain since November 29.
KUALA LUMPUR staged a technical rebound, boosted by the overnight Wall
Street rise and firmer regional markets, but brokers said the rally may be
short-lived as funds are still waiting to sell. The composite index put on
4.64 at 900.41.
Idris Hydraulic was actively traded, advancing 38 cents to MDollars 4.28 on
bargain hunting. The newly listed Diethelm Holdings surged ahead to a high
of MDollars 3.48 before closing at MDollars 3.16, against its initial public
offer price of MDollars 1.80.
TAIPEI fell away as some investors continued to be worried that local funds
would sell shares to meet dividend payments. The weighted index declined
24.83 to 6,697.57 in turnover of TDollars 53bn.
Financials failed to sustain an early rise driven by speculation that the
inauguration of the ruling Nationalist party's candidate as a provincial
governor on December 20 would boost prices. First Commercial Bank shed
TDollars 1 to TDollars 189 after an intraday high of TDollars 193.
SYDNEY was subdued, but with bargain hunting among leading industrials
pushing the All Ordinaries index up 10.7 to 1,852.7, its high for the day.
Leading mining stocks were mixed, with CRA up 14 cents at ADollars 17.20 but
MIM a cent easier at ADollars 2.20 and WMC off 14 cents at ADollars 7.02.
Banks were mixed overall: firmness among the leaders was seen as a cyclical
move away from regional banks, due to their larger exposure to the corporate
lending market where demand for funds is expected to hold firm over the next
year or so. CBA rose 11 cents to ADollars 8.05 and Westpac by 10 cents to
ADollars 4.
BANGKOK finished higher in spite of profit-taking in the afternoon session
 -which followed a strong morning rise on news that one of the opposition
parties was to join the governing coalition.
The SET index put on 27.08 at 1,305.58, off the day's high of 1,320.58, in
turnover of Bt6.5bn.
In the banking sector, Krung Thai Bank gained Bt4 at Bt79 and Bangkok Bank
rose Bt6 to Bt186. Asia Equity upgraded its forecasts for 1994 earnings
growth from 21.4 per cent to 29.7 per cent in this sector on the basis of
its good performance over the previous nine months.
BOMBAY retreated another 1.4 per cent in further response to the Congress
party losses in key state polls, the BSE 30-share index finishing 54.43
lower at 3,830.05.
Small investors were said to have been the main sellers, with mutual funds
scaling down their divestment, compared with Monday.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Meeting of minds on prospects
for Milan bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting of minds at Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg produced parallel
recommendations for the recently belaboured Italian equity market, writes
Our Markets Staff.
Mr Richard Davidson, European strategist for Morgan Stanley, lifted Italian
exposure from 4.5 to 7.5 per cent in his European model portfolio, and cut
Germany's from 11.5 to an underweight 8.5 per cent.
Italian politics were fully discounted in current share prices, said Mr
Davidson, adding that an undervalued currency, good profits growth, an
underpriced stock market and some of the country's best ever economic
fundamentals were being overlooked.
Germany's 1995 profits growth, he said, was discounted in a prospective p/e
of 19.8, against Italy's 15 1/2 , and a price/cash flow multiple of 4.8
against 3.3; the economy was in good shape but interest rates were set to
rise next year.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrew Garthwaite at SG Warburg reiterated his recommendation
for Italy, saying it remained, with France, one of his two favourite markets
in continental Europe. He said that on a two-year view, investors risked
underestimating earnings recovery in Italy.
FRANKFURT recovered most of Monday's post-bourse losses. While the Dax index
showed a fall of 13.57 to 2,011.25 on the session, the Ibis-indicated level
rose 15.49 to 2,019.13 by the end of the afternoon.
Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM4.8bn. There were useful recoveries by
Allianz and Deutsche Bank in financials, but sentiment was lifted more by
progress reports from Conti, the tyremaker, which rose DM5.40 to DM219.40;
and Degussa, the chemicals and metals group, up another DM4.50 to DM432.
Other industrials to do well included MAN, Preussag and Siemens.
In the service sector, Karstadt, the department stores group, dropped DM5.60
to DM540 after German retail sales fell again; but Lufthansa rose DM4.80 to
DM190.30 as a buy note for the airline coincided with technical factors.
MILAN staged a technical bounce after sharp falls in recent sessions. The
Comit index registered a loss of 4.55 at 581.64, but the real-time Mibtel
index picked up 171 or 1.9 per cent to 9,436, reflecting late short-covering
ahead of today's close of the monthly account.
News that opposition parties had withdrawn amendments to speed the budget
through parliament were viewed as a positive sign, as was a growing
acceptance that the present coalition's days were numbered and that an end
might soon be in sight to the increasingly acrimonious political crisis.
However, the mood remained nervous as investors awaited the outcome of the
prime minister's questioning by Milan magistrates in connection with alleged
corruption.
Among the blue chips, Fiat rose L106 or 1.9 per cent to L5,496, Generali
rebounded L865 or 2.5 per cent to L35,305 and Olivetti was L64 or 3.4 per
cent higher at L1,864.
PARIS lost early ground, and then recovered in line with Wall Street. The
CAC-40 index was off 2.21 at 1,917.11, after a high for the session of 1,921
and a low of 1,903. Turnover remained modest, at FFr3bn.
In an assessment of the decision by Mr Jacques Delors not to contest next
year's pres-idential election, James Capel noted that the effect on
financial markets was likely to be negative. One of the reasons, it said,
was because a Balladur/Delors duel had already been factored in, 'and the
markets knew what to expect in terms of policy, whatever the outcome'.
AGF, the insurance group, followed the trend of the sector  - the sub-index
slipped 2.40 to 1,068.72  - with a loss of FFr4 to FFr220 bringing its fall
from the start of the year to some 40 per cent. In common with other finance
companies, AGF has been affected by poor results, exposure to a weak
property sector and losses on its bond portfolio.
Elsewhere among financials, SocGen dipped FFr3 to FFr595, Bancaire FFr1 to
FFr543 and Paribas FFr3.40 to FFr375.80.
ZURICH made little progress in quiet conditions, although some selective
demand emerged for blue chips in the wake of the day's US economic data.
The SMI index finished 3.2 higher at 2,566.0.
UBS bearers fell a further SFr13 to SFr1,071 amid reports that one US broker
had said that the stock could fall by another 10 per cent.
MADRID revived in the afternoon and recovered some of its morning losses,
cheered by gains on Wall Street and by US retail sales and producer prices
data. The general index was finally off 0.46 at 299.72 in turnover of
Pta25bn, with an active Tabacalera, a strong performer in recent months,
down Pta165 at Pta3,590.
BRUSSELS, with the Bel-20 index down 4.12 at 1,380.33, featured a fall of
BFr15 to BFr2,480, after BFr2,465, in Union Miniere, which postponed a
planned Swedish stock market flotation of its Swedish mine unit.
UM was also weighed down by tomorrow's expiry of warrants to buy the
parent's shares at BFr2,450. The warrants fell BFr13 to BFr23.
STOCKHOLM was led higher by Ericsson as the Affarsvarlden General index
closed 12.80 stronger at 1,467.90. The telecoms group landed a major order
and the 'B' shares rose SKr12.50 to SKr407.50 on the signing of a framework
agreement with the Spanish group Telefonica worth SKr4bn to SKr5bn over the
next three years.
Other heavyweights followed suit, with Astra 'A' and Pharmacia each up SKr2
to SKr195 and SKr115.50 respectively, Electrolux SKr4 better at SKr373 and
Skanska ahead SKr2.50 at SKr168.
OSLO closed lower in thin trading, overshadowed by the announcement of the
death of the bourse president Mr Erik Jarve a day after his dismissal for
alleged financial irregularities. Mr Jarve was widely regarded as the public
face of the bourse for two decades, The all-share index was down 2.25 at
623.14 in very low turnover of NKr185m.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Markets Report: French franc slips to 1994 low against
D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc yesterday fell to a twelve month low against the D-Mark as
political uncertainty continued to set the tone in currency markets, writes
Philip Gawith.
The franc closed in London at FFr3.447/DM, from FFr3.439.
Political troubles also saw the Italian lira fall to a record low of L1,044
against the D-Mark, before closing at L1,042. The weakness of the franc and
lira was accentuated in the interest rate futures markets, with both the
March eurolira and PIBOR contracts losing over 30 basis points.
Traders were careful to stress, however, that trading conditions, ahead of
Christmas, were thin, and this could lead to exaggerated movements on small
volumes. While both the lira and the franc had the potential to weaken
further, analysts said market activity was not of the order to suggest
either currency was in trouble.
Elsewhere the dollar had a steady day, with producer inflation and retail
sales data effectively cancelling each other out, depriving the market of
fresh trading impetus. The dollar closed unchanged at DM1.5728, and at
Y100.395, from Y99.875.
In New Zealand, the six month monetary statement from the central bank gave
the New Zealand dollar further upward impetus. It touched a five-year high
of 64 US cents during Asian trading, before slipping back to a London close
of 63.71 cents.
The Swedish krone weakened slightly to SKr4.792 against the D-Mark, from
SKr4.786, after the Riksbank raised the key repo rate to 7.6 per cent from
7.4 per cent.
Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index finishing unchanged
at 80.4.
While political uncertainty was the catalyst for lira and franc weakness,
the other key factor was generalised D-Mark strength, which has been obvious
against most currencies except the dollar and sterling.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, said that while
'politics was the principal villain' when it came to franc weakness, this
coincided with a gradual shift in perception about the outlook for German
interest rates. He noted that the September 1995 and December 1995 euromark
futures contracts had both moved about 30-40 basis points this week alone
(towards discounting higher interest rates).
'The market seems to be moving to the conclusion that the next move in
German rates will be up,' said Mr Magnus.
With the franc effectively fixed to the D-Mark through the franc fort
policy, Mr Magnus said political uncertainty was more likely to be reflected
in the interest rate markets. He predicted, however, that the franc could
yet weaken to FFr 3.45-3.50/DM.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said that the current
exchange rate of the lira appeared to price in most of the bad news.
Although the lira was getting weaker, 'each individual piece of news is
having less impact in the market.'
Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI, said that while the dust would
settle in France, Italy's problems appeared to be continuing.
Mr Durrant stressed that thin trading conditions were leading to exaggerated
moves, and a general climate of market unease. 'There was no reason, for
example, why short sterling should fall across the board today,' he said,
but it did. Most contracts lost around four to seven basis points.
The dollar's performance was cited by analysts as further evidence that it
had decoupled from bonds. For much of 1994 the dollar and US treasury bonds
tracked each other closely.
With a low PPI figure offset by strong retail sales, the foreign exchange
market 'was very happy to sit on its hands,' said Mr Cocker. 'Now it is
waiting for a clear sign whether the Fed will tighten next week.' The open
markets committee, which sets Federal Reserve policy, meets next Tuesday to
discuss the outlook for interest rates.
Mr Cocker said Tuesday was a key date for the dollar because the FOMC
meeting coincided with the release of trade data. Monetary policy, and
US-Japan trade tensions, have been two key factors explaining the dollar's
poor performance in 1994.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 476m of assistance
at established rates, and Pounds 430m of late assistance, after forecasting
a Pounds 950m shortage.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans seek extra sugar
access to expanded EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's traditional sugar suppliers want to ship 700,000 tonnes
a year more to meet the higher demand they expect to result from the
expansion of the union.
Exporters in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, who have an overall
quota of 1.3m tonnes a year, have told the EU that they can guarantee the
additional 700,000 tonnes.
'With the impending expansion of the European Union and changes in the
sourcing of sugar for Portugal, the ACP countries have an opportunity to
expand their exports,' said Mr Karl James of the Sugar Association of the
Caribbean. 'A recent study done on production in the ACP states indicates
that they can ship 700,000 tonnes more each year, and in the negotiations
with the EU we are asking that this be bought at the preferential price we
now enjoy.'
The European Union is changing its sugar import regime and will establish a
mechanism for the access of additional sugar under an agreement that will
become effective in July 1995 and run for six years, according to the Sugar
Association of the Caribbean.
'The EU's proposals are an encouraging development and will provide the
basis for the ACP group to negotiate with the EU to achieve its objective of
additional access at the guaranteed price.'
In a move to make more of another preferential market, Caribbean Community
(Caricom) sugar exporters have asked the US government for changes in the
allocation of their import quotas to allow other producers in the group the
first call on meeting shortfalls of any member, said the Sugar Association.
'The United States does not allow any member of the group to supply any or
part of a quota belonging to another member,' the association said. The US
Department of Agriculture sets annual import quotas for Caribbean and other
producers.
'Some countries have frequent difficulty in meeting their US quotas,' said
Mr James. 'Barbados, for example, has not shipped any sugar to the US for
several years, but none of the association's members benefit from this
shortfall. This is what we have asked the US Department of Agriculture to
change.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond project
exceeding expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North America's first diamond mine will be bigger and have a longer life
than earlier estimates indicated, according to the Australian-Canadian joint
venture that is developing the deposit near Lac de Gras in Canada's
Northwest Territories.
BHP Minerals said that, based on the latest samples, the proposed
development plan would be broadened from three to five diamond-bearing
kimberlite pipes. The life of the project has been extended to 25 years.
Production is due to start in the third quarter of 1997, assuming that
regulatory approvals for the building of a mine are obtained within the next
12 months.
The Canadian government set up a four-person environmental review panel
earlier this month. The project, which is located in an ecologically
sensitive area close to the Arctic Circle, is likely to come under close
scrutiny from environmental and local aboriginal groups.
According to BHP, initial production will be 9,000 tonnes of kimberlite a
day, rising to 18,000 tonnes in the tenth year. The mine will be a
combination of open-pit and underground operations.
BHP said that last summer's exploration programme uncovered 13 new
diamond-bearing pipes, bringing the total to 39. Further exploration is
planned this winter, involving the extraction of 100-200 tonne samples from
four or five pipes.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fisherman seek to repel
Spanish armada - Alison Maitland on a campaign that could lead to another
government defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of the Spanish fishing fleet gaining full access to waters west
of the UK spurs Mr John Ashworth into grim eloquence.
Mr Ashworth, spokesman for the Save Britain's Fish campaign, believes this
is the thin end of the wedge. It will lead to the European Union's largest
fleet winning entry to all EU waters, including the North Sea, by 2003, he
says.
'At the end of the day, it means that Britain has handed over her greatest
renewable resource. It will mean the end of our industry.'
The campaign group wants Britain to renounce the principle enshrined in the
Common Fisheries Policy of equal access for all member states to a common
resource. As this is the policy's cornerstone, they say the logical step is
for Britain to withdraw from the CFP.
Next week, EU fisheries ministers must resolve the prickly question of how
to integrate Spain and Portugal into the western waters off the UK, France
and north-west Spain, and in particular into the 'Irish Box'  - the waters
surrounding Ireland.
While having restricted access to most of the western waters, the two
countries have been barred from the Irish Box  - where fish stocks are
particularly fragile  - since they joined the community. This ban is to be
lifted at the end of next year, but the UK and Ireland are anxious to
protect their fishermen's rights and minimise the Iberian presence.
The British House of Commons will tonight debate an opposition Labour party
amendment to keep Iberian fishermen out of the Irish Box. It could win
backing from anti-European Conservatives, leaving the government facing
another defeat.
Spain has threatened to block the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden
in January unless a deal is worked out by the end of this year.
The UK government has been at pains this week to deny rumours spreading
through the fishing community that Spain has already been granted new rights
to these waters under a secret deal. Mr Michael Jack, the fisheries
minister, says the only agreement at last weekend's EU summit in Essen was
that a fishing deal should be clear and unbureaucratic.
Mr Ashworth acknowledges that Spain and Portugal are fully justified in
their claims to greater access. But he cannot see how the European
Commission can square this with an agreement that Iberian integration into
the CFP should not entail any overall increase in fishing effort.
'I don't think they know how to do it,' he says. 'They're in a shambles.'
Integration, originally due by 2003, was brought forward to 1996 as part of
the deal on accession for the Efta countries.
British fishermen are deeply concerned that the 17,000-strong Spanish
fishing fleet will ignore quotas and other conservation measures in western
waters. They also fear the Spaniards will catch immature fish, which are
much appreciated on their domestic market, depriving shoals of their
replacement stocks.
Mr John Thomson, vice-chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers, says
fishermen are already hard-pressed. 'Fishing is the life-blood of Scottish
communities. For every man at sea there may be 10 people employed on shore.
We're very frightened this could be devastated.'
At the very least, he wants Britain to regulate EU vessels entering its
western waters, a proposal taken up by the UK government.
Mr Geoff Bullus, a Cornish fishermen's leader, is bitter about what he sees
as double standards. 'Stocks are overfished at the moment and the scientists
are recommending reductions in all stocks in the western approaches. At the
same time the Commission is telling us we must make room for the Spanish
fleet. That's very difficult to stomach.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana boffins win research
prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers in west Africa have won an international award for breeding a
better banana.
Development of a high-yielding strain resistant to the devastating black
sigatoka disease, has attracted the 1994 King Baudouin Award for the most
outstanding agricultural breakthrough of the year. The research should lead
to higher food output and a significant increase in the incomes of millions
of African farmers.
Named after the late Belgian monarch, the award is presented by the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a world-wide
research network. It goes to the Ibadan, Nigeria-based International
Institute for Tropical Agriculture.
Bananas are one of Africa's most important staple foods, exceeding maize,
rice and cassava in value. In Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, per capita banana
consumption averages 200kg a year. But black sigatoka, a fungus disease,
spreads rapidly in the wind and can destroy up to half a farmer's crop.
Breeders face the problem that bananas do not produce seeds. 'When we
started the research, eight years ago, people thought we could not make any
progress in breeding bananas,' said IITA director-general Mr Lukas Brader.
Using a combination of approaches, scientists at the institute were able to
make a breakthrough in breeding technology, which led to a hybrid of
plantain banana, a variety used for cooking, that yields two to three times
as much as existing varieties and is resistant to black sigatoka. Following
trials in 12 sub-Saharan countries, the hybrids are soon to be released to
farmers.
The hybrids have the advantage of not needing pesticide and they grow faster
than existing varieties. The higher yields are expected to reduce the need
to expand banana cultivation to other land areas. 'Over the next eight to
ten years these hybrids will gradually replace the existing varieties', said
Mr Brader.
The annual value of banana production in Africa is now estimated at Dollars
2.8bn, but this could increase to Dollars 9bn if the hybrids are widely
planted.
Mr Ismail Serageldin, CGIAR chairman and World Bank vice-chairman, said
millions of small African farmers and their families would benefit. 'This is
truly a milestone contribution toward stemming the long-term decline of per
capita food production in sub-Saharan Africa', he said.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian winter crop forecast
at 12-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Latest forecasts put Australia's drought-affected winter crop production at
13.5m tonnes, down from 28.4m tonnes in 1993-94.
The aggregate figure, published yesterday by the Australian Bureau of
Agriculture and Resource Economics, includes a marginal upward revision  -
an additional 400,000 tonnes  - to reflect the scattered rainfall received
in some cropping areas in late October and early November. Nevertheless, if
the estimated production levels prove accurate, they will represent the
lowest winter crop seen in Australia since 1982-83.
The New South Wales crop is forecast to be just 850,000 tonnes, down from
7.65m tonnes in the previous year. In Queensland, winter crop production is
put at 250,000 tonnes, about one-quarter of the levels seen in each of the
previous two years. These two states have been worst affected by the current
drought, one of the most severe this century.
Wheat production is forecast at 8.6m tonnes, down 49 per cent on the
previous crop, reflecting both the reduced acreage sown and the fall in
yields across Australia caused by below-average spring rainfall. The
Australian federal government is revamp the organisation of the country's
ADollars 5bn meat industry, handing more responsibility for marketing and
development to producers and processors. The changes, which have been
endorsed by the federal cabinet, follow criticism from beef exporters about
the degree of statutory intervention in the industry, and the lack of
responsiveness to producers' concerns.
A new meat industry policy council will take over responsibility for the
ADollars 150m raised by compulsory levies and spent on promotion and
research.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Further flattening of US Treasury yield
curve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN, MARTIN BRICE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yield curve flattened further yesterday as the long end of the US
Treasuries market outperformed the short end in the wake of mixed economic
news.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 95 7/8 ,
yielding 7.854 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was down  1/16 at 99 3/16 , yielding 7.684 per cent.
Economic data released early in the morning offered differing signals about
the strength of the economy, but the flatness of the curve depicting the
relation between yields on two-year and 30-year bonds seemed to indicate
that the market was preparing for another round of tightening by the Federal
Reserve. The spread was near 17 basis points by the end of the day, as flat
as it has been in more than four years.
The yield curve, a graphical representation of the yields on bonds of
different maturities, is taken as an indicator of market sentiment about the
economy.
A flattening curve indicates that the market is expecting the economy to
slow. The curve has been markedly flatter since the Fed raised interest
rates by 75 basis point in November.
The producer price index grew by 0.5 per cent in November, marking the
reversal of two months of decline, but was generally in line with
economists' forecasts.
Less expected was the slowing growth of the core index - PPI excluding
volatile food and energy prices. Core prices rose by 0.1 per cent last
month, below the expected 0.5 per cent increase.
Still, the figures continued to show inflationary pressures at the early
stages in the production cycle.
The intermediate goods sub-index showed a 1.1 per cent increase in November,
the largest jump since October 1990.
Another signal of potential inflation came from much stronger than expected
retail sales figures.
Figures released by the Commerce Department showed sales up 1.2 per cent
last month, whereas economists had predicted an increase of 0.5 per cent. A
sub-index showing the sale of durable goods was also strong.
UK gilts slipped on weak sentiment from the US, and were largely unaffected
by the CBI survey which showed that in November a balance of 6 per cent of
retailers were reporting increased sales from a year ago.
The balance of retailers reporting an annual price increase was 13 per cent,
the weakest since the survey began in 1983.
Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said: 'The market didn't move at all
when the figures came out, and it might be that the market has under-rated
the significance of the survey.'
He said the CBI survey suggested UK retail sales figures due to be released
tomorrow would be weak. He said: 'If that is the case, the market might take
it quite well.'
Mr Saunders said: 'The signs are that a similar round of price cutting and
prolonged sales may be under way now, helping to keep inflation low in
coming months.'
Mr Tom Cullen at Technical Data said: 'The major emphasis now is on
Thursday's by-election, where the government is expected to suffer a
spectacular defeat.
'This will set the tone for heightened political concerns in 1995, which in
turn will bring pressure to bear on gilts and sterling.'
The December long gilt future was down  13/32 to trade around 101 19/32 .
The yield spread over bunds moved out from 123 to around 126.
German government bonds were hit by the poor sentiment in the US, but found
some support and recovered ground. The March bund futures contract on Liffe
fell by 0.19 on the day to 89.70.
The retail sales figures for October were released, and Mr Julian Jessop at
HSBC Markets said they were 'a timely reminder of weakness in the personal
sector'.
The figures showed a decline of 2 per cent month-on-month. and Mr Jessop
said the personal sector had yet to face a 7.5 per cent increase in income
taxes, known as the 'solidarity surcharge,' which would further weaken
spending.
Italian government bonds edged down on domestic political worries as Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, met magistrates investigating corruption,
and the March bond futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.74, down 0.13.
Mr Pio de Gregorio at NatWest Markets said: 'A government crisis is now
looming, and it is very likely that it will come in the new year. This is
already in the price in bonds, equities and the currency. It is unlikely
that the market will recover until there is a clarification of the political
outlook.'
He said it was likely that the budget would be passed, possibly before the
end of the year, but said: 'What will happen afterwards is unclear.' He
added that the outlook for the economy was positive, with wage inflation at
1.8 per cent in the year to October.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Outstandings in OTC contracts
top Dollars 30,000bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The total value of outstandings in the over-the-counter derivatives market
seem likely to exceed Dollars 30,000bn by the end of this year, according to
Swaps Monitor, the specialist New York-based publication.
The figures imply 1994 growth of at least 20 per cent. Swaps Monitor
estimates that the global market in interest rates swaps  - one of the most
popular derivatives contracts  - will be more than Dollars 12,000bn compared
with Dollars 8,200bn in 1993 and Dollars 6,100bn in 1992.
The figures are contained in the publication's annual review of the
derivatives industry*, which is based on a detailed breakdown of figures for
1993.
The survey shows that the outstanding value of OTC contracts increased by 20
per cent last year to reach Dollars 25,500bn. Foreign exchange forward
contracts  - the biggest single class of business  - increased to Dollars
9,500bn from Dollars 8,400bn.
The outstanding value of two other classes of OTC contract  - forward rate
agreements and interest rate options  - also rose, to Dollars 3,500bn from
Dollars 3,300bn and to Dollars 2,000bn from Dollars 1,200bn, respectively.
The survey also shows that the average gross replacement costs for swaps
range from 1.18 per cent of notional value for currency forwards to 1.3 per
cent for interest rate contracts, 1.59 per cent for OTC exchange rate
contracts, 2.88 per cent for interest rate swaps and 5.97 per cent for
currency swaps.
Overall these figures imply that the gross replacement cost of the global
OTC derivatives market was approximately Dollars 900bn as of the end of
1993.
The survey says, however, that the true exposure is lower than these amounts
because most counterparties have master agreements in place which permit
netting.
The survey also indicates that there is a high degree of concentration in
the OTC market with a few large players controlling large chunks of
business.
In the interest rate swaps area, for example, five banks  - Chemical Bank,
J. P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Paribas, and Bankers Trust  - account for a
combined market share of 30 per cent.
Ten banks control 47 per cent of the same market. J. P. Morgan, Paribas,
Bankers Trust, Swiss Bank and Deutsche Bank are the biggest players in the
currency swap market, accounting for 28 per cent of total outstandings.
Citicorp, Barclays, Societe Generale, Canadian Imperial and Swiss Bank lead
the market for forward rate agreements, collectively accounting for 31 per
cent of the total in 1993.
Swaps Monitor points out that the numbers understate slightly the degree of
concentration because certain firms that would be large enough to qualify
for a place in the top five or top 10 do not disclose their outstandings and
are therefore excluded from the table.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Argentina returns to yen sector with
three-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dull day in the eurobond market yesterday was brightened by a flurry of
structured offerings and the appearance of a number of sovereign borrowers.
The Republic of Argentina launched a Y20bn issue of three-year bonds with a
6 per cent coupon, the country's second foray into the yen market. The
Republic launched a debut Y12.5bn offering of four-year bonds via Daiwa at
the end of November.
The bonds for the latest issue were all pre-placed with Japanese financial
institutions and corporate investors, lead manager Nomura said.
Traders said that Argentina was still set to make its debut in the French
franc market this week, with a FFr1bn issue of three-year bonds.
HSBC Markets launched a Dollars 272m offering of two-year floating-rate
notes on behalf of a special-purpose vehicle backed by direct obligations of
the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia.
The bonds offered a coupon of 15 basis points over three-month Libor but a
discounted margin of 26 basis points over Libor, HSBC said.
The offering met with significant interest from investors in the Gulf,
Europe and the Far East, the lead manager said.
'The issue gives investors exposure to Saudia Arabia for the first time in a
securitised form,' an HSBC official said.
Traders expect eurobond primary activity to remain subdued for the remainder
of this year with no significant issues expected to come to the market.
They are already looking to January, a traditionally busy month, when they
expect activity to accelerate but doubt that there will be a marked
improvement in market conditions from this year.
'But there will still be a rush of sovereign borrowers trying to get ahead
of the pack,' said one trader.
Meanwhile, however, Pakistan is rumoured to be set to make its long-awaited
euromarket debut this week, with a Dollars 200m five-year transaction.
Traders said the offering, which could come as early as today, is likely to
have a spread of around 350 to 400 basis points over US Treasuries. Last
night, lead manager Bear Stearns was unavailable for comment.
Treasury Corporation of Victoria launched a ADollars 100m issue of two-year
bonds offering a discounted coupon of 5 per cent.
The issue was notable only because it continues a recent trend of Australian
dollar offerings targeted at the Japanese market.
These issues offer a coupon similar to that currently available on Japanese
yen bonds, but come at a significant discount and offer a play on the
currency.
The Government of Barbados launched a Dollars 30m five-year tranche of
guaranteed global registered notes via Bankers Trust. Investor demand meant
that the offering was changed from an original two-tranche issue to a
single-tranche deal.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, is
taking over control of ACC-Babcock, a loss-making boilermaker in India,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
ACC-Babcock has been managed by an Indian government agency for some time
because its private sector shareholders did not consider it viable.
Associated Cement, India's leading cement maker, has a 28 per cent stake and
Babcock of the UK has 11 per cent.
According to Indian news agencies, ABB will pay Rs520m (Dollars 16.5m) for a
76 per cent stake in the company. The idea would be to integrate it with
other ABB subsidiaries in India to bid for turnkey power plant contracts.
ABB said that it would be making an announcement today.
According to the Indian reports, the Board of Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction, the government agency that nurses ailing companies, had
approved the takeover.

178m) in the year to the end of September, writes Christopher Parkes in
Frankfurt. Results improved in all operational sectors, most notably in
metals which benefited from the disposal of the Leybold subsidiary to
Oerlikon Buhrle of Zurich, and returned to operating profit after heavy

The sale led to a 7 per cent fall in group turnover to DM13.8bn, which,

Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, and its Canadian
partner, Dia-Met Minerals said yesterday that they were expanding the scope
of their proposed diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, writes
Nikki Tait.
The companies said that an updated project development plan, submitted to
the Canadian government, had been enlarged to five diamondiferous kimberlite
pipes, instead of the three previously suggested. With the inclusion of the
two extra pipes, the potential project life could be extended from 20 years
to 25 years.
If project approvals are granted next year, the first production could occur
in 1997. BHP said that initial production would be at 9,000 tonnes of
kimberlite per day, rising to 18,000 tonnes per day by the 10th year of
production.

Chemicals, accounting for 49 per cent of sales, returned 'considerably
higher' profits on turnover up 3 per cent in a market where prices remained
under pressure.
Pharmaceuticals, which include dental supplies, also improved earnings, and
raised its share of group sales from 20 per cent to 22 per cent in the year
under review. More than half a 5 per cent increase in turnover stemmed from
the first-time consolidation of the Dutch dental company, Elephant.
The letter said most of the improvements resulted from improved demand in
the US and Asia and parts of Europe. A slight recovery in the domestic
market had only just started.

QBE, the Australian general insurer, is stepping up its links with
Chicago-based Kemper International through a new joint venture in the
Asia-Pacific region and a strategic alliance under which both companies
would provide reciprocal services for multinational clients.
Kemper International is the international arm of Chicago-based Kemper
National Insurance Companies, the 13th largest property casualty insurer in
the US, and former parent of Kemper Corporation, the listed financial
services group.
The joint venture company will provide engineering and loss control services
throughout Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands, and will
begin operating during the first quarter of 1995. Under the new strategic
alliance, QBE will administer Kemper's licence in Australia and service some
of its global direct insurance requirements.
QBE, which has representation in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia
and Hong Kong, added that it planned to set up a new 'global accounts'
division as a result of the new alliance. This will take in the local
portfolio of Kemper in Australia, and aim to service national accounts,
exporters, and multinationals requiring risk management services. Existing
Kemper staff are being offered jobs with either the joint venture company or
with QBE's new division.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Taiwanese groups face setback
over eurobond issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that Taiwanese companies could raise fresh equity through the launch
of convertible eurobonds look set to be dashed as the first of a rush of
issues since 1989 comes up for repayment later this month.
The authorities in Taipei have yet to reach agreement on rules allowing
foreigners to convert their holdings into listed shares, although the matter
has been the subject of debate since Yuen Foong Yu Paper (YFY), a listed
paper manufacturer, issued Taiwan's first convertible bond in 1989.
YFY may thus have to redeem its Dollars 120m issue in cash when a put option
falls due on December 21.
To date, 29 Taiwanese companies have issued euroconvertible bonds, mostly in
the past year. But because foreign individuals are not permitted to buy
Taiwan shares directly, government departments have been unable to solve the
dilemma presented by conversion.
The central bank and the finance ministry, to which the Securities and
Exchange Commission reports, have agreed in principle that convertible bonds
may be switched into global depository receipts. However, the details of
such a conversion method have yet to be worked out.
Investor appetite for Taiwanese paper has largely evaporated due to
oversupply following a flurry of issues this year. Secondary trading has
dried up and proposed new issues are being met coolly amid rising interest
rates and concern over the lack of convertibility.
In YFY's case, the point is moot as the current share price makes conversion
unattractive. But several other issues have met criteria for conversion set
out in issue documents.
A number of Taiwanese companies have delayed or cancelled planned
convertible issues as the cost has risen almost to the level of raising
funds domestically. In October Formosa Plastics Corp, the petrochemical
company, shelved plans to raise USDollars 300m in convertible bonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Hankinson has resigned suddenly as president of Canadian Pacific,
the rail transport, shipping, energy, hotel and property group.
He will be succeeded by Mr David O'Brien, head of the group's energy arm,
PanCanadian Petroleum, next February.
Mr William Stinso, chairman and chief executive, said Mr Hankinson, who has
been with CP for 21 years, left to 'pursue other interests'. He would not
provide further details.
Mr O'Brien, a former executive vice-president of Petro-Canada, a big
integrated oil company, came to Montreal in 1989 to head Noverco, a big
Quebec energy group.
However, when Noverco's expansion programme failed to take off, he moved to
Canadian Pacific in 1990 to become president of PanCanadian.
His appointment emphasises the importance of energy for the CP group's
future recovery. CP owns 87 per cent of its energy arm and PanCanadian has
been one of the main contributors to CP's consolidated results over the past
three years.
Mr Hankinson is best known for the creation of one of the world's biggest
newsprint groups, Canadian Pacific Forest Products in the early 1980s.
CP spun this off early last year and it has become Avenor, a widely held
company.
Unitel, a joint venture of Rogers Communications of Toronto, AT&amp;T of the US
and Canadian Pacific is losing several key executives.
Mr Richard Stursberg, executive vice-president, will become president and
chief executive of the Canadian Cable Television Association on January 3.
He led Unitel in the battle to open up Canadian long distance
telecommunications to competition in 1992 and will now lead the cable
industry at a critical point when cable TV, telephone and computer
technologies are converging.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: New Line hopes to break out of
old mould - The film group is moving into the big-budget movie business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This Friday's premiere of Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey, the cult
comedian, will mark the end of an extraordinary year for New Line Cinema,
one of Hollywood's most talked about movie studios.
New Line started 1994 by finalising its Dollars 550m acquisition by Mr Ted
Turner, the buccaneering media mogul. It went on to score its biggest hit in
Carrey's The Mask, which has earned almost Dollars 120m in the US.
It then joined the ranks of Hollywood's big spenders by offering Julia
Roberts Dollars 12m and Meg Ryan Dollars 8m to star in a remake of The Women
and bidding Dollars 4m for The Long Kiss Goodnight, an unfinished script by
Shane Black.
As New Line is aware, 1995 will be a critical year in which it must prove it
can break away from its old independent status by producing big-budget
movies as a direct competitor of leading studios such as Warner Brothers,
Sony and Paramount.
The Hollywood cynics are already predicting it has gone too far and risks
becoming yet another ambitious Hollywood independent that aimed too high and
lost.
Mr Robert Shaye, chairman, disagrees. 'We've been in this business for 27
years. We've proved ourselves by making successful films for niche
audiences. Now we're ready to move on,' he says.
Mr Shaye is a Columbia law school graduate who became a film archivist at
New York's Museum of Modern Art. He founded New Line in 1967 by selling
underground movies to college film clubs from his apartment in Manhattan.
New Line made its name in the movie world with a string of cult successes
aimed mainly at a young audience  - from the Nightmare on Elm Street series,
which has grossed Dollars 500m worldwide, to art-house projects such as Mr
Gus Van Sant's My Private Idaho and Mr Robert Altman's Short Cuts.
It soon won a reputation for tight cost control. Mr Shaye became infamous
for memos urging staff to save paper and recycle paper clips. He also
practised what he preached by driving a 1972 Oldsmobile convertible.
New Line swiftly distinguished itself from fellow independents by
diversifying into distribution. Most concentrate on the less profitable area
of production, thereby remaining reliant on distribution deals with the big
studios.
Mr Shaye and Mr Michael Lynne, a lawyer friend from Columbia who became
president of New Line in 1990, expanded their production interests by
launching Fine Line Features to handle art-house projects, including the
Altman and Van Sant films. The New Line group was making 14 films a year by
the early 1990s.
However, there were limitations attached to its independent status. The main
problem was that its banks would not allow it to make films for more than
Dollars 25m.
This not only excluded New Line from larger projects, but impeded its
expansion outside the US. New Line's films were so small it could only sell
them to foreign distributors on a packaged basis, rather than negotiating
special international deals for promising projects, such as The Mask.
The Turner acquisition, which coincided with Mr Turner's purchase of Castle
Rock, the independent behind When Harry Met Sally, addressed this problem by
enabling New Line to raise capital for more ambitious projects.
New Line still looks and feels like the same, free-wheeling independent. Its
baseball-capped staff are younger than the Hollywood norm. Mr Michael de
Luca, head of production, is in his late 20s.
Behind the scenes New Line has been making the most of its new status as a
subsidiary of the Turner group. As well as the deals with Roberts, Ryan and
Black, it has paid Dollars 7m to Carrey for Dumb and Dumber and signed Renny
Harlin to direct The Long Kiss Goodnight with his wife, Geena Davis, in the
lead.
Mr Lynne has formed a joint venture with Havas, the French media group, to
invest Dollars 30m in interactive entertainment over the next few years.
The company will then be able to develop its own computer game and CD-Rom
formats, rather than licensing them to other companies as it has done
previously.
If New Line's projects pay off, the rewards will be far higher than in the
past  - but so will the risks. As the chairman of a rival studio said: 'New
Line is hot right now. But they've taken on a lot. Let's hope Ted Turner has
deep pockets. He might need them.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort to set up investment
banking operation in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRAZIL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the London-based merchant bank, is to set up an investment
banking operation in Brazil, attracted by increasing confidence about the
country's economy and privatisation prospects.
Mr Winston Fritsch, Brazil's secretary of economic policy and one of the
main economists behind a new inflation taming currency, the Real, will leave
the government at the end of the year to head the Kleinwort operation.
The bank plans to open two offices, in Rio de Janiero and in the main
commercial centre, Sao Paulo.
Mr Fritsch said the new venture would look for merger and acquisition work
stemming from big changes in the economy. Lower inflation since the Real's
launch in July, and reduced tariff barriers to foreign competition, are
forcing companies to restructure and merge.
The Mercosul customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay which
comes into force on January 1 is also leading to increased cross-border
acquisitions. Mr Fritsch expects an increase in privatisation work.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over as president on January 1, is
'fully committed' to privatisation of some public services, according to Mr
Fritsch. 'He will also be pressed into privatising other companies which can
give him a return for cash,' he said.
Private sector analysts agree the scope for Brazilian privatisation is
enormous. Telebras, the state controlled telephone monopoly, would be worth
about Dollars 35bn if valued on the same basis as Telmex of Mexico. However,
Brazil's slow legislative process suggests it will take time for big
privatisations to be approved.
Kleinwort is the latest in a series of foreign financial services companies
to target Brazil. Robert Fleming of London is due to open a new office next
year, and France's Paribas last week announced a co-operation agreement with

Trans World Airlines, the US carrier struggling to avoid a liquidity crisis,
said two aircraft lessors had agreed to defer payments which were due in
November, allowing the airline to save Dollars 15m in cash and keep four
Boeing 767-200 aircraft in its fleet.
It also said an informal committee of preferred stockholders had agreed a
proposal for the company's financial restructuring, under which they would
get three times more equity in the company than holders of the common stock.
In October, TWA announced a plan under which creditors were asked to swap
Dollars 800m of the company's Dollars 1.8bn of debt for new equity.

Riva, the private Italian steel producer, has joined the bidding for Ilva
Laminati Piani, the state-owned flat steels company up for privatisation,
Italian news agencies reported yesterday.
Riva is said to have renewed its alliance with Tarnofin, a group of
entrepreneurs from Taranto and Novi Ligure, where ILP has its main plants.
Neither Riva nor Tarnofin was available to comment on the report yesterday
afternoon that they had submitted a bid to IRI, the state holding company
which owns ILP, before Monday's deadline for offers.
Riva-Tarnofin would have to beat the Franco-Italian consortium headed by
Lucchini, another private Italian producer, and Usinor Sacilor of France.
They submitted their own offer for ILP on Monday, in alliance with Bolmat, a
private company formed by two Italian steel traders. No details of either
offer have emerged.
Riva was always considered one of the most likely buyers for ILP.
Riva-Tarnofin submitted an offer to IRI two weeks ago, but withdrew it when
IRI insisted on keeping the sale open to other potential buyers.
Mr Domenico Cassalia, the president of Tarnofin and of Taranto's local
employers' association, recently spoke of the local entrepreneurs' 'duty' to
play a role in the future of the plant which dominates the southern Italian
town. 'One era has finished and a new one has begun, and we have to give a
signal of active involvement (in ILP),' he said.
Directors of IRI are expected to meet tomorrow to discuss the offers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker Aircraft, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, has been forced to lower
profit forecasts for the full year. It blames a further deterioration in
industry conditions and a weak US dollar in the second half of 1994, AP-DJ
reports from Amsterdam.
Fokker said it now expected the net result to be close to that of 1993, when
it reported a loss of Fl 460m (Dollars 261.4m).
It said a financial package agreed with its parent company, Deutsche
Aerospace, and with the Dutch government, became effective last month.
The company said a non-interest bearing, subordinated loan of Fl 600m had
been made available through Deutsche Aerospace.
The loan can only be repaid out of the proceeds of future rights issues, to
which Fokker Holding is committed to subscribe 51 per cent.
After 15 years, anything remaining of the loan will be converted into common
shares at the stock price then prevailing.
Fokker said that with the sale and lease-back of its technological
'know-how', the subordinated loan would help strengthen its capital base.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Czech banks warned on loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loan losses have wiped out the capital of some Czech commercial banks,
according to an investigation by the country's central bank.
'There could be some banks in the system that have negative capital
adequacy,' said Mr Ota Kaftan, head of banking supervision at the Czech
National Bank.
Three small institutions have already collapsed, and Agrobanka, the
fifth-largest bank, had to seek an injection after loan losses destroyed its
capital.
Further failures would mar an international image which has, in the latest
quarter, allowed three of the largest banks to raise syndicated loans at
only 65-70 basis points over the London interbank rate.
Komercni, Obchodni and Investnici banks, the main borrowers on international
markets, have evaluated their portfolios according to strict, international
standards at least since their 1993 results.
The CNB has, however, exposed a much higher level of bad debts than
previously recorded for the sector as a whole. The key ratio of
non-performing loans to assets jumped from 12 per cent in August to 20 per
cent in September, the first month in which the new international
methodology was applied.
Accounting, according to international standards, will force those Czech
banks which have not yet translated their accounts to recognise loan losses
that may exceed their capital.
Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank traded on the Prague stock market, is the
largest lender on the interbank market and is particularly exposed to
defaults by smaller banks.
The CNB said an adjustment for collateral and government guarantees improved
the picture, and warned that the figures could be misleading.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere delays share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, yesterday postponed the flotation
of its Swedish subsidiary, Ammeberg Mining, because it failed to achieve the
pricing it wanted. The delay again highlights the weak state of the new
issues market.
'The mine is not part of our core business, but it is a valuable asset and
we are not prepared to sell at a give-away price,' UM said.
However, bankers associated with the issue said the flotation would have had
problems at any price because international investment institutions were
tired and nervous after a difficult year. 'They are just not interested.
They want to start afresh in January,' said one.
Apart from a general malaise in the new issues market, the Ammeberg
flotation also suffered because of what Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord
Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming, describes as 'indigestion' in the
resources sector. He calculates that resource companies so far this year
have raised Dollars 8.7bn and, by the year-end, the total will be nearly
twice the Dollars 5bn raised in 1993.
Other recent resource casualties include Samax, the UK company with African
mining interests which shelved a Pounds 16m flotation two weeks ago, and
Alumax, the US aluminium group, which postponed indefinitely the issue of 8m
new shares worth about Dollars 250m. Kymmene, Finland's second largest
forestry group, last week unexpectedly called off plans to raise more than
FM1.5bn (Dollars 307m) in a domestic and overseas share issue.
Two other resources companies are touring institutions in the hope of
raising money before the year-end: Banesto, the Spanish bank, wants to sell
39 per cent of Asturiana de Zinc, which owns the largest zinc smelter in the
world; while Stillwater Mining of the US, the only primary platinum group
metals producer outside South Africa, is looking for about Dollars 70m.
UM planned an initial public offering of nearly 11m Ammeberg shares, or 95
per cent of the company, at between SKr112 and SKr130 each. This valued
Ammeberg at between SKr1.26bn and SKr1.46bn (Dollars 167.3m and Dollars
193.9m).
Ammeberg, which was to be quoted on the Stockholm stock exchange, operates
the Zinkgruvan zinc-lead-silver underground mine in south-central Sweden,
which produces about 10 per cent of the western world's zinc.
UM said last year it wanted to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc
producer. It has closed its zinc refining plant at Overpelt in Belgium and
cancelled plans to double capacity at its Balen zinc refinery, also in
Belgium.
In February, UM sold its Union Zinc subsidiary in the US to Savage
Resources, a small Australian company, for USDollars 200m. Flotation of the
Swedish zinc subsidiary would have rounded off the rationalisation process.

deadline of December 31 for the full privatisation of Italy's state-owned
steel industry. Mr Vito Gnutti, Italy's industry minister, said he hoped the
EU timetable would be respected.
Mr Gnutti also warned that the ambitious Italian privatisation programme was
facing more difficulties than had originally been foreseen.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz finds French site
for Swatchmobile plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the German carmaker, is to build its first car assembly plant
in France.
The company is expected to announce next week that it has chosen a site in
Lorraine, northern France, for the production of its pioneering micro city
car  - the so-called Swatchmobile  - which it is developing in a joint
venture with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker.
The decision was disclosed yesterday by Mr Karl Feuerstein, the chairman of
the Mercedes-Benz employees' council and a member of the supervisory boards
of both Mercedes-Benz and Daimler-Benz, the parent company.
Mr Feuerstein, who has been fighting to bring the project to Germany, said
the plant would be built at Hambach, near Sarreguemine in Lorraine.
Mercedes-Benz refused to confirm the site, and insisted that negotiations
were continuing with several local authorities. An official announcement is
expected on December 20, following a meeting of the Daimler-Benz board.
Mr Feuerstein claimed that some 8,900 jobs would be created by the micro-car
project, including 800 to 1,000 jobs at the car plant itself. The bulk of
the jobs, however, would be created at suppliers to the project, including
3,900 at components producers in Germany. Some 1,300 jobs will be created at
Mercedes-Benz plants in Germany.
Mr Feuerstein said the French car plant would have capacity to produce up to
200,000 cars a year, with production beginning in 1997. Mercedes-Benz
planned to build additional micro-car plants elsewhere in Europe, if the car
was a success.
He attacked the choice of a French site, saying the Mercedes-Benz workforce
was 'angry and indignant' at the decision to locate the plant outside
Germany.
With the Swatchmobile, the company is aiming to open up a new segment at the
bottom of the European car market for a two-seater urban micro-car. At only
2.5 metres long, much shorter than the Mini, they can be parked in congested
cities head-on to the pavement.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Veba plans to invest DM30bn in
five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, will invest DM30bn (Dollars 19bn) over
the next five years, under a plan which will see the group reduce its
exposure in cyclical businesses such as chemicals and focus on becoming a
key player in European telecommunications.
About 40 per cent, or DM12.1bn, would be spent on investments in
PreussenElektra, the group's biggest division and Germany's second biggest
utility. A further DM2.1bn would be spent on telecoms, but the company said
that on top of the investment budget another DM8bn was available 'for
specific acquisitions or to start up partnerships'.
Some of that money could be spent on finding an experienced international
partner for Veba's expanding telecoms operation. The company had hoped to
find a partner by the end of this year but said that a decision was now
likely in January.
The group said it would continue to scale down its activities in chemical
commodities and concentrate the business more on specialities.
As part of its strategy to branch out into telecoms, Veba has already
approached ARD and ZDF, the two publicly-owned television stations, with an
offer to provide an alternative network which would have an expected
turnover of up to DM80m.
The company said it hoped Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the minister for post and
telecommunications, would approve Veba's application for the venture within
the next few months, marking the first time that the two channels would be
able to work with a company other than Deutsche Telekom, the monopoly soon
to be privatised.
However, the ministry said it had told Veba that no decision would be likely
in the near future and that a broader decision about how to deal with
so-called alternative networks would not be made until the middle of next
year.

FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and Unisource in telecoms
services venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms carrier, and Unisource, a consortium of
European telecoms operators, said yesterday they had established a new
company to provide telecommunications services to multinational groups in
Europe.
The company will intensify global competition in the lucrative market for
managed network services, where global 'supercarriers' provide a broad range
of sophisticated telecoms services for companies seeking worldwide
communications links.
The venture, as yet unnamed, will combine the data and business voice
services of the two organisations in Europe, and look to give customers
improved access to North America and Asia. Given the necessary regulatory
approvals, it should be fully functional by mid-1995.
Mr Viesturs Vucins, Unisource president, has been named chief executive. Mr
John Foster, president of AT&amp;T Communications Services Europe, is chief
operating officer. A location for the headquarters has yet to be chosen.
The formation of the company had been widely anticipated since the two
organisations became associates in AT&amp;T's 'WorldPartners' scheme, an
affiliation of telecoms carriers, earlier this year. Some services are
already available in Europe through this association.
Unisource, a pan-European telecoms services provider, is a joint venture
between the national carriers of the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and
Spain. It will own 60 per cent of the new venture and AT&amp;T, 40 per cent. The
company will have assets of about Dollars 200bn and 2,200 employees  - 500
from AT&amp;T and 1,700 from Unisource.
According to Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, president of AT&amp;T Europe, and Mr Lars
Berg, Unisource chairman, the new company starts life with revenues of over
Dollars 1bn. Profits forecasts were not disclosed, but Mr Falotti said the
group would invest about Dollars 1bn over the next few years to strengthen
and expand its infrastructure.
The principal market for the company is Europe, where it will be the
distributor for WorldPartners global services. International companies will
be offered a range of voice and data services including messaging and
video-conferencing. 'As business conditions and regulatory rules permit,'
AT&amp;T said yesterday, 'the new company will consider both service and
geographic expansion.'
The venture will be subject to the regulatory approval of the European Union
authorities, but will not need approval from the US Federal Communications
Commission.
It represents fresh competition for 'Concert,' an international voice and
data service established by British Telecommunications and MCI of the US and
for 'Atlas,' a similar service being established by US Sprint, Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom.
BT said it would make representations to the European Union and to the FCC.
It argues that with the exception of Sweden, Unisource partners are state
monopolies operating in unliberalised markets, and can therefore compete
unfairly with private companies, such as BT, operating in liberalised
markets.

Loan losses have wiped out the capital of some Czech commercial banks,
according to an investigation by the country's central bank.
'There could be some banks in the system that have negative capital
adequacy,' said Mr Ota Kaftan, head of banking supervision at the Czech
National Bank.
Three small institutions have already collapsed, and Agrobanka, the
fifth-largest bank, had to seek an injection after loan losses destroyed its
capital.
Further failures would mar an international image which has, in the latest
quarter, allowed three of the largest banks to raise syndicated loans at
only 65-70 basis points over the London interbank rate.
Komercni, Obchodni and Investnici banks, the main borrowers on international
markets, have evaluated their portfolios according to strict, international
standards at least since their 1993 results.
The CNB has, however, exposed a much higher level of bad debts than
previously recorded for the sector as a whole. The key ratio of
non-performing loans to assets jumped from 12 per cent in August to 20 per
cent in September, the first month in which the new international
methodology was applied.
Accounting, according to international standards, will force those Czech
banks which have not yet translated their accounts to recognise loan losses
that may exceed their capital.
Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank traded on the Prague stock market, is the
largest lender on the interbank market and is particularly exposed to
defaults by smaller banks.
The CNB said an adjustment for collateral and government guarantees improved
the picture, and warned that the figures could be misleading. 'It is not a
catastrophe,' said Mr Kaftan.
The Czech banking sector had capital of more than 6.25 per cent of assets at
the end of 1993, but the CNB refused to disclose the capital adequacy ratio
implied by the new classification of loans.
Hungary's first comprehensive evaluation of banks' portfolios revealed that
the two largest commercial banks had negative capital equivalent to 8 per
cent of assets.
Stricter evaluation of bad debts makes the Bank for International
Settlements' official deadline  - 1996  - for Czech banks to reach the 8 per
cent ratio less attainable.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RPO sales play sweet music as Tring rises
to Pounds 2.56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International Group, the publisher of budget-priced compact discs and
audio cassettes that was floated last February, is paying a maiden interim
dividend of 1.42p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose by 19 per cent from
Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.56m, while sales were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds
10.9m, compared with Pounds 9.47m last time.
The group, which sells roughly one CD or tape for every Pounds 1 of
turnover, ended the period with Pounds 2m net cash.
An agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is helping to drive sales
ahead. To date 24 titles have been released, a figure that is expected to
have more than doubled by the end of the financial year.
The CDs, which are sold for up to Pounds 3.99, are now available at 7,000
shops in the UK, including 300 branches of Tesco. The group will soon add WH
Smith to its customers.
Tring's range of recordings spans both popular and classical music. Its Hits
of the Sixties compilation sold more copies last month  - after a relaunch
 -than it did in June 1990, when the company was formed. However, it relies
on no single recording for its sales.
Mr Mark Frey, joint chief executive, said the group would soon introduce a
range of budget video tapes, ranging in price from Pounds 2.99 to Pounds
4.99. The tapes will feature children's entertainment, sport, health and
fitness and cookery, among other subjects.
'I see no reason why we cannot repeat our success with videos,' said Mr
Frey. We can use the same distribution, the same sales team and in many
cases we will have the same buyers.'
The possible costs of legal action by other music companies against the
company for alleged copyright violations were dismissed as insignificant.
'Litigation is an industry hobby,' said Mr Frey, adding that any damages
against the company would be covered by warranties and indemnities.
The prospectus said that the interim distribution would be roughly one third
of the full dividend. Earnings per share were 3.98p, against a pro forma
3.57p.
The shares, placed at 118p, were unchanged yesterday at 119p.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Leading Edge leaves Kleeneze at Pounds
0.13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleeneze Holdings, the home shopping and mail order company, yesterday
blamed bad debt provisions and losses by The Leading Edge, its former retail
chain, for a big fall in profits.
The group saw pre-tax profits slide from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 128,000 in
the year to August 31, despite increased turnover of Pounds 74.1m, compared
with Pounds 56.6m last time.
Its performance was undermined by operating losses of Pounds 1.02m at The
Leading Edge, which was sold in August for Pounds 850,000, incurring a
further Pounds 433,000 loss on disposal.
An exceptional Pounds 800,000 provision for bad debts also hampered profits
on its continuing operations, which fell slightly from Pounds 2.04m to
Pounds 1.99m.
Mr Robin Klein, chairman, said the provision was a one-off charge to cover
bad debts run up by direct selling agents who, he admitted, had not been
monitored rigorously enough.
The company has since vetted its sales force, withdrawn accounts from 400
agents, and yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Nigel Swabey, who has
run the Kleeneze direct selling division since 1988.
Mr Klein said it was essential to restore 'adequate controls' in the
division, where profits fell from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 412,000.
Earnings per share fell 6.08p to 0.89p. But despite the problems, the
company is recommending an increased dividend of 1.5p (1p).
The move, according to Mr Klein, reflected the group's confidence in its
core Innovations catalogue business, which lifted profits from Pounds
582,000 to Pounds 1.59m.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Inspirations to buy Caledonian - Disposal
marks British Airways' exit from the charter airline business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday announced its departure from the charter airline
business by revealing it was to sell Caledonian Airways to Inspirations, the
tour operator, for Pounds 16.6m.
BA said the development of vertically integrated holiday groups meant it
made sense for Caledonian to be part of a tour operating company.
Inspirations, which was floated on the USM a year ago, is attempting to
emulate large travel groups such as Thomson and Airtours, which have their
own airlines.
BA said Caledonian represented a 'tiny proportion' of British Caledonian,
which it bought for Pounds 250m in 1987. Most of British Caledonian has been
integrated into BA's scheduled services. Caledonian, which was set up in May
1988, absorbed British Airtours, BA's charter airline.
BA said that although it would still provide aircraft, such as Concorde, on
a charter basis, it would no longer provide charter services for tour
operators.
Inspirations said it would raise Pounds 6.7m through a 1-for-4 rights issue
at 120p a share. The shares closed yesterday at 143p, up 3p.
The consideration to BA will take the form of a Pounds 4.9m cash payment,
with Pounds 2.9m payable on March 31 1995, when the deal is due to be
completed. Two payments of Pounds 1m each will be made on November 1 1996
and November 1 1997.
Inspirations will also take on an Pounds 11.7m loan made by BA to
Caledonian, repayable over five years. Inspirations will receive five
Lockheed TriStar aircraft. In addition, Inspirations will abandon its plan
 -announced in October  - to set up an airline called International Airways,
although it will still lease three Airbus A320s, which will become part of
the Caledonian fleet.
Caledonian will retain its brand name and livery, including its golden lion
logo and tartan uniforms.
Inspirations' pre-tax profit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 4.5m,
compared with Pounds 2.54m in the 11 months to September 30 1993. Turnover
was Pounds 209.8m, against Pounds 118.4m last time. Earnings per share were
21.4p (9.3p) and the final dividend is 2.24p, making 2.8p.

Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing homes, hospitals and homecare group,
yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits amid growing demand for
private medical services.
The company, which raised Pounds 29m from its flotation earlier this year,
saw pre-tax profits more than double from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 5.3m in the
12 months to October 2, as turnover increased 39 per cent to Pounds 41.7m
(Pounds 30m).
Mr Graham Smith, chief executive, said the figures justified the group's
expansion  - involving Pounds 8.2m of acquisi-tions since it came to the
market.
He signalled a further step in that strategy yesterday by announcing the
Pounds 4.9m acquisition of two nursing homes and a sheltered housing
management company from Emerson Group, the privately owned property
developer.
The cash purchase will push net borrowing up to Pounds 23.1m  - equivalent
to gearing of 48 per cent  - and will increase Goldsborough's total number
of beds to 1,349.
Outlining plans for further acquisitions, Mr Smith said the group would be
comfortable with gearing of up to 75 per cent 'although we'd prefer it to
remain below 50 per cent'.
The group is also increasing its homecare activities by opening five new
branches, serving an area of the market which it claimed was proving more
popular than residential homes.
Of the group's three main divisions, however, profits in homecare were
outstripped by both care homes and acute hospitals.
Profits from care homes rose from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 6.1m; while in acute
hospitals they increased from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.9m. Homecare,
nevertheless, reported increased profits of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 700,000).
Earnings per share rose from 7.1p to 13p, or from 9.1p to 11.6p after
adjustment for recovery of advance corporation tax; the group announced a
maiden full year dividend of 2.3p, some 5 per cent ahead of expectations.
The shares rose 4p to 148p yesterday, still well below the flotation price
of 170p.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts David Smith to
Pounds 40.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at David S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office
supplies group, jumped from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 40.4m in the six months
to October 29.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said he was disappointed at a share
price rise of just 1p to 499p. He ascribed the flat response to Monday's
report from SG Warburg which assessed the group as a paper stock, pitted
against global competitors.
Mr Williams said that paper only accounted for 25 per cent of turnover since
the acquisition of Kaysersberg Packaging and Spicers, the stationery
wholesaler and manufacturer.
He also believed that Warburg had wrongly estimated the overcapacity in
Europe. He said that although historically paper companies tended to
underperform the market when new capacity came on stream, recent
announcements of new capacity would not yet meet the demand.
Turnover grew 41 per cent to Pounds 475.4m (Pounds 337.9m). Without Spicers,
which was only in last time's figures for three months, the rise would have
been 20 per cent. Operating profits jumped to Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 19.5m)
and without Spicers would have been Pounds 36.2m.
Mr Williams said the sharp rises could be attributed to three factors.
First, the economic upturn in Smith's markets, particularly the UK and
Ireland, where operating profits rose to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 11.2m) on
turnover of Pounds 355.5m (Pounds 243.7m).
Second, the modernised Kemsley mill 'came even righter than we thought',
capitalising on the upturn in the cycle. Third, prices for waste,
artificially depressed by German environmental policies, became more
responsive to market forces. These factors led to an improvement in
operating margins from 5.8 to 9.6 per cent.
Raw material prices rose by up to 50 per cent and were set to rise further,
said Mr Williams.
Gearing advanced from 37 per cent at the end of April to 41 per cent as
borrowings rose by Pounds 21.3m over the six months to Pounds 141.6m.
The interim dividend is lifted to 4.25p (2.75p) and earnings expanded to
20.4p (9.3p) per share.
COMMENT
The City has been upgrading forecasts since April; even so the profits came
in about Pounds 5m higher than expectations. Warburg's report seems a little
short-sighted given Smith's broadened and strengthened portfolio. The
upswing looks to last longer than predicted, peaking as late as 1998-99,
when some City voices reckon earnings could climb to 70p-80p. Anyway, Smith
has bought itself protection with Kaysersberg and Spicers. With pre-tax
profits redrawn at Pounds 90m for the current year and Pounds 118m the
following (giving earnings of 45.4p and 56.7p respectively), the multiples
would be 11 and 8.8. The latter is a 25 per cent discount to the market.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Coats' carpets disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textiles company, yesterday cleared the way
for an expansion of its thread, clothing and fashion retailing businesses by
agreeing to sell its carpets division to Shaw Industries of the US, one of
the world's largest carpet manufacturers.
The move is expected to be followed shortly by the disposal of its yarns and
fabrics business, enabling the group to devote more resources to its core
activities.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said the group had been hoping to sell the
carpets business for some time but Shaw had only emerged as a bidder in the
past three weeks.
'This deal will give us more focus and enable us to invest more in both
established and emerging textile markets,' he said.
For Shaw, which last year reported after-tax profits of Dollars 129.2m
(Pounds 78.7m) on sales of Dollars 2.63bn, the acquisition brings with it
four yarn spinning mills and two tufted carpet plants.
It declined, however, to disclose the size of the cash offer for the Coats'
business, which made profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 58.8m in the
six months to June 30 1994.

Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textiles company, yesterday cleared the way
for an expansion of its thread, clothing and fashion retailing businesses by
agreeing to sell its carpets division to Shaw Industries of the US, one of
the world's largest carpet manufacturers.
The move is expected to be followed shortly by the disposal of its yarns and
fabrics business, enabling the group to devote more resources to its core
activities.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said the group had been hoping to sell the
carpets business for some time but Shaw had only emerged as a bidder in the

'This deal will give us more focus and enable us to invest more in both
established and emerging textile markets,' he said.
For Shaw, which last year reported after-tax profits of Dollars 129.2m
(Pounds 78.7m) on sales of Dollars 2.63bn, the acquisition brings with it
four yarn spinning mills and two tufted carpet plants.
The US group's offer follows its announcement earlier this year of a new
joint venture with Mexico's Grupo Industrial Alfa to make and distribute
carpets in central and South America.
It declined, however, to disclose the size of the cash offer for the Coats'
business, which made profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 58.8m in the
six months to June 30 1994.
Once the acquisition is completed in the new year, the UK group is expected
to outline plans for expanding its thread business, the largest division
with first-half profits of Pounds 46.1m.
It is also thought to be seeking acquisition opportunities in continental
Europe for its clothing business and considering a possible move into North
America.
Mr Bain, meanwhile, hinted at greater promotion of the group's Jaeger and
Viyella brand names, which he said were under exploited at present, while
also establishing an international presence for its home furnishings
business.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Greenalls 10% ahead to Pounds 74.8m - First
full-year contribution from Devenish helps advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first full-year contribution from the Devenish pub chain helped
Greenalls Group report a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 68m
to Pounds 74.8m for the year to September 30.
The smooth integration of Devenish should continue to bring benefits this
year, which was off to a good start for the whole group, Mr Andrew Thomas,
chairman, said.
The group should also benefit from new supply agreements with brewers,
improving hotel returns, new concepts in its off-licence chain and expansion
of Tavern, its drinks wholesaling business.
The Devenish pubs, acquired for Pounds 214m in July 1993, contributed
operating profits of Pounds 24.5m and were earnings enhancing.
Pre-tax profits were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 13.4m (profits
of Pounds 165,000), incurred mostly in closing Greenalls' soft drink maker.
Before exceptionals, profits rose 30 per cent and benefited from an extra
week of trading in the latest year.
The group's pubs operating profits were up 39 per cent at Pounds 75.9m, or
up 8 per cent without Devenish. Food sales per outlet rose 9 per cent and
drink sales 5 per cent. Premier House restaurants and lodges raised profits
by 57 per cent to Pounds 16.4m, or by 35 per cent without Devenish.
De Vere Hotels benefited from rising room and occupancy rates which helped
it to an 18 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 19.8m. Revenue per available
room was up 7 per cent to Pounds 32. The group's six US hotels, which are
for sale, turned in Pounds 768,000 (Pounds 145,000).
Off-licence profits slipped 4.7 per cent to Pounds 4.3m, but new management
and trading concepts brought a second half recovery after an 11 per cent
drop in first half profits. Drinks manufacture and distribution and leisure
contributed Pounds 8.4m, up 33 per cent.
A net cash outflow of Pounds 25.8m in the latest year should fall to an
outflow of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m this year as hotel building
ended, the company said. Borrowing rose to Pounds 395m (Pounds 368.5m) for
gearing of 55 per cent (46 per cent).
A proposed final dividend of 7.77p makes 13.1p for the year, up 6 per cent.
Earnings per share were 26.09p (28.37p) fully diluted after exceptionals and
30.78p (28.28p) before. Turnover from continuing operations rose 23 per cent
to Pounds 716.2m.
COMMENT
Highly advantageous long-term supply agreements with brewers show the value
to Greenalls of quitting brewing to concentrate on retailing. Only
Boddington Group offers a similar play in a fair-sized company. But
Greenalls has a better geographic spread and is more innovative. Steady
growth in pubs and a rising contribution from new hotels should help pre-tax
profits hit Pounds 97.5m this year for earnings of 34.5p. This puts the
shares on a realistic multiple of 12.3 on yesterday close of 425p, up 9p.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant hotel showing behind 14% rise at
Vaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux, the hotels and pubs group, yesterday
mounted a thinly veiled criticism of Queens Moat Houses, the rival hotel
chain living on the sufferance of its banks while it refinances Pounds 1.3m
of debt.
'Certain companies, which ran into financial difficulties, have been kept
afloat with subsidies from their bankers enabling them to gain a competitive
advantage over properly financed companies,' he said.
Sir Paul was unveiling a 14 per cent rise in Vaux's pre-tax profits from
Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 29.3m for the year to September 30, with a strong
contribution from its Swallow Hotels chain offsetting flat beer profits.
The current year was running ahead of budget, he added.
Companies subsidised by their bankers disrupt the hotel market and 'pay
excessive salary' levels to attract staff. Liquidating such companies would
have avoided the problems, he said.
Swallow reported a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 15.9m as
occupancy and room rates improved to give a 3.8 per cent increase in room
yield.
Profits from brewing and tenanted pubs were flat at Pounds 21.5m despite a 6
per cent increase in volume of beer brewed to 550,000 barrels. Vaux
maintained its 4 per cent share of the northern draught market which had
fallen 2.6 per cent. Extensive price discounting continued in the on and off
trades.
Profits from Vaux Inns, the managed pubs, edged ahead to Pounds 5m (Pounds
4.9m). Planning permission delays meant some pubs were closed during the
summer for refurbishment.
St Andrews nursing homes reported a 23 per cent rise in profits to Pounds
17.3m on a 30 per cent increase in beds.
Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 243.5m (Pounds 234.9m). A proposed final
dividend of 6.5p makes a total of 9.85p, up 3.7 per cent. Earnings per share
were 17.88p (16.01p) before property profits and a tax credit and 16.5p
(14.75p) after.
COMMENT
Vaux has two conflicting calls on its limited cash: spending more to develop
its pub estate and raising dividends for investors used to a high yield. It
tilted yesterday towards investment, which could undermine the shares a
little. On the trading front, a cyclical recovery of hotels will more than
compensate for flat beer and pub profits to give pre-tax profits this year
of about Pounds 31.5m for earnings of 17.4p. On a forward multiple of 13,
the shares are a hold at best.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Assets holders urged to reject
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, is urging shareholders in British
Assets Trust to vote against the proposed reorganisation at the
extraordinary meeting scheduled for December 20.
It is also suggesting that shareholders who have already voted in favour
should withdraw their proxies by the cut-off date of December 15.
Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund manager, admitted last month that British
Assets, its flagship investment trust with 30,500 shareholders, could not
maintain its high dividends.
It is offering shareholders a choice between keeping their ordinary shares,
with a maintained dividend but the possibility of future earnings dilution;
and swapping them for a package which offers an immediate cut in income but
the hope of greater long term capital growth.
Shareholders who want the package need to make the election by December 15.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Emap wins Maclean Hunter - Purchase takes
media group into Germany for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the media and exhibitions group, yesterday won the battle for Maclean
Hunter European Publishing with a Pounds 60m deal.
It is believed it beat off United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily
Express, Bertelsmann, the German media group, and Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, to acquire the group from Rogers Communications of Toronto.
The deal, which is subject to Rogers' purchase earlier this year of Maclean
Hunter getting Canadian regulatory approval, greatly expands Emap's presence
in continental Europe which has been largely confined to France until now.
MHEP publishes 22 directories, provides seven electronic information
services and publishes 34 business magazines in six countries apart from the
UK. In the UK the publications include UK Press Gazette, the business
publication of the newspaper industry, and BRAD (British Rate and Data).
More importantly the acquisition takes Emap into the German market in a
significant way for the first time through the Media Daten directory and
Germany's second largest portfolio of construction business magazines,
directories and information services.
The deal marks what may be the end, for the time being at least, of a very
active period for Emap on the takeover trail. During the first half of the
current financial year Emap spent Pounds 197m on acquisitions, including
Pounds 106m for 28 magazines from Editions Mondiales, the French publisher,
and a further 10 consumer titles from the Hersant group of France.
It also included Pounds 50m on Trans World Communications, the commercial
radio group.
Mr Robin Miller, group chief executive, promised yesterday that the company
would continue to take advantage of any opportunities which arose.
He added: 'Our main efforts will now be concentrated on achieving the
anticipated returns from the recent additions to our business.'
Last month Mr David Arculus, managing director, made it clear he regarded
the Maclean titles as a 'bolt-on' to the existing business titles.
The latest deal is part of Emap's determination to expand in continental
Europe.
'Within the space of six months we have firmly established ourselves first
in France and now in Germany with smaller operations in a number of other
European countries,' Mr Miller said.
Last month Emap reported pre-tax profits up 34 per cent at Pounds 22.2m for
the six months to the beginning of October on turnover up 38 per cent at
Pounds 234.2m.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hanson chief pay boosted to Pounds 1.04m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Bonham, deputy chairman and chief executive of Hanson, saw his
total pay rise by a third to Pounds 1.04m for the year ended September 30.
This was because of a bonus which was linked to the group's 32 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits for the period to Pounds 1.35bn.
Lord Hanson, the chairman, received an unchanged amount of Pounds 1.36m.
Under a scheme introduced two years ago the executive directors received
bonuses totalling Pounds 2.49m, of which Pounds 1.45m related to directors
whose services are performed mainly outside the UK.
The previous year, when profits were depressed by the recession and the coal
dispute at Peabody, the total bonus was Pounds 265,000 of which Pounds
218,000 related to US directors.
Lord Hanson is not included in this scheme.
The regular salary bill for the executive directors rose 7 per cent to
Pounds 7.26m with total directors' emoluments up by a quarter to Pounds
11.4m.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Southern Electric shows 20% advance to
Pounds 107m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Electric sustained the momentum of strong profit growth in the
electricity sector yesterday as rumours swept the stock market of an
imminent takeover bid for one of the regional electricity companies.
Southern's shares ended with a gain of 6p to 756p. But Northern Electric,
SWEB and Seeboard were among the day's strongest performers as they became
the focus of bid speculation.
Southern's profits were up 20 per cent to Pounds 106.8m pre-tax on the back
of strong demand and continuing cost reductions. Turnover was down as
regulatory pressures impacted on electricity prices.
Earnings per share improved to 29.69p (24.8p). The interim dividend goes up
by 24 per cent to 8.3p  - well below increases announced by other recs
during the current reporting season. But Southern was one of only two recs
which did not make dividend-enhacing share buy-backs this year.
Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said Southern's region 'has performed
well', with units distributed up 3.7 per cent. Growth was especially strong
in the industrial and residential sectors.
The non-electricity businesses lifted profits by 10.7 per cent, reflecting
strength in the contracting and cable-laying operations. But retailing lost
money, as did the newly formed gas supply business which Southern said it
was viewing with caution.
Controllable costs were down 5.6 per cent and manpower down 12 per cent.
Southern is now ahead of its job reduction target, but still aims to shed
1,200 of its 4,200 jobs by 2000.
Southern has already announced a price freeze and rebates which it said
yesterday would bring total savings passed on to customers since
privatisation to Pounds 112m.
COMMENT
Insofar as the market was able to concentrate amid the bid excitement, these
were seen as a solid set of figures, confirming Southern's position as one
of the sector's soundest, if most conservative, members. The relatively low
dividend increase is caused partly by Southern's decision not to buy back
any shares, at least until the tax uncertainties of the National Grid sale
are out of the way. The shares yield about the sector average, which
suggests that Southern's performance inspires respect if not excitement. But
the appointment of a managing director yesterday with specific
responsibility to find a replacement for Grid earnings also suggests welcome
long-sightedness.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive British Land expands 11% to
Pounds 17.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land, the property investment company which last month unexpectedly
wound up its joint venture with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, reported an
11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.9m.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said the company would remain an active buyer
despite the Pounds 142m cost of buying out Quantum from the joint venture
fund, which was set up in June 1993 and was expected to last for 10 years.
The deal gave British Land full ownership of the joint venture's Pounds 591m
property portfolio.
In addition, it has spent Pounds 190m on acquisitions since its March year
end, when the portfolio was valued at Pounds 2.2bn.
The main purchases in the period were 73,000 sq ft of offices and shops at
2/14 Baker Street, central London, and 76,000 sq ft of retail warehouses in
Oxford.
Mr Ritblat said British Land had committed bank facilities and cash of
Pounds 430m after the Quantum deal. Interest charges were covered 1.7 times
by net rents during the period, he added.
British Land is known to be interested in acquiring the Broadgate office
development in the City of London.
It has a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, the developer which owns half of
Broadgate and is in last-ditch refinancing negotiations with its banks.
Boosted by acquisitions and rent reviews, net rental income for the half
year to September 30 amounted to Pounds 66.4m, up from Pounds 58.1m.
After interest charges of Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 40.8m) revenue profits,
excluding capital items, increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 23.7m.
Capital items included a loss on realised exchange movements of Pounds 1.1m
(Pounds 1.4m) and the Pounds 4.7m one-off cost of redeeming long-dated bonds
secured on properties which were acquired in 1992.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said the company had decided to
redeem the bonds early because they carried restrictive coven-ants.
British Land's share of the Quantum joint venture contributed Pounds 8.1m to
net rental income and Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits. The company also
received fees for managing the joint venture which were included in other
income of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 900,000).
Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 2.1p, or from 3.9p to 3.6p diluted.
The interim dividend is lifted 8 per cent to 2.64p.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Halma extends growth record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halma, the sensor and detector manufacturer, extended its remarkable growth
record with a 24 per cent increase in first half profits to Pounds 12.5m
before tax, against Pounds 10m.
The interim dividend of 1.12p (0.933p) is up 20 per cent, a rate of increase
the group has maintained since 1979. Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to
4.2p.
Mr David Barber, chairman, said the group had benefited from strong markets
in America and Asia and had seen indications of some recovery in certain of
its European markets. But the UK had shown little sign of growth.
'The UK was relatively flat and it feels pretty much the same in the second
half.'
Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 70.6m thanks largely to strong
overseas sales which rose to 58 per cent of the total. Halma's direct
exports, which have grown strongly over the past two years, rose 22 per cent
to Pounds 22m.
Mr Barber said that its Apollo fire detector subsidiary had seen US sales
treble in the first six months.
Trading margins swelled from 16.4 per cent to 17.7 per cent despite what Mr
Barber identified as a changing attitude towards price increases. 'Even in a
group like ours, selling highly specialised products, there is a feeling
that you should not be passing on cost increases to customers.'
In the UK profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 8.73m on sales up only 5 per
cent to Pounds 29.7m. US profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.59m while the
rest of the world doubled to Pounds 1.01m.
Out of its main continental markets Mr Barber said France had been very good
but the Netherlands was relatively flat.
Profits were boosted by a full contribution from acquisitions made last
year. Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Markets, estimated
that these accounted for about half the growth in sales and profits.
The company spent Pounds 4.8m on acquisitions and capital projects in the
first half but ended with record net cash of Pounds 12.7m.
NatWest is forecasting full-year profits of Pounds 29.5m which puts the
shares at 220p, up 1p yesterday, on a forward multiple of 22 times earnings.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Triplex mounts recovery and plans division
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the engineering group, returned to profit at the interim
stage, after a lapse into the red during the second half of the previous
year. It also announced that it had put its engineering division on the
market, writes Paul Cheeseright.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 2.55m,
against Pounds 1.45m in the first half of last year and an annual loss of
Pounds 2.91m.
The recovery comes on the back of swelling order books for its power and
automotive divisions. Orders for the group totalled Pounds 67.5m at the end
of the first half compared with Pounds 46.3m last time. The recovery is
likely to accelerate in the second half as increased property profits become
available.
The engineering division contributed Pounds 15.4m to turnover from
continuing operations of Pounds 84.7m (Pounds 67.5m). 'We've cut all the
losses out and the division is for sale,' Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, said,
adding that there were 'some interested parties'.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p, just covered by earnings per
share of 2.8p (1.6p).

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope's future hangs in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Stanhope hung in the balance last night after a meeting of
banks owed Pounds 140m broke up without a decision on whether to accept
proposed rescue offers or put the troubled property developer into
receivership.
The meeting of 16 banks led by Barclays did not extend the company's
existing borrowing facility beyond next Monday. The lending syndicate must
therefore decide on a course of action within the next few days.

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berkeley 41% ahead to Pounds 17.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing stability in the new housing market helped Berkeley Group record
a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 17.8m,
for the six months to October 31.
Berkeley, which specialises in executive homes and is prominent in the
south-east, said that the average sale price had risen by Pounds 30,000 to
Pounds 190,000.
Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said that the price improvement had come
from the change in the mix of units sold, rather than any significant rise
in prices. He described the current price environment as 'stagnant but
solid', with the London market the most buoyant. However, he did not foresee
any further price rises during the coming year.
'The feelgood factor is still missing for most potential buyers,' he said.
With land prices rising strongly this year and building costs also
increasing, Mr Pidgley said that margins had come under pressure, although
the group had managed to increase profitability through its large landbank
and by responding to changes in customers' specifications. 'You cannot
afford to be an inefficient building group in this market,' he said.
He added that land prices were now beginning to ease off, although they
still remained 'ridiculously high'. The group's landbank was steady during
the period and now stood at 5,000 units. The group also maintained a net
cash balance, with Pounds 10m in the bank.
Turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 128.7m (Pounds 103.9m). Earnings per
share rose 40 per cent to 15.4p (11p) and the interim dividend is raised
from 1.9p to 2.1p.
Berkeley has also been pursuing developments in the commercial property
market through two joint venture companies as well as its own division.

Shares in First Technology rose 34p to 364p yesterday as the company, which
supplies sensors and crash test dummies to the car industry, announced a 60
per cent rise in pre-tax profits and a sharper rise in the interim dividend
from 1p to 2.8p.
Profits advanced to Pounds 2.82m (Pounds 1.76m) on turnover which was flat
at Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 16.1m) as a four-year contract to supply Cadillac
with accelerometers came to an expected end. That business is to be replaced
as work for Fiat and PSA Group comes on stream.
Earnings per share emerged at 11.77p (7.36p).

FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Former Spring Ram chief raises Pounds 6m
from sale of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Rooney, the former chairman of Spring Ram, yesterday raised some
Pounds 6m with the sale of almost a quarter of his stake in the kitchen,
bathroom and furniture group from which he was ousted last year.
The sale comes just two weeks after Mr Rooney, who recently announced a
Pounds 6.6m deal to take control of Atreus, the bathroom goods supplier,
denied he was actively seeking to sell his shares. However, he is understood
this week to have approached Spring Ram's brokers, Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
for help in placing them.
Mr Rooney had agreed with Spring Ram's management that any sale would be
conducted through the brokers to ensure an orderly market. It is understood
the shares have been placed with a range of institutions.
Mr Rooney and associated family trusts sold 15m shares, representing 3.3 per
cent of the company, at a price believed to have been 42p each against last
night's close of 43 1/2 p, down  1/2 p. The sale leaves the Rooney family
with 46.4m shares, or 10.2 per cent of Spring Ram.
The company's largest shareholder is now Prudential, with just over 11 per
cent.
Mr Rooney was forced off the Spring Ram board by institutional investors 14
months ago following revelations of false accounting at its Balterley
Bathrooms subsidiary and three profits warnings in eight months. Before
this, the group had enjoyed 13 years of rapid growth.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Saatchi may quit if name dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's non-executive directors want to change the name of the
advertising group's holding company, but have been warned by Mr Maurice
Saatchi, the group's founder and executive chairman, that he may resign if
his surname is dropped.
The issue is likely to come to a head on Friday, when the board is scheduled
to discuss a possible change in group identity and other proposals put to
the company by a group of dissident shareholders. 'The board is completely
split on whether to force Maurice out,' said one Saatchi director.
Saatchi non-executives - including Sir Peter Walters, SmithKline Beecham
chairman; Mr Paul Girolami, former Glaxo Holdings chairman; Professor Ted
Levitt of Harvard University; and financier Mr Clive Gibson - gave their
views in favour of a name change at a meeting last week. However, a formal
vote to retain the Saatchi name only for use by operating subsidiaries has
not yet been taken.
Many Saatchi employees and directors back the argument put forward by rival
advertising group WPP that the holding company brand name should be
different from the operating subsidiaries' brand names. They argue that the
development of those subsidiaries without 'Saatchi' in their name is stifled
because when they win a client, the success is often described as a
'Saatchi' achievement.
Mr Saatchi has the backing of a majority of executive directors for his
continuation as chairman. However there are only four executive directors,
including Mr Saatchi, compared with seven non-executives. Executives
immediately below board level are split on whether Mr Saatchi is an asset as
chairman.
Saatchi's five biggest shareholders, controlling a third of the shares, have
proposed to the board that it should drop a plan to give Mr Saatchi a Pounds
5m option package, that it should change its name and that it should
consider asking Mr Saatchi to stand down as holding company chairman to
become chairman of the operating subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.
They are threatening to requisition an extraordinary meeting to put the
issue to a shareholder vote, if the board fails to do what they want.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Montague gets new writ from Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second bankruptcy petition has been served on Mr Robert Montague, chief
executive of Tiphook, the container rental group, after the breakdown of
negotiations between Mr Montague and creditor banks over his estimated
Pounds 40m of personal debts.
Barclays Bank, which is owed about Pounds 9m, is thought to have served the
notice late last week. Mr Montague was issued with his first writ, for
Pounds 2.3m by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in September.
That was due to be heard last month but was extended until December 22 in
order to give Mr Montague time to reach agreement with his creditors, which
also include Commerzbank and Lloyds Bank.
The Barclays petition is due to be heard on January 9.
Of the money owed to Barclays, some Pounds 8m is secured on Mr Montague's
1,300-acre estate at Pusey in Oxfordshire. RBS's outstanding debts are
thought to relate to loans made for improvements and upkeep of the estate.
Commerzbank is said to be owed about Pounds 12m, of which about Pounds 7m is
secured on Mr Montague's yacht, which is up for sale.
The latest development in the financial turmoil surrounding Mr Montague will
increase pressure on the Tiphook board ahead of its interim results tomorrow
which are expected to reveal further deep losses. The group, which has seen
its stock market value shrink to a twelfth of its worth three years ago,
last year made losses of Pounds 331.1m.
If Mr Montague were to be made bankrupt, it would disqualify him from
serving as a director of a public company. The Tiphook board has so far
remained loyal to its former chairman and present chief executive. It said
last night: 'The company regards Mr Montague's private affairs as just that
 -private. The company will not comment on speculation until it is presented
with the facts.'
A banker close to the negotiations said that further discussions may be held
between the two sides, but added: 'The banks are pretty fed up with a
situation that has dragged on too long.'
Mr Montague had wanted to negotiate an individual voluntary agreement, under
which he would have sought to pay back his debts over a period of time, but
would have been allowed to remain on the board of Tiphook.

FT  14 DEC 94 / ICI looks outside on pensions: In-house manager may be
scrapped as bids sought for Pounds 4.6bn scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries is preparing to scrap the in-house manager for
its Pounds 4.6bn pension scheme and has asked leading investment fund
managers to make presentations to manage the funds externally. If ICI farmed
out its entire investment portfolio, it would be the largest 'beauty parade'
for external fund managers held in the UK within recent memory.
ICI yesterday confirmed that the management of the pension scheme was under
review but said no decisions had been made. Several leading fund managers
said privately they had been asked to bid for the business.
ICI is said to be seeking a core of managers to run 'balanced' portfolios
investing in the UK and abroad in shares and bonds and a group of
'specialist' managers who will manage smaller satellite portfolios of
investments in discrete geographical regions or special asset classes.
Two weeks ago, Zeneca, the drugs company which was demerged from ICI in
1993, formally withdrew its Pounds 1.3bn in pension assets from the ICI
Pension Fund, leaving only the property portfolio with the in-house manager.
Its new managers are PDFM, Mercury Asset Management, Schroder Investment
Management and JP Morgan Investment Management.
ICI and Zeneca's pension schemes combined had been the 10th largest scheme
in Britain. The decision to review the scheme's management follows the
sudden death in the summer of Mr Thomas Heyes, long-time head ICI's
investment department, and a wider review of the scheme.
ICI, like many other large UK companies, has used its pension scheme to
provide early retirement benefits to significant numbers of workers made
redundant since the early 1980s. The provision of early retirement benefits
has the effect of forcing schemes to crystallise their liabilities, a move
which could force them to switch investments out of equities and into bonds.
That switch could prompt employers to add additional cash to their schemes
because, over time, bonds offer lower total returns than equities.
In 1993, ICI and Zeneca together had more than 86,000 current or deferred
pensioners and only 38,000 contributing members, according to Pension Funds
and Their Advisers, an industry handbook. Its investments are heavily tilted
towards equities with nearly 80 per cent of assets in UK or overseas shares.
Just over 10 per cent of the schemes' combined assets are in UK or overseas
bonds.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Global equity buyers dance to a Latin beat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year the global equity market was blown up like a bubble but in 1994 it
has behaved more like a sponge. The eager US pension funds and mutual fund
investors have seen the FT-Actuaries World Index mostly reverse in the
second half-year the 3 per cent gain of the first six months.
This is the relatively benign picture as viewed from the perspective of a
dollar-based investor. The Swiss fund manager, however, thinks the world
index is down by 13 per cent, the Japanese by 8 per cent.
The spread around an unexciting global average performance has been less
dispersed than in 1993. The key features have been relative strength in
Japan, up 16 per cent in terms of dollars, and in parts of Latin America,
where Brazil - newly admitted to the World Index list - is up more than 60
per cent.
Weakness has been concentrated in Asia, focused on Malaysia and, especially,
Hong Kong where the index fall has been 37 per cent. There has been more
modest relative weakness in some of the European stock markets, notably
those of France and the UK. By the close last night London's Footsie Index
was showing a decline of 14 per cent on the year.
These movements clearly reflect the flows of funds across borders, in so far
as slow and patchy statistics permit them to be tracked. The notable event
in 1994 has been the rush of Dollars 47bn (Pounds 28.6bn) of foreign funds
into Japanese equities in the first half. But the benefit was seen in the
currency as much as in the stock market, where overstretched Japanese
financial institutions have taken advantage of the gaijin money to improve
their balance sheets.
There were better rewards from the cascade of dollars into South America. In
the first half, US investors put Dollars 5.2bn into Latin America but only
Dollars 600m into Asia (excluding Japan). In fact money was withdrawn from
Hong Kong in the first quarter, and despite a flow back during the early
summer the outflow appears to have been resumed more recently.
The challenge for the global investor is how to front-run these ebbs and
flows of hot money, mostly deriving from the US. UK fund managers used to be
among the leading global players but have recently been sitting largely on
the sidelines - where their performance has suffered.
Thus UK pension funds began the year with less than half the World Index
weightings in Japan and the US, and two or three times the weightings in
Asia (excluding Japan) and continental Europe. The money was in all the
wrong places.
During the year there has been some modest shifting of money into Japan and
more recently a repatriation from continental Europe. But according to
measurement data from the WM Company, the median overseas equity portfolio
of a UK pension fund was showing a negative return of 3.3 per cent by the
end of the third quarter, suggesting nine-month underperformance against the
World ex-UK Index of some 5 per cent. Of course, this has to be seen in the
context of outperformance of a massive 14 per cent in 1993.
Recently the UK fund managers' own domestic market appears to have been
under attack by foreign sellers. Can this be the start of the much-feared
sell-off by US international mutual funds as their cash inflows turn
negative?
As it happens, international investors have themselves taken a dim view
recently of the US stock market - which still accounts for 33 per cent of
global market capitalisation. Foreigners were net sellers of Dollars 2bn of
US equities in the second quarter. But this was a fleabite and Wall Street
has remained amazingly steady, despite pressures from the bond bear market.
Flow of funds statistics are so out of date that we can only guess at the
most recent trends. The modest recovery of the dollar would certainly argue
that some repatriation of funds has been proceeding. The danger is that by
imposing currency losses on remaining US global portfolios the effect will
be destabilising.
Until Americans have a longer track record as major cross-border portfolio
investors their behaviour will continue to worry and perplex the established
global players.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Albright &amp; Wilson returns to market: Tenneco hopes to raise
Pounds 600m from flotation of UK chemicals group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>

   LONDON, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Albright &amp; Wilson, one of the oldest names in the UK chemicals industry, is
returning to the London stock market with a flotation its US parent hopes
will raise at least Pounds 600m. Its return to public company status should
rank it as the UK's fifth biggest chemicals company behind Imperial Chemical
Industries, Courtaulds, BOC Group and Laporte.
The company, which makes specialist ingredients for household goods and
foods, including Sainsbury's own-brand washing powders and Coca-Cola, lost
its independence in 1978 when Tenneco, the US diversified industrial group,
paid Pounds 115m for the 50.2 per cent of the company it did not own.
The transaction would be Tenneco's second large disposal in a year. Earlier
this year, it had successful public offerings of 55 per cent of the Case
Corporation farm and construction equipment supplier. Both deals are part of
Tenneco's goal 'to become less cyclical', said Mr Dana Mead, chairman.
He said Tenneco would buy back Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m), or about 7.2 per
cent, of its common shares. The flotation and buy-back were not directly
related, he said.
The proceeds might go towards acquisitions, said Mr Mead, adding that it
would be some time before Tenneco would make a deal in the Dollars 1bn-range
that Wall Street seems to expect.
The Albright &amp; Wilson flotation is scheduled 'for the first quarter of
1995'.
The company had sales in 1993 of Pounds 609m, up from Pounds 583m in the
previous year.
In common with the rest of the chemicals industry, profits have recovered
strongly. In 1993, operating profit post exceptionals was Pounds 60m,
compared with Pounds 44m in 1993 and a loss of Pounds 22m in 1992.
No forecasts were made yesterday of the current year's profitability,
although further restructuring charges are likely to affect the pre-tax
figure.
Mr Robin Paul, chief executive, said that a restructuring undertaken in 1991
had regrouped speciality operations, which have 'since been growing at 20
per cent a year-plus on profits'. The company now has three divisions:
surfactants, phosphorus derivatives and phosphates, and specialities.
The strategy to reduce dependence on commodity goods was 'to have 20 per
cent of the company's worldwide turnover from products introduced in the
last five years by 1998', said Mr Paul. Today the figure is 14 per cent.
Mr Paul acknowledged that there was little growth in one of its main product
areas, washing powder phosphates, which are banned in several countries on
environmental grounds. He said sales were steady thanks to new markets in
Asia and Latin America.
Mr Mead said there had been talks with several chemicals companies about a
direct sale of the Albright &amp; Wilson businesses. They failed because
potential buyers 'wanted to cream off what they regarded as the better
parts'.
He said a flotation was more uncertain but that they would get a better
price.
With the divestiture of Albright &amp; Wilson, and the majority offering of
Case, the only remaining division of Tenneco that is not included in Mr
Mead's 'core' businesses is the New Jersey-based Newport News Shipbuilding
company.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein row casts shadow on conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, intervened to avert a potentially
embarrassing row between the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, as politics overshadowed the first day of the Belfast
International Investment Conference yesterday.
With more than 300 delegates gathering for the largest business conference
since the troubles began 25 years ago, Sinn Fein confirmed that its party
councillors would be attending today's working sessions.
The decision followed a meeting in Londonderry between Mr Brown and Mr
Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's northern chairman. Mr McLaughlin
insisted that the party, which had threatened to boycott the conference, had
always said it would attend.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, launched the event by seeking to
highlight the province's investment potential, the British and US
governments signed a science and technology agreement to give Northern
Ireland companies access to US technology and production techniques.
Separately, British Telecommunications and US chemicals group DuPont were
poised to announce new investment projects for the province totalling Pounds
36m.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr Brown, Mr Major told delegates they could
be in at the beginning of 'a very exciting phase' in the province.
He said he was not asking potential investors to be 'less than hard-headed'
about their business decisions but simply to 'recognise that there is a
society bursting with the desire to succeed'. He said he hoped strong
pressure to 'make peace irreversible' would come from outside Northern
Ireland.
Mr Brown said the US would work with the people of Northern Ireland 'to
replace the architecture of violence'. He said the US was drawing up a
strategic plan for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic's border counties
which he would present to the White House Conference for Trade and
Investment in Ireland in April. However, he announced no new plans for US
government investment in the province.
He said the US would 'seek to harness the effort and expense of hatred and
security; to build with it an economy on which opportunity overshadows
enmity; and create an infrastructure that will support a new era of
reconciliation'.
Mr Brown also said the US Trade and Development Agency was to lead a
technical delegation to the province to identify projects 'that represent
more mutually beneficial opportunities'.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Chechnya action leads to rift in Russian military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY, VLADIKAVKAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rift among Russian top brass emerged yesterday as senior military
officials criticised the government's effort to subdue the breakaway Chechen
republic.
General Alexander Lebed and General Boris Gromov, who commanded Soviet
forces during the Afghan war, warned that the intervention in Chechnya might
lead to a bloody and drawn-out guerrilla war.
'Step by step, the Afghan experience is being repeated in Chechnya,' said
Gen Lebed, commander of Russian forces in Moldova. 'We risk getting involved
in a war with the entire Moslem world.' He condemned the government for
sending 'untrained kids' into the region.
The criticism, when nine Russian soldiers have already died, highlights how
the Chechen crisis is dividing Russian leaders.
A strange alliance of liberal and communist politicians in the Russian
parliament yesterday opposed the action. The Duma, lower house, passed a
resolution describing the government's actions as 'unsatisfactory'.
But it urged President Boris Yeltsin to disarm the Chechens and to 'restore
legality' in the region, which declared its independence three years ago.
Russian forces, aiming to encircle Grozny, the Chechen capital, are being
impeded by swarms of civilians. The intervention appears to have dissolved
internal political disputes in Chechnya, and other peoples of the volatile
north Caucasus are rallying to aid their neighbours.
Negotiations between Chechen and Russian representatives in the North
Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz continued last night, but made no real
progress.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister,
as saying Russia would give Rbs 1,000bn in aid to Chechnya once the conflict
ends.
It was possible yesterday to drive into Grozny in spite of Russian claims of
a blockade. The road from Nazran, capital of neighbouring Ingushetia, was
crowded with nervous Russian troops and littered with the remains of a dozen
burnt-out tanks and trucks.
Crossing into Chechnya, there were few visible defences - only a few
concrete blocks thrown across the road. Grizzled Chechen fighters carrying
Kalashnikov rifles and Molotov cocktails walked around.
At the village of Dovidenko, about 40km west of Grozny, several hundred
Chechen civilians swarmed towards a column of Russian troops and pleaded
with them to turn back.
One woman screamed, 'Do not make another Afghanistan]' Another shouted:
'This is not a battle against the Chechens it is war against the Moslems.'
A group of Chechen women was also sent to plead with the second Russian
column advancing from the republic of Dagestan. The third column of Russian
troops moved to within 5km of Grozny where reporters said they saw troops
blow up a car with a family inside fearing they were trying to destroy a
bridge.

FT  14 DEC 94 / OFT calls for new rules on electrical goods warranties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is to seek a new code of practice for the sale of
extended warranties on electrical products in a report out later this week.
The report is thought likely to attack the high-pressure sales tactics and
often misleading claims made by retailers when selling warranties, as well
as the lack of pricing information available for customers.
It will also call for measures to increase competition in the extended
warranties market.
For big electrical retailers such as Dixons and Comet, which make
significant profits from the sale of warranties - particularly before
Christmas - the timing of the report could hardly be worse.
However, the OFT has decided against an immediate referral of electrical
goods retailers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or a ban on
retailers' selling warranties at the point of sale. Both these measures
could be proposed in future by the OFT, should retailers fail to co-operate
with its other suggestions.
In spite of the recommendations, some consumer groups are likely to
criticise the OFT's failure to take tougher action. Some hoped retailers
would have had to provide details, at the point of sale, of the reliability
of their goods and of alternative warranty policies.
Extended warranties are insurance policies that provide extra protection
against product breakdown after the standard manufacturers' guarantees have
expired. They generally run for five years. Typical extended warranties cost
about Pounds 55 for five years' cover for a portable colour television to
Pounds 750 for a top-of-the-range personal computer.
City analysts have criticised electrical goods retailers for the amount of
profits warranties generate. Recent research by stockbrokers Collins Stewart
suggests that Dixons makes total gross profits of about Pounds 100m a year
from its extended warranties.
The OFT report is thought to include:
Action on transparency, with prices of warranties and servicing details to
be made readily available to customers in stores. Leaflets should be
available for shoppers to take away.
A long 'cooling off' period, during which customers can cancel their
warranty policies. For the first time, the OFT will publish free details of
reliability and repair costs for a wide range of electrical goods.
A new code of practice to oversee the sale of warranties in the UK.
However, high street retailers are likely to be pleased that several more
radical reforms have been rejected by the OFT. Those included forcing
retailers to disclose the commission they take on the sale of warranties.

FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's non-executive directors must decide at Friday's board
meeting whether to back their shareholders or their chairman. They should be
in no doubt where their duty lies. Investors accounting for a third of
Saatchi's shares want a change in group name and a scaling back of Mr
Maurice Saatchi's proposed options package. If directors do not listen to
shareholders, the group will be engulfed in a public squabble leading to a
bitter extraordinary general meeting. If Mr Saatchi makes his continuing
chairmanship dependent on no name change, other directors should call his
bluff. After all, in the nine years since he has chaired the group, its
shares have fallen by over 98 per cent against the market.

With chemicals companies' profits rising sharply, Tenneco may have chosen a
good time to float its Albright &amp; Wilson subsidiary. The company, which
could fetch Pounds 600m, has restructured its operations recently, is
arguably a low-cost producer and supplies chemicals to the likes of
Coca-Cola and Colgate toothpaste.
That said, investors' enthusiasm should be tempered. For a start, they
should ask why Tenneco has chosen to float Albright instead of selling to a
trade buyer  - an option it has sought for at least a decade. The main
reason is that the US conglomerate thinks it will receive a better price
from a float. But potential investors will wonder why they should pay more
than trade buyers are willing to put up.
Thinking about the longer term in the notoriously cyclical chemicals
industry is sobering. Albright faces questions about one of its most
important products  - washing powder phosphates which are banned in many
countries. By its own admission, it is also squeezed between much larger
suppliers and customers. None of this means that Albright will not thrive as
an independent entity; merely that the price must reflect the risks.

FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Stanhope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ironic that as city property prices start to rise, Stanhope, the part
owner of Broadgate, should be faced with the possibility of falling.
But its banks are running out of patience. Stanhope's assets match its
Pounds 148m of loans, following property revaluations, but it has no income
and carries Pounds 7m of overheads. It has had over a year to get
refinancing, but Mr Stuart Lipton, chairman and major shareholder, has
failed to capitalise on reviving confidence in property and cheap long-term
finance. Hence a last-minute scramble for survival ahead of Monday's
deadline.
The banks face a difficult choice. They can knock more than Pounds 30m off
the value of their debt, by selling to bidders British Land or PosTel, and
crystallise losses against a company with net value and an attractive asset.
Or they can opt for receivership, which would pare Stanhope's overheads and
facilitate the eventual sale of Broadgate, co-owned by Rosehaugh's
receivers. Those banks which wanted out could sell their debt. The downside
is that receivership can damage asset values, and would add to the banks'
reputation of taking receivership as the easy option.
There is an alternative. Roll over the debt, get equity funding to cover
administrative costs, and wait for Broadgate values to rise. The trouble is
that the main proponent of this is Mr Lipton, whose credibility has suffered
from an inability to turn ideas into reality. Given the harsh alternative of
receivership, it is not surprising the banks are pausing for thought.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The protagonists in the future European telecoms war are taking up
positions. Yesterday's joint venture between AT&amp;T and Unisource is the
latest move. As a sign of their seriousness, the partners have earmarked
roughly Dollars 1bn for investment over the next few years. Though the
venture's initial focus will be on supplying multinationals, it will be
positioned to serve the European long-distance market when that is opened to
competition in 1998. The same is true of BT's venture with MCI and France
Telecom's alliance with Deutsche Telekom. With margins on long-distance
calls high throughout much of Europe, a price war is only a matter of time.
BT looks set to adopt an aggressive strategy. It has relatively little to
lose from rivals invading its turf, since it already faces competition, and
much to win from poaching business from continental groups. By contrast, the
continental operators may play it defensively, seeking to protect their
patches. But such strategies are unlikely to pay off in the long run.

FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Italian showdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's financial markets are seriously shaken, and no wonder. Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's coalition government looks increasingly fragile. The sharp fall
in the lira and in Italian bonds and equities over the past week all point
to an intensification of political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.
It is a shame that politics should have brought the markets to this pretty
pass. Debts apart, the economy is in an unusually robust state. Italy is one
of the few European countries to have a primary, or pre-financing, budget
surplus. Helped by the weak currency, growth is strong. Inflation, though
climbing again, is low by historical standards. And yet Italian bonds stand
at a near 5 per cent premium to German bunds, with a tremendous real yield
of 8.4 per cent. The elephantine budget deficit is the bugbear: it will fall
next year if the watered-down budget passes before Christmas, but only to
L139 trillion or 8 per cent of gross domestic product.
On fundamentals, Italian markets look attractive  - real bond yields are
high and corporate earnings growth is set to be robust. But investors yearn
for political stability. This would allow for a determined attempt to reduce
debts, the interest on which is gobbling up over 10 per cent of gross
domestic product  - and growing as interest rates rise. It is a vicious
circle from which only a new government, led perhaps by Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi or Mr Antonio di Petro, has a chance of escaping. Investors'
enthusiasm for such a change would lead to lower rates which would, in turn,
reduce the cost of financing the deficit. But any rally before then is
likely to be seized on as a selling opportunity.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Chechen warning exposes rift in Russian military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY, VLADIKAVKAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rift among Russian top brass emerged yesterday as senior military
officials criticised the government's effort to subdue the breakaway Chechen
republic.
General Alexander Lebed and General Boris Gromov, who commanded Soviet
forces during the Afghan war, warned that the intervention in Chechnya could
lead to a bloody and drawn-out guerrilla war.
'Step by step, the Afghan experience is being repeated in Chechnya,' said
Gen Lebed, commander of Russian forces in Moldova. 'We risk getting involved
in a war with the entire Moslem world. Individual guerrillas will
indefinitely shoot at our tanks and kill our soldiers with single bullets.'
Gen Lebed condemned the government for sending 'untrained kids' into the
region and said their poor preparation was to blame for the immediate
surrender of 47 Russian troops to Chechen forces during the weekend.
The criticism, as nine Russian soldiers have already died, highlights how
deeply the Chechen crisis is dividing the Russian leadership.
A strange alliance of Russian liberal and communist politicians sharply
opposed the intervention in the Russian parliament yesterday. The Duma, or
lower house, passed an ambivalent resolution describing the government's
actions as 'unsatisfactory'.
But it urged President Boris Yeltsin to disarm the Chechens and to 'restore
legality' in the region which declared its independence from Russia three
years ago.
Only Mr Vladimir Zhirinovksy, the ultra-nationalist leader, gave his
unequivocal backing to the use of force.
Russian forces, aiming to encircle Grozny, the Chechen capital, are being
impeded by swarms of civilians. The slow-moving Russian intervention appears
to have dissolved internal political disputes in Chechnya, and other peoples
of the volatile North Caucasus are rallying to the defence of their
neighbours.
Negotiations between Chechen and Russian representatives in the North
Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz continued last night, but made no substantive
progress.
It was yesterday possible to drive into Grozny in spite of Russian claims to
have effectively blockaded the city. The road from neighbouring Ingushetia
was crowded with nervous Russian troops and littered with the burnt-out
remains of a dozen tanks and trucks.
Crossing into Chechnya, there were few visible defences  - only a few
concrete blocks thrown across the road. Grizzled Chechen fighters carrying
Kalashnikov rifles and Molotov cocktails walked around.
On the ground, Russian forces were slowed by encounters with the local
people and their supporters.
Mr Umar Gudaborshev, 31, a native Ingush, drove from his home in Kazakhstan
in central Asia to help. 'I am here to protect Chechnya. It is my homeland,'
he said.

Bit of a puzzle. The one area of Britain's defence budget which seems to
have escaped unscathed from the recent defence cuts is the provision of
ceremonial swords. According to a written parliamentary answer from Nicholas
Soames, the armed forces minister, Pounds 365,700 has been spent on buying
560 new swords over the past five years, which works out at roughly two new
swords a week.
A further Pounds 156,700 has been spent on refurbishing another 576 weapons.
The MoD estimates that there are now 2,500 swords in official use, plus many
more owned privately. The rapid rise in the sword count contrasts with an
equally rapid rundown in the number of field marshals, admirals and generals
in recent years. So much for that corny idea about turning swords into
ploughshares.

Trivial pursuit. What has Procter &amp; Gamble, the US soap sud giant, in common
with Albright &amp; Wilson, the UK chemicals firm, soon to be refloated on the
UK stock market?
Answer: Both companies were started by brothers-in-law. William Procter and
James Gamble got together in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1837 at the prompting of
their father-in-law. Arthur Albright got his big break in 1851, five years
after he married the local squire's daughter. He was on the lookout for a
chief engineer for his West Midlands phosphorus business and a husband for
his sister-in-law. John Edward Wilson came up trumps on both counts.

Trio Holdings, David Hagan's money-broking outfit, is hardly a household
name so only an alert merchant banker would have spotted the new competition
on the block. A bunch of Canadian Inuits is helping underwrite Trio's Pounds
6.5m rights issue.
Don't laugh - Hagan could be on to something. Inuvialuit Investments (II),
which is co-underwriting the issue, helps invest the loot of Canada's Inuit
people. The Inuit have come into tons of money in recent years thanks to
payments from the federal government to settle long-standing land claims.
The Inuit in the eastern half of the Northwest Territories, for example, won
a land-claims settlement last year that will net them almost CDollars 1.2bn
over 14 years. Royalties from mines and oil and gas wells in the Northwest
Territories are likely to swell their coffers still further.
Trio's newfound underwriter is based high above the Arctic Circle and is the
international investment arm of Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC). II
almost doubled its money earlier this year when it sold a 10 per cent stake
in Hong Kong's Regent Pacific Group, which just happens to be Trio's biggest
investor and is the main underwriter of the Trio issue. Don't fancy Hagan's
chances if he lets those eskimos down.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Running rings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would seem, as Observer reported last week, that the British Olympic
Association's attempt to gain statutory protection for its use of the
Olympic rings follows on from the 'success' of its counterpart in the US.
Despite a law being passed in 1978 which gave the US Olympic Committee
exclusive rights to the logo, it has been something of a marathon task to
police it. One of the latest targets ordered to cease-and-desist was one
Spiros Nakos, long-time owner of the Olympic diner in Manhattan. Locals drew
up a petition in his support and two regular customers who just happen to be
attorneys offered their services free. Now, after two weeks of intense
negotiation, Nakos has taken down his interlocking rings but has kept the
name.
In the bruised corner, the USOC emphasises it has not given Nakos
'permission' to use the O-word and reserves the right to take action at a
later date. It maintains that Nakos's 10-table establishment infringes the
sponsor rights of McDonald's, which paid more than Dollars 40m to provide
the official trough.

Another convert to the musings of Nostradamus? Yesterday the British
Chambers of Commerce set some kind of precedent by reacting to today's
inflation figures 24 hours ahead of time.
A fax to the FT at 11.30 am on Tuesday cited Richard Brown, the deputy
director-general, as welcoming the news of 'the unchanged underlying
inflation rate'.
Had there been a leak? Alas, an hour later, the BCC confessed that the early
fax was due to 'temporary Christmas insanity'. It seems that, in its
confusion, the Chamber had thought the inflation figures would be published
yesterday. On ringing the Central Statistical Office's statsline, it gleaned
the news about underlying inflation, but did not realise that the CSO was
referring to October rather than November.
Still, if underlying inflation is unchanged when today's figures are
announced, expect Brown to be headhunted by Old Moore's Almanack.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Personal View: Political mileage from motorway tolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY RICHARDSON and GEOFFREY DUDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few experienced political observers could have been surprised by the recent
highly critical report produced by the Commons' transport select committee
on government plans to introduce tolls for UK motorway users.
For the average MP, any suggestion that millions of car-owning voters should
be compelled to pay for using roads that were hitherto 'free', has long been
regarded as electoral dynamite. Both Tory and Labour MPs, therefore, have
joined forces to chorus disapproval for a scheme which they fear could
eclipse rail privatisation as the ultimate 'poll tax on wheels'. Even the
government itself has decided that any decision to introduce tolls should be
delayed until 1998, well after the next general election.
Meanwhile, in the real world, congestion continues to grow on motorways
which are breaking up under the pressure of traffic; vehicles emit gases
that pose an increasing threat to public health; and public transport usage
declines for lack of sufficient investment.
Somewhere between the solid wall of opposition to motorway tolls and the
threadbare state of Britain's transport systems lies a political void that
needs urgently to be filled. Much of the debate on road tolling has centred
on the economic costs and benefits, but it is the political problems of
motorway tolling that should be given highest priority. If these can be
overcome, the system offers great potential benefits.
First, there is the question of the numbers affected by motorway tolls. In
favour of tolls is the fact that, as the government's 1993 green paper on
tolling pointed out, about half of drivers rarely or never use the
motorways. This can be contrasted with the 100 per cent who would be
compelled to pay any increases in fuel duty, one of the suggested
revenue-raising alternatives.
Second, one of the chief concerns of the select committee is the fear that
motorway tolls would result in a large amount of traffic being diverted on
to other roads. The government could, however, 'sugar the pill' for those
who regularly use the motorways.
For example, the smart cards that would be used to operate the system of
electronic charging could give the motorist access to information on traffic
conditions and weather reports.
In any case, the evidence from European countries such as France, where
motorway tolls are common, suggests that the degree of diversion on to
untolled roads becomes negligible after a short transitional period.
Third, and of crucial political importance, would be to decide how the toll
revenues actually should be spent. At the moment, the proposal is that any
proceeds should be used to expand the motorway and trunk road network.
Politically, this is a narrow and short-sighted perspective.
As the government's latest trunk roads review conceded, it now takes more
than 13 years to complete a typical national road scheme. Consequently, it
could be many years before those who pay the tolls actually see any results
for their money.
The toll system would also be locked into the increasingly controversial
road-building programme that frequently arouses heated opposition from those
affected by the proposed roads and members of environmental groups. It would
be better for toll revenues to be earmarked for specific developments on
existing motorways, such as maintenance, improvements in information,
lighting and safety. In this way, motorists could see a quick return for
their money, but without attracting political controversy.
A far more valuable political aim for the government, however, would be to
seek to use toll revenues to bridge the yawning gap that currently separates
the road and environmental lobbies. Although it might mean creating yet
another quango, the two sides could be brought together in a body that would
allocate money to a range of deserving projects. These could include
research on vehicle emissions and safety, grants for the building of urban
light rail systems, the development of bus lanes and pedestrianisation
schemes, and traffic calming in suburban areas. In this way, a direct link
could be made between tolls and benefits to the community as a whole.
For an imaginative government, therefore, motorway tolls need not be
regarded as an automatic electoral liability. In any case, Britain's growing
transport problems are likely to keep the subject on the political agenda,
regardless of the party in power.

FT  14 DEC 94 / The strong whiff of trouble: The US tobacco industry is
facing a wave of potentially ruinous lawsuits, says Richard Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should cigarette manufacturers be made to pay for the harm smoking does to
people? Many believe justice would be better served if they were  - perhaps
nowhere more than in the US, where the anti-tobacco lobby is strong and
litigation is a national industry.
Even so, US courts have proved stubbornly unsympathetic to the idea. Over
the past 40 years, some 700 lawsuits have been lodged against US tobacco
companies by people claiming damage to their health from smoking. None has
ultimately succeeded, and no cigarette maker has paid a cent in damages.
Now, however, the tobacco industry is facing a new wave of litigation. On
Monday, a court in Miami ruled that non-smoking flight attendants could sue
US cigarette makers for health problems caused by passive smoking. Worse, in
two much bigger cases to be heard in the US over the next few days, lawyers
will be trying out new types of claims against cigarette manufacturers
which, if successful, could prove financially ruinous.
The main reason earlier attempts to sue the tobacco industry have failed is
straightforward. In nearly every case, juries have concluded that the health
hazards associated with smoking are so well known that anyone taking up the
habit automatically accepts the risks.
One notable exception came in 1988 when a jury awarded damages of Dollars
400,000 to the family of Rose Cipollone, a smoker who died after getting
lung cancer. However, the award was overturned in a federal appeal court in
1990, and the family, faced with the formidable legal costs of a case that
had lasted seven years, gave up the struggle.
That case illustrated another big difficulty of taking on the US tobacco
industry: cigarette makers, with their vast financial resources, can easily
outgun lone plaintiffs represented by small law firms. Anti-smoking
activists accuse the tobacco industry of waging a war of attrition on its
opponents, citing an internal memorandum written by a lawyer working for RJ
Reynolds Tobacco in 1988. 'To paraphrase General Patton, the way we won
these cases was not by spending all of Reynolds' money, but by making that
other son-of-a-bitch spend all his,' the note said.
Yet both difficulties  - the assumption of risk and the costs of legal
action  - could be overcome in a case due to be heard in a federal court in
New Orleans today.
The Castano case  - named after Dianne Castano, one of the five plaintiffs
 -does not seek compensation for health damage caused by smoking. Instead,
it seeks compensation for addiction to nicotine. The plaintiffs want each US
cigarette company to refund all the money they have spent on cigarettes,
meet the cost of health monitoring for addiction-related problems,
compensate them for emotional distress and pay punitive damages.
The plaintiffs are also backed by big money. Some 60 law firms have formed a
consortium to pursue the case in an attempt to turn it into a class action
that will pursue similar claims for millions of present, former and deceased
US smokers reaching back 50 years. Each firm has undertaken to invest up to
Dollars 100,000 a year in the case, providing total backing of Dollars 6m a
year  - easily enough to fight the cigarette manufacturers.
Paradoxically, this fresh approach comes at a time when the political
pressure on cigarette companies has died down. The Republicans' crushing
victory in last month's mid-term elections has produced a Congress much less
inclined to attack the tobacco industry with tighter regulations and
increased taxes.
Further, the cigarette manufacturers' arch-foe  - Representative Henry
Waxman, the Californian Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee on health
and the environment  - is to lose his position in January. This will end a
series of hearings in which chief executives of US tobacco companies have
repeatedly been hauled before the subcommittee to answer hard-hitting
questions about their industry's activities.
The change in the political climate, however, has not erased the memories of
events earlier in the year when internal tobacco industry documents were
leaked to the media and Mr Waxman's committee. Together, these documents
built up a picture of an industry that not only knew of the addictive and
carcinogenic properties of cigarettes, but had concealed the evidence for
decades.
The anti-smoking lobby believes these disclosures have transformed the
outlook for litigation. 'The notion that tobacco companies were innocent
purveyors of an agricultural product has been changed to a more accurate
notion that they are very knowledgeable and sophisticated manufacturers of
an addictive drug,' says Mr Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Project at Boston's Northeastern University.
The disclosures have not only prompted the Castano case, but encouraged a
second type of litigation now being brought against cigarette manufacturers.
Two US states  - Florida and Mississippi  - are suing the tobacco industry
for the costs of treating smoking-related diseases under public assistance
programmes (notably Medicaid). The Mississippi case reaches a crucial stage
next Monday when a state judge hears arguments about what defences the
tobacco industry should be allowed to deploy.
The state cases are clever because they seek to avoid complex arguments
about whether individuals knew the risks when they started smoking or which
brands harmed their health. Their sentiment is: Smoking has cost us (in
Florida's case) Dollars 1.2bn in Medicaid payments over the last five years.
We want our money back. Liability for damages would be split between the
cigarette manufacturers according to their market share.
The tobacco industry says the states have some nerve: after all, they
collect far more in cigarette taxes than they pay out for the treatment of
smoking-related diseases. But its main argument is that it would be unfair
for states to roll up all their smoking-related medical costs into one
undifferentiated sum. Before paying up, the cigarette companies say, they
would have to study each person's case individually to determine whether
smoking was really the cause of his or her illness and to see whether their
medical costs could be fully justified. In all likelihood, they say, they
would dispute the facts of every patient's case in court, so overwhelming
the US judicial system.
But what of today's case in New Orleans? The Castano case is a little more
complex than those in Florida and Mississippi because it raises the question
of nicotine addiction.
Tobacco lawyers say cigarette smoking cannot be addictive because large
numbers of people have given it up. By that definition, say anti-smokers,
neither is heroin.
The tobacco industry argues that, if smoking is addictive, then so are (for
example) tea and television, yet no one until now had suggested that
addiction in itself was a personal injury. Anti-smokers observe that
addiction to tea and television rarely results in damage to people's health.
The immediate issue in the Castano case, however, is whether the case can be
turned into a class action. As in the state lawsuits, the tobacco industry
says it is vigorously opposed to lumping individuals together as every
smoker's case differs. The industry's lawyers threaten that, if a class
action were allowed to proceed, they would insist on a court hearing for
every smoker who sought to join the class and dispute his or her entitlement
to membership. The result  - as in the state cases  - would be to overwhelm
the US judicial system.
For the tobacco industry, the stakes are high. If it were defeated in this
new wave of litigation and had to meet all the claims that followed, the
bill would make the Dollars 10bn so far paid out to victims of
asbestos-related diseases look like petty cash.
Would the courts dare do it? Tobacco companies say it would make no sense
for society to condone the manufacture and sale of cigarettes but penalise
the tobacco industry when people smoked them. A decision against the tobacco
industry would also set a disturbing precedent for manufacturers of other
products carrying health risks, such as high-fat foods and alcoholic drinks.
But times change, and the fact that cigarette makers have triumphed in the
courts for the last 40 years does not make the outcome of the latest
litigation any more predictable.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Choosing a WTO leader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than three weeks before the World Trade Organisation is due to come
into being, deadlock appears to have developed over the choice of its
leader. Governments' failure to agree on such a central question is doubly
disturbing. Not only does it threaten to handicap the WTO's start in life;
it augurs badly for decision-making in the longer term.
The WTO has been set ambitious objectives. Realising them calls for skilful,
clear-sighted, intellectually imaginative and determined leadership. Without
firm direction from the outset, the organisation risks degenerating into an
ineffective talking shop.
Deadlock also raises questions about plans for the WTO to operate by
consensus. That principle worked well in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, because the smaller members usually went along with the wishes of
the US and Europe, in order to ensure the larger players' continued
participation.
But the compact is likely to become steadily less effective, as the economic
preponderance of the older industrialised countries declines in favour of
emerging economies, notably in Asia. The planned expansion of the WTO's
membership  - above all the admission of China  - will test cohesion still
further.
This shifting balance makes it vital for the WTO head not only to be able to
mediate between diverse and sometimes conflicting national and regional
interests, but to articulate a clear intellectual vision around which
members can cohere. It is healthy that the contest has attracted three
candidates from countries at varying stages of economic development and
located on different continents. It is regrettable, however, that their
support remains sharply divided along regional lines.
Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas has strong backing in North and
South America, but almost nowhere else. Support for Mr Kim Chul-su, South
Korea's trade minister, is heavily concentrated in Asia. On the face of it,
Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister and the EU's official
candidate, counts a wider following, which includes much of Africa, the
Middle East and the Caribbean.
However, this show of support is deceptive. It is drawn overwhelmingly from
countries which already belong to the EU, plan to do so, or depend on its
aid and trade largesse. If Mr Ruggiero's claims to lead the field are to be
convincing, he needs to demonstrate that his support is based on objective
assessments of his ability, not on self-interested allegiances centred on
Brussels.
The WTO contest should not be a crude trial of strength between economic
blocs. That would be divisive and could undermine the post's authority. It
is, in any case, absurd to suppose that any vital interest would be served
by installing a candidate of a particular nationality.
What is needed instead is to unite around a highly qualified candidate. If
governments cannot agree soon on any of those now in the race, they may need
to consider a fresh approach, rather than settle on an unsatisfactory
interim arrangement. One answer would be to entrust the choice to a
selection committee composed of a representative sample of Gatt members.
That might prove the best way to settle on an appointee possessing the
qualities, and enjoying the confidence, needed to do the job well.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: TUC's right step
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last 15 years have largely stripped the UK trade union movement of the
negative, obstructionist image of the past. It is no longer fashionable to
blame unions for the UK's labour market failures. But shedding a negative
role is not the same as acquiring a positive one.
Finding such a role need not take another 15 years, but it will take a
willingness to transcend old-style collectivism. Collective workers' rights
were viable as long as employees were more or less homogeneous, and union
membership was high. Neither condition holds today. The new framework of UK
employee rights currently under discussion at the Trades Union Congress
would not entirely equip the movement for the new era. But it is an
important step in the right direction.
The proposals for a new system of UK employee rights, published in
yesterday's FT, will not be formally agreed until next week, and may undergo
significant revision. But the draft blueprint is encouraging. It shows that
Mr John Monks, the new general secretary of the TUC, has recognised that the
current complexities of UK labour law provide a golden opportunity for a
post-collectivist union movement to prove its worth.
The UK labour law system is an increasingly unworkable product of two
distinct approaches to worker rights. The first is traditional contract law,
under which trade union rights are expressed as collective immunities. The
second rests on the positive individual rights embedded in some domestic
and, increasingly, European Union legislation.
UK union leaders have often been unable to capitalise on moves towards
legislating enhanced worker rights in the EU, because they remained wedded
to the collectivist tradition. The drafters of the blueprint have made a
creditable attempt to marry the UK tradition to the universal rights more
common in European legislation. Doubtless, there will be many compromises
with the different parts of the movement before a new framework, if any,
gains majority approval at next year's TUC Congress. But Mr Monks has
already managed to win converts to the new guiding ethos.
The idea visible in these new proposals is that a post-collectivist union
movement must address the concerns of all workers, not just of union
members. Moreover, it must address them in a way that balances individual
demands for security and protection from unfair treatment against the
economy's need for labour flexibility and wage restraint. Few of the world's
union movements have met the challenge successfully. But many have at least
recognised its existence. The signs are that the TUC is at last beginning to
join them.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: The end is nigh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Rome government announced 2 1/2 months ago steps to reform Italy's
health and pensions systems in the 1995 budget there appeared a glimmer of
hope that the country's fortunes might be on the mend. Not least because
trade union opposition has demolished Mr Silvio Berlusconi's plans for
pensions reform, that hope has now been shown to be an illusion.
Rather than stemming the sources of Italian instability during his seven
months as prime minister, Mr Berlusconi has proved depressingly adept at
exposing new ones. Mr Berlusconi has undermined his own position by refusing
to put necessary distance between his office and his business interests,
while organised interests have been unwilling to accept the cuts in state
hand-outs needed to rescue Italy from a spiral of mounting debt.
Mr Berlusconi has been further weakened by the judicial investigations
opened last month into his suspected involvement in alleged corruption by
his Fininvest business empire, a matter on which he was interviewed by Milan
magistrates yesterday. Yet in political terms, whether or not Mr Berlusconi
is actually guilty of corruption is now irrelevant, for he has lost the
ability to govern. In coming months Italy faces a fresh transition in which,
almost certainly, a new, more broadly-based government will try to prevent
political and financial disarray from becoming a full-scale crisis.
After a difficult summer, Mr Berlusconi has suffered a still sourer autumn.
Strains in his coalition have become increasingly evident, while Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement won only 8.6 per cent of the vote in this
month's municipal elections.
The most serious single blow, however, was the about-turn on pensions,
forced by the unions' threat to step up labour stoppages. This has spared
Italy serious social unrest, but it means that the 1995 budget, when given
parliamentary approval probably in the next fortnight, will be bereft of a
crucial measure designed to buttress fiscal credibility. This week's fresh
lira fall has underlined the financial markets' nervousness about budgetary
policy.
Italy's short-term political priority is to pass the 1995 budget, imperfect
though it is. After that, the search for a new administration will start in
earnest. A new government is most likely to unite a wide spectrum of parties
in parliament. It will have no choice but to return to the task of cutting
the deficit, and to ensure that the ensuing pain is spread as evenly as
possible. Only when a measure of fiscal consolidation is in sight can new
elections be countenanced. Unless Italy collectively finds the will to make
the right decisions, renewed failure to act will exact, in financial and
political terms, an ever higher price.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Article of faith challenged: The dispute over flaws in
Intel's Pentium chip has alarmed the computer industry, says Louise Kehoe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chastened executives of Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip
manufacturer, are struggling to restore public and investor confidence in
the company's microprocessor chips - the 'brains' of more than 80 per cent
of all personal computers - in the wake of damaging disclosures of a flaw in
its Pentium chip over the past month.
The flaw in the chip, Intel's highest performance microprocessor, can lead
to miscalculations in some mathematical applications, a fault that Intel
argued would affect few users as it would occur so infrequently.
The heaviest blow to Intel's reputation came on Monday when IBM announced
that it would halt shipments of Pentium-based PCs, pending the delivery of
production volumes of a new version of the Intel chip in which the error has
been corrected, some time in the first quarter of 1995.
IBM's action, which Intel claims is 'unwarranted', has brought renewed
public attention to the Pentium problem and cast doubt on Intel's insistence
that the flaw is minor and will not affect the vast majority of PC users.
As the leading supplier of microprocessors, Intel has much at stake. IBM, in
contrast, has little to lose. Pentium PCs account for only about 5 per cent
of its PC sales. What is more, IBM is planning to launch PCs based on its
own rival PowerPC microprocessors.
The controversy has, however, created a crisis of confidence for the
computer industry that could have lasting effects. The ubiquitous
microprocessor chip is not only the 'engine' in most of today's computers.
It also controls a myriad of equipment ranging from car engines and aircraft
controls to medical equipment and weapon systems. Its accuracy - until now
an article of faith - is essential in these applications upon which life may
often depend.
The Pentium problem first emerged last month when Thomas Nicely, a
mathematics professor at Lynchburg College in Virginia, discovered that his
three Pentium computers were producing erroneous results in calculations
designed to identify prime numbers (a prime number is a whole number that
can be divided only by 1 and itself, such as 2, 3, 5 or 7).
Prof Nicely shared his finding on the Internet, a global network of
computers, prompting near-hysteria among computer scientists. The story was
quickly picked up by the media, creating a public relations crisis for
Intel.
The chipmaker's response has been an offer to replace Pentium chips if users
want a replacement. Operators on Intel's 'hot lines' stress, however, that
most PC users should not concern themselves with the issue. The majority of
callers have been satisfied with Intel's explanation that the risk of error
is low. To date, Intel says that it has agreed to replace only 'a few
thousand' Pentium chips; a small fraction of the more than 5m Pentiums
shipped to date.
Most PC manufacturers have taken a similar approach, offering to replace
chips for customers who insist, but encouraging them to ignore the furore
surrounding the Pentium chip.
The approach seemed to be working. Retail sales of Pentium PCs continued to
boom in the US and Europe as recently as last weekend, according to Intel.
While Internet devotees were still criticising Intel, it seemed that the
buying public was losing interest in the arcane debate.
IBM's announcement on Monday that it was halting sales of its Pentium PCs
was therefore a blow for Intel. 'We've conducted our own tests and concluded
that the risk of error is significantly higher than previously thought and
warrants today's actions,' says Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice-president in
charge of the company's PC business.
Intel maintains that the likelihood of a PC user encountering an error is
only once in 27,000 years and that standard off-the-shelf software
applications are not affected. IBM, however, says that its tests indicated
that users of common spreadsheet programs could encounter errors as
frequently as once in every 24 days.
In a statement that seemed certain to strike fear into the hearts of
corporate computer users, IBM said: 'For a customer with 500 Pentium-based
PCs, this could result in as many as 20 mistakes a day.'
IBM has no argument with the technical aspects of Intel's analysis, but
questions the assumption made by Intel's computer scientists that the
numbers used in calculations made by millions of PC users are random and
that the number of calculations made per day is approximately 1,000.
By inserting non-random numbers into their tests and substantially
increasing the number of calculations per day, IBM came up with its very
different, and damaging, results.
Intel strongly disputes IBM's calculations and hints that the computer
company is deliberately trying to undermine its credibility to further its
own interests. IBM's tests are 'contrived', Intel executives say. 'If IBM
were right, millions of PC users would have already encountered errors,'
says Mike Barton, an Intel computational scientist.
IBM insists, however, that it has acted purely in the interests of its
customers. Some of IBM's largest corporate customers have expressed concerns
about the accuracy of Pentium PCs, an IBM official says. 'We have to stand
by our products.'
IBM says that it shared preliminary results of its tests with Intel last
week. However, Andy Grove, Intel president and chief executive, says that
Intel first learnt of IBM's decision to halt shipments via news wire
services on Monday morning, and that IBM has refused to supply Intel with
details of its tests.
So far, no other PC manufacturer has followed IBM's lead and Intel hopes
that it can contain the problem by continuing to offer to replace Pentium
chips if customers are concerned and by placing a lifetime warranty on them.
'We are quite clearly anxious to have this event behind us, but given that
this has become a major event in the mass media, involving people who are
not accustomed to dealing with sophisticated mathematical terms like random
divides, operands and floating points, quite frankly we do not know what to
do,' says Mr Grove with a note of desperation.
Ironically, the 'Pentium flaw' is far less serious than errors that were
found in early versions of Intel's past generations of microprocessors.
These problems went largely unnoticed by the media and the general public.
Yet Intel's success in establishing its brand name as one of the most
recognised in the world through multimillion- dollar advertising campaigns
has changed the situation.
'Microprocessors have quite clearly become a part of every person's life, a
very high profile consumer item and that has raised the level of expectation
forever,' says Mr Grove. 'This incident and the exposure it has received
globally will have a lasting impact on the design, verification and
manufacturing of microprocessors - everybody's microprocessors.
'The Pentium is the most tested - and I believe the best - microprocessor
that has ever been manufactured in the world,' Mr Grove claims. 'But there
is no such thing as a perfect microprocessor.' It is almost impossible to
ensure that there is no tiny flaw in chips of this level of complexity,
which contain more than 3m transistors on a tiny square of silicon, Intel
executives explain.
'This is probably a very important moment in Intel history as we continue to
evolve into a consumer technology company,' says Mr Grove. The company is
learning some painful lessons about how to deal with the concerns of the
buying public, he acknowledges.
Intel is not alone, however, in facing this crisis of confidence. The
reputation of the computer industry is at stake. Privately, leading software
and computer systems manufacturers fear that they could become the next
target of public disdain, if their products fail to live up to high
expectations for accuracy and reliability.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rules for a Euro referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I agree that a referendum on Europe is necessary ('Referendum
required', December 12) there remain some tricky details to be resolved.
First of all, who is to set the questions? This is not a task that should be
left solely in the hands of politicians, particularly those from the present
divided administration.
If the referendum is to be more than a simple Yes/No to a single, or common,
currency then more than one question will be necessary if we are to have an
informed consent to a new constitutional settlement in Europe. I suggest
that an independent commission be established and charged with the task of
devising suitable questions. The commission should have a majority of
non-politicians. It could also draw on available expertise from the market
research profession and the social sciences.
The second issue is: will the result of the referendum be binding or simply
advisory? To make it binding would restrict parliament's sovereignty to a
marked degree. To make it advisory is probably preferable, given that a
substantial referendum majority could hardly be ignored by elected MPs.
Finally, if we are to have a new set of (written) rules for governing Europe
after the intergovernmental conference in 1998, is it not time we also had a
set of (written) rules for governing Britain in the late 20th and the 21st
century? Such rules could, among other things, spell out the conditions
under which referendums should be held.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Hard choices ahead: European states need to be prepared to
pay for military independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France and the US this week papered over their recent quarrels over the war
in Bosnia, and dec-lared their united support for the UN peacekeeping
operation. Yet everyone can see that this operation is nearing its end,
because it cannot fulfil its peacekeeping function. Sooner or later the
peacekeepers will be withdrawn, and the only question is whether they will
have to fight their way out, or run, leaving their equipment ignominiously
behind.
When that withdrawal happens, the international community will need to take
a cool review of the post-cold war euphoria which helped to expand the UN's
peacekeeping operations beyond what could reasonably be accomplished.
Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda testify to the inadequacy of the means available
to inter-vene against war and bloodshed.
The Europeans will also have to draw their own lessons, not because they
have found themselves in the frontline of the peacekeeping operation, nor
even because the Bosnian war is taking place in Europe, but because of the
ramifications of the tragedy in the wider world.
After diplomatic mediation failed to stop the war, Europe decided, rightly
or wrongly, to go for humanitarian peacekeeping under UN authority.
Self-righteous commentators and those with 20:20 hindsight think they should
have acted differently. But these facile criticisms are irrelevant, compared
with three serious facts.
The first is the European countries' military weakness. They have had
difficulty mustering their small forces in Bosnia; they could not operate
conveniently there without a Nato headquarters and other alliance assets;
and they may not be able to get out without US military and logistical help.
The second fact is that the Europeans have conducted their policy towards
the war in Bosnia in the teeth of open and repeated opposition from the US.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, many in the west asked whether Nato had a
future, and if so, what future? Nato policymakers tried to answer the
question by drafting long documents that purported to describe a new Nato
'strategy'. But this was just a bureaucratic device to conceal the real
political question, which is much more uncomfortable: does the alliance have
a future, and if so, what future? Nato is a valuable set of institutions,
but what counts is agreement on political objectives.
We do not yet have an answer to the political question. The US
administration has tried to mend fences with the Europeans, on the grounds
that the Atlantic alliance is more important than the war in Bosnia; but
that was not the hierarchy of values which seemed to operate in practice
when Washington decided to stop enforcing the UN embargo, against the wishes
of the European peacekeepers.
The third fact is that we have come to the end of the honeymoon between
Russia and the west. In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, Moscow's
top priority in foreign policy was co-operation, but that period is over.
The Russians have angrily denounced US plans to expand Nato into eastern
Europe. And while the US has been siding more openly with the Bosnian
Moslems, the Russians have been siding more openly with the Serbs. Last week
they reduced the pan-European security summit in Budapest to futility by
blocking any resolution on the Bosnian war.
Conversely, the violent rightward shift in the US's recent mid-term
elections points to the likelihood that US foreign policy will become more
unilateral, more hostile to Russia, and probably more impatient of the
European allies.
The implication of these three facts, is that the European countries will
have to confront the hard choices between weakness and independence. As one
Foreign Office official said: 'Europe cannot be independent of the
Americans, because it cannot provide heavy air-lift or satellite
intelligence.' The proposition is evidently absurd; what he meant was that
European countries have so far been unwilling to pay for these things, or
unite in such a way that paying for them became more cost-effective.
They can, of course, continue to refuse to pay for them. The European Union
has long been characterised as a 'civilian power', and the member states may
prefer to keep it that way. Ostensibly, the Maastricht treaty commits them
to develop a common foreign and security policy; but the procedures ensure
that co-operation in this area is optional.
The reason for this is that Maastricht was drafted in the first flush of
post-cold war euphoria. The west had won, the cold war was over, and the
Russians were friends. The old nation states in western Europe, such as
Britain and France, thought they could cling to the trappings of national
independence in foreign policy and defence, because there was no threat to
security and no need to sacrifice any of the old vanities.
The denouement of this phase of the Bosnian war should give pause to such
complacency. Russia is unlikely to pose a military threat to western Europe
in the near future; but it could easily become a disturber of the peace. The
US and Europe share the most important values and interests; but there are
now fewer compelling reasons to assume they will share the same policies.
It will still be cheaper and easier to pretend that nothing has changed. All
European governments will do their best to keep Nato in business and
American forces in Europe; British traditionalists will continue to bray
about the 'special relationship'. But the past cannot be brought back:
Europe will have to choose.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: BAA charges not excessive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DES WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Rupert Darwell's article about BAA (Personal View, December 12) is
based on a totally false premise.
He complains that landing charges to our airline customers are excessive . .
. 'generally higher in the UK than in the US'. This is completely untrue. As
an independently-published review of the 40 leading international airports
reveals, BAA's landing charges are lower than those of nearly every leading
US airport. Charges at New York's JFK are double those of London's Heathrow.
BAA's main European rivals  - Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam  - also charge
significantly more. (Incidentally, BAA's charge of Pounds 4 a passenger for
all its facilities and security checks is less than half the chancellor's
recently introduced passenger tax.)
These charges, lower than those made by so-called non-profit-making
airports, are, of course, only possible because of our retail success and
the extra efficiency and productivity that privatisation has encouraged.
Yet, despite the lower charges, BAA's airports are judged by passengers to
offer superior facilities and services. Our own monitoring of the opinions
of half a million passengers a year demonstrates steadily growing customer
approval since privatisation. And in a recent survey of customer opinions of
18 leading European airport terminals, BAA's south-east airport terminals
took four of the top six places.
Finally, in addition to a satisfactory return to shareholders, highly
competitive landing charges, and much-appreciated customer service, the
company, by spending Pounds 1m every day, is providing Britain with an
essential part of its infrastructure  - high quality, international airports
 - at no cost to the taxpayer.
We are in no doubt that, come the next review, the regulator will recognise
that. But then, unlike Mr Darwell, the regulator will have his facts
straight.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: MMC must look into this fowl practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH RAVEN and PROFESSOR TIM LANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Commons trade and industry committee would do well to add food
retailers to its list of sectors to be examined with regard to UK
competition policy ('MMC's impact to be assessed' December 12). It would be
difficult to find a clearer example of the failure of our competition
authorities than the current price war between the supermarkets.
Having fought themselves to a standstill (with many casualties) on milk and
bread, the supermarkets' latest battleground is turkeys. Gateway has boasted
prices for the frozen variety of 35 pence a pound. Safeway went one better
with the self-basting version at 34p. Kwik Save has trumped these with its
28p a pound fowl. Such prices make turkey cheaper than dog-meat  - and are
less than half what the retailers pay the producers.
The competition authorities have the responsibility for adjudicating on
whether this war is a legitimate ploy to pull in the punters, or whether it
is a cynical example of predatory pricing. In the confusion following the
announcement of Sir Bryan Carsberg's resignation as its director-general,
the Office of Fair Trading has said nothing. Meanwhile, the traditional high
street butcher and specialist producer are being bankrupted because they
lack the financial muscle to cross-subsidise important lines from profits
made on others.
So confident of official inertia have the retail giants become that Tesco
now advertises on television that it takes a loss on each sale of many
lines. At the very least this should merit an MMC investigation. Again, so
far the response has been silence. The trade and industry committee may wish
to ponder whether this is consistent with the secretary of state's pledge to
'intervene before breakfast, lunch and dinner'.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why not take a kick at another
obsession?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN PAVELIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley frequently delights in making jibes about religion,
his latest (Arts: 'Go tell it to the Martians', December 7) being to
speculate about why the media pay so much attention to church affairs when
only 2.3 per cent of the population are regular Anglican churchgoers.
Leaving aside the fact that most churchgoers are other than Anglican, it is
often rightly pointed out that more people go to church on Sunday than to
football on Saturday.
So why does not Mr Dunkley question the obsession of much of the mass media
with football, which receives far greater coverage than church affairs?

FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A painful account to be heeded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALEXANDER HUTCHISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Taking another look at Lady Doris Stenton's account of English Society
in the Early Middle Ages I was intrigued to find that Henry I, under the
impression that people were becoming 'careless' about coinage, had summoned
his moneyers to Winchester around Christmas in 1125. There, they were each
deprived of their right hand and emasculated. The historian notes this 'dour
business'  - recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  - was completed by
Twelfth Night.
Financial officers and public servants, elected or otherwise, breathe much
easier these days; but, as we approach the same season, contemplation of
that cautionary punishment may well create a frisson in some notable nooks
and corners of the City or Westminster  - more obviously in the light of
recent past events.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Esteve-Coll to leave the Victoria and Albert Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, the 56-year-old director of the Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum, is to quit next September to take up the post of vice chancellor at
the University of East Anglia. She will be leaving the V&amp;A in the middle of
her second five-year term as director.
'It's never easy to leave a place where you are working with a really good
team' Esteve-Coll said yesterday. 'But I can't resist a challenge and the
UEA has an international research reputation'.
She had a difficult start as director in 1988. Many of her senior colleagues
disapproved of her attempts to bring in a wider public by popularising
displays, and there were eight departures in a year. But she has stamped her
look on the V&amp;A, courting sponsors to provide eight refurbished galleries,
reintroducing regular exhibitions, and building up visits from school
children from 9,000 to 75,000.
This year attendances at the V&amp;A are over 40 per cent higher than in 1993,
thanks mainly to the Faberge, Pugin and Street Style shows, and should total
1.35m. When Esteve-Coll took over they had fallen below 1m, thanks to the
imposition of a suggested entrance charge in 1985.
The race to succeed her has already started. With Lord Armstrong still
chairing the trustees the new director will presumably be expected to
continue Esteve-Coll's populist policies. The most obvious contender is
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, who cut
his teeth at the V&amp;A.  He recently co-operated with the V&amp;A in securing the
controversial Three Graces, which the two museums will share, and has the
necessary mix of knowledge, energy and imagination, plus excellent contacts.
But his tendency to shoot from the hip may give the trustees pause.
The V&amp;A, embracing all the decorative arts and with a history as a
craft-fostering institution, has a tradition of appointing internally:
Esteve-Coll was librarian before her surprising lift to director. The most
obvious V&amp;A graduate, Charles Saumarez Smith, formerly the research
director, put himself out of the running earlier this year when he accepted
the top job at the National Portrait Gallery.
Another V&amp;A insider, Simon Jervis, went to the Fitzwilliam. Most of the
remaining departmental heads are fairly young and fairly new: if the
trustees go for managerial expertise they might favour Jim Close, who is
assistant director in charge of administration.
Alternatively there is Timothy Stevens, a recent arrival from the National
Museum of Wales who is assistant director in charge of collections. Among
the specialist curators Philippa Glanville, head of metal work, must be a
possibility.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: A northern nether-world of oddballs - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These days there is so much television that entire series can come and go
without the critic managing to mention them. Even if you resist the
blandishments of cable and satellite, as most people do, and stick to the
four terrestrial channels, there is still a vast amount of material on
offer. BBC2 usually closes down from about 1.00 am until 7.00, BBC1 is off
the air between 1.00 and 6.00, Channel 4 rests for about three hours most
nights, and ITV broadcasts round the clock. This means that most weeks there
are around 575 hours of programming available. Consequently some series
receive less notice here than they should, and the time has come to catch
up.
We are most of the way through two drama serials which form an extraordinary
pair. Both are transmitted on Thursday nights, indeed they clash for half of
their 60-minute duration. Both are based in Newcastle. Each is involved in a
nether-world inhabited by oddballs. Each has used a big funeral as one of
its central scenes . . . but then, which British television serial has not?
Melanie Hill appears in both, as does Christopher Fairbank. So does that
blasted bridge which must be the only architectural feature of note in the
entire city, judging from the obsessive way that cameramen wheedle it into
so many shots. You can see the sixth of BBC1's seven-part series, Crocodile
Shoes, tomorrow, and the fifth in the six-part ITV series, Finney.
Finney is that unusual phenomenon, a television series inspired by a movie.
It can work: those of us who predicted that television could never sustain
the acid tragicomedy of MASH the movie were forced to admit our error, but
such successes are unusual. So at first a series inspired by the 1987 film
Stormy Monday, in which pop star Sting played Finney, owner of a Newcastle
jazz club, seemed unpromising. Furthermore the plot was awfully familiar
from westerns: one member of a family tries to remain uninvolved while
everyone else feuds violently with another family.
Crocodile Shoes seemed more enticing. Not only was the lead role of Jed
being taken by Jimmy Nail  - the lugubrious Geordie who proved the most
popular of the fly-by-night brickies in Auf Weidersehn Pet and then went on
to write and star in Spender  - this time he was writing, producing,
starring and even singing his own country songs. In the central role he
plays a Newcastle lathe operator whose sister (Melanie Hill) sends off a
cassette of his amateur singing efforts and gets him a contract with a
London manager.
In the event, however, Finney has proved to have more strengths and
Crocodile Shoes more weaknesses than anticipated. In Finney the
paterfamilias having been killed in the opening moments of Episode 1, Lena,
played by Melanie Hill, becomes the leader of the Finneys in their war with
the Simpsons.
It is a pity that director David Hayman, who also plays villain McDade,
requires her to wear dark glasses so often, this being such a hard-nut
cliche and Lena being the sort of character who would never hide behind
anything. Despite this, Lena turns out to be television's most convincing
female crook since Ann Mitchell played Dolly in the 1983 Widows. It is also
a little hackneyed to have the supposed humanity of Finney himself (David
Morrissey) symbolised by his passion for jazz. The idea of inverting the old
cliche and changing jazz from a paradigm of lowlife and sin into the essence
of cool karma has, itself, become a right-on cliche since people such as
Alan Plater began using it in the mid 1980s in series such as The
Beiderbecke Affair.
The fact remains that the old formula works. You do feel on Finney's side
when he is reluctantly forced to buckle on his gunbelt and get back down
among the hard men in order to defend Tom, his ne'er do well coward of a
brother. The moment when Tom was forced by Bobo Simpson to act as assassin
in order to square his gambling debts, and opened the left-luggage locker to
find that the photograph of his target showed Bobo himself, was a good coup
de theatre. If the slo-mo monochrome 'therapist' inserts showing us the
brutality of the boys' upbringing look decidedly familiar, they are
nonetheless effective. Most important, the sense of tension  - of violence
scarcely held in check - is wholly persuasive.
Crocodile Shoes, on the other hand, is turning out to be rather less than
the sum of its parts. It wins points for not being about crime, and would
win even more for not being set in London, New York or Los Angeles, were it
not that Newcastle is rapidly joining that list. The scenes in the world of
music publishing, where co-star James Wilby plays the self-seeking, Porsche
driving, coke-sniffing Adrian, are as good as anything in this milieu on
television since Rock Follies in 1976.
The contrast between the effete hothouse atmosphere of the London music
scene and the darkening factories of Newcastle might have provided a telling
subtext if treated with a light enough touch, but sentimental object lessons
about the canny lads and the dignity of the workers rather spoil that. The
sad visit to the deserted factory in last week's episode was heavy handed
enough without the close-up of the outline on the floor of the old position
of Jed's lathe. The black humour (reminiscent of Bleasdale in Boys From The
Blackstuff) concerning, for example, the chap who paints his head  - to look
younger for job applications?  - prompting the comment 'He should have used
non-drip', feels like a deliberately added ingredient rather than a natural
element. As for the songs, they have a certain charm and, although Nail's
voice is thin, it is easy on the ear. The title song is even quite catchy.
The trouble is that the elements do not fit together well enough; Crocodile
Shoes seems like a contrived assemblage, in which all the constituents  -
northern recession, Nashville, London drugs scene - have been brought
together and placed in juxtaposition in the hope that they will form a
workable vehicle, rather than anyone working outwards from a coherent and
unified design. That is not to suggest it is unenjoyable but, like Finney,
and such an overwhelming proportion of television fiction today, it is to
suggest that this is formula drama, albeit superior formula drama.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: The Little Match Girl - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA SOUTHWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After his radical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,
the thought of gay provocateur Neil Bartlett interfering with Hans Christian
Andersen's The Little Match Girl at the Lyric Hammersmith might send shivers
down most censorious spines. It is like Fagin leading one of our seasonal
institutions down a dark alley for some forbidden pleasure.
But in Leah Hausman's frothy production, fears of something untoward are
completely unfounded. This is undiluted child's play, aided and abetted by
the show's main attraction: the Britton brothers, Tim and Chris,
collectively known as Forkbeard Fantasy, doubling up as assorted snowmen,
nuns, cops and angels when they descend from heaven in their underwear on a
snow cloud. Their mission? To protect the Little Match Girl from the
yuletide afflictions of poverty and homelessness.
So far so kosher. All Bartlett can really be accused of is shoehorning
Andersen's slight, melancholic and sentimental story of the street urchin
who dies from exposure on New Year's Eve into a contemporary Christmas
musical. Unfortunately his ambition never quite catches fire. What we get is
an evening of sugary anachronisms cheerfully presided over by Terry Neason's
dear, dead old Grandma: an ample-bosomed Scottish matron who has been yanked
from the steps of Mary Poppins' St Paul's, airbrushed and relocated to West
London.
Against the backdrop of Penny Saunders' lurid cartoonscapes, Hammersmith is
turned into a Dickensian theme park. The council house penury of Sian
Reeves' Little Match Girl failing to contend with her grumpy, Sun-reading,
sofa-bound Dad (Steve Fortune) rapidly gives way to joyous cod-Victorian
street bustle when Grandma persuades Miss Match to go out and sell some Swan
Vestas.
Suspiciously mature and vocally shrill, Reeves' raven-haired, emaciated
heroine is a striking street ingenue. But there is too much of the artful
about her to take her plight seriously. 'First The Big Issue, now matches .
. . whatever will they think of next?' snarls Tim Britton's bemused Harrods'
grotesque, Griselda, exiting stage left pursued by a tottering skyscraper of
Christmas presents. Quite. It seems much more likely that Reeves has time
shares in her pocket rather than a handful of lucifers.
The uncomfortable parable, that not everybody is happy at Christmas, is
conveniently lost in the warm flush of Nicolas Bloomfield's tripping
Sondheim and Lionel Bart-sounding arrangements. Each song, like a struck
match, becomes a cue for one of the Match Girl's customised visions. This is
where sentiment and the Britton brothers' diverting pantomime are most
successfully spliced.
The first startling vision is an enormous, cuddly Pooh Bear; but the third
vision is the showstealer: an inspired piece of Alice in Wonderland with the
Brittons as two pieces of giant cutlery  - (a sort of Basil Fawlty
knife-and-fork duet). In this they champion the hurt feelings of an
all-singing, all-dancing Christmas dinner dominated by Steve Fortune's
lugubrious giant Turkey, supported by a three-part harmony of Mashed
Potatoes (Liza Sadovy, Lindsey Dawson and Simon Penman), and finally swamped
by a children's chorus of Brussels Sprouts (pupils from Brackenbury School).
The short second half fails to match this shameless ebullience. The final
fantasy scene, where the Little Match Girl is finally taken into heaven, is
a resistible piece of Bartlett campery with the entire cast conjugating in
Restoration wigs around a haystack posing as a Christmas tree. An 18 carat
piece of cutesiness; but a 22 carat piece of kitsch.
The Little Match Girl is at the Lyric, Hammersmith until January 21.

The series on Hollywood wives exerted a horrible sort of fascination. Living
Barbie-dolls, plasticly gorgeous or surgically bedizened, spokespersons for
the aesthetics of plush suburbia writ large, the intellect of airport
bookstall paperbacks writ small, and the morality of the second-hand car (or
husband or wife) salesman. There was a certain fun to be had from the
assembled kitsch, a horrified thrill in the realisation that virtual reality
had already arrived and, as in some sci-fi shocker, had taken over the real
people. They made the Stepford Wives seem normal.
Hollywood Kids (9pm, ITV) is as fascinating but much sadder. One
automatically bristles against the plaint of the poor little rich kid, but
some of these children, offspring of the famous, were genuinely hurt and
bewildered. Clark Gable's secret daughter had to have those tell-tale ears
altered. Having Judy Garland as a mom was no rainbow's end (nor was calling
Liza Minelli Sis). Next week the four-part series moves on to children who
were stars themselves.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Figaro's Wedding - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figaro's Wedding, as the English National Opera quite rightly calls it, is a
better translation of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro than the stilted 'Marriage
of Figaro'. Since Saturday, Graham Vick's 1991 production is enjoying its
second ENO revival, as rehearsed by John Abulafia with a largely new cast.
For newcomers to the opera, it would make a fine pre-Christmas treat.
For seasoned Mozartians it offers nothing special beyond a promising team of
principals who need a little more time to work themselves in, but it is
creditable and funny enough in Jeremy Sams' indefatigably bright version
('translation' would be the wrong word). The new conductor is the Canadian
Derrick Inouye, who showed a lively grasp of the main lines of the score and
how to pace them. The lyrical interplay between soloists and first-desk
woodwinds  - a touchstone for any Figaro of distinction  - was less
confident on this first night; and in the breathless Cherubino-Susanna
duettino (as he prepares to leap from the window) orchestra and singers came
hopelessly adrift.
The soprano Nerys Jones is Cherubino, prettily sung but slightly relentless
in 'his' two set pieces; Susanna is Rosemary Joshua, fresh, alert and
charming despite too many genteelly indeterminate words. For diction as well
as bursts of solid character, Susan Bickley's Marcellina outdoes them both,
and in every ensemble her line is a sterling pleasure to hear. John
Connell's peppery Don Bartolo is another solid asset, uncommonly vital and
varied.
Rosa Mannion is an elegantly unhappy Countess who seems to have dropped in
from a higher sphere, where the oxygen is thinner. Neither she nor anybody
else is particularly accommodated in this production. They go through the
basic moves energetically, but none of those were  - as balletomanes say  -
'made' on them, and the general effect is, well, generalised. The sole
survivor from the original cast is John Graham-Hall's excellent Don Basilio,
whose extravagant foppishness now looks quite mad among these un-classy
people.
The leading men exemplify the problem. Figaro is the bass-ish baritone
Steven Page, whose long-jawed, baleful presence makes him a natural Count
(his previous role in the opera) no less than the operatic-villain tics that
stud his vocal delivery. The original Figaro here (Bryn Terfel) must have
been very different, but nothing is made of Page's own peculiar strengths.
Again, Robert Poulton's Count  - who sports a good line in self-satisfied
gloating, and compensates for underweight tone by forceful attack  - is left
to cut a merely foolish figure: why should his Countess care about
retrieving him?
Undoubtedly Vick's production was devised according to the virtues of the
first cast. The current staging is short on the psychological detail which
should lend depth to what is sung  - and that must originally have been
crucial, for Richard Hudson's sets are too anorexically minimal to establish
anything. Great slabs of plain, bright colours, lined-in just enough to fix
them as walls, ceilings and floors; no furniture beyond what the action
expressly requires, nor any extra doors or windows. The Almavivas seem to
live in near-destitution.
In the bedroom of the Countess there is nothing at all for Susanna to hide
behind, so we have to assume that the Count is obstinately failing to notice
her. In the final garden-act, brightly lit, the actors have to mime blind
stumbling-in-the-dark. Between such collusive artifices and Mozart's
uncomplicated naturalism, Figaro's Wedding looks fractured. As 'poor
theatre', it could fit an intimate stage perfectly; in its present form in
the vast Coliseum space, it seems wilfully denuded of its cosy, hierarchical
domestic setting, without  - so far - enough telling character-detail to
make good the loss. Goodish, nonetheless; but no kind of 'must'.
Further performances December 15 and 17; the run continues in January and
February

The scene: a Los Angeles petrol station, in a few years' time. A
medium-sized family car pulls in from the highway and hums up to the line of
pumps. The driver ignores the petrol and diesel nozzles. Instead, he reaches
for the one marked potassium hydroxide.
Five minutes later, just like its petrol-fuelled counterpart which has
filled up at the adjacent pump, the battery-powered car is on its way. By
applying some lateral thinking, California's SRI International  - still best
known by its old name of the Stanford Research Institute  - and Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratories believe they may have the answer to two of the biggest
technological hurdles which for years have bedevilled attempts to produce
viable battery-powered cars.
The hurdles are the lack of mileage provided by batteries between recharges
 - few of the prototype cars so far developed have proved capable of more
than 60-100 miles  - and the length of time needed for a complete recharge;
usually several hours.
Seeking to improve these performance parameters has led vehicle and battery
makers and government research teams around the world into multi-billion
dollar efforts to develop 'super-batteries'.
These efforts have been made more urgent for car makers by California's
adoption of legislation requiring 2 per cent of new car sales to be of
non-polluting 'zero-emission vehicles' in 1998, rising to 10 per cent in
2003. Thirteen other US states are soon to follow suit.
More powerful 'conventional' lead/acid batteries have been developed, as
well as new types of battery using different materials for the process  -
electrolysis  - by which electrical current is generated. But all fall far
short of providing the range and versatility of a petrol car and most have
other drawbacks. Some use materials that would be too costly to put into
mass production, others have technological problems, such as the
sodium-sulphur batteries that need to operate at several hundred degrees
centigrade.
SRI and Lawrence Berkeley Labs have opted for a 'zinc-air' battery, which
generates its power by reacting zinc and oxygen in an electrolyte comprising
zinc particles suspended in potassium hydroxide.
This battery has a good, but not outstanding, performance  - with a mileage
of just over 100 miles in a medium-sized vehicle  - compared with other new
battery technologies, and has the advantage of using cheap and readily
available raw materials.
What makes SRI's approach radical, however, is the concept of not recharging
the battery electrically. Instead, the spent electrolyte is physically
drained and fresh electrolyte simply pumped in as 'fuel'. SRI maintains that
not only does this quick 'refuelling' eliminate the biggest impediment to
driver acceptance of the battery car, but it also allows the potentially
huge infrastructure problems of electrical vehicles to be swept away.
There would be no need to dig up city streets to install a roadside charging
infrastructure; no need for festoons of power cables from houses to cars; no
need for businesses to provide recharging facilities for employees' cars to
make sure their cars can reach home.
Garages would merely have to add two more tanks to their fuel storage
systems. One would pump in the new 'fuel', the other would take the spent
electrolyte to storage tanks for collection. The spent electrolyte collected
from a network of garages would then be regenerated at central recharging
stations in a safe and controlled setting, using off-peak electricity,
before being redistributed.
'This feature is so attractive that one major oil company has become a key
supporter of our concept,' according to Joe Rudzinski, one of SRI's
executives involved with the project.
SRI, one of the world's biggest independent research and consulting
organisations, is starting a Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m) prototype programme to
prove the concept's overall practicality.
Its projected cost of a battery pack is around Dollars 3,000. It also
forecasts a forecourt refuelling cost of Dollars 12.30, compared with
Dollars 11.35 for a petrol vehicle of the same size travelling an identical
mileage  - a premium which Californian legislators and citizens are likely
to regard as a small price for relieving the state's notorious air
pollution.
Sixty-three per cent of Californians said in a survey recently they would
probably or definitely consider buying an electric car.
The survey of 400 Californians, commissioned by specialist newspaper
Automotive News, was taken immediately before EVS-12, the biennial symposium
on electric vehicles currently taking place in Los Angeles. Fifteen per cent
said they were prepared to pay up to Dollars 5,000 more than for a
conventional car.
North America's electricity utility industry is expected to watch the SRI
developments with mixed feelings. Whichever battery-powered car proves most
commercially successful, the electricity supply industry will benefit  -
from extra electricity demand arising from a large battery vehicle
population.
But it also sees a considerable business opportunity in the development and
provision of an infrastructure for the electrical recharging of a battery
car population, and has been working within the US Advanced Battery
Consortium  - a federal government-backed, Dollars 1bn project linking US
car and battery makers and utilities  - on how best to provide one.
If SRI's radical approach is successful, much of that opportunity could slip
from its grasp.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Yardsticks made to measure -
Haig Simonian considers the issues surrounding green indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indicators, like the statistics that underpin them, may not lie. But like
statistics, indicators can be used to support a variety of arguments.
Hence the debate rekindled last week after seven UK environmental groups
unveiled new indicators to illustrate the state of the environment. The
conclusion from 10 of the measures, which will be published as an annual
'Green Gauge' of environmental trends  - painted a bleak picture of rising
pollution and biodiversity under threat.
But while the Green Gauge was designed to grab headlines, the wider set of
46 environmental yardsticks on which it is based* has spotlighted the
broader question of the suitability of indicators to track environmental
performance.
The issue is not limited to a coterie of statisticians or theoretical
mathematicians. As concern about the environment and sustainable development
grows, attention is moving to the validity of traditional measures of
economic well-being, such as gross national product, to assess a country's
'true' quality of life.
Part of the debate, conducted by august international institutions such as
the World Bank and the US Department of Commerce, involves arcane arguments
about adjusting national accounts to reflect green concerns. But the issue
has also entered the broader political arena. In July, Britain's Labour
party committed itself to introducing adjusted national accounting in a
landmark report on the environment.
The use of environmental indicators forms an important, and more accessible,
part of the debate than fine-tuning national accounts. How valid are
statistics about, say, animal numbers, in tracking a nation's environmental
well-being? And how carefully should such information be used if the
underlying data are only partial?
Alex MacGillivray, the economist who co-ordinated the study on which the
Green Gauge is based, is bullish. But his research revealed many
contradictions. While there is no lack of data on the British environment
(the report talks of an 'information overload'), much of the material was
unusable because it was either too specific or covered an insufficient
time-span.
The work also exposed differences in the academic community about the
applicability of environmental yardsticks. Many specialised departments and
international bodies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, have concentrated on choosing measures that meet strict
statistical criteria. On the other hand, non-governmental agencies, such as
the pressure groups that sponsored the Green Gauge, are as interested in
finding indicators that will strike a chord among the general public.
In the new study, availability, frequency and international comparability of
data emerge as three of the most desirable criteria to determine good
environmental indicators. The 'quality' of the indicator is an essential
fourth, says MacGillivray. That means preferring a measure, such as the
standard of a country's bathing water, that also gives an insight into other
environmental factors such as river pollution and sewage discharges, over
narrower indicators.
International comparability, however, is the environmentalist's Achilles
heel. Since 1990, the OECD has been at the forefront of work on comparable
indices. Recently, it published a set of core indices covering 13
environmental issues, such as waste, urban environmental quality and soil
degradation. It warned, however, that much of the national data on which it
had drawn should be treated with caution.
Canada and the US have set an example in measuring environmental data.
Environment Canada, the ministry responsible in Ottawa, was among the first
to produce indices in the early 1990s. After publishing an initial 700-page
tome, it now also produces shorter, more readable updates on the indices it
tracks.
In the US, two cities, Seattle and Jacksonville, Florida, have made names
for themselves for their environmental initiatives.
In Seattle, citizens were asked to select the green yardsticks that best
reflected their perceptions of environmental quality. The quantity of salmon
in local rivers and the number of days residents could see the coastal
mountains through the urban smog were favourites.
But it is a somewhat different approach that may affect most Europeans. The
Netherlands government, a pioneer of environmental indices, monitors a range
of environmental pressures. These are given different weightings to produce
a single measure of the Netherlands' environmental performance.
Critics say the Dutch method is simplistic since no single figure can sum up
so many factors. Its supporters argue that the approach has the advantage of
immediate public 'resonance'. The dispute should be worth following as the
Dutch system appears likely to be adopted by the European Commission, which
has just started a project on developing European environmental pressure
indices.
While specialists are beavering away on new indicators, most shy away from
the much more sensitive issue of setting targets. Yet most environmentalists
argue that indicators in themselves are of little value if not combined with
specific targets to show how a country's environmental policies are helping,
or failing, to meet popular demands.
Targets could also prove useful to business  - usually at the sharp end of
lobbying from green pressure groups  - to help set yardsticks for
environmental performance. If there were visible signs of progress, industry
could also help rid itself of its image of environmental neglect.
Targets, of course, remain prescriptive, and highly contentious as a result.
It will be some time before agreement can be reached on the principle of
targets, let alone where they should be. In the meantime, the
environmentalists believe that creating standardised environmental
indicators is a small, but significant, step in the right direction.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: Academe plc - John Authers on a new trend in
university appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives from the world of commerce might have a place at university high
tables. Today's appointment of Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, director of the
Victoria and Albert museum, as the next vice-chancellor of the University of
East Anglia is only the latest of several moves by universities to recruit
entrepreneurial talent from outside academe.
The trend is most accentuated in the 'new' universities which converted from
polytechnics in 1992, but older institutions are also spreading their net
wider. For example, University College London now has Derek Roberts, a
former research director for GEC, the electronics company, as its provost.
Under his direction the college has amassed government research ratings
bettered only by Oxford and Cambridge, and also built a much envied
enterprise scheme to provide services for businesses. It is prospering in
the competition for both public- and private-sector funds.
This competition, intensifying as universities proliferate and funds become
scarcer, has spurred academic selection committees to look for people with
experience of industrial management, and also with presentational skills.
According to Raymond Frostick, who chaired East Anglia's selection committee
for the appointment, the assessors were looking for unorthodox qualities in
an academic: 'The ability to promote and market the university to the
outside world is extremely important, while at the same time having a clear
conception as to what happens when managing a complex organisation.'
Half of East Anglia's final shortlist of eight for the post held jobs
outside the university environment, and the university even employed
head-hunters Saxton Bampfylde for the first time. The company had already
found vice-chancellors for four other universities - Leeds, South Bank,
Southampton and York. Stephen Bampfylde, director, says: 'The real process
skill we look for is that of managing knowledge-based professionals.' This
threw the field open to managers of large accountancy firms or book
publishers, for example.
He defines what he was looking for as a management style which involves 'the
ability to articulate a vision and then a gentle ability to herd people
along with a hand rather than a heavy boot.'
It was also important to find someone who could command the intellectual
respect of the academic staff, even if it was no longer necessary to recruit
a renowned scholar.
This approach involves a sharp change in standard management styles for
higher education. According to Ted Nield of the Committee of
Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents all UK universities:
'Traditionally, being a vice-chancellor is a bit like being a sheepdog. You
have to get everyone moving in the same direction but you do it by chivvying
from behind, as opposed to holding a banner at the front.'
Now, rather than the stately and collegial process of persuading colleagues
to agree on a course of action, vice-chancellors are taking on the role of
American college presidents, and acting as figureheads. At De Montfort
University, a fast-growing former polytechnic in Leicester, of which
Esteve-Coll is a governor, different departments have transparent budgets
and work to targets in a stark, but so far successful, move away from the
traditional collegial style.
Academic sensitivities remain too strong for this to be taken too far,
however. According to Frostick: 'I certainly think we have found a
flag-waver. But there is a university community, and the job is still not
like being a managing director of a commercial organisation. There is still
a lot of persuasion involved.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: Testing time for new recruits - Alison Smith on
the sensitive process of finding financial regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong views about the national lottery or knowledge of champagne-making
techniques are not the most obvious attributes of a financial regulator.
Yet voicing firm opinions and displaying expertise helped two candidates to
make progress through the selection procedure to join the Personal
Investment Authority, the regulator which protects the private investor.
The last session for testing a small group of applicants was held late last
month, with final interviews yet to take place.
The PIA became operational in July, and has spent the autumn seeking to
recruit more than 30 monitoring and enforcement staff. Many of its employees
come from its two predecessor regulators  - Lautro and Fimbra  - which
covered life insurance companies and independent financial advisers
respectively. But the 'step change' in investor protection which it is
intended to bring about has led it to expand operations.
While there are many people with relevant experience working in compliance
departments of financial services companies, the PIA was seeking so many
candidates that it wanted to widen
the potential pool. This required a recruitment process in which lack of
expert knowledge of the financial services act was not a barrier to
performing well.
The result was the assessment centre designed and run for the regulator by
the management consultancy arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The assesment took half a day and comprised four main elements, starting
with a personality questionnaire.
From four statements in each of 40 questions, candidates were asked which
most or least applied to them. In one, for example, that choice would show
whether they were the sort of person who: 'shows concern for others; prefers
the tried and tested approach; controls my moods; weighs up the alternatives
quickly'. The aim was to identify 'danger areas' such as little social
confidence or lack of a methodical approach.
The next test was to deliver a six-minute presentation on a subject not
related to work and answer questions on it for four minutes. Candidates'
choice of subjects ranged from mundane to wildly ambitious: from the London
Borough of Croydon to arguments about surrogate motherhood.
Weaknesses such as expecting to keep attention with a dull topic or
addressing too wide a theme appeared to count for surprisingly little
compared with efforts to plough bravely on.
The third test was a group discussion, in which candidates were given a
short brief and 30 minutes to prepare a five-minute presentation on the
PIA's future.
The three assessors from the PIA and C&amp;L seemed to find ignorance of
financial regulation less material than participation in the group  -
although they did comment on how some candidates had failed to use
background information provided.
The final element was a verbal and critical reasoning test, which involved
candidates reading short passages, and saying whether statements related to
each were true, false or could not be judged because there was not enough
information.
Ann Shepherd, management consultant at C&amp;L executive resourcing, says the
key to making assessment centres work is getting the right mix of tests.
'The PIA is concentrating really on communication, general impact and
influence, and overall analysis and problem-solving,' she says. 'Other
organisations might put less emphasis on communication and more on
analytical skills, and the combination of tests would change to reflect
that.'
While the exercise worked in terms of bringing in a range of candidates from
outside financial services  - such as police officers, barristers and civil
servants  - it is already clear that not all the places will be filled. More
significantly, there is the question of whether the right candidates have
been selected. The PIA's record as a regulator over the coming years will be
one of the ways that judgments will be made.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: The shareholder as customer - Daniel Green on St
Jude's diversification strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ronald Matricaria arrived as president and chief executive of Minnesota
heart valve maker St Jude Medical he found a company in rude financial
health.
The business had sales of more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 122m) a year and
net profit margins, after tax, of 43 per cent. Its one product, a heart
valve, enjoyed an 85 per cent US market share and was either first or second
in almost every other large market for medical devices. There was a cash
pile of Dollars 350m.
Yet nobody seemed to want the company's shares. The historic price earnings
ratio had sunk to just 11, at the bottom of the pile in the US healthcare
sector.
'We had spent four years in paralysis. We couldn't diversify without hurting
profitability,' says Matricaria.
'There were several external (non-executive) directors, all senior
executives from large healthcare companies. They all had strong views and
there was never agreement on strategy. There was no plan,' he says.
At the first board meeting after Matricaria joined  - from Eli Lilly, the US
drug company, where he had been head of the medical devices division  - a
director asked him: 'What are we going to buy?'
Matricaria's response was to say that first he had to find out what
investors wanted him to do.
A shareholder survey showed that greater risk-taking and a spread of that
risk were the main priorities. No one mentioned profitability as an area of
concern.
The replies may have been obvious, but Matricaria had another reason for
consulting shareholders.
'Two-thirds of US companies that diversify get hit by shareholder suits,'
says Matricaria. 'And over the months that followed consultation there was a
big turnover in our shareholder lists. Some bought and others sold.'
The next stage was to bring in external advisers  - PA Consultants  - to
identify which of St Jude's 'core competencies' could be applied to other
businesses and hence form the basis for an acquisitions stra-tegy.
PA started off by identifying 191 processes that St Jude used in heart valve
manufacture. Forty eight were labelled as 'critical', of which 15 were
considered 'world class'.
This group was narrowed down to just eight which would be useful in other
business areas.
The consultants and the company then compared these eight with the 16
therapeutic areas in which medical device companies work. They wanted to
label potential takeover targets according to whether they could benefit
from St Jude's technologies.
'Six or seven companies were then identified, and we then had to find out
which was for sale,' says Matricaria.
Given that Matricaria had just come from Eli Lilly, there were perhaps
inevitable rumours that St Jude wanted to buy Lilly's heart pacemaker
business. That speculation came to nothing.
The Siemens heart pacemaker business was also on St Jude's list and luckily
for Matricaria the German electronics giant had just conducted a review of
its businesses and concluded that it was no longer interested in that
activity.
Talks between St Jude and Siemens began in early 1994 and a Dollars 500m
deal was announced in June.
The irony is that St Jude's profitability has fallen sharply: at the
company's January first quarter results following the acquisition, net
profit margin after tax will have fallen to 17 per cent, according to Kurt
Kruger, medical devices analyst at Hambrecht and Quist. But the shareholders
are happy.
The price earnings ratio is at 17, corresponding to a share price that has
risen from Dollars 29 to Dollars 40.
Looking back, Matricaria gives a telling, if subconscious, twist to the
maxim about putting the customer first. 'We had to become more
customer-oriented and find out what our shareholders really wanted from us,'
he says.

<TEXT>
David Bernstein is leaving Pentland Group, the consumer goods company, after
seven years as one of the acquisitive company's leading strategists.
Bernstein, 50, is quitting his post of executive director with
responsibility for group development, to 'pursue other interests', according
to Pentland.
Stephen Rubin, Pentland's chairman, says Bernstein had been responsible for
finding and investigating acquisition opportunities. 'We are sorry that
David Bernstein has decided to move on. During his seven years with
Pentland, he has made a significant contribution to the group's progress and
we wish him well in his future career,' Rubin said. Bernstein would receive
a pay-off which is not expected to be more than 18 months' salary.
Pentland is taking the opportunity of Bernstein's retirement to reshape the
board; and has appointed two executive directors.
Andy Rubin, 30, the chairman's son and head of group marketing services,
will take up his post from January 1. His appointment reflects the
increasing importance of marketing to the brand-led group, Rubin Snr says.
Andy Rubin was not on a contract, nor would he receive share options because
of the Rubin family interests in the company.
Pentland also announced the appointment of John Charlton, 48, as executive
director with responsibility for the company's hard goods division. This
includes china interests in the US.

FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Deputy md for Pearson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and entertainment group and owner of the Financial Times,
announced yesterday that David Veit is to become deputy managing director
with group-wide responsibilities.
Veit, 56, has been with Pearson since 1961 and for the past 20 years has
been the senior Pearson executive in the US. He joined Pearson after
graduating from Oxford and later obtained an MBA from Stanford University.
The move is designed to give some support for Frank Barlow, the Pearson
managing director who turns 65 in March. It could also signal the likely
succession, although Lord Blakenham, the Pearson chairman said yesterday: 'I
am glad to say that Frank Barlow has no immediate retirement plans. David's
appointment marks a welcome strengthening of our senior management team in
London.'
Veit, who was involved in the development of Pearson's publishing and other
activities in the US, will continue to live in New York while spending an
increased amount of time at head office in London.

The last of the old guard at Simon Engineering departed this week as Peter
Cook resigned from the board to pursue other interests. The move came as no
surprise to Simon-watchers, and completes a reorganisation of the board
since Maurice Dixson arrived last year as chief executive.
Cook joined Simon in 1977 as finance director, and subsequently held a
number of executive roles. In January, he was relieved of his
responsibilities as managing director of the industrial services division.
Since then, he had been concentrating on the group's disposal programme, and
had been due to retire at the end of this year.

Humphrey Odd, managing director of Diesel Marine International and John
Kirkham, DMI's finance director, are to leave the company on December 31 in
a cost-cutting move by parent Torday &amp; Carlisle.
The head office staff of the North Tyneside-based engineering group and of
DMI, its biggest subsidiary, are to be merged. Group chief executive Eric
Brightmore will become managing director of DMI and group finance director
Steve Scott will become DMI fd as well.
The departures of Odd and Kirkham are intended to be the final fall-out from
a difficult few years for T&amp;C, which led to the departure in early 1994 of
Paul Torday, then chief executive. 'Major changes of personnel are over,'
says Brightmore, who became chief executive in April.
This year the group closed its Newcastle headquarters and moved to a
building adjacent to DMI. With DMI comprising two thirds of the group there
is no longer a need, says Brightmore, for two head office staffs. 'It's a
cost-cutting streamlining,' he added.
The changes mean the five executive directors on the T&amp;C board will also be
directors of DMI. Odd, currently a T&amp;C director, declined to comment on his
departure.

<TEXT>
Southern Electric is reshaping the top management team which has led the
company from privatisation, so as to deal with the next phase of
development.
Two directors will have their jobs redesigned to give the company a stronger
focus on the future.
Jim Forbes, the operations director with responsibility for the distribution
business, will take over as managing director, electricity, and will assume
wider responsibility for the supply business, including gas, which is one of
Southern's new areas. He will also have responsibility for raising
productivity and cutting costs.
Jim Hart, the commercial director, will become managing director, business
development, which includes regulatory matters and strategy. One of his key
tasks will be to find new business activities to replace earnings from the
National Grid  - to be sold next year  - and in which Southern has a ten per
cent stake.
The two will work alongside John Deane, the finance director, and all three
will report to Henry Casley, the chief executive. Casley says the changes
reflect Southern's determination 'to build on the positive benefits we have
already achieved for our customers and shareholders'.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Recruitment: Don't throw away those gold watches -
Assumptions that lifetime employment is a thing of the past are being
challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate about whether we have a job for life has reached an interesting
stage in the life-cycle of a trend.
First we have the observations of the trend spotters, in this case and
perhaps most prominently management writer Charles Handy, whose observations
and anecdotes are striking chords of recognition among many employees and
managers.
Second we have the academics who test the theory. What often happens with
such trend observations is that they attract disciples who accept them as
gospel truth. This stimulates the academics, who then take great delight in
demolishing or blowing holes in the theory. There follows a period of calm
in which the trend is found to be not a trend at all, or where its real
strength emerges.
In the 'end of jobs for life' debate, we have reached the second stage. Last
week Simon Burgess and Hedley Rees at Bristol University published findings
which suggested that many more people than might have been expected are
spending their working lifetimes with the same employer.
Peter Robinson, a researcher at the Centre for Economic Performance, London
School of Economics, welcomed the findings, which, he said, was 'nailing
another myth' about the labour market. He pointed out that in the US, where
many similar trend observations have been made, the proportion of employees
reporting they had been in their existing jobs for more than eight years had
hardly changed in the 21 years from 1979 to 1991.
So what are we to conclude? Have the seers got it it wrong, or are their
often anecdotal observations alerting us to the beginnings of a large-scale
change? Should we, in fact, ignore the evidence of our own eyes and
experiences?
Robinson says we should at least be guarded about what we might believe from
our observations. Take short-term contract working, for example. Surely this
is becoming far more widespread? Not so, he says. 'The tendency is to look
around you and see what's happening in your own area. I and my colleagues
are all on temporary contracts now, but when you look at the proportion of
employees on temporary contracts you see it hasn't changed between 1984 and
1994.'
Part of the problem with such academic observations is that they are far
less fun for consultants and writers - including journalists - who make
their livings from trend spotting. They may also have their flaws in that
their findings are historical. Robinson does not deny that there may be a
trend. What he is saying is that the evidence suggests the changes may be
far more gradual than we have assumed.
When change does happen, however, it sometimes takes time to gain momentum.
Many of the changes in work patterns emanating from the industrial
revolution mainly took place in about 30 or 40 years around the turn of the
18th century. Some people are asking whether the information technology
revolution will prove a similar watershed in the way we work.
The tension between popular observation and hard statistical analysis does
nothing to clear the confusion among employees and job applicants who would
really like to know what to do for the best.
University graduates could be forgiven for becoming particularly cynical
They are courted by the large companies on the university milkround, yet
they are becoming increasingly sceptical about the prospects on offer.
The careers department that serves both Manchester University and Umist
(University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) has started a
scheme which is trying to encourage more small and medium-sized businesses
to take an interest in graduates.
Chris Phillips, the department's deputy director, said: 'We need to do this
because the large companies will continue to recruit graduates but nothing
near enough to keep up with the increase in the numbers of graduates leaving
universities.'
Such careers-orientated schemes are particularly appealing for Umist, which
likes its students to take part in company-based research projects,
utilising disciplines learned in their first year.
Dale Littler, Umist professor of marketing said the university's approach,
which avoids set texts, tries to encourage students to think strategically
about their work and to obtain first-hand knowledge of company expectations
in project work. Abilities to do the work, complete reports, carry out
presentations and meet deadlines are all tested in the workplace. The
benefit to companies is that findings can be used to their advantage. In one
project, a team of Umist students suggested improvements to a new banking
kiosk developed by the Co-operative Bank.
'Some of the solutions to the things they are working on are not found in
text books,' said Littler.
The separate careers scheme, in turn, gives companies which might usually
consider taking on graduates the opportunity to put them through their paces
without any obligation or commitment.
Some interesting findings on student expectations and approaches to their
jobs have been discovered by John Arnold, lecturer in organisational
psychology at Umist, in research he carried out with Kate Mackenzie Davey at
Birkbeck College, London. They found that absence or provision of clear
career paths had a strong influence on whether graduates stayed with an
organisation or left. It also found that they had a preference for being
developed through the work they did rather than through theory in training
programmes.
This again seems to point to quite conservative tendencies among graduates.
In other words, if companies are offering well defined career paths, they
should maintain their promise. They might also devise projects or programmes
that enable them to use their graduate recruits as performing assets from
the start of their employment.
Returning to the theme that things may not be always as they seem. No sooner
had I reported on a trend among recruiters to seek out competencies from job
applicants that was questioning the need for such things as curriculum vitae
and paper qualifications, than I came across a system for sifting CVs that
is being widely used in the US and which promises to streamline recruitment
and sifting procedures for recruiters.
The more thoroughly composed the CV, the greater advantage there is for the
system.
The system, called Resumix - there are other CV database systems on the
market but Resumix, based in Santa Clara, California, has patents for its
information sifting method - was devised about six years ago and has been on
the US market for about two years.
Whereas part of the recruiter's art is to sift and funnel applicants into a
digestible interviewable group, Resumix acts like a bucket, scanning as many
CVs as you want to put in it. The information on them is stored and when you
have a job which has a particular skill or qualification requirement, all
you need do is punch in the particular skills you are looking for and it
spouts out a list of names.
Mercury Communications, which is using the system to select from the 8,000
graduate applications it will have received by the end of March, says it has
made the selection process much speedier.
By retaining names on a database, employers can sift through for any number
of jobs they please and applicants' CVs which would otherwise be filed away
and forgotten if they were unsuccessful in their specific job application
can be instantly reappraised for other job openings.
It is proving particularly popular among the big mass recruiters in the US
such as IBM and Disney.
So the CV is dead, long live the CV. The potential of such systems seems
enormous. It may be worth questioning at some stage whether there is any
potential for abuse. The day when all our CVs are on such systems may not be
far away. If we have a job for life, however, we should only need to use
them once.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Nadir hopes to draw line under five-year debacle: John
Barham explains how political changes could resolve the fugitive
businessman's problems and lead to his comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir may be close to resolving his
difficulties with the north Cyprus government.
This would involve striking a deal with his British creditors, opening the
way for a comeback in 1995, five years after his Polly Peck International
(PPI) group collapsed.
Mr Nadir often says the charges against him will be dropped soon and he
threatens a battle for compensation. He was charged with theft and false
accounting after Polly Peck failed in 1990.
Mr Nadir, claiming he would not get a fair trial in Britain, jumped Pounds
3.5m bail last year and fled to north Cyprus.
Recently, though, Mr Nadir and his long-time patron, President Rauf Denktas
of north Cyprus, have clashed in public, raising speculation that his
political protection is ebbing away.
Mr Denktas has demanded that Mr Nadir either pay Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.7m)
in back taxes or face arrest. Earlier, street protesters, apparently
encouraged by Mr Nadir, had taunted Mr Denktas outside his office. They
jeered that he was a homosexual, the most damning insult in Turkish.
At the same time, administrators of PPI, unable since 1990 to make any
headway in recovering company assets in Cyprus, are finding that they have
the government's ear.
In a report to creditors published recently, the administrators struck an
optimistic note on developments in north Cyprus while warning that political
shifts had repeatedly upset progress on getting hold of PPI assets in the
breakaway republic. However, the latest political shift in north Cyprus does
at last appear to be ending the years of government stonewalling.
A coalition government took office in January, led by Mr Denktas's
conservative DP party, with the leftwing CTP party as the junior partner.
The CTP wants to end the Nadir affair, hoping this will clean up north
Cyprus's image of a rogue republic recognised by no one but Turkey.
A CTP official said: 'We want to show that the Turkish community is a legal,
democratic community.'
The party's finance and tourism ministers have recognised the British
administrators' right to manage two state-owned hotels run until recently by
Mr Nadir. They could also be close to reaching settlement over Sunzest, a
citrus company run by Mr Nadir but claimed by the administrators.
Although these businesses are profitable, Mr Nadir owes Dollars 11m in
unpaid taxes, social security contributions and rent on the hotels. Now he
has offered to surrender Sunzest, valued at Dollars 19m last year, to the
government if it waives its tax demand.
A source close to PPI's administrators said: 'We are interested in a
political settlement between Nadir and the government and us.'
This would obviate the need for a ruling in the courts, which have
consistently supported Mr Nadir. The administrators have always recognised
that PPI has legitimate debts in north Cyprus.
The government would use cashflow from the companies to pay off Mr Nadir's
debts and then allow administrators to sell them. He said they 'should
accept this deal and get out. You never know in this country what will
happen tomorrow.'
Still, the administrators may turn down the proposals. Many Cypriots doubt
that politicians, who owe Mr Nadir many a favour, will assent to any deal he
does not like.
It would be awkward for a government to be seen to be backing British
creditors against Mr Nadir - still a popular man in north Cyprus - with
campaigning for presidential elections due to start in the spring.
Mr Nadir's tabloid newspaper Kibris, north Cyprus's most read paper,
relentlessly drives home the message that he brought jobs and money to a
country blighted by under-investment and unemployment caused by its pariah
status.
'I would say that Asil is a great man, a really great man for Cyprus,' said
one man. Mr Erdogan Ulgen, a shopkeeper, added: 'We are always close to Mr
Nadir because he brought a lot of business to our country. He is no thief.
His problems come from the Greeks and the British.'
Occasionally Mr Nadir is rumoured to be considering a political career,
especially since Mr Denktas, for 20 years north Cyprus's strong man, says he
will not stand for re-election.
Yet one man, asked if he would vote for Mr Nadir, replied:'Nadir is a
businessman, not a politician.' And his opponents insist his hero status is
no more than the reflexive support of one islander for another, put on for
the benefit of outsiders.
In fact, they claim, public perceptions are changing as the facts of the
Polly Peck affair penetrate Mr Nadir's propaganda barrage. Increasingly,
they insist, Mr Nadir is seen as a thief, a tax dodger and a man who has
disgraced north Cyprus.
One opposition lawyer says Mr Nadir should be punished for offences
committed in Cyprus.
But should he be handed over to a British court? 'No, of course not. We have
no extradition agreement with Britain and Britain has no agreement with us.
'Nadir is a citizen of north Cyprus, he cannot be kicked off.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Labour bolsters election strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday announced the formation
of a team of 18 backbench MPs to help build the party's campaigning strategy
for the next general election.
In a bid to strengthen Labour's membership and activities, Mr Prescott said
the team would promote local campaign initiatives and political education.
The announcement came as the party's national membership crossed the 300,000
mark. According to Labour officials the membership has risen by more than
56,000 since Mr Tony Blair's election as leader in July and by more than
76,000 in the past 12 months.
At a press conference at Westminster yesterday, Mr Prescott said the party
was on target to have more than 500,000 members at the next general
election.
He said: 'Although the Tories go from bad to worse, with crisis heaped on
crisis, the Labour party knows that we should not just rely on the Tory
party to lose by-elections or the general election.
'We have to keep working to present positive messages about the Labour party
and to develop the policies on which we will fight the next election.'
The campaigning team is to be led by Ms Bridget Prentice, MP for Lewisham,
and will be directly responsible to Mr Blair and Mr Prescott.
Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, will co-ordinate the party's campaigns
on Treasury affairs and Mr Mick Clapham, MP for Barnsley, will be
responsible for trade and industry.
Earlier this year Mr Prescott made clear that one of his main roles as
deputy leader would be to boost the party's membership and campaigning.
The party is still well behind the Conservatives, who have a national
membership of about 750,000.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Lloyd's reserves 'short by Pounds 10bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London would need to find an extra Pounds 10.2bn, over a period
of years, to bring its reserves into line with possible liabilities,
according to forecasts published yesterday.
Estimates by Chatset, the independent company that monitors Lloyd's, suggest
a further deterioration in the outlook for so-called 'open years' - annual
accounts for Lloyd's insurance syndicates which have not been closed because
of difficulties in calculating possible claims, in particular from US
asbestosis, health and pollution cases.
Chatset urged the agencies which run Lloyd's syndicates not to make further
cash calls on Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market. It said demands for more funds should await the
setting up of Equitas, the company Lloyd's is forming to take over,
initially, responsibility for 1985 and prior liabilities.
Chatset said the Lloyd's authorities 'need to move quickly to maintain the
goodwill of the Names, because in practical terms that is the only way they
are likely to be paid by the growing army of dissidents, otherwise Lloyd's
will find itself being swept into the chasm of insolvency'.
Lloyd's authorities are hoping that Equitas will be able to subsume
liabilities from old years at a lower cost than individual syndicates, but
has yet to prove that the scheme is viable or will win regulatory approval.
Chatset's figures highlight the difficulties Lloyd's faces in shaking off
past problems. Last week Lloyd's announced that it was reviving attempts at
finding an out-of-court settlement for the legal action by Names who are
claiming damages from Lloyd's agencies to cover their losses.
Mr Charles Sturge, Chatset editor, said the figures assumed under-reserving
would be made up over a number of years. The exercise would be less costly
if money was injected earlier because income would be earned from
investments. But in practice it would be impossible to raise anything
approaching Pounds 10bn from Names - if only because many of those who would
have to be approached are no longer active in the market.
Last year Names were asked to provide an extra Pounds 1.4bn for reserves.
Chatset said that had not stopped a deterioration in the amount of
under-reserving from Pounds 8.6bn at the end of 1992 to Pounds 10.2bn at the
end of last year.
US liability policies remain the biggest cause of under-reserving - and for
some 'open years' claims may outstrip premium income by several times - but
much of the latest increase has arisen from 'personal stop loss' policies
underwritten in the Lloyd's market.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Tram schemes win approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Approval for tram systems to be built in Birmingham and the south London
borough of Croydon was granted by the government yesterday. Both will be
funded by a mix of public and private capital.
Detailed proposals for the schemes, which are expected to require a total
investment of Pounds 305m, have been prepared by private sponsors and local
authorities. They were delayed for several years while awaiting government
approval.
The schemes will depend on the private sector making a 'significant'
contribution to the total cost, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary,
said.
London Transport, one of the backers of the Croydon Tramlink, said the
government's statement represented an important step forward, but West
Midlands Passenger Transport Authority criticised it as requiring too large
a financial contribution from local authorities.
If the two schemes do proceed they will represent a significant boost to
light rail systems in the UK. Manchester began operating trams in 1992,
followed by Sheffield this year. Before that British cities had neglected
trams for decades.
Croydon Tramlink is a 17-mile network aimed at speeding up journey times
between Wimbledon, Croydon, Beckenham and New Addington. London Transport
and Croydon Borough Council believe the private sector would be willing to
provide more than half the Pounds 160m cost.
The Midland Metro would link central Birmingham with Wolverhampton over 13
miles of track, with the private sector contributing about Pounds 10.5m to
the Pounds 145m cost.
Mr Richard Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands PTA, said it had already
spent or promised Pounds 13m to aid preparations for the project. 'We are
being asked to commit further capital from resources we do not have,' he
said.
Proposals for Croydon Tramlink have been drawn up by a private consortium
comprising German engineering group AEG, Tarmac Construction and Transdev,
an operator of trams in France, but the project would be put out to open
competition. The Midland Metro contract has already been won by a consortium
comprising John Laing, the UK construction group, and Ansaldo Trasporti, an
Italian supplier of rail systems.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Drugs investment drive eyes Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today announce a campaign designed to develop
substantially Japanese investment in the UK pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology sectors.
It is the first attempt by ministers and leaders of the pharmaceuticals
industry to take advantage of Britain's successful bid to house the European
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. The agency will manage the
European Union's new system of medicines licensing that comes into force
next month, and its location in London could prove a magnet for new
pharmaceuticals investment.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and a team of senior
representatives from the pharmaceuticals industry will visit Japan in March
to try to sell the message of Prescribe UK, a joint inward investment
campaign being launched by the government and industry today.
Mrs Bottomley and the industry team will also travel to the US in the
spring, but Japan is seen as the main target for their efforts. She said
yesterday: 'We have to demonstrate that the factors which have led to
successful Japanese manufacturing investment in the UK apply even more
strongly to pharmaceuticals.'
Britain's drugs industry is already substantial by world standards, and
includes many subsidiaries of overseas companies. The UK market for
medicines totalled Pounds 4.9bn last year, while 10 of the world's top 35
prescribed medicines were discovered and developed in the UK. Britain
accounts for about 12 per cent of the international export market in
medicines, and a third of all European biotechnology companies are located
in the UK.
The Prescribe UK team believes Britain has extra advantages to offer
pharmaceutical investors that are sometimes overlooked. These include the
National Health Service - the world's biggest healthcare organisation -
which by its size offers unique opportunities for research and teaching in
the use of new drug techniques.
Mrs Bottomley said: 'The government worked with the industry to win the
medicines evaluation agency for Britain. Many of the arguments that helped
our success in that campaign, like our excellent communications and the use
of English as the international language of the pharmaceuticals industry,
also make a strong case for greater inward investment in pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Rail bidders face stringent controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far-reaching controls on fares, timetables and levels of overcrowding will
have to be accepted by the bidders for the first eight train operating
companies due to be offered for sale today.
Fare increases will be limited on many commuter routes while rules designed
to prevent any increase in present levels of overcrowding have been drawn
up.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director responsible for the passenger train
operations sell-off, hopes to revive the momentum of British Rail
privatisation when he announces the terms for the first round of franchises.
But the 'passenger service requirements' are expected to provoke a political
storm, with critics of privatisation arguing that they will lead to a
reduction in services.
The service requirements will cover:
Timetables. Operators will be told the minimum number of trains which they
will be expected to run on weekdays and at weekends, the intervals between
trains, and the times of the first and last services.
Mr Salmon is expected to guarantee only an hourly service on some main lines
compared with current half-hourly services. Subsidies will be available for
these services but Mr Salmon expects additional trains to run to maximise
revenue and to compete effectively.
Fares. The franchising director is expected to intervene to hold down fares
on routes where rail travellers do not have a realistic alternative,
including rush-hour London routes and Edinburgh services. Responsibility for
fares in other large urban centres lies with local passenger transport
authorities.
Overcrowding. Train operators will be limited in terms of the numbers of
passengers they may carry. That is intended to ensure that if an operator
reduces services when demand falls, it will be obliged to increase services
when demand picks up. That measure is designed to prevent further
overcrowding.
At present train operators may carry up to 35 per cent more passengers than
they have seats.
Tickets. Train operators will be obliged to accept discount and full-fare
tickets sold by other train companies (though Apex fares, which have to be
bought in advance, will not be covered).
However, requiring operators to accept other companies' tickets could be
seen by critics as stifling price competition.
Consequently, while the lead operator on a particular route must accept
other companies' tickets, an operator offering an alternative service would
be allowed to provide a lower-priced ticket.
The rail regulator is considering proposals to concentrate the sale of
long-distance tickets on a limited number - perhaps 400 - stations.
Tickets are increasingly expected to be sold by tele-sales offices and
off-station outlets. However, rail user groups are concerned that this would
complicate ticket purchases.
Details of the franchises to be put up for sale in the first round will be
published today as pre-qualification documents.
Bidders will be expected to register an interest by March. Detailed bids
will then be invited in April, and the first sale is expected by December
next year.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Students finding jobs more easily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of UK university students finding a job within six months of
graduating increased sharply last year, the Association of Graduate Careers
Advisory Services revealed yesterday.
The proportion finding permanent employment rose by 3 percentage points to
43.9 per cent, in spite of a 20 per cent increase in the overall number of
graduates. The proportion of unemployed fell by 1 percentage point, but
remains high compared with historic levels, at 11.7 per cent.
Ms Margaret Wallis, director of the careers advisory service at the
University of Warwick, suggested that increased graduate recruitment by
small and medium-sized companies accounted for most of the rise.
This was demonstrated by the continued fall in the number of large
recruiters using the 'milk round', with interviews held on campuses.
A survey by the University of Southampton has suggested the number of
milk-round sessions booked by employers in 'old' universities (which held
their status before polytechnics were upgraded to universities in 1992) will
drop by 14 per cent next term from its level in the spring term this year.
'New' universities are likely to experience a sharper cut of 23 per cent in
such bookings.
Employers also appear increasingly to be targeting individual institutions,
with only 308 visiting former polytechnics, while 1,574 have booked to visit
old universities.
There was also no revival in employment prospects for scientists, with civil
and electrical engineering, physics, computing and sociology showing the
highest unemployment rates, all at about 13 per cent.
Instead, courses such as economics, geography, history and modern languages
proved more popular with employers.
Women were more likely to find permanent employment than men. Only 42.3 per
cent of male graduates found permanent employment, compared with 45.4 per
cent of female graduates. Ms Wallis said young women appeared to be more
'assiduous' in applying for jobs, and appeared better prepared at
interviews.
The association emphasised that the employment market was only recovering
slowly. But Mr Nigel Llewellyn, national recruitment partner with Touche
Ross, the accountancy firm, said: 'There is clear evidence that the market
for graduates is turning up. As the output of graduates levels off, we could
well see a squeeze on employers as candidates start to pick and choose. It's
all a far cry from three years ago.'
Careers services said employers took a strong academic record for granted,
and wanted evidence of strong involvement in extra-curricular activities,
and of interpersonal skills.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Increase in ethical concerns reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethical concerns about products are set to follow environmental issues as a
growing preoccupation for UK consumers, says a study by Mintel, the market
research company.
A marked rise in consumers' awareness of ethical matters in their spending
bears all the hallmarks of the rising concern about 'green' issues of the
early 1990s, Mintel says.
Awareness is most marked in customers of financial services, with 47 per
cent of those asked saying they would not use any financial service  - bank
or building society account, credit card or investment  - from a particular
company because of an ethical issue. That is 2 percentage points higher than
in the previous study in 1990.
The research also points to growing consumer concern about the ethics of
manufacturing companies. The proportion of consumers who acknowledge they
care about ethical issues, but have not yet adjusted their spending
accordingly, rose by 7 percentage points to 35 per cent.
Miss Angela Hughes, Mintel consumer research manager, says concern about
company ethics is still concentrated on younger and better-educated
consumers, notably from the south of England.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Nissan's 16% rise makes it biggest vehicle exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, emerged as the biggest UK vehicle exporter
last year ahead of the traditional industry leaders Rover group, Ford and
Vauxhall.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed Nissan
increased car exports last year by 15.9 per cent to 182,207 from 157,209 a
year earlier.
Rover group increased its exports marginally last year by 1.5 per cent to
173,292 (including cars and commercial vehicles) as a result of a big jump
in foreign demand for its Land Rover products.
The foreign car sales of Ford and Vauxhall collapsed in 1993 after a plunge
in new car demand in continental Europe.
Ford's car exports from the UK rose sharply in 1990 and 1991 but in 1993 the
export volume fell by 84.6 per cent to only 11,218. Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of General Motors, suffered a similar fate, as its car exports
dropped by 61.8 per cent to 39,932 last year.
The export of Ford cars from the UK was exceeded last year by all three
Japanese companies producing cars in the UK - Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Ford
stayed ahead of Toyota and Honda in overall vehicle exports because of sales
of UK-built light commercial vehicles.
Sales of used cars bought on credit are continuing to increase at twice the
rate of new cars on credit, says HPI, the vehicle finance information
organisation, John Griffiths writes.
Its figures show that used car sales grew by 10.4 per cent in November
compared with the same month last year, while new cars rose 4.5 per cent.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Court ban on naming of lottery winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, the National Lottery operator, was last night granted a High Court
injunction preventing Mirror Group or News International from naming the
winner of last Saturday's Pounds 17.9m lottery jackpot.
The legal action was taken after both the Daily Mirror and The Sun had
almost certainly discovered the identity the winner of the largest amount
ever won in the UK.
The winner, a factory worker in the north of England with three children,
had opted for anonymity as is his right under the rules of the National
Lottery.
The newspapers said last night that they had not been intending to publish
the winner's identity in today's newspapers but that they intended to
challenge the ex parte injunction, which remains in force until next
Tuesday, at the earliest possible opportunity.
Under the rules set by the National Lottery office the privacy of winners
receives strong protection if that is what they want. Unlike football pools
winners, who have to opt for privacy, National Lottery winners have an
automatic right of privacy until they opt for publicity in front of a
witness.
The excitement over last Saturday's jackpot, and the near inevitability of
the winner's identity becoming common knowledge, raises questions about how
practical the privacy rule will turn out to be. In many US lotteries winners
are not allowed to remain secret to ensure fair play.
On Monday, when a number of newspapers offered rewards for finding the
multi-million winner, Mr Ian Sproat, the National Heritage minister,
suggested that complaints about unfair behaviour by newspapers could go to
the Press Complaints Commission.
On Monday night The Sun and the Daily Mirror withdrew rewards of Pounds
10,000 and Pounds 5,000 respectively for identifying the winner. Though it
is very unlikely a newspaper will name the jackpot winner while the
injunction is in place, more and more details of the lifestyle and character
of the person are likely to emerge.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Warranties may lose earning power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading report on the sale of extended warranties, due
out on Friday, is likely to be an unwelcome Christmas present for electrical
retailers.
Its recommendations are not expected to ban the sale of such warranties at
point of sale, as some had feared, but are still likely to have a big impact
on what has become a main source of profit for several large retailers.
Extended warranties are insurance policies which provide extra protection
against product breakdown after the standard manufacturer's guarantee has
expired. The OFT's report is thought likely to call for the introduction of
a new code of practice in the electrical retail sector governing the sale of
such warranties, plus a lengthy 'cooling-off' period during which consumers
could cancel warranties.
The OFT announced its probe into the sale of extended warranties in February
after much criticism from consumer groups. They highlighted the
high-pressure sales techniques employed by some companies, the lack of
information provided to shoppers, the difference between the prices of
extended warranties offered by retailers and those offered by manufacturers,
and questioned the value of them.
Retail analysts have also criticised large electrical goods retailers such
as Dixons and Comet for their reliance on extended warranties as a
significant source of income.
Fierce high street competition has severely squeezed margins on retail
electrical goods, and extended warranties account for a significant slice of
the sector's profits.
Dixons, which also owns Currys and accounts for about 20 per cent of the UK
electrical market, is thought by several analysts to derive most of its
pre-tax profits from extended warranties. The group has sold 4.5m such
warranties since setting up its own insurance arm.
The latest research, by Mr Terry Smith and Mr Neil Darke of stockbrokers
Collins Stewart, claims that:
Dixons made total gross profits from extended warranties of about Pounds
100m in each of its past two financial years - more than the group's pre-tax
profits of Pounds 77m and Pounds 73m respectively. That Pounds 100m includes
commission earned by stores on policy sales, underwriting profits, and
investment income from cash - estimated at Pounds 384m in April this year -
held by its subsidiary Dixons Insurance Services, to cover warranty claims.
Dixons' dividend 'is being funded through the retail commission they pay
themselves on the sale of the extended warranty policies'.
The group makes a gross margin of 40 per cent on extended warranties, more
than twice that made by Domestic &amp; General, an insurer selling such
warranties mainly through independent electrical retailers.
The conclusions echo those published earlier this year by Mr Tony Shiret of
stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Mr John Clare, Dixons chief executive, yesterday
said they ignored or underestimated costs associated with selling extended
warranties. 'You don't have physical stockholding costs, but you do have a
large service organisation to provide the service.'
Dixons has its own subsidiary, Mastercare, which provides after-sales
service on products it sells. 'We might make a gross profit which is quite
considerable on many parts of the business, but after all the costs and
overheads the net profit looks very different,' Mr Clare said.
He said analysts ignored the fact that without extended warranties, the
dynamics of Dixons' business and of the whole electrical retail sector would
change.
'In the extreme event of extended warranties disappearing from the mix, the
assumption that nothing else would change is ludicrous,' he said.
He said that if the group did not make money from selling insurance policies
to cover product repair costs, it would instead make money from charging
customers directly for repairs. More importantly, if the electrical retail
trade could no longer make profits on selling extended warranties, there
would have to be 'some structural change in the margins of the business'.
Retailers would be forced to renegotiate deals with suppliers, Mr Clare
said, and some unprofitable stores - and weaker chains - might be forced to
close.
The OFT is not expected to recommend a ban on selling extended warranties,
but its efforts to introduce more competition into the warranties market
could force retailers to cut the margins they make on selling the policies.
Ms Hilary Monk, author of this year's report on electrical retailing by
research group Verdict, said: 'The balance between margin on the product and
margin on warranties clearly needs to be redressed.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Tighter watch on projects urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Overseas Development Administration could improve its management of UK
programme aid to developing countries to ensure greater value for money,
says the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog.
Reporting yesterday on the disbursement of programme aid to four African
countries between 1987 and 1993, the NAO urged the development
administration to consider 'more timely' completion of reports, the setting
of more specific targets and swifter payment of aid to countries meeting
their reform programmes.
Since 1987 the administration has spent Pounds 914m on programme aid, which
is intended to smooth the introduction of economic restructuring programmes
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Most of the aid has gone to Africa.
The NAO examined prog-ramme aid devoted to Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and
Zambia, which between them account-ed for more than half the aid given to
Africa over the six years.
It concluded that new safeguards to ensure better value for money in
procurement spending had achieved only 'mixed' success where governments
were reimbursed with foreign exchange, and needed to be tightened.
According to the office, two-thirds of the aid was not tied to UK or other
suppliers. The Overseas Development Administration believes that the untying
of aid was generally beneficial to the UK 'because British exporters win a
significant share of African business'.
Overall, the NAO concluded that 'no fully satisfactory' method existed for
judging the value of programme aid.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Regulator says auditors should have more freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Auditors should use their judgment in checking financial links between a
company and related parties, and not rely on following a set procedure, the
audit regulator said yesterday.
Draft proposals from the Auditing Practices Board mark a significant shift
away from rigid procedures designed to monitor companies, towards an
approach based on an auditor's experience and skills.
The regulator's recommendation follows strict proposals put forward in March
by the Accounting Standards Board to combat fraud. Several corporate
failures have been found to stem from undisclosed links with related
parties.
The standards board has proposed far-reaching requirements for directors to
disclose related-party transactions which go beyond those listed in
companies legislation.
Related parties would include individuals or companies connected with,
influenced by, or controlled by the company, its pension funds, its
directors, and managers, and their immediate families.
Mr David Lindsell, chairman of the practices board's working party, said
that checking disclosures on related party links in a large company would
lead to a 'huge' increase in audit costs.
He added that the thrust of the proposals did not concern the detection of
fraud, as most companies entered into only legitimate transactions with
related parties. Auditors had to use their judgment in checking the
disclosures and identifying inherent internal risks.
'However,' said Mr Lindsell, 'if the auditor assesses the risk of
undisclosed transactions as high, the proposal provides guidance as to the
procedures that could be followed.'
The practices board hopes that its draft proposal will become a standard,
with the force of law.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Sanctions on jobseekers could stop all benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed people who face penalty sanctions under the government's proposed
Jobseeker's Allowance scheme, to be introduced in April, could lose
unemployment benefit for up to 26 weeks - the whole period of entitlement.
According to a leaked briefing document, jobseekers could be sanctioned for
reasons including leaving a job voluntarily or without just cause, refusing
to work, or failing to attend an interview or mandatory course.
The document, obtained by Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington, says:
'Sanctioned jobseekers will no longer receive (even) reduced rates of
benefit unless they can demonstrate hardship.
'If hardship is demonstrated, 20 per cent or 40 per cent reduction of the
personal allowance will be made, normally after the first two weeks of a
sanction. Most sanctions will be fixed at two weeks, others may last 26
weeks.'
Hardship payments will only be available to people with children, or with
caring responsibilities, or who are pregnant or have a pregnant partner, or
who are sick and disabled or who have a partner who is sick or disabled.
There will be no access to the Social Fund for living expenses for people
who are ineligible for hardship payments.
The document says arrangements have still to be considered fully, but most
unemployed people will need to attend the Jobcentre regularly, generally
every two weeks, to review their search for work.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has estimated the scheme will
mean a Pounds 100m net cut in government spending on unemployment in
1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m each succeeding
year.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Hurd admits he illegally endorsed Pergau aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday acknowledged that he had
illegally endorsed an aid donation of Pounds 216m to help build Malaysia's
Pergau dam, but refused to apologise in the Commons.
In a statement to MPs, Mr Hurd said he would not appeal against a recent
High Court judgment that the Pergau project was 'economically unsound' and
that his endorsement of the donation in 1991 had broken British legislation
on overseas aid.
He also revealed that three other contracts signed under Britain's Aid and
Trade Provision in the past eight years could be deemed illegal given the
judgment.
These were a contract for the Ankara metro in Turkey worth Pounds 22m, a
Pounds 2.3m television studio project in Indonesia and a Pounds 2.9m
contract for flight information facilities in Botswana.
Facing repeated demands from opposition benches for his resignation, Mr Hurd
said future payments for Pergau would come directly out of Treasury reserves
and not the Overseas Development Administration's budget.
He also said that the Pounds 48m which the government must pay to Malaysia
for the project in 1994-95 and 1995-96 would not be matched by commensurate
cuts in ODA funding. This would give the department a surplus to allocate to
other projects.
Outstanding payments for the other three projects will also come from
Treasury reserves to ensure that they fall within the remit of the Overseas
Development and Co-operation Act 1980. The necessary supplementary estimates
are to be laid before parliament.
But Mr Hurd angered Labour MPs when he said the Pounds 24m which the ODA had
spent on Pergau in previous financial years would not be restored to the
department.
Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, who has taken a close interest in
the affair, attacked Mr Hurd. 'What is self-evident to the taxpayer is that
this money was misused,' he said. 'The taxpayer believes that the limited
budget for overseas aid should be used for the proper purpose, and you
should reinstate those funds.'
But Mr Hurd also left open the possibility that the ODA budget would suffer
a serious cut after 1996-97, when the Treasury will have another Pounds 122m
to pay to the Malaysian authorities.
Mr Hurd said that the size of the ODA budget in those years would have to be
set in forthcoming public expenditure rounds. But Treasury officials could
seek drastic reductions in ODA spending in those years to make up for the
increased expenditure incurred by their own contingency fund.
During angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr Hurd refused repeated invitations
from opposition MPs to give a public apology over the issue. Instead, he
insisted that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, had made a
commitment that could not be broken.
'I do not feel penitent at taking a fairly robust view of where the
interests of this country lie,' he said.
However, Sir David Steel accused Mr Hurd and Lady Thatcher of having
'steamrollered' the ODA into the Pergau project.
Mr Hurd said that activities financed by the ODA were 'not in general
vulnerable to the kind of legal challenge brought in the case of Pergau'.

FT  14 DEC 94 / MPs hit at MoD closure plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to close Ministry of Defence stores and cut hundreds of jobs were
fundamentally flawed, unsafe and designed to avoid public scrutiny, the
cross-party Commons Defence Committee said yesterday.
The committee's report says it was 'disturbed' that the ministry had decided
to proceed with a single option to the exclusion of any detailed
consideration of others.
Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, said: 'Clearly, the Defence
Cost Study is fundamentally flawed and there was no proper examination of
the various options.
'It is quite clear from this report that the study was purely to save money
and that there was little account taken of our strategic defence needs.'
The committee's report on plans for naval stores announced in the July 14
Defence Cost Study attacked the lack of consultation documents and the
ministry's refusal to release the actual study report.
'We can only assume from the amount of work which has had to be carried out
subsequently that it was not as full and searching a review as it should
have been,' the committee's report said.
Under the plan, depots at Eaglescliffe in Cleveland and Exeter and Wrangaton
in Devon will be shut, holdings at Devonport and Rosyth cut, and a central
store will be created at Portsmouth, with a northern equivalent at Faslane
on the Clyde.
But the committee's report criticised failure to carry full investment
appraisals of alternative options until after officials gave evidence to it
in October.
'Without the results of that investment appraisal it was unsafe for MoD to
have reached a conclusion,' the committee said.
The committee added that while the procedure by which the conclusion was
reached was fundamentally flawed, the conclusion itself appeared to be
sound.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Call to help long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, highlighted the problem of structural
unemployment in his Budget but failed to provide sufficient resources to
tackle long-term unemployment, the Employment Policy Institute, the
independent think-tank, says in its economic report published today.
The institute says the funding cut for the Training for Work scheme could be
justified by the poor track record of such programmes to get people into
work. But if Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, is serious about
improving training provision, he should conduct a review of adult training
schemes and consult on possible reforms.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Fall in corporate liquidity to 142%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidity of large UK companies worsened in the third quarter of 1994,
the first deterioration in almost two years.
Central Statistical Office figures show that the liquidity of all large
companies - measured by the ratio of total current assets to total current
liabilities - fell from 147 per cent in the second quarter to 142 per cent
in the third.
Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'It is the first
indication that companies are happier with their balance sheets and will now
attempt to take on debt to finance expansion.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Salary upturn seen for managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salary awards for managerial and professional staff averaged 3.4 per cent in
the three months to October compared with 2.7 per cent in the same period
last year, says a report by Incomes Data Services published today, Richard
Donkin writes.
The report, in the December issue of the IDS Management Pay Review, cautions
against interpreting the salary upturn as evidence of new wage inflation. It
says the salary average has been pushed up by the disappearance of pay
freezes for the first time since 1990.
The report also highlights signs in some areas, particularly information
technology, that the recovery is beginning to push up salary awards for
managers and specialists.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Money lenders' 'boys' are women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of money lenders as people who threaten to 'send the boys round'
if payments from their borrowers are not maintained is subverted by a study
published today - at least so far as legal money lending is concerned.
It says that most of the 27,000 agents collecting payments for licensed
money lenders are women working part-time, and that the social aspects of
the work are among the factors attracting them to the job.
The report for the independent Policy Studies Institute suggests that there
are some positive reasons, such as the availability of small loans and
doorstep collection, for using money lenders.
But it also highlights the extremely high annualised percentage rates of
interest - up to 500 per cent - that customers can be charged, partly as a
result of such expensive and time-consuming collection methods.
The study also criticises money lenders who encourage borrowers to take a
further loan automatically when an existing debt had been paid.
It says there are about 3m customers of legal money lenders, most of whom
are women aged between 30 and 60. Most borrowers, it says, find it hard to
repay their loans, with one-third sometimes missing payments and one-third
paying smaller amounts or meeting payments only with difficulty.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Major seeks to calm referendum hysteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday sought to calm speculation about a referendum on
further European integration as Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister,
warned that a plebiscite would not restore voters' confidence in the
government.
Amid growing expectations that the government is moving towards a
referendum, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to put the
government's Budget troubles behind it by pledging a continued tough line on
inflation and public borrowing.
But as the government tried to restore its authority after setbacks on
Europe and value added tax, senior ministers were bracing themselves for a
crushing loss to Labour in the Dudley West by-election tomorrow.
Mr Major, who has hinted repeatedly that the government will promise a
referendum, was asked in the Commons at question time what the criteria
would be for such a vote. Clearly seeking to calm backbench hysteria on the
issue, he told MPs: 'I am not prepared to close the door to the possibility
of a referendum, but equally there are very important constitutional matters
to be considered, and it would be very unwise to make snap judgments.'
Mr Major said it was extremely difficult in advance of the 1996
inter-governmental conference of European Union heads of government 'to know
precisely what the question might be in a referendum'.
Sir Edward, a fervent pro-European, warned on BBC Radio that promising a
referendum would not solve the government's problems with Eurosceptic Tory
MPs, and could spark a run on sterling. Voters were demanding a referendum
because they had lost confidence in the government and parliament. He added:
'The way to deal with it is for the government to regain its authority, and
for parliament to show it does know how to behave.'
Mr Clarke, opening a debate on last week's mini-Budget, said that confidence
in the government's stewardship of the economy had been maintained by his
prompt action in raising interest rates and proposing higher taxes on fuel,
cigarettes and alcohol after the government's plans to increase VAT on
heating fuel were defeated.
He acknowledged fears that the raised duty on alcohol would reduce sales and
employment but promised tough negotiations with other EU countries to
achieve an 'approximation' of duties throughout the EU.
The scale of the task was underlined by Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington
and chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, who said that
other countries could not be expected to increase the duties they levied.
He said: 'At some stage you will have to reduce our duty.'
Mr Clarke answered: 'That may be so. But I do not wish to anticipate our
negotiating position.' He promised to strengthen the measures already in
place to counter the activities of those smuggling alcohol and tobacco into
Britain.
He said it was estimated that the loss of duty resulting from goods being
smuggled across the English Channel amounted to Pounds 65m a year. He
suggested that there was a case for seeking the approximation of tobacco
duty in the EU.
Mr Clarke added that the government had no intention of extending VAT to
categories of goods now subject to the zero rate 'without primary
legislation'.
MPs approved the mini-Budget changes in a series of votes at the end of the
debate.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Role of industrial tribunals called to account: Richard
Wolffe looks at the pressure for reform as the system's caseloads and costs
jump to record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is today expected to announce proposals to reform the
industrial tribunal system, which has been criticised by businesses and
unions alike.
The proposals, which follow an eight-month review, aim to improve the
efficiency of a system in which the number of cases has increased by 150 per
cent over the past five years. Tribunals dealt with a record 73,000 cases
last year on 60 types of claim, from race discrimination to unfair
dismissal.
The government has become increasingly concerned at the costs of tribunals,
whose budget since 1988 has risen by 75 per cent to Pounds 26.6m this year.
Launching the review in April, Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister,
said the government would 'review the operation of the industrial tribunals
with a view to identifying any changes which would help them to cope with an
increasing volume and complexity of cases and reduce delays, while
containing demands on public expenditure'.
Her announcement came just three weeks after a tribunal awarded record
compensation of Pounds 300,000 to an army major who was forced to give up
her career when she became pregnant.
The case, which paved the way for a series of armed service claims worth an
estimated Pounds 100m, highlighted the increasing powers exercised by
tribunals. The compensation followed last year's decision by the European
Court of Justice to remove the ceiling on awards in sex and race
discrimination cases.
Originally designed to deal with appeals against the training levy in 1964,
tribunals have grown in response to a mountain of employment law. The 1971
Industrial Relations Act gave tribunals jurisdiction over unfair dismissal
claims, and the caseload expanded again under the 1986 Wages Act. More
recently the government transferred contractual disputes in England and
Wales from the county courts to industrial tribunals.
The growth in employment law has undermined the informal nature of the
industrial tribunal, which is led by a panel of two lay members sitting
beside a legally trained chairman. One in three employers and one in five
applicants are now legally represented at tribunal hearings, although legal
aid is not available.
The Confederation of British Industry said: 'The whole process could be
speeded up and made more efficient, but we would not want to see an increase
in legalism. The informal structure would tend to permit less delay in most
cases.'
The CBI is calling for tribunal chairmen to hear more cases on their own,
without the help of lay members. At the moment chairmen have the power to
sit alone in cases which revolve around legal issues.
However, the TUC argues that lay members have essential experience of the
workplace, particularly in cases of sex and race discrimination.
Mrs Sarah Veale, senior policy officer, said: 'Industrial tribunals should
not resemble the labour courts on the Continent. We are rather saddened to
see the use of lawyers, particularly by employers.'
The huge compensation awards to former servicewomen also highlight the legal
anomalies in the tribunal system. While there is no limit to discrimination
awards, the maximum compensation for unfair dismissal remains at just Pounds
11,000.
Mrs Janet Gaymer, chairman of the Law Society's employment law committee,
said: 'We have been saying for a long time that it is totally illogical that
you can have a limit on the amount of awards on an unfair dismissal and none
on sex and race discrimination.'
One of the options open to the government is to expand the role of Acas, the
conciliation service, which attempts to reach a compromise in all tribunal
cases. However the proportion of cases resolved by Acas has fallen over the
last five years from 58 per cent to 33 per cent. More than two thirds of
Acas resources are now committed to individual conciliations.
Another option is to prune administrative costs by taking a stricter line on
delays. However, employment lawyers fear further efficiencies will ignore
the logistical difficulties of mounting a case.
Mrs Gaymer said: 'A lot of the backlog of cases has reduced recently because
of vigorous listing pol-icies.
'The concern that employment lawyers have is that tribunals are ignoring the
requirements of both parties to a very large extent, over whether their
representatives can attend or not.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Construction industry suffers big fall in orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a significant improvement in demand for construction work this
year are waning as official statistics released today show building activity
tapering off.
Department of the Environment figures indicate that activity in the public
sector plummeted in the third quarter, with the housing and infrastructure
sectors showing big falls in orders compared with last year. Contractors
believe this signals an end to the upward trend in order levels seen in the
past year.
The future does not look much brighter. Mr Christopher Vickers, construction
spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said cuts in the
roads programme and the chancellor's over-reliance on the private finance
initiative would do little to maintain workload levels in the public sector
next year.
Statistics showed that, at constant 1990 prices, public housing and housing
association orders in the third quarter were 24 per cent lower than in the
previous three months and 36 per cent lower than in the comparable period
last year.
Infrastructure orders fell 33 per cent compared with the previous three
months and 39 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
This was offset by a steady rise in orders for new work in the private
commercial and industrial sectors. The total volume of new orders was 1 per
cent higher than the previous three months but 1 per cent lower than a year
ago.
The slowdown in orders has not yet filtered through to building material
producers, and figures released yesterday by the institution show that
building prices were 11 per cent higher than a year ago.
The organisation estimated that building prices across the country rose 3.4
per cent in the three months to the end of September. Prices were expected
to rise 5.6 per cent in the next 12 months and 4.5 per cent the following
year.
Mr Vickers said tender prices had reacted to the rising costs of site
labour, materials and sub-contractors. He thought that in the short term
increases in input costs, particularly labour, would fuel further prices
rises.
Mr Vickers believed, however, that by the end of the year the situation
would change and there would be an easing of tender price inflation.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Ban for Tory aides caught in Blair office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Security at Mr Tony Blair's Westminster office was being tightened yesterday
after two Conservative aides caught on the premises by staff were banned
from the Commons for seven weeks.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ordered the removal of security passes
issued to the aides - researchers for Mr David Atkinson, Tory MP for
Bournemouth East - after a police inquiry into their intrusion into Mr
Blair's office on Friday evening.
Miss Boothroyd said the inquiry had concluded that the researchers 'abused
the privilege' of access to the Commons, but there was 'no malice' in the
incident, which reflected 'an excess of seasonal spirits'.
The inquiry was set up by Sir Alan Urwick, the Commons Serjeant at Arms,
after the two aides and a friend with a day pass were discovered by Ms Sue
Jackson, Mr Blair's head of administration, who heard laughter coming from
his office.
One of the researchers, Mr Andrew Hull, said they had lost their way in the
Commons' labyrinthine corridors while returning from a social engagement. He
wrote to Mr Blair yesterday, apologising for the incident.
Mr Atkinson said the explanation given to him coincided with Miss
Boothroyd's judgment that no malice was involved. He said he would consider
Mr Hull's future, but would probably regard his suspension as sufficient
punishment.
Mr Blair, campaigning in Dudley West for tomorrow's by-election, said he was
'concerned' about the incident, and revealed that his staff were checking
papers to make sure that nothing had been removed from his office.
Labour MPs claimed that the incident was an attempt to acquire sensitive
information from Mr Blair's office. Some linked it with a leaked memo to the
prime minister from Mr John Maples, a Conservative party vice-chairman,
urging an aggressive approach to Labour.
'There is feeling on the Labour benches this is a sort of minor
'Westminstergate' - a deliberate attempt to find out information
unofficially from the opposition leader's office,' said Mr David Winnick,
Labour MP for Walsall South.
Ms Hilary Armstrong, a former aide to the late John Smith, said it was
'difficult to give credibility' to Mr Hull's explanation. 'It is an office
which is away from the main area of the Commons. There is a long corridor
leading to it, and 'Leader of the Opposition' is emblazoned above the door
that leads into the suite of offices,' she told BBC Radio.
Other Labour MPs called for tighter controls on researchers, whose numbers
have increased greatly in recent years in spite of attempts by the Commons
authorities to impose limits.
Some MPs have employed as many as five unpaid or poorly paid researchers at
a time. Many are politics students - often from the US - eager to gain
experience for academic purposes or as the foundation for a political
career.
Earlier complaints prompted a limit of one researcher for most backbench
MPs, but senior backbenchers and frontbenchers are allowed two or more, by
negotiation with the Commons authorities.
As a result, several hundred researchers have privileged access to the
Commons, including areas such as the library, closed to most other
passholders except MPs themselves.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Contractors to manage Scottish roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Office plans to put the management of Scotland's motorways and
main dual carriageways into the hands of private contractors by early 1996,
in what it sees as a big step towards a private-sector road management
industry.
Three groups of roads are likely to be offered under five-year contracts
each likely to be worth Pounds 25m to Pounds 35m.
The remaining 70 per cent of Scotland's trunk road network is to be divided
into five geographical units. A managing agent will be appointed for each
unit to co-ordinate the work of local councils for routine and winter
maintenance.
The managing agent might be a private company or a lead local authority
appointed by the councils. The arrangement would be reviewed after three
years. Roads would be managed under contracts agreed with the Scottish
Office and monitored by an audit unit.
The new arrangements have to come into effect by April 1 1996, when the nine
regional councils which maintain trunk roads and motorways on behalf of the
Scottish Office are abolished and replaced by 28 single-tier councils.
The government believes that the new councils will be too small to manage
parts of the trunk road network and is taking the opportunity to involve the
private sector in road management  - an element in the government's private
finance initiative.
In England local government reform is less advanced and only four roads have
been proposed for contracts that include designing, building and financing
them.
The new arrangements, set out in a consultation document, do not cover the
southern stretches of the M74 motorway. Here the Scottish Office hopes to
reach agreement with a consortium which would design, build, finance and
operate the remaining stretches of the motorway and manage 100km of road
between Carlisle and Abington, Lanarkshire, for 15 to 20 years.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Ofwat critical of bigger suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the 10 big water and sewerage companies fell short of the level of
service customers could reasonably expect in at least one of seven areas
measured by Ofwat, the industry regulator said yesterday.
Of the three  - Anglian, Thames and Yorkshire  - Thames's performance was
the poorest, scoring 'good' marks in only one area of service where the
companies were directly comparable and 'below' or 'well below' average in
the other three.
Ofwat's findings are likely to stoke criticism of the big water and sewerage
concerns, privatised in 1989. Virtually all have since been pilloried for
their high profits and the big salary increases awarded to senior
executives.
Ofwat said smaller water companies, particularly those concentrating on
drinking water, had the highest standards of service in 1993-94.
The highest accolades went to South Staffordshire and York Waterworks, two
'water only' groups. Both performed particularly well in the four measures
of service where the companies were directly comparable.
Five companies  - Southern, Bristol, Hartlepool, Mid Southern, and Sutton
District, performed well. All except Southern are 'water only' concerns.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Tony Blair confident of easy Labour victory in Dudley West
by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, canvassed support yesterday in the Dudley
West by-election amid reports that his party is cruising to an easy victory,
Paul Cheeseright writes.
The Conservatives are more than 55 points behind Labour, a poll of 635
voters carried out by the Evening Mail of Birmingham on Friday and Saturday
found. The poll puts Labour on 71.02 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives
on 15.93 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 11.06 per cent. Nearly 53 per
cent of those polled thought their lives had worsened over the last 15
years. More than 51 per cent considered they and their families would be
better off under Labour. Nearly 54 per cent thought Mr Blair would be the
best prime minister. Mr John Major's approval rating was 16.38 per cent.
Dudley West has been held by the Conservatives since 1979. The by-election
follows the death of Dr John Blackburn who had a majority of 5,789 at the
1992 election, a lead of 8.1 per cent over Labour.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: The price of 'fast-track' - Nancy Dunne on
the negotiating trap for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton received two letters last week illustrating the gulf
between lofty free trade goals and political reality.
One was sent by the new House Republican leadership. It supported renewing
the president's 'fast-track' negotiating authority - under which Congress
undertakes either to pass or reject trade pact negotiations without
amendment. The president needs that authority to pursue new trade pacts,
such as that - announced at the Summit of the Americas at the weekend - to
include Chile in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and
Mexico.
However, Republican support for fast-track has a price: any thought of
negotiating side pacts on labour and the environment, similar to the pacts
in Nafta with Canada and Mexico must be abandoned, the letter said.
The second letter to Mr Clinton came from Congressman Richard Gephardt, the
Democratic leader in the House. 'We need to ensure that our policies are not
simply viewed by the public as promoting the interests of multinational
corporations at the expense of our workers,' he wrote. 'A broad coalition'
for passage of fast-track can be found within the Democratic party he said,
but 'we must not allow Republicans to treat workers rights and environmental
issues as back-seat issues.'
Mr Clinton faced a similar bind in his 1992 election campaign when he was
forced to take a stand on Nafta. His solution was to promise to negotiate
'side pacts' on labour and environment to discourage US companies from
moving production to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labour or
non-enforcement of environmental rules.
After the 1992 election, negotiations over the labour pact ran into
difficulty and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, eventually
settled for a deal which stressed co-operation and consultation and permits
sanctions only in rare cases after the completion of a complicated
complaints process.
'Lewis Carroll, working with Franz Kafka, could hardly have devised a
process more surreal,' said the Institute for Policy Studies.
Complaints go first to National Administrative Offices (NAOs) in each of the
three countries. They can then be referred on through a variety of
trilateral councils, committees and arbitration panels that could take more
than three years.
At the end, the offending party may be fined up to Dollars 20m either in
cash or trade concessions withdrawn. Funds collected would be repaid to the
offending country to enable it to take corrective action.
Thus far, no case has passed the first step. The NAO in Washington has
received four complaints, held hearings on two, and refused to take further
action on those.
To American trade unionists, such as Mr Chris Townsend, of the United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the process is 'a sham'.
But to Republicans, it is a threat to the future of free trade deals.
President Clinton will request fast-track authority as soon as Congress
convenes in January. He could probably win it with the support of the
Republican majority by de-linking labour and the environment from any trade
negotiations.
But if he does so he will create a rift with congressional liberals who are,
at best, unenthusiastic about his re-election in 1996.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Australia coal plan 'high-risk'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The creation of a national coal marketing board to offset the negotiating
tactics of Japanese buyers was yesterday described as an inappropriate and
'high-risk' strategy by a report into Australia's coal industry.
Mr Rae Taylor, a former civil servant, was called in to review the coal
sector after the last annual round of coal price negotiations between
Australian producers and Japanese buyers. In the 1993-94 round, Australia
accepted price cuts for the fourth successive year, provoking two national
strikes by miners and costing the industry hundreds of millions of dollars
in lost production.
Coal is Australia's largest single export, and the country is the world's
biggest coal exporter. More than 40 per cent of Australian exports go to
Japan and the annual Australia-Japan negotiations serve as an international
price-setting mechanism.
In submissions to the Taylor inquiry, coal unions argued that since the
Japanese buyers were in effect working as a cartel, Australian producers
should also negotiate collectively. However, Mr Taylor said such a move
could jeopardise the significant coal trade between Australia and Japan and
added there was no conclusive evidence that Japanese buyers' practices had
been detrimental. 'Under existing arrangements, the Australian industry has
achieved significant growth and a high market share,' he said.
In wide range of conclusions, he suggested that there was scope for
improving 'price transparency' and export control administration, and for
achieving efficiencies in transportation both on the rail and shipping
fronts. Another area highlighted for reform was industrial relations, where
he urged devolved enterprise-based wage-bargaining. He also recommended
efforts to develop export market diversification over the medium to long
term  - with markets such as India, China, Thailand, the Philippines and
Pakistan being identifiable targets.
The findings will be discussed at the Australian Coal Industry Council, a
tripartite body involving unions, companies and federal government, on
Sunday. However, the initial response from employers and unions yesterday
was cautious.
The Australian Coal Association said the study was 'forward-looking' and the
industry needed to concentrate on making the sector more competitive. The
mineworkers union said Mr Taylor had not gone far enough, noting that on
pricing 'the report doesn't say that the union's goals are wrong  - only
that the union's approach is high-risk'.

Wintershall, the gas subsidiary of BASF, Germany's largest chemical group,
will today sign a joint venture with Romgaz, the state-owned Romanian gas
company, in an attempt to tap the country's growing gas sector. Wintershall,
which has tried to break the Ruhrgas gas monopoly in Germany, will import
and sell Russian gas on the Romanian market. Romania, which is dependent on
Russian gas deliveries, imports about 3bn cubic metres of gas a year.
Although oil is Romania's primary energy source, Wintershall believes that
gas will become a competitor for environmental and cost reasons. Wintershall
has been seeking markets in eastern Europe for some time. It has a 5 per
cent stake in Europol, the Polish state-owned gas company.

<TEXT>
Dornier, the subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), will supply 20 Dornier
328 turbo-prop aircraft to a regional US airline, the second biggest
delivery since the aircraft was launched last year. The order is a
significant coup for Dornier as major orders on the international aviation
market are relatively scarce. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chief executive,
said: 'With the second big client we have finally managed the breakthrough
on the hotly contested US market.'
Jetstream International Airlines, the Ohio-based operator which has placed
the order, has an option for a further 20 aircraft. Dornier's biggest order
to date came from Horizon Air, a Seattle-based operator which placed 20 firm
orders and 40 options. Dasa did not disclose the value of the order. The
Dornier 328 has a list price of Dollars 9m, can seat 33 passengers and is,
with a top speed of 620kmh, the fastest aircraft in its class, Dasa said.
Saab, Bombardier, British Aerospace and Embraer, the Brazilian group, are
the 328's main competitors.
Air Engiadina, a Swiss operator, placed the first order for the 328 in
October last year. Since then Dornier has sold the aircraft to clients in
the US, Taiwan, Nigeria and India. Dornier now has 72 firm orders and a
further 71 options from 16 clients.

<TEXT>
The European Commission and the US have begun informal talks on the higher
import duties resulting from enlargement of the European Union. In a bid to
avert a dispute, both sides have agreed to find an interim solution to
losses facing the US when higher tariffs come into effect as a result of
Finland, Sweden and Austria formally joining the EU early next year.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, last week threatened retaliation
if the two sides failed to reach immediate agreement on an interim
compensation package. The US subsequently agreed to proceed with formal
talks early in the new year.
The negotiations are part of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt)
procedures and are triggered by the enlargement of any common market, but it
is the first time an interim solution has been sought. Commission officials
said the EU would seek an agreement on measures to be applied for six months
pending a permanent deal.
Already differences have emerged on calculating compensation. 'We have to
try to make a qualitative assessment off how to offset decreases against
increases,' a Commission official said.
However, the US has interpreted Gatt rules to mean that the EU is required
to offset each individual tariff increase. Both sides have also yet to agree
the period over which the tariff changes are calculated. The US has said
sectors such as electronics, forest products, chemicals and agricultural
products would be adversely affected by EU enlargement. US trade with the EU
and its three new members totalled Ecu7bn (Dollars 8.9bn) in 1993, of which
8 per cent was with Austria, Sweden and Finland. Commission officials said
that less than 10 per cent of total US trade with EU members would be
affected.

FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Biotech sector urged to seek partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biotechnology companies should abandon hope of becoming large
pharmaceuticals companies and concentrate on becoming niche players with
links to big partners, a Financial Times conference on biotechnology heard
yesterday, writes Daniel Green.
The sector had been through a difficult year in terms of investment said Mr
Frank Baldino, chief executive of US biotechnology company Cephalon. This
was because the successes of companies such as Amgen and Genentech had not
been repeated since the early 1990s. He said each biotechnological advance
added to the risks and newer companies therefore faced greater risks than
their predecessors. 'Biotechnology companies should define themselves not on
a technology but on a corporate and marketing strategy and therefore
companies should spread the risk at the research stage,' he said.
Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive of UK biotechnology company Celltech,
warned delegates in London that 'equity capital (alone) cannot fund the
industry'. 'Most biotechnology companies,' he said, 'would need marriages of
convenience' with pharmaceuticals industry partners.
The loss of potential profits when biotech companies dealt with
pharmaceuticals companies could be minimised through 'many devices', such as
giving rights in some geographic areas but retaining rights elsewhere, he
said. His company has a series of partnerships with pharmaceuticals
companies but 'retains 25 per cent to 45 per cent on the net profit'.
Large pharmaceuticals companies could benefit too from such partnerships,
said Mr John Keller, associate director, technology evaluation at SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals.
He said that the pharmaceuticals industry was being hurt by downward
pressure on prices from customers in government and the private sector, and
the expiry of patents on many of its best-selling drugs.
The industry's response included mergers with rivals, buying
over-the-counter (non-prescription) medicines businesses, and signing deals
with biotechnology companies whose research expertise supplemented the
pharmaceuticals companies' own development pipelines.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Japan's grey army captures niche market: Elderly consumers'
preferences range from anti-wrinkle cream to books on dying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growing army of ageing Japanese represents an important new consumer
market, according to Dentsu, the country's largest advertising agency.
The grey wave has, over the past year, become a lucrative opportunity for
sellers of cosmetics, life assurance and books about death, on the evidence
of the agency's annual survey of hit products, a revealing barometer of
Japan's changing public tastes. It is likely to be a long-term trend, as
Japan has the world's fastest ageing population profile, with more than one
in four destined to be older than 65 by the year 2020.
Examples of grey wave winners include cosmetic group Shiseido's new
anti-wrinkle liquid, of which it has sold 1.5m bottles in its first year
after launch. This is double Shiseido's initial projection, partly because
Wrinkelift Essence has also sold surprisingly well among skin-conscious
mid-20 year olds. Cures for baldness, an affliction that dogs an estimated
15m Japanese, represents another fast growing market, in every sense.
In tune with the Japanese love of long-term planning, many are preparing now
for the end. Books about dying are experiencing a revival, showing 'a
greater desire to learn how to live and how to die,' says Dentsu. The most
popular, Peaceful Death, by radio commentator Rokusuke Ei and published in
March, has sold more than 1m copies.
To ensure consumers can afford to keep spending all the way to the grave,
Japanese life assurers have offered a new policy that pays out six months
before death, on presentation of a doctor's certificate. Sales are estimated
to have reached 1m in the first half of the year alone.
Nostalgia, meanwhile, is running high among young and old alike, which
Dentsu attributes to a backlash against the technological sophistication of
the 1990s. Space Invaders, one of the first computer games, is making a
comeback 16 years after its launch. Taito, its maker, has sold 300,000
copies this year in the original black and white format and has increased
its target to 1m, says Dentsu. Buyers range from young families up to the
grey wave.
The products that have made a hit over the past year indicate that Japanese
consumers crave familiarity in what they buy, perhaps a mark of the shock
inflicted by the worst recession since the second world war. The innovations
to have made Dentsu's 1994 list are, revealingly, improvements on old ideas.
There is a wrinkle-free shirt, made from a fabric that remembers its
pristine shape, and a white swimsuit designed not to go transparent when
wet.
Bargains continue to be as popular as they were in the midst of the
downturn, but this year the focus has shifted to imports, cheapened by the
rise in the yen's value. Car imports rose by nearly 46 per cent in the first
nine months of the year, led by Japanese models made abroad and followed by
German and US vehicles. Drinks were the other beneficiary of the import
boom, helped by the hottest summer for years. One of the biggest winners was
US cola, on supermarket shelves at a mere Y39 (24p) a can.
Consumers were slightly more prepared to buy luxuries in 1994 than they were
in 1993. But truly extravagant gestures such as seen in the heady late 1980s
are now absent, mourns Dentsu. So the best-selling expensive products have
made a point of offering value for money.
Dentsu's top product in this category is the silent electronic piano, which
can be played through earphones. The hard-pressed piano industry is pinning
hopes for a revival on it. This is a boon to families with musical children
 -80 per cent of the silent piano market - living in cramped apartments. It
allows their parents to grow old in peace, perhaps dozing in front of
another 1994 hit product, the wide-screen television.

Japan's trade minister has attacked a central bank-led rescue of two
troubled credit companies in remarks which analysts said reflected concern
about using public funds to bail out financial institutions. 'If I had been
told about the recent rescue package before the announcement, I would not
have agreed to that,' Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto (left), minister of international
trade and industry, told a news conference. The Bank of Japan, in its first
such emergency bail-out of private lending institutions, announced on Friday
that it would join private banks to set up a bank to rescue two ailing
credit companies saddled with bad loans - the bulk inherited from the
bursting of the nation's late 1980s 'bubble' economy. The central bank said
the Tokyo-based institutions, Anzen Credit Bank and Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association, had total bad assets of Y100bn (Pounds 641m).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of the New Frontier party, Japan's new political opposition
alliance, has made little impact on voters, according to a poll published
yesterday. A telephone survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the economic
newspaper, found that a mere 14.8 per cent supported the NFP. The survey of
1,500 people was carried out in the 24 hours after the NFP's launch on
Saturday. One explanation for the NFP's low rating, offered by the
newspaper, is that voters find little new in its leaders, Mr Toshiki Kaifu,
a former Liberal Democratic party prime minister, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, an
influential political strategist. The pair made voters feel as if time had
been reversed, a Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorial said. It argued that the
nine political parties which merged to form the NFP did so primarily to
improve their chances under a new electoral system to take effect on
December 25, and lacked a clear message. The NFP's low popularity score may
also equally reflect a general ebb in public interest in politics, after
three confusing changes of government in the past 18 months.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Ethiopia's former rulers on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethiopia's former Marxist rulers were put on trial yesterday, charged with
genocide and crimes against humanity during a 17-year dictatorship which
ended with the overthrow of Col Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. It is the
first time an African government has attempted to make a former regime
accountable for human rights violations, and its conduct may provide a model
for nations such as Rwanda and Liberia.
Col Mengistu, who lives in exile in Zimbabwe, and 20 officers of his
military junta are being tried in absentia. Attempts by the transitional
government to obtain their extradition have failed as the accused face the
death penalty if found guilty. The 45 former officials who appeared before
the central High Court in Addis Ababa yesterday were charged with ordering
the killings and disappearances of more than 2,000 identified people. From
1974 to 1991 tens of thousands of Ethiopians were murdered, tortured or
disappeared.

Thailand's agriculture minister resigned yesterday, averting a no-confidence
motion that could have shaken the government days after defection of the New
Aspiration party in the ruling coalition. The opposition had planned to call
a no-confidence motion today against the minister, Mr Niphon Promphan, and
his former deputy, Mr Suthep Thueksuban, because of allegations that Mr
Suthep had manipulated a land reform programme to favour rich landowners. Mr
Niphon submitted his resignation to Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, to
take responsibility for the scandal threatening to taint the government and
Mr Chuan's Democrat party. Mr Niphon and Mr Suthep, members of the Democrat
party, insist they are innocent. Mr Suthep resigned as deputy agriculture
minister last week, saying it would allow him to defend his actions without
being accused of trying to cling to his position.

<TEXT>
The Philippines yesterday won International Monetary Fund approval for a
request to raise ceilings on monetary growth while keeping its programme for
economic expansion on track. The agreement removes a big obstacle in the
current IMF review of the country's compliance with economic performance
targets to enable it to draw the second tranche of the Dollars 648m (Pounds
415m) credit support for the economic programme.
A visiting IMF technical team had initially rejected the Philippine debt
negotiators' request, which led Mr Cielito Habito, the socio-economic
planning secretary, to remark that Manila should abandon the Fund's
programme if the new monetary target was not allowed. The threat was
contradicted later by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, who
insisted the IMF programme was still needed. Under the programme, base money
(money held by banks and the public plus banks' deposits with the central
bank) is to grow by 13 per cent next year to about 3.5 per cent of GNP. The
Philippines asked that the growth rate be allowed to increase to 16 per
cent.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Dash to dam the Mekong raises ecology fears: William Barnes
on the environmental cost of plans to control flooding and generate power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creeping up on the millions of people who draw sustenance from the Mekong
river is the threat of a dash to dam and exploit one of the world's longest
rivers.
Last month Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos agreed to resurrect their
long-dormant Mekong oversight committee. The agreement  - brokered by the
United Nations Development Programme  - breathes new life into decades-old
plans to develop the Mekong Basin that were frozen by more than two decades
of warfare and ideological turmoil in Indochina.
There is only a handful of tributary dams in the upper and middle reaches of
the river. Now Laos alone is proposing to build 58 dams by the year 2020,
mostly to feed voracious demand for energy in neighbouring Thailand and
eventually Vietnam.
Mr Kithong Vongsay, chairman of the Lao National Mekong Committee, says the
whole of the lower Mekong area could generate 37,000MW of electricity, of
which Laos could account for 18,000MW. The country's two main dams produce
210MW and are already its biggest foreign exchange earner. Thailand, which
also wants to irrigate its arid north-east, has virtually run out of dam
sites because of local opposition to environmental destruction.
'This is a modern agreement, a pragmatic agreement,' says Mr Prathet
Sutabutr, director of Thailand's department of energy development and
co-operation. 'Each country will have the right to do what they think is
justified in their own territory.' One US banker in the region says the work
will be a 'bonanza' for construction companies, bankers and water engineers.
But environmental groups say Mekong projects often ignore the fragile
ecology of a region fed by a river which descends from the snowy Tibetan
plateau to the warm waters of the Vietnam Delta.
In the 1940s US engineers, fresh from numerous 'big dam' projects in north
America, first laid plans for a cascade of 'multi-purpose' dams along the
river for electricity, flood control, irrigation and improved river
transport.
Then, as now, would-be dam builders who cite their ability to 'control' the
Mekong's annual flooding frequently omit to mention that the flooding is
part of a complex cycle of natural activity.
The Mekong's watersheds receive hardly any rain in the early months of the
year allowing salt water from the South China Sea to penetrate 500km inland,
as far as the middle of Cambodia. But monsoon rains transform the Mekong in
May. The water flow into the Vietnam delta increases 30-fold and certain
stretches of the river can rise by as much as a six-storey building.
The annual reversal of the flow of water back into Cambodia's economic
heart, the Tonle Sap lake, is unique and important fueling one of the
world's most productive fresh-water fish industries.
Ecologists say that 90 per cent of the fish in the Mekong basin spawn not in
the river but in submerged forests and fields. Among the many complex
arguments against rapid development is that dams which hold back silt might
decrease downstream fertility, risk increasing incursions of salt water and
worsen flooding.
'Still waters run dead,' says Mr Tyson Roberts, a specialist in freshwater
fish from the University of California. 'The people who live above or below
dams almost never benefit. But the worst dangers from dams can be
downstream: it is quite possible to imagine the Mekong Delta itself
(Vietnam's rice bowl) being eroded away.'
Mr Roy Morey, the United Nations Development Programme's resident
representative in Hanoi, says the new co-operation agreement  - which will
be signed early next year  - is an improvement on the old one. 'For the
first time the members have an avenue of appeal. Any arguments not resolved
in the joint working committee can be sent to a policy-making council  -
there was never anything resembling a council before.'
Yet, says Mr Vitoon Permpongsacharoen, general secretary of the Project for
Ecological Recovery in Bangkok, the new agreement weakens the old rule that
member countries could veto projects that diverted or dammed the river and
its main tributaries.
The new agreement requires majority approval, at council level, only for
projects that divert water out of the Mekong basin during the dry season.
'The purpose of this exercise is to legitimise dam building  - there's
hardly any talk about people participation or about studying the ecological
impact,' says Mr Vitoon.
The reason wary downstream countries such as Vietnam have agreed this change
can be partly explained by looking north to where China has quietly built
the 1500MW Manwan dam. This is only one of more than a dozen dams the
Chinese  - who are not on the committee  - are planning to build on the
Mekong to spur the development of a region that has lagged behind the
economic boom along China's coastal region.
Faced with the possibility of a free-for-all involving powerful neighbours,
some downstream countries have decided that some means of consultation and
appeal is better than nothing. 'It was a good political decision,' says Mr
Mok Mareth, Cambodia's secretary for state for the environment.
Two decades ago an early critic of exploitation of the Mekong, Mr John
Milton, observed: 'No real effort has been made to consult the people
affected. . . no one asked those 20m or 30m people about their needs and
problems or asked them what they wanted. . . . The assumption had long been
made that those dams were going to be built; the only questions were how
many, where and how.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Strong growth challenges NZ governor's inflation contract:
Terry Hall on the struggle to keep price rises below 2 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Brash, governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, is grappling with
the challenge of holding inflation below 2 per cent without stifling growth
in an economy that is showing one of the strongest recoveries in the
developed world.
He operates under a statutory contract that puts him in charge of monetary
policy under strict inflation parameters. These stipulate that he must not
let inflation rise above 2 per cent.
Mr Brash's immediate challenge is what to do about the strength of the
recovery, with growth in gross domestic product running at 6.1 per cent,
arousing fears that the economy could overheat. This would tip it, in his
words, 'away from sustained growth to the boom-bust cycle New Zealand has
endured in the past'.
Outlining his concerns yesterday in the central bank's economic statement,
he said that the rise in interest rates by around a percentage point over
the past fortnight had been warranted. Mr Brash said this had allowed the
bank to lower its estimates of underlying inflation. It now expected
underlying inflation to peak at 1.7 per cent early next year, and drop to
1.4 per cent by early 1996.
However, he warned that the bank would act at the first sign that underlying
inflation might exceed 2 per cent. Mr Brash made clear he was happy that the
financial markets had taken the hint in late November that the Reserve Bank
would tolerate higher interest rates by pushing market rates higher.
Mr Brash's handling of monetary policy is under intense scrutiny. He agrees
that his powers have not been tested through a full economic cycle since the
passing of the Reserve Bank Act in 1989 which stipulates the terms of his
inflation-beating contract. A drawn-out recession in the first few years of
the decade helped the bank bring inflation below 2 per cent.
However, critics say the Reserve Bank Act's inflationary parameters are too
restrictive. As soon as the economy starts to show worthwhile growth, they
say, the Reserve Bank is forced to tighten the monetary screws, putting
growth at risk.
Mr Brash's particular concern is inflationary expectations. The consumer
price index is forecast to rise to more than 4 per cent next year.
Mr Brash's statement yesterday that he wanted monetary conditions to stay
'firm' gave the green light to mortgage rate rises by around 1.5 points to
11 per cent with similar rises in business borrowing costs. These would be
in line with increases in short-term rates.
Mr Brash is receiving ample advice on how to do his job. Critics such as Mr
Gareth Morgan, a private forecaster, say he should have applied the brakes
earlier this year when it was apparent that the economy was performing
strongly. However, others say that if he had acted earlier it might have cut
off the recovery before it took hold.
Mr Brash said yesterday that he would not know if he had been right until
next year as lags in the economy made it difficult to judge the impact of
any decision.
There are ample signs of resurgent inflation. The Reserve Bank's survey last
month showed house owners expected inflation of 4.4 per cent next August.
There has also been a sharp lift in retail sales, new house approvals, car
sales, and private sector credit.
Prices of homes, especially in Auckland, have risen strongly, helped by
rising numbers of wealthy Asian migrants. The Reserve Bank is concerned at
growing skills shortages in the labour force, which could lead to higher
wage demands.
Other signs of growth include a drop in unemployment to 7.5 per cent from
9.5 per cent in 1993 and 10.3 per cent the two previous years.
Adding to the problems faced by the Reserve Bank has been a sharp rise in
the value of the New Zealand dollar, up 1.5 cents against a trade-weighted
basket of currencies. This has also helped reduce inflationary pressures in
an economy heavily dependent on imports.

The threat, however, was contradicted later by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor
of the central bank, who insisted that the IMF programme was still needed by
the country. Mr Singson is head of the negotiating panel with the IMF.
Under the programme, approved only in June, base money (money held by banks
and the public plus banks' deposits with the central bank) is to grow by 13
per cent next year to about 3.5 per cent of gross national product.
The Philippines asked that the growth rate be allowed to increase to 16 per
cent, because of a recent surge in base money levels which was traced to
increased levels of foreign exchange flows into the country. following the
improved investment climate.
Philippine officials are confident that the economy could grow by up to 6.5
per cent next year, against 5 per cent earlier projected. This year the
growth rate is forecast at about 5.5 per cent  - the best since 1989  -
compared with the target of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent under the IMF programme.
So far, growth has been bolstered by strong investment and exports, although
independent economists fear that a large trade deficit, if unchecked, could
derail this.
The IMF mission ends its visit on Friday.

FT  14 DEC 94 / 'Big increase' predicted in New Zealand's fiscal '94 budget
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Our Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's high growth rate will lead to 'a big increase' in the
NZDollars 1.28bn (Pounds 520m) budget surplus forecast for the current
fiscal year by the government as recently as June, Mr Bill Birch, finance
minister, said yesterday, Peter Montagnon, our Asia Editor, reports.
Small increases can also be expected in the surpluses of NZDollars 3.1bn and
NZDollars 5bn forecast for the two following years to June 1996 and 1997.
Growth had boosted tax revenues and reduced welfare payments, he said. 'I
share the opinion that continued fiscal discipline is essential to
maintaining low inflation and strong growth,' he added.
The government would maintain its goal of reducing net public debt to 30 per
cent of gross domestic product by June 1997 from 42 per cent in the middle
of this year.
The Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation said last week
that New Zealand should use its improved fiscal position to pay expensive
debt rather than increase public spending.

FT  14 DEC 94 / China cancels Pena trip over Taiwan visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has cancelled a planned visit by Mr Federico Pena, US transportation
secretary, to express its 'strong displeasure' over a trip he made to Taiwan
last week. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and insists the US
and other nations have only unofficial contacts with the island. 'Under such
circumstances, it is hard for us to receive Mr Pena in January,' the Chinese
foreign ministry spokesman said.
Mr Pena was to visit Beijing and two other cities on January 7-17 to boost
US-Chinese commercial relations.
A US State Department spokesman said China had described the meeting as
having been postponed rather than cancelled. 'They said it would not be
convenient at this time,' he said, adding that Mr Pena's trip last week was
consistent with US policy of maintaining unofficial economic, commercial and
cultural relations with Taiwan.
A Transportation Department official said there had been 'a shift' in US
policy toward Taiwan in September, to recognise the island's democratic
reforms and economic development. 'The White House asked Mr Pena to make the
trip and the State Department was aware of it,' the official said.' China
signalled its displeasure over the trip before Mr Pena went to Taiwan.
An aerospace industry official said a US executive, visiting China within
the last two months, was also warned by the Chinese information ministry
against operating 'a two China policy' of parallel contacts with Beijing and
Taipei, and was told that 'it would not go away as a problem' so long as
such contacts with Taiwan were maintained.
Mr Pena was only the second cabinet-level official to visit Taiwan since
Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.
His spokesman said the White House received an invitation for a high-ranking
official to speak at the US-Republic of China joint economic council meeting
in Taiwan. Mrs Carla Hills, the then US trade representative, spoke to the
group in Taiwan two years ago just two weeks before the end of the Bush
administration. In 1991 Mr Sam Skinner, the then transportation secretary,
addressed the group in the US.
Mr Pena, however, went a step farther than his predecessors by meeting
Taiwanese officials, including the president, and commending them for their
recent elections.
Despite the cancellation, China maintains that high-level exchanges with the
US should be strengthened, the Beijing spokesman said.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Clinton may propose a cut in taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an effort to recapture the initiative from the new Republican majority in
Congress President Bill Clinton is tomorrow considering proposing a middle
class tax cut when he outlines his plans for the next two years.
The Republicans intend to push through a tax credit of Dollars 500 per child
for families earning up to Dollars 200,000 a year, a measure which they
expect would cost Dollars 107bn over five years.
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the new leader of the minority Democrats in
the House of Representatives, yesterday proposed his own income tax cut,
which would apply only to those earning less than Dollars 75,000 a year but
regardless of whether or not they have children.
Mr Clinton says he will only propose a 'middle class tax cut' if he thinks
he can pay for it with offsetting savings.
However, the White House remains split on how exactly to structure a tax cut
and on how the president should shape his overall strategy in the wake of
the Democrats' devastating defeat in the congressional elections on November
8.
White House discussions are centred on a tax break for families with
children, like the Republican plan, but with a much lower income ceiling,
costing between Dollars 50bn and Dollars 80bn over five years.
In a number of small but symbolic ways Mr Clinton's decisions over the last
month have seemed calculated to position him further to the right - a swift
intervention to persuade the Postal Service not to cancel its traditional
Christmas stamp featuring a Madonna, the firing of Surgeon-General Joycelyn
Elders, a favourite target for right wingers, and encouragement for allowing
prayer in schools.
The Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank, last
week proposed its own policy agenda for the defeated Democrats to 'reclaim
the vital centre in American politics' while left-wing Democrats have
simultaneously warned Mr Clinton that it would be political suicide to paint
himself as a watered-down Republican.
Mr Gephardt's tax cut proposal yesterday appeared designed to distance
congressional Democrats from a president who many now feel is a liability
for the party, and the House Democratic leader went out of his way to point
out that the plan had not been co-ordinated with the Clinton administration.
Doubts about the right strategy have been reflected in the White House's
to-ing and fro-ing about Thursday night's speech. Although Mr Clinton wanted
to lay out his plans for the next two years sometime before Christmas, it
was not until Monday evening that the speech was firmly written into his
diary.
The battle over who can propose the most attractive tax cut for the middle
class - defined, as is usual in American politics, to include virtually
everyone - has dismayed the Congress's purest fiscal conservatives, who
worry about the persistence of high budget deficits.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Spotlight falls on Merrill Lynch investment role: Richard
Waters on the part played by the firm in selling the securities on which the
losses were made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the war of words being waged between Wall Street and Orange County, the
beleaguered southern California authority which faces huge losses on
misjudged bond investments, the name of Merrill Lynch is beginning to stand
out.
Other investment firms, both foreign and US, may have lent the county much
of the Dollars 12bn that it used to play the financial markets. However the
involvement of Merrill, the US's biggest - and, in recent years, probably
its most consistently profitable - securities firm, covered a number of
areas.
The firm lent Orange County Dollars 2bn, and remains the only investment
firm of any size not to have sold the collateral held against these loans.
What is more important, it sold the county more than half the Dollars 20bn
of securities on which it suffered the losses, which are put at more than
Dollars 2bn.
And it underwrote a Dollars 600m bond offering for the county in July,
several months after the turn in US interest rates first began to hit the
county's investment fund. The cash raised through that bond issue was
earmarked for the county's investment fund, bolstering its cash resources to
buy more securities (some of them through Merrill) or service its borrowings
(including borrowings from Merrill.)
This multiple relationship has already made Merrill the subject of a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the Orange County
investment losses, and the target of a lawsuit from bond holders, who argue
that they should have been told more about the investment losses in July.
A senior executive at Merrill Lynch, who refused to be named, said there was
nothing uncommon about either Orange County's heavy borrowings to fund its
investments, or about the nature of the investments it made.
'The fact that the reverse repurchase agreements were used as a financing
alternative was not uncommon for counties,' he said. 'The securities the
county treasurer was buying were all within his legal and legislative
ability, and within his investment guidelines. The county (treasurer) was a
highly sophisticated investor, and very publicly known for his experience
and success in the past.'
Merrill also contended that, at any given moment, it did not know the full
extent of Orange County's borrowings. The debt level was 'relatively high',
the Merrill executive said, but, 'we were not aware of that at any given
time.'
Other investment houses which lent heavily also said that the treasurer, Mr
Robert Citron, did not tell them about his total borrowings.
The hunt is under way for other US counties which may have followed similar
investment strategies. According to Mr Richard Larkin, a managing director
of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, 'We're concerned that
other county treasurers were trying to emulate Mr Citron. It's previous
investment successes were very well publicised.'
Of the July bond issue, meanwhile, Merrill said: 'It was in no way a
conflict.' Helping the county to raise money and acting as a broker, were
entirely different functions, it added.
Some bondholders claimed that Merrill should have forced the county to
disclose more about its investment fund in July.
The prospectus issued at the time of the bond issue warned that 'the price
and income volatility of the . . . securities (in the investment fund) is
greater than standard fixed income securities and may serve to increase the
volatility' of the fund. It also warns that the fund often borrowed heavily.
But the prospectus only showed the original cost of the securities bought by
the fund, not their value at the time (a much lower figure.) That figure did
not need to be disclosed, given the fund's investment strategy, Merrill
maintained.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Foreign aid in US under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the new Republican majority in Congress are lining up to slash
many foreign aid programmes, long a favourite target for US budget cutters.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will head the Senate subcommittee
that governs foreign aid spending, this week proposed a bill which would
radically overhaul the US's aid apparatus and concentrate money on strategic
priorities in the Middle East, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,
at the expense of Africa and elsewhere.
Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the extreme right-winger who will
chair the Senate foreign relations committee, has separately proposed
eliminating all funding for the World Bank, the United Nations Development
Programme and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.
The two proposals are likely to be the opening shots in a battle over US
foreign aid, already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country
as a proportion of gross domestic product.
Under Mr McConnell's plan, which would slightly increase aid to the Middle
East and cut funds to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by 9 per
cent but slash most other programmes by 20 per cent, the total US aid budget
would drop from Dollars 13.7bn in the current fiscal year to around Dollars
12.5bn.
Others expect Mr McConnell's proposal will represent something of a ceiling
for next year's foreign aid bill. The Kentucky senator is more willing than
many of his Republican colleagues to consider foreign aid a useful foreign
policy tool, but says it is unrealistic to expect aid will be spared when
domestic spending is being cut.
One area left blank in Mr McConnell's bill is funding for US contributions
to the multilateral development banks, which Mr Helms would eliminate or
slash.
The Treasury has already started a campaign to argue that money invested in
these banks is a cost-effective way of multiplying the US's aid money, and
administration officials say their credibility in pressing for institutional
reforms has been greatly enhanced by last year's aid bill, which provided
some money to reduce US arrears to banks such as the Asian Development Bank.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Cleared Collor may try to make political comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilians reacted with a mixture of anger and resignation yesterday to news
that former president Fernando Collor, who left office in 1992 amid
corruption allegations, had been cleared of the charges by the Supreme
Court.
Mr Collor said he had always had faith in justice. 'With my friends I do not
celebrate. We merely share an intimate satisfaction in knowing that,
finally, justice was done,' he said.
Politicians close to Mr Collor are thought to be preparing an appeal for the
lifting of a separate Senate ruling banning him from holding public office
until the year 2000. Even if unsuccessful, Mr Collor is only 45 and is
widely thought to be planning a political comeback.
Public criticism was most virulent against attorney general and prosecutor
Mr Aristides Junquiera, who was attacked over the way he presented his case.
However, legal specialists pointed out that it was very difficult to link Mr
Collor to the alleged influence peddling scheme which took place during his
government. Without documents directly linking the former president to the
acceptance of money, several of the eight judges hearing the case decided
the evidence was too weak.
Many people interviewed by television and radio stations yesterday expressed
disappointment at the ruling, but no great surprise. An opinion poll
conducted ahead of the trial found more than half the interviewees believing
Mr Collor would not be found guilty of the charge he faced of 'passive
corruption'.

<TEXT>
Orange County's loss on its investment portfolio now stands at Dollars
2.02bn, Mr Tom Hayes, the newly appointed chairman of the restructuring team
said yesterday, Tony Jackson reports from New York. The figure was struck at
close of business on Monday.
Though higher than the originally published loss of Dollars 1.5bn, it is
below some outside estimates.
The County's board of supervisors authorised Salomon Brothers, which was
last week retained as financial adviser, to dispose of the fund's remaining
investments. Mr Hayes said he aimed to increase the liquidity of the fund,
reduce its holdings of derivatives and shorten the average maturity of the
securities held.
The board also authorised an interim distribution of cash to investors in
the fund, having met with the 11 largest earlier in the day.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Retail sales surge by 1.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales surged last month, a further sign of buoyant economic growth
despite a series of interest rate increases this year.
The Commerce Department said sales rose 1.2 per cent last month  - more than
twice the increase projected by most forecasters  - and by nearly 9 per cent
in the year to November. Data for October were also revised up to show an
increase of 1.3 per cent from September.
Bond traders, however, were mollified by separate figures for wholesale
prices indicating that rapid growth is apparently still putting only limited
upward pressure on the prices of finished goods. The producer price index
rose 0.5 per cent last month and by 1.3 per cent in the year to November  -
roughly in line with market expectations. The closely-watched 'core'
producer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose only 0.1 per
cent, less than expected.
Most forecasters expect the Federal Reserve to try to curb growth by raising
short-term rates significantly in coming months. The Fed could tighten
policy again as early as next Tuesday but many analysts say the next
tightening move will be delayed until late January.
Retail sales showed across-the-board strength with robust increases in
building materials (up 2.9 per cent from October), furniture (up 2.3 per
cent) and cars (up 2.2 per cent.) So far in the fourth quarter retail sales
excluding cars, which tend to be volatile, have grown at an annualised rate
of about 8 per cent in real terms, up from about 6 per cent in the third
quarter.
Although inflation still appears subdued at the level of finished goods,
pressures are building at earlier stages of production. The core producer
price indices for crude and intermediate goods rose 3.4 per cent and 0.9 per
cent last month. Over the past six months, core intermediate goods prices
have risen at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent.
'The Fed has to raise short-term rates significantly if it is to avoid a
hard landing in 1995,' said Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon
Bank in Pittsburgh. Mr Berner expects real economic growth to peak at an
annualised rate of 6 per cent this quarter before slowing to about 2.5 per
cent next year.

FT  14 DEC 94 / West's fears rise over Chechnya: Moscow urged to minimise
bloodshed and search for negotiated solution to conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western nations are observing the Russian onslaught in Chechnya with
mounting anxiety, but so far they are holding back from directly criticising
President Boris Yeltsin or putting their relations with Moscow on the line.
All pronouncements on the crisis from the main western capitals have
stressed that Chechnya is legally part of Russia. But Nato governments have
urged Moscow to keep bloodshed to a minimum and pursue a negotiated
settlement.
'We insist on the need to search for a negotiated solution,' a French
foreign ministry spokesman said. He added that, despite Chechnya's claim to
independence, France viewed the territory as an 'integral part of the
Russian federation'.
Western nations could, if they chose, challenge Russia for a prima facie
violation of the rules of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, including new provisions that were agreed only last week at a summit
in Budapest.
CSCE members are supposed to give 42 days' notice of military activities
involving more than 9,000 troops or 200 sorties by fighter aircraft - a
threshold that has easily been surpassed in the case of Chechnya.
Last week's summit also adopted a code of conduct for military operations
which provides a notional yardstick by which Russian behaviour in Chechnya
will be judged.
The code calls for constitutional procedures to be observed during internal
security operations; any use of firearms should be 'commensurate with the
needs for enforcement' and care should be taken to avoid harming civilians.
However, no country has voiced any intention of raising these matters in the
CSCE.
Western observers are conscious of the worrying implications of the Chechnya
onslaught for Russian policy on other fronts. Many of the Russian
politicians whose views are most respected in the west have opposed the
operation, which seems to reflect a victory for the 'war party' within the
Yeltsin administration.
Yet westerners are pointedly holding back from making any link between the
fighting in the Caucasus and other east-west issues.
'By no means does Chechnya define the broad parameters of the US-Russian
partnership,' said Mr Michael McCurry, State Department spokesman.
The fighting in the northern Caucasus follows a distinct cooling in
US-Russian relations because of President Yeltsin's outspoken opposition to
any rapid Nato expansion eastwards, a stance criticised by US officials. Yet
Washington's toughness over Nato has not so far been translated into
toughness over the Chechnya question, which the US regards as less
significant.
Turkey is the one Nato member where the Chechnya fighting could strike a
deep emotional chord. But Ankara is anxious to avoid compromising the
territorial integrity of Russia while it is locked in a war with Kurdish
separatists, whom it suspects are backed by Moscow.

FT  14 DEC 94 / President of Oslo bourse found dead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Erik Jarve, president of the Oslo bourse, was found by police drowned in
a fjord near his cabin south of Oslo early yesterday morning, just hours
after being dismissed by the bourse executive due to alleged financial
improprieties.
News of Mr Jarve's death shocked Norway's financial community and securities
trading was restricted for 15 minutes yesterday during a memorial service
held at the Oslo bourse.
Mr Jarve, 50, was abruptly dismissed by the bourse board on Monday. The
bourse at the time said his dismissal was related to financial
irregularities connected with his work but unrelated to securities trading.
Yesterday, following the announcement of his death, the bourse said Mr Jarve
had exploited his position to advance the employment prospects of a close
family member, though without their knowlege.
In all, the money involved was a petty sum, but Ms Elisabeth Wille, chairman
of the bourse board, said it was more a question of trust being violated
than of the sums involved.
'We judged the situation as being so grave that for us there was no other
possibility than the dismissal. This is a very deep tragedy,' she said.
On Monday, bourse officials refused to spell out clearly the reason for Mr
Jarve's dismissal and said the affair was to be investigated by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm.
Yesterday, however, Ms Wille said that it would have to be decided whether
or not to complete the probe in view of Mr Jarve's death. It is believed
that he committed suicide.
Yesterday, criticism mounted over the way the board handled the affair but
Ms Wille said it had not yet considered resigning.
It is understood that Mr Jarve was called in for questioning without warning
on Monday by the board. In just over an hour, including the time he was
questioned, he was gone from the bourse.
It is also understood, however, that tension between Mr Jarve - who had
worked at the bourse for 25 years - and the board had been building up for
more than a year. The board had been critical of his expensive lifestyle.
Mr Jarve had also employed a family member at the bourse and subsequently
awarded a Pounds 25,000 contract to upgrade the bourse trading system to
Logica, a UK software firm, which had later employed the same family member.
Mr Jarve had been instrumental in modernising the bourse, its rules,
regulations and technical functions. He had personified the Oslo stock
exchange since 1977 when he was appointed president.

Mr Michel Rocard yesterday ruled out a comeback as the French Socialist

candidate to replace Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Rocard, a former prime minister,
was considered the Socialists' natural candidate until he was ousted as
party leader last June for poor leadership of the party's campaign in the
European parliament elections. A Louis Harris poll, conducted before Mr
Delors announced on Sunday he would not run, showed that Mr Jack Lang, a
former education minister, led the field of alternative candidates.

<TEXT>
Mr Antoine Pinay (left), a former French prime minister, finance minister
and one of the architects of the country's post-war economic recovery, died
yesterday, shortly before his 103rd birthday. Mr Pinay earned a reputation
as a skilled economic manager and a champion of anti-inflationary policies.
Before leaving government in 1960 he introduced the 'new franc', which
knocked two zeros off the currency, and earned him the title of 'the man who
saved the franc'. He held a succession of government posts, including
minister for economic affairs and finance minister, before being appointed
prime minister in 1952. As premier he helped restore public finances,
introducing austerity measures and issuing a successful bond, known as the
'emprunt Pinay', which allowed savers to convert cash and gold which had
been stashed away in the post-war years into legal, tax-exempt savings. Mr
Pinay returned to the cabinet as foreign minister in 1955 and became finance
minister when Charles de Gaulle formed the first government of the fifth
republic in 1958.

<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Oreja and Mr Karel Van Miert, European commissioners for transport
and competition, yesterday announced plans to open the market for ground
handling services at European airports, a move which could sharply reduce
airline costs. The commissioners' proposal will strip airports and national
carriers of their monopoly rights over ground handling, which covers
passenger and baggage check-in, loading and unloading of baggage, mail and
cargo handling, refuelling, and aircraft maintenance.
The proposed law will require airports and airlines to separate accounts
covering ground handling activities from those relating to other parts of
their business. It also aims to allow airlines to manage their own
activities on arrival at an airport - currently severely restricted. The
draft directive, which the commissioners would like to be in place by July
1996, will be presented as a formal proposal to the Council of Ministers
next year.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's central bank yesterday raised short-term interest rates for the
third time since August, as it sought to curb an upward trend in inflation
which it fears could derail economic recovery and the government's efforts
to control public finances. The Riksbank raised its 'repo', or repurchase,
rate by 20 basis points to 7.60 per cent. The bank has warned repeatedly
that inflation in 1995 is set to exceed its target ceiling of 3 per cent and
is anxious to prevent any recurrence of the inflationary boom of the 1980s
that preceded Sweden's deepest recession for 50 years.
The new Social Democratic government is depending on lower interest rates to
bolster the recovery, reduce 13 per cent unemployment and help cut the
budget deficit, which is forecast to reach about 13 per cent of gross
national product in the current fiscal year. But the Riksbank believes
raising short-term rates will aid the process by reassuring financial
markets that inflation will be controlled, thus easing long-term interest
rates.

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday announced it is delaying publication of
proposals setting out a value added tax regime to make business transactions
across Europe's single market simpler and swifter. The announcement is a
setback to Commission ambitions to establish a common system of VAT between
member states, with businesses only required to register once to trade
within it. It also raises doubts about the likelihood that the switch from
existing transition arrangements to the definitive regime will be made on
the scheduled date of January 1 1997.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner responsible for indirect taxation,
said it would be 'premature' to produce proposals before the end of the
year. She said the transitional arrangements had been a success and that it
would be dangerous to change them at this stage. Instead the Commission will
launch a green paper, to be published by the end of March, examining options
for the definitive regime.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German private consumption is showing continuing weakness as retail sales
figures for October, released yesterday, indicated a decline of 2 per cent
in real terms from the same month a year earlier. The fall against September
this year (seasonally and calendar adjusted) was also 2 per cent.
September's figure had shown a rise against August. Last week's
third-quarter figures for west German gross domestic product had indicated a
stronger rise in private consumption than expected, put down by some
economists to the seasonal adjustment process which they said might no
longer reflect buying trends. Yesterday's announcement from the federal
statistics office showed consumption has still to pick up after the
recession. The decline in the first 10 months was a real 1 per cent for the
whole country. Department store turnover in west Germany, down a nominal 8
per cent, was especially weak. Mail order sales dropped 3 per cent and those
of supermarkets fell 4 per cent.
Norway's trade surplus in November fell to NKr5.2bn (Pounds 485m) against
NKr6.1bn in October. The trade surplus for November 1993 was NKr3.6bn.
Spain's budget deficit narrowed in the first 11 months of 1994 after
revenues rose 4.4 per cent and spending climbed 2.7 per cent, said Mr Pedro
Solbes, economy minister. He said Spain's current account deficit would be
slightly above forecast for this year, at about 1 per cent of GDP, while the
deficit for 1995 could be similar.

FT  14 DEC 94 / N Caucasus republics nurture old enmities
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The North Caucasian republics remain trapped in a net of historical
grievances and unfulfilled national ambitions, which 70 years of Soviet
rule, followed by its sudden loosening, have complicated rather than solved.
The 5m people, divided into half a dozen republics and into scores of ethnic
and linguistic groups, ranging from a few thousand to some hundred
thousands, have bitter experience in common, together with a pervasive
tradition of powerlessness. But this has not been a unifying force and even
now divides as much as unites.
The area's importance is twofold. First, the republics are constitutionally
Russian and thus must decide their future with Russia. The independence
ambitions of Chechnya in particular are a threat to state integrity and thus
to the strength of the Russian leadership and its support from liberal
parties now opposed to the use of force. Second, the area is largely Moslem
and thus arouses strong Russian fears of 'extremism' and provides a focus
for at least latent sympathy of many millions of Moslems in Russia and in
Azerbaijan and central Asia.
The North Caucasian republics strung out between the Black and Caspian seas,
along the Caucasus mountain range, which divides Russia from Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan are (from west to east): the Adygeya republic,
separated from the others by Russian territory and with an ethnic Russian
majority; the Karachai-Cherkesk republic, in which the two main groups which
make up the republic's name coexist uneasily; Kabardino-Balkaria, which has
the same problem; North Ossetia, the only largely Christian state, whose
sister southern republic is formally within Georgia; Ingushetia, which split
from its ethnic cousin, Chechnya, three years ago and still has a clear
border with it; Chechnya, the centre of the conflict; and Dagestan, the
largest and most ethnically complex, with more than 30 groups in delicate
counterbalance.
For centuries at the edge of competing empires, the Northern Caucasus was
absorbed into Tsarist Russia in a series of brutal campaigns up to the
mid-1860s. They were seen as a barrier between Russia and its hegemony over
Georgia and Armenia which had come under Russia's sway in the early 1800s.
Where these southern people were seen by the Russians at least for a time as
cultivated, 'the people of the Northern Caucasus were seen as out-and-out
savages', according to Suzanne Goldenberg, author of a recent history of the
region.
The cruelty of their imperial suppression is one defining factor; the
degradation of the Soviet period is an even fresher one. Chopped into
various and frequently altered administrative regions in the twenties,
subjected (especially the Chechens) to vicious purges in the thirties,
deported and murdered for suspected Nazi collaboration in the forties
(again, especially the Chechens), the North Caucasian peoples emerged into
the post-war period with too heavy a historical burden to be dissolved by
the strokes of a pen in Moscow.
They now suffer disproportionately from the economic dislocation which
afflicts all Russia. They bear the added burden of open ethnic tension
between and within them and the inspiring but fearful example of Chechnya's
drive for independence.
On the fringes of the talks between Russian and Chechen negotiators
yesterday was a delegation from the Confederation of Caucasian Peoples, an
ad hoc group formed in 1989 with the aim of uniting the different republics.
Mr Ali Aliev, the speaker of the confederation's 'parliament', and himself
from Dagestan said that 'our position is that we defend the rights of the
little peoples of the Caucasus. Now in Russia there is a war party. Our task
is not to allow that party to win. For, if there is a war it would not be a
Russian-Chechen war, it would be Russian-Caucasian war'.
This may be over-dramatic. The splits in the North Caucasus, especially
between the North Ossetians and the others are deep. All except the Chechens
have come to some accommodation with the fact of Russian authority. But in
all of these states there are many young men with arms who might respond to
a call to rebel. The squashing of Chechnya, if it is to take place, would
ignite old fires across the Caucasus.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Doubts deepen over Slovak sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar became prime minister of Slovakia for the third time last
night, assuming almost complete control of the country's privatisation
policy amid widespread confusion over the immediate future of a Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.28bn) sell-off of state assets scheduled to begin tomorrow.
His appointment as privatisation minister of Mr Peter Bisak, a virtually
unknown nominee of the radical leftwing Workers' party, one of the three
coalition partners in the new government and a fierce opponent of selling
off state companies, signals a serious downgrading of the ministry. It
leaves policy in this crucial area in the hands of Mr Meciar and Mr Sergej
Kozlik, his new finance minister and chief economic adviser.
A lame duck privatisation ministry also suggests a much greater role for the
National Property Fund, the body that administers companies being readied
for privatisation and which Mr Meciar has packed with his own supporters.
During September's election campaign the prime minister said he would
introduce wholesale changes in the way state assets are sold, and to whom.
Mr Meciar is expected to push for sales to existing company management, many
of whom are supporters of his populist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS), the dominant coalition partner.
The third coalition member is the extreme rightwing Slovak National party.
Mr Meciar's new government has 83 of parliament's 150 seats.
It was the pursuit of this policy that forced Mr Meciar and his last
government from office last March amid allegations that he was diverting
sales proceeds to finance the HZDS. He has long argued for delaying the
first sell-off of companies in a programme of coupon privatisation under
which Slovak citizens exchange vouchers, bought for a nominal sum, for
shares in companies of their choice. More than 3m Slovaks have already
bought vouchers in the scheme, put together by the outgoing government.
The most significant change to the voucher programme is likely to be the
removal of shares in what Mr Meciar has termed strategic industries,
including Slovakia's electricity and gas companies, which represent at least
10 per cent of the total value of Sk60bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and almost certainly
damp investor sentiment.
Investment managers, who are hoping to invest the vouchers on behalf of
hundreds of thousands of Slovaks in privatised companies through specially
created investment vehicles, are in the dark as to the government's
intentions. Many say, however, that they have prepared the new funds on the
assumption that there would be at least some delay to the coupon programme,
and have continued to woo potential investors.
A delay in starting the so-called 'zero round' of the coupon programme,
during which investors allocate their vouchers to fund managers, is less
important than a change to the list of companies on offer. That list has
already been changed five times since the process began in September, and
nobody yet knows which companies are included. A lot of administrative work
still has to be done to prepare the final list for sale.
The NPF has made board changes at some of Slovakia's biggest companies,
including the petrochemical giant Slovnaft, since Mr Meciar succeeded in
placing his nominees on its management board after a parliamentary session
in early November that has become known as 'Bloody Thursday'. He also
secured control of Slovak radio and television by the same means.

FT  14 DEC 94 / French MPs ban corporate gifts to parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French National Assembly yesterday voted to ban corporate contributions
to political parties and candidates, in a move to remove widespread
suspicion of corruption in French political life.
But clearly hoping to maintain their political life-style, deputies also
refused to lower the ceilings on spending by parties and individual
candidates. They also demanded that the state should step in to finance the
gap which will be created by the ban on company gifts.
Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, said the government would try to get
MPs to reconsider and to lower the ceilings on political expenses during the
rest of the debate which will wind up in the National Assembly this week and
move to the Senate next week. But the Balladur government is now
encountering more trouble from within its parliamentary majority than from
the opposition Socialists.
But the new outright ban on corporate campaign contributions threatens to
'bring back the bag men with their suitcases of money,' said Mr Guy
Carcassonne, a law professor who helped the Rocard government design its
1990 law. This law, together with an earlier piece of legislation in 1988,
legalised and therefore controlled companies' gifts to politicians, while
also introducing some public funding of political expenses.
At the outset of the latest corruptions scandals, Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur argued that the allegations that led to the resignation of three of
his ministers related largely to events before 1990, and therefore the
subsequent legislation should be allowed to work. But public reaction has
since forced him into endorsing more drastic action to cut the umbilical
cord between business and politics.
Mr Pasqua said he was ready to raise from 30 to 50 per cent the proportion
of candidates' election expenses that the state was prepared to reimburse,
but some MPs yesterday said they wanted this share raised to 70, or even 100
per cent.
According to the national watchdog body on political campaign spending,
companies gave a total of FFr367m (Pounds 43.5m) to parties and candidates
in 1993, more than triple the amount given by individuals.
Meanwhile, the Senate yesterday rejected a controversial national assembly
amendment that would have made it illegal for the press to publish the
results of magistrates' investigations.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Bangemann pours scorn on TV quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU attempts to limit further the amount of non-European films and programmes
European broadcasters are allowed to screen would damage the industry, Mr
Martin Bangemann, the commissioner responsible, said yesterday. It would not
even be the best way to protect European culture.
The existing approach of imposing quotas on EU-based television channels to
protect the audiovisual industry, as well as European languages and culture,
from a Hollywood onslaught was misguided, he said.
'I am totally in favour of creating the right conditions for
programme-makers at a European level, but that cannot be done by restricting
their economic activities. . . . I believe we should try to support a policy
which separates economic and technological aspects from cultural aspects.'
However, it is understood that Mr Bangemann will not be present to defend
his position when commissioners meet next Wednesday to discuss tightening
broadcasting legislation. He may therefore ask for the discussion to be
postponed.
The 1989 Television without Frontiers directive requires 51 per cent of
material shown to be of European origin, and 10 per cent to be set aside for
independent European producers  - requirements that have infuriated foreign
producers, particularly in Hollywood. However, the quotas only apply 'where
practicable', a loop-hole that Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, outgoing
audiovisual commissioner, proposes to plug. Further, he wants to extend
restrictions to new screen-based services such as tele-shopping and
video-on-demand. This would have the effect of banning advertising on
shopping channels and restricting American content on interactive TV.
Mr de Deus Pinheiro  - backed strongly by the French - is extremely eager to
secure support from the rest of the Commission by the end of the year.
However, Mr Manuel Oreja, who takes over responsibility for audiovisual
policy, next year does not want to be lumbered with what he sees as
controversial and impractical revisions. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator, is also opposed, believing any moves to tighten quotas would
send a bad political signal to EU trading partners.
Mr Bangemann yesterday stressed there was still a case for protecting
European culture. 'It is not right, or even fair that the Americans are
always attacking the Europeans for being protectionist in this field,' he
said. 'In the US, if you want to own more than 25 per cent of a radio
station you have to be American. That is not the case over here.'

FT  14 DEC 94 / Retailers find little cheer at Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers seem set for a gloomy Christmas. With 11 trading days left, a
business survey yesterday reported retailers' confidence falling and
suggested that profit margins will be under severe pressure.
The survey, from the Confederation of British Industry, provides fresh
evidence of the 'feel bad' factor souring Britain's economic recovery.
Weak sales forced the retail trade to keep annual price increases in
November at their lowest level for at least 11 years, the CBI said.
Mr James May, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said
retailers were likely to see a 'tough Christmas'. Official retail sales
data, due tomorrow, were likely to show High Street inflation was lower than
1 per cent in November, he said.
The CBI survey is expected to fuel stock market concerns that intense price
competition and low consumer spending will further erode profits and margins
in the run-up to Christmas.
However, it boosted City hopes that November's official inflation data,
published today, will show continuing low price pressures. This might ease
some of the impetus for another interest rates rise, fuelled earlier this
week by rising raw material costs.
Yesterday's data indicate why some shops have introduced pre-Christmas
sales. 'In terms of margins and profits it is very tough - people are going
to have to adjust their ideas of profits,' Mr May said.
The CBI said its survey showed retailers reporting the lowest annual growth
in selling prices in November since the price survey started in 1983.
Selling prices were reduced by 24 per cent of shops compared with last
November. Some 25 per cent of shops expected prices to be lower in December
than last Christmas, with 37 per cent expecting them to be higher, a
positive balance of 12.
Discounting in November succeeded in slightly boosting overall retail sales
volumes, the survey suggested. The level of sales reported by retailers in
November was slightly better than in October, with 40 per cent of retailers
reporting sales higher than in the previous November.
However, this was below retailers' expectations in the previous quarterly
survey, and the level of optimism fell to its lowest level for two years,
with 74 per cent of retailers expecting no improvements in the next three
months.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's survey panel, said there appeared
to be a slowdown in sales growth, partly as a result of recent tax and
interest rate rises. But consumers may be leaving shopping until the end of
the Christmas period, he said.

FT  14 DEC 94 / BR sell-off speeds up as rail network finances are hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is to speed up railway privatisation amid claims that the
network's financial base is starting to crumble.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director responsible for selling the passenger
train companies to the private sector, will today announce plans to dispose
of eight of the 25 British Rail companies. BR had planned to sell just six
in the first round of franchise sales.
He will set out rules for franchisees, including limits on fare increases in
some areas, such as London commuter lines, where there is no real
competition from other means of transport.
He will also specify basic levels of service, which would be lower than at
present, but expects operators to run more trains for commercial reasons. Mr
Salmon's move is expected to hit InterCity routes, but maintain protection
for rural services. Under the new rules, companies will also have to accept
each others' tickets.
The attempt to revive the momentum of BR privatisation comes after the
leaking of a confidential report prepared for the Commons transport select
committee, disclosing increasing pressure on the railway network to cut
costs and services.
The report, by two railway experts, Mr Richard Hope, a consultant, and
Professor Bill Bradshaw of Oxford University, prompted the committee to
announce plans yesterday for an immediate inquiry into the state of railway
finances.
The report highlighted a Pounds 400m gap in the railways' finances which, if
not filled, could in theory lead to the closure of 4,000 miles of branch
lines out of the network of 9,000 passenger miles or to a 25 per cent cut in
the level of peak services.
The network's finances have suffered after last summer's four months of
strikes by signalmen, a drop in coal shipments because of a shift to gas by
power generators, the cost of preparing for privatisation and cuts in
government subsidies.
The report says it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of railway
finances over the coming months because the principal organisations involved
were themselves unclear about what was happening. But the fact 'that a
serious shortfall in cash looms is scarely in doubt,' the report said.
In the Commons, Mr John Major said that privatised servicces would be based
on existing timetables, and 'scare stories' about the process
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, demanded the cancellation of privatisation
if there was even a 'remote risk' of big cuts in the rail network.
Further evidence of the cost pressures on the railway was provided yesterday
when Mr Terry Worrall, BR's director of safety, said measures designed to
reduce the risk of accidents could be introduced only if they were
affordable.
The government wants to privatise at least half the passenger rail network
before April 1996.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Berlusconi answers bribery charges: Prime minister quizzed
by magistrates - Coalition partner threatens to aid fall of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government last night looked increasingly unstable as Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, faced questioning over bribery allegations
and his political partners threatened to bring down the coalition.
The accelerating weakness of the seven-month-old right-wing coalition was
underlined by the appearance of Mr Berlusconi before Milan magistrates to be
interrogated about alleged payment of bribes to members of the Guardia di
Finanza, the financial police, while running his Fininvest business empire.
It was the first time in Italian post-war politics that a serving prime
minister has been questioned about alleged corruption. Afterwards Mr
Berlusconi said the investigation was based 'on a theory devoid of any firm
evidence' and repeated he would not resign.
The move to quicken the fall of the government was signalled yesterday by
the opposition and the populist Northern League, a key partner in the
coalition.
Both agreed to withdraw amendments to the 1995 budget to allow a speedy
parliamentary passage, possibly before Christmas, opening the way for a
no-confidence motion against the government. They also want the budget
passed to avoid further uncertainty on financial markets.
The long-postponed interrogation of Mr Berlusconi began just before 12.30 in
Milan's imposing Palace of Justice. The questioning lasted more than seven
hours and was conducted by Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief
public prosector, whom Mr Berlusconi has repeatedly accused of mounting a
political vendetta against him. Two other magistrates were present. Mr
Berlusconi was supported by Mr Giuseppe De Luca and Mr Ennio Amodio, two of
his lawyers.
Outside the court a small crowd was dominated by government opponents
including a group collecting signatures in support of Milan's Mani Pulite
('clean hands') anti-corruption team and their star magistrate, Mr Antonio
Di Pietro, who resigned last week complaining of political manipulation.
In an open letter on the front page of Sole 24 Ore, Italy's main business
paper, Mr Berlusconi said he was going to the interrogation 'with my head
held high and utterly convinced of all my arguments'.
Mr Berlusconi was being asked about three payments totalling L330m (Pounds
129,000) made between 1989 and 1992 to the Guardia di Finanza to ensure
favourable inspections of Fininvest subsidiaries - Videomusic (television
production), Mondadori (publishing), and Mediolanum (life assurance). Mr
Salvatore Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, and Mr Paolo
Berlusconi, the premier's younger brother, admitted the payments when
arrested last July.
Outlining his defence, the Sole 24 Ore letter said: 'It is obvious that
whatever the rare and isolated episode, which involved giving in to
degenerate public habits, it could in no way be attributed to me personally
as an entrepreneur and head of a big diversified multinational group - save
in bad faith.'
But the magistrates were expected to extend their questioning to cover other
of their investigations into Fininvest.
As he was being questioned, the climate within the judiciary became more
bitter with the resignation of all 20 inspectors at the justice ministry.
They said they were protesting at the impossibility of working in the face
of mounting public criticism. The inspectors had been sent to investigate
the activities of Milan and Palermo magistrates on government orders.

FT  14 DEC 94 / Tobacco industry faces class action in US courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US cigarette industry, facing an unprecedented wave of
multi-billion-dollar lawsuits, was examining the implications of a Miami
court ruling yesterday.
A judge ruled that up to 60,000 present and former flight attendants could
together sue US tobacco companies for health difficulties they said had been
caused by inhaling passengers' cigarette smoke. It is the first time illness
caused by secondhand smoke has been accepted as grounds for a class action
lawsuit.
Mr Stanley Rosenblatt, the flight attendants' lawyer, said compensation and
punitive damages for all 60,000 plaintiffs might total in excess of Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3bn).
Today, in a court in New Orleans, lawyers representing tens of millions of
present and former smokers seek to bring a class action against the tobacco
industry claiming compensation for nicotine addiction.
In yet another type of case to be heard next Monday, tobacco manufacturers
will try to fend off a lawsuit from the State of Mississippi in which the
state attorney-general is demanding compensation for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses under public assistance programmes such as
Medicaid. Other states are bringing similar suits.
The flight attendants suing in Miami are employed by various US airlines.
They do not smoke, but say they were exposed to passengers' cigarette fumes
before the US banned smoking on most domestic flights in 1989.
US cigarette manufacturers say passive smoking has not been proved to cause
any illness, but last year the Environmental Protection Agency, a US
government body, declared that secondhand smoke was carcinogenic.
Judge Robert Kaye of the Circuit Court for Dade County originally turned
down the attendants' request to proceed as a group, but in March a state
appeal court overruled his decision.
Some tobacco companies were considering an appeal to the Florida Supreme
Court. They were also taking comfort from a footnote to Judge Kaye's
decision in which the judge said he was 'deeply concerned with the issue of
causation'.
RJ Reynolds Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco tobacco and food group, said
that indicated that the judge felt individual trials would still be needed
for each flight attendant to establish the precise cause of their illness
and the appropriate level of damages.
'As we have argued, thousands of separate trials to decide those facts
defeats the purpose of handling these claims as a class action,' RJ Reynolds
said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US commerce secretary Ron Brown, followed by Social Democratic and Labour
party leader John Hume, leaves the Guildhall in Londonderry yesterday after
meeting with Sinn Fein leaders to avert a row over the Belfast International
Investment Conference. Sinn Fein, which denied reports that it had
threatened to boycott the business conference, confirmed that its party
councillors would attend today. With more than 300 delegates, it is the
largest such conference to be held in Belfast since the troubles began 25
years ago. Mr Brown said the US would work with the people of Northern
Ireland 'to replace the architecture of violence'.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Santer backs EU expansion to east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The next president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Santer, said
yesterday he hoped to see the emerging democracies of eastern Europe joining
the European Union around the turn of the century, Reuter reports from Bonn
and Brussels.
He did not set a specific date for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU, but stressed in an interview
with German radio that Europe must strive to expand eastward as fast as
reasonably possible.
His optimism about widening the EU eastwards contrasted sharply, however,
with gloom about the Union's future at the Commission following the decision
by the outgoing president, Mr Jacques Delors, not to run as the Socialist
candidate in next year's presidential election in France.
EU officials and diplomats reacted with surprise, regret and some anxiety on
Monday to Mr Delors' decision. 'His decision could undo all he has done
here,' said one EU official, referring to Mr Delors' 10-year effort as head
of the Commission to further the cause of European integration.
But Mr Santer insisted in Bonn: 'We will do everything to be able to lead
these countries up to the European Community around the end of this century.
Whether they can become full members by this date depends on developments.
We must first get our house in order from an institutional perspective,' he
added, referring to reforms the EU will consider at a conference in 1996.
Mr Santer, current prime minister of Luxembourg, will succeed Mr Delors as
head of the Commission next month. EU leaders meeting in Essen at the
weekend backed plans to prepare the so-called associate countries for
eventual membership, but without setting a timetable.
A Commission official said Mr Delors' legacy stood the greatest risk of
erosion if the Gaullist leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, became president in May
on a nationalist platform, but even prime minister Edouard Balladur was
unclear in his intentions on Europe. 'If anyone could have changed the
political landscape of France, it was Delors,' said the same source. Mr
Delors, it was believed, had underestimated the power he could wield in the
Elysee palace.
The source said a centre-right French government might not be that far from
Mr Delors' views on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) or defence
co-operation. Mr Delors' achievements in creating the EU single market and
building Emu would not unravel. But he added that Mr Delors' absence would
be a handicap for those forces pushing for an overhaul of the Maastricht
treaty's cumbersome inter-governmental rules in foreign, justice and home
affairs policy-making.
Unanimity is the rule for decisions in these areas, but France without Mr
Delors may remain just as attached as Britain to preserving national
sovereignty in these areas at the EU's 1996 inter-governmental conference.

FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell steeply in average trading volume, running up a
sizeable discount to cash equities and triggering negative arbitrage
business, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 2934 at the close of pit trading, down
31 points for a decline of 82 points over the past two sessions.
Having traded in the 16 points range for much of the day the discount to the
cash market at the close was around 10 points or eight points under fair
value.
Activity was again little better than average despite the appearance of one
big seller, Goldman Sachs, which pushed through 500 lots during the morning
session.
Contracts traded totalled 18,839, but more than 5,000 of this was spread
trading into the March contract, so underlying activity was again little
better than average.
Apart from Goldman Sachs' mid-morning swoop, activity was mostly confined to
local, independent traders and fairly extensive dealer arbitrage.
Although the discount to cash equities was at times wide, there was rarely
any real weight of selling or concerted attempts to drive the cash market
down, traders said.
Stock option volume was 28,048, against 33,615 on Friday. Call and put
volume was evenly matched with FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trades accounting for
more than 16,000 lots.

FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Focus on MAM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectation of a tussle for SG Warburg sharpened the focus on the merchant
banking sector as investors latched on to any nuance coming out of the
proposed link with Morgan Stanley of the US.
Yesterday, interest was concentrated on Mercury Asset Management (MAM) the
fund management company 75 per cent owned by Warburg. Speculation that MAM's
minority shareholders would demand a preferential price for their stake to
reflect the contribution MAM makes to the group's overall capitalisation saw
the fund mangement arm's shares leap 39 to 750p.
Meanwhile Warburg gained 10 to 793p as most investors refused to believe
that an agreed bid would go ahead at current levels - particularly when the
shares hit Pounds 10 apiece earlier in the year. Nevertheless sellers
emerged on the grounds that any bad feeling from MAM could upset a deal that
would need complete mutual agreement.
Elsewhere, the hunt is on for other merger or takeover candidates as some
dealers excitedly predict Big Bang, phase two. Smith New Court jumped 24 to
444p and Kleinwort Benson 16 to 553p.
Mobile phones group Vodafone moved marginally ahead against the market in
12m turnover, finishing at 193 1/2 p. Recently floated TeleWest
Communications dipped below its 182p issue price, closing a penny lower at
181p in 2.5m turnover. Building materials group Caradon came under clear
pressure as part of a wider run against the construction sector on the back
of interest rate fears. Caradon shed 13 1/2 to 230p while housebuilder
Barratt Development tumbled 10 to 141p.
The latest setback pushes Caradon's market capitalisation down to less than
Pounds 1.4bn and to a level that leaves the group bumping along at the
bottom of the Footsie rankings.
Revived speculation that De La Rue, the bank note printer, was poised to
make an offer for Portals, the specialist paper maker, motivated the share
prices of the two groups.
Portals shares were up 60 at one stage on a Sunday newspaper report that the
chairman had met De La Rue's chief executive over the weekend. The stock
closed 41 higher at 874p while De La Rue fell 16 to 929p.
Paper manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton lost 8 at 251p after SG Warburg
became a seller of stock. The house also downgraded David S. Smith, which
fell 20 to 498p.
Reports that UBS had turned negative on the property sector together with
fears of another rise in UK interest rates sent shares in the sector into
retreat. MEPC fell 17 1/4 to 358p xd and Land Securities fell 13 to 547p, in
trade of 3.3m while British Land eased 2 to 361p, and Hammerson relinquished
2 to 310p.
Asda Group were in demand ahead of interim figures on Thursday. The shares
edged a  1/4 forward to 65p. Turnover in several stocks in the sector was
boosted by programme trades. Volume in Budgens rose to 48m though the shares
closed unchanged at 25p. Heavy volume of 41m was also seen in Park Food. It
too closed unchanged at 122p. An agency cross in Tesco brought volume of 7m.
The shares added a penny to 237p.
Stores group House of Fraser edged forward a half to 183p, following a
recommendation from NatWest Securities. Advising investors to add to
holdings, NatWest said, 'House of Fraser has all the necessary ingredients
to engineer a recovery and the strategy is already delivering encouraging
results.'
However, the securities house downgraded current year profit expectations by
Pounds 6m to Pounds 40m, and the following year's figure by Pounds 8m to
Pounds 51m.
Football club Manchester United firmed a penny to 615p ahead of this
morning's four-for-one scrip issue which will see the share price divided by
five at the outset.
Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings benefited from visits to institutions,
adding 2 to 175p.
SmithKline Beecham shed 4 to 423 1/2 p as the company held an international
conference call.
Rival Wellcome dropped 13 to 655p. Dealers cited a US news report alleging
possible write-downs by the company.
Pharmaceuticals group Proteus International fell 45 to 195p in response to a
lengthy and critical Sunday newspaper article.
British Aerospace moved ahead strongly against the market following the
cancellation of the second stage of a Pounds 535m rights issue, rising 4 1/2
to 427p in 1.1m turnover.

FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR/Hanson switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diversified industrials BTR and Hanson comfortably headed the Footsie
activity charts with volumes boosted by a certain amount of switching out of
Hanson. Turnover in the two stocks totalled a combined 26m shares.
BTR saw 15m shares change hands, including a 1m deal at 279 1/2 p. The
shares closed marginally lower on the day at 278 1/2 p while Hanson shed 2
1/2 at 228p in 11m turnover. Dealers said BTR was subject to something of a
two-way pull with the shares gaining from the Hanson switching but meeting
with some equally determined sellers.
BTR, which has underperformed the market by almost 10 per cent over the past
three months, hosted City lunches last week in what was seen as an attempt
to repair damage to information flows between the company and analysts.

FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stores sector rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading retail stocks were the market's best performers as they brushed
aside negative weekend press comment and recent gloom over Christmas trading
to move firmly ahead.
One market watcher said the sector 'may have been oversold in recent
sessions' while another observer said simply, 'I doubt things in the high
Street are that bad.' Several stocks also benefited from programme trading
and volume was lifted by agency crosses.
Dealers also took comfort from favourable full-year figures from stores
group Allders, and its positive comments on current trading, helping the
shares add 5 to 204p.
Among the leaders, Kingfisher, weakened by recent profit downgradings, was
one of the day's strongest traders. The shares gained 4 to 420p. Marks &amp;
Spencer also benefited from pre-Christmas bargain hunting, edging forward a
half to close at 369 1/2 p. Hopes of another special dividend from Great
Universal Stores helped the shares put 2 to 507p.

FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie drops to lowest level for
five months - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market fell to its lowest levels since July as both the FT-SE
future and the FT-SE 100 index continued to drop below crucial support
levels. Dealers said London had fallen away for various reasons  - domestic,
international, political and economic.
And there was no support for equity markets from international bonds which
gave ground across the globe amid continued inflationary fears.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the session a net 33.9 off at 2,943.4. Over the
past two sessions the index has now fallen 70.4, or 2.3 per cent. The
market's weakness extended to the second liners; the FT-SE Mid-Cap 250 index
dropped 23.4 more to 3,372.4, for a two-day retreat of 55.5.
A sudden and sharp sell-off in the FT-SE future in mid-morning helped to
depress equities.
Dealers ascribed the slide in the UK market to unease about Wall Street,
which has been beset with worries about inflation and the possibility of
another rise in US interest rates in the short term. The Orange County
bankruptcy, and the threat of big forced selling of bonds, has increased
pressure on US markets.
Such was the gloom in London that even a positive opening performance by the
Dow Jones Average, which moved up about eight points shortly after the
opening and was still marginally higher two hours after London closed,
failed to produce any worthwhile response from the UK market.
There was little or no pressure on the market at the outset of trading when
the 100-index opened about a point higher and gradually pushed up to the
day's high of 2,987.5, up 10.5, helped by Wall Street's surprisingly steady
performance last Friday.
At that stage, however, a big seller of the FT-SE future, believed to have
been a big US investment bank, found little resistance and both the future
and the cash market began to tumble, helped on the way down by a couple of
small to medium-sized sell programmes.
Shortly after midday the 100 index moved down and never recovered, sliding
to a low of 2,941.9 and closing below what was previously perceived as a
strong resistance point of 2,955.
Some marketmakers saw the failure of the market to finish above 2,955 as
finally putting paid to any chances of a year-end rally. 'It's turn the
lights out and come back in 1995 as far as I'm concerned,' said one. Another
said the market felt 'unhappy, but not disastrous', and spoke of selective
buying interest on the way down. The head of trading at one of the big
integrated UK houses said it was difficult to be positive about a market
which had crashed through two very important chart levels.
The first of a series of crucial economic numbers to be released this week,
input and output producer prices, failed to cause any big shift in
sentiment. This morning brings the monthly Confederation of British Industry
survey of Distributive Trades.
Retailing provided one of the few strong sectoral performances with the top
quality retailers, Marks and Spencer, GUS and Kingfisher making sound
progress in spite of a generally bearish weekend press.
There was more buying of the merchant banks/stockbrokers. Northern
Electricity took over the lead in the regional electricity companies'
interim dividend race, posting a scintillating 30 per cent rise in its
payment.
Composite insurers were roughly treated following the heavy flooding in
Scotland, while housebuilders were affected by the recent interest rate rise
and forecasts of further rises next year.
Programme trades helped swell turnover in equities to 602.5m shares, with
non-FT-SE stocks accounting for 54 per cent of the total. Customer business
last Friday was Pounds 1.13bn.

FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Political worries leave Milan
at 12-month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most bourses were unsettled by weakness in bond markets, and the pattern was
extended in the afternoon as US treasuries opened lower, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN had its own preoccupations. It fell 2.6 per cent to a 12 month low
after comments by Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and a member of
the Northern League, were viewed as a premature political obituary for Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government.
The Comit index, which lost 4.7 per cent last week, fell another 15.33 to
586.19 after Mr Maroni was quoted as saying that the government could be
replaced by a different coalition after next month's review.
Against the trend, Credito Italiano gained L13 to L1,548, after a high of
L1,595, amid renewed speculation that Cariplo was about to launch a counter
bid for Credito Romagnolo. Italiano announced the full terms of its L2,780bn
offer for Rolo over the weekend and analysts noted yesterday that if the
deal fell through, it would be left with a significant amount of cash. Rolo
was L204 lower at L17,329.
Telecommunications stocks were markedly weaker on fresh worries that mobile
telephone concessions could be costly. Telecom Italia fell L200 or 5.3 per
cent to L3,580 and Stet was L222 or 5.0 per cent lower at L4,215.
FRANKFURT waited for New York. On the session, the Dax index fell just 3.51
to 2,024.82; but after hours the bourse saw an opening drop in US long
bonds, weakness in bund and equity features and an Ibis-indicated Dax below
2,000, at a low for the day of 1,998.20 before it closed a percentage point
down at 2,003.64.
Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.1bn. Friday's weakness in carmakers
continued during the session, and was extended after hours: BMW ended the
afternoon down DM15.50 at DM723.50, Daimler DM22 lower at DM714 and
Volkswagen DM9.40 off at DM400.60.
Apart from generalised institutional investment caution about cyclicals, and
the sector in particular, there were specific fears about VW, which slid to
new 1994 lows on a Spanish news report that its lossmaking Spanish
subsidiary, Seat, will not achieve breakeven before 1997. Nomura estimates -
that the company is trading on prospective p/e ratios of below 8 for 1995,
and under 5 for 1996 - fell on stony ground.
However, the chemicals and metals group, Degussa, did well ahead of today's
provisional results for the year to September 30. The shares rose DM3.50 to
DM427.50 on analysts' estimates of a 50 per cent increase in 1993-94
earnings.
PARIS bond markets were unnerved in the morning by the decision by Mr
Jacques Delors to drop out of the French presidential race, and weakened
further by the fall in US bonds in the European afternoon.
The weakness of the bond market hit equities, as elsewhere in Europe, and
was a major factor behind the 17.67 decline in the CAC 40 index to 1,919.32
in thin turnover of FFr2.74bn.
In the circumstances, the news that Assurances Generales de France (AGF) was
to be privatised early next year hit shares of the latter, which fell
FFr6.30 to FFr224.
Among other losers, Moulinex fell FFr5.70, or 5.4 per cent to FFr100.20
ahead of the appliance company's first half results tomorrow. However,
Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr4.90 to FFr461.10 in advance of a board meeting next
week.
ZURICH was lower in thin volume with early gains being given up as the
dollar tended easier. The SMI index fell 13.2 to 2,562.8.
UBS bearers fell SFr26 to SFr1,084, with the bank said to be among the main
sellers, as local press reports said that exceptionally heavy trading in the
registered shares in October had raised fresh questions about how UBS won
shareholder support for its unitary share plan. However, the bank rejected
any suggestion that it acted incorrectly. The registered shares slipped SFr6
to SFr244 but were still trading at a 12.5 per cent premium to the bearers.
Among second tier stocks, Interdiscount picked up SFr50 to SFr1,490 after
last week's fall. Ems Chemie dipped SFr90 to SKr3,770 and Sarna was SFr75
lower at SFr1,445.
OSLO saw profit-taking by short-term international investors after the gains
of the previous fortnight and the all-share index closed 5.49 down at 625.39
in turnover of NKr380m, about half the level of recent sessions.
Analysts commented that domestic institutions were holding back some
liquidity in the hope of lower prices and were expected to begin buying
before the index reached 610.
After the close of trading, the bourse announced the dismissal of its
director for unspecified irregularities which, it said, had nothing to do
with securities trading. However, brokers feared that the dismissal might
have a negative impact on international confidence.
WARSAW bounced after last week's steep decline, the Wig index recovering
430.3, or 6.2 per cent to 7,391.9 with turnover 20 per cent higher at
746.9bn zlotys. Brokers said that 6,900 had proved to be a strong support
level.

FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technical trading takes Dow
higher

Wall Street
US shares got an afternoon bounce from technical trading yesterday as
investors positioned themselves ahead of the release of important economic
statistics today and tomorrow, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.26 at 3,718.37. The
more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.50 at 449.47, the American
Stock Exchange composite gained 0.14 at 420.80 and the Nasdaq composite
gained 0.07 at 719.12. Trading volume on the NYSE was 287m shares.
Trading was light as investors waited for data on producer prices, consumer
prices and capacity utilisation due out today and tomorrow. Economists
expected all the figures to show a robust economy, which may send a shock
through the market as it could prompt the Federal Reserve to move sooner,
rather than later, to increase interest rates.
The Fed has already raised rates six times this year, and its chairman, Mr
Alan Greenspan, told a Congressional panel last week that he would continue
a tight monetary policy in order to hold the line against inflation.
In the mid-morning, IBM announced that it would halt shipment of all
personal computers based on the Pentium chip. This hit Intel, which makes
the Pentium microprocessor, and other large technology companies on the
Nasdaq, causing the index to lose almost 1 per cent of its value before
rebounding to close nearly flat.
Intel fell sharply and then regained some ground to close down Dollars 2 3/8
at Dollars 60 3/8 on the news. Also falling were Dell Computer and Gateway
2000 - both computer makers that have shipped a high percentage of
Pentium-based PCs. Dell dropped Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 38 5/8 and Gateway
slipped Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 22.
Shares in IBM fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 70 5/8 after the announcement and
following news that the US Supreme Court would not hear the computer maker's
appeal against a lower court ruling in an anti-trust case.
Woolworth gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8 after announcing that it had
recruited Mr Roger Farah as its chairman and chief executive. Mr Farah had
previously been head of Federated Department Stores and RH Macy.
Transco Energy gained Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 16 1/4 on news that it would
be purchased by the energy company, Williams.
Canada
Toronto held its ground, despite a weak Canadian dollar and heavy losses in
the Canadian bond market. The TSE 300 composite index added 10.76 points to
close at 4045.09 with losers over winners 393 to 352. The trading value of
CDollars 442.1m was down from Friday's CDollars 522.7m.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed 1.7 per cent higher in light trading after news that that
the Fipe inflation index had dropped to 2.6 per cent in the four week period
to December 8.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares closed 819 higher at 48,132
in thin turnover of RDollars 233m (Dollars 276.4m) as brokers noted that
falling inflation could trigger a new round of nominal interest rate cuts by
the central bank.

FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rally in Nikkei cut
short as Kuala Lumpur falls 1.7%

Japanese equities, ultimately, seemed depressed by events around the Pacific
Rim, the Nikkei index finishing little changed in thin trading, writes
Robert Patton in Tokyo.
Volume fell to an estimated 192m shares from the 492.94m traded on Friday.
The benchmark 225 average crept down 3.20 points to finish at 18,975.10. It
remained in a narrow range all day, moving between a high of 19,071.61 and a
low of 18,959.09.
The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 2.30 to 1,503.78, while
the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 ticked down 0.32 to 277.29.
Declining stocks outpaced gainers by 569 to 366 with 235 unchanged and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.56 to close at 1247.69.
Following its 201.74 drop on Friday the market made strong early gains,
largely on bargain hunting and fund manager buying for corporate employee
stock ownership plans. In the first 15 minutes of trading, the Nikkei took
more than 60 points of Friday's losses, but the absence of market moving
news undercut the rally and stocks quickly retreated from their early highs.
Some brokers felt that recent losses in Hong Kong and the collapse of Orange
County due to speculation in derivatives continued to weigh heavily on the
market.
Large capital stocks, including Japan Tobacco and some steelmakers, fell on
selling by foreign brokerage houses. Japan Tobacco made a new low since
privatisation of Y920,000, down Y20,000. East Japan Railway, which had just
suffered a crippling electrical failure which stranded thousands of weekend
passengers, finished unchanged at Y469,000. Nippon Steel shed Y9 to Y349.
Pharmaceuticals weakened. Takeda lost Y10 to Y1,190 and Taisho Y30 to
Y1,790. But most game equipment makers advanced. Matsushita Electric
Industrial, which announced that the next generation of its 64-bit 3DO/Real
machine would be driven by the IBM/Apple/Motorola PowerPC chip, edged up Y10
to Y1,580. Sony, which launched its 32-bit PlayStation last month, surged
Y100 to Y5,380; and Sega Enterprises, with its just announced, 32-bit Saturn
enjoying brisk sales, gained Y80 to Y5,740 as Nintendo fell Y100 to Y5,600.
Electric utilities weakened, then recovered to a degree. Tokyo Electric
Power revisited its 1994 low of Y2,750 before closing at Y2,760, off Y10.
Hokkaido Electric Power bounced back from a low of Y2,280 to finish
unchanged at Y2,300.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 97.73 to finish at 20,887.19 with 133.6m
shares changing hands.
Roundup
Concern about the effects of US price data due later in the week continued
to put the brake on some of the regional markets. Bangkok was closed for a
public holiday.
KUALA LUMPUR encountered further redemption-linked liquidation by foreign
institutions which, together with forced selling by clients unable to meet
margin calls, sent the the composite index down another 15.49 or 1.7 per
cent to a new closing low for the year of 895.77.
Tenaga Nasional's attempt at recovery was short-lived with the issue ending
down 10 cents at MDollars 9.55 after hitting an early high of MDollars 9.80.
Telekom Malaysia fared slightly better, closing up 10 cents at MDollars 16
after reaching a high of MDollars 16.30.
SINGAPORE failed to sustain a mild rebound as investors continued to
liquidate stocks. Sentiment was also depressed by the wave of selling in
Malaysian stocks.
The Straits Times Industrials index fell 10.59 to 2,091.69, after an
intra-day high of 2,108.07. Singapore Press Holding foreign shares fell
SDollars 1 or 3.9 per cent to SDollars 24.50 on a rumour that the company
would see lower investment income in the current financial year due to the
stock market's fall.
HONG KONG extended last week's 5.3 per cent decline, losing another 1 per
cent to finish at its lowest level since September 1993 on the view that
Wall Street faced further falls. The Hang Seng index closed 81.29 down at
7,707.78 after sinking to an intraday low of 7,670.83. Turnover was a
provisional HKDollars 2.44bn.
HSBC lost HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 80.25, Swire Pacific A dropped
HKDollars 2.50 or 5.5 per cent to HKDollars 42.60 and Henderson Land fell
HKDollars 1.20 to HKDollars 35.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell 24.99 or 2.5
per cent to 977.62.
BOMBAY fell 2.1 per cent after the rout of the Congress party in regional
elections, with brokers fearing a setback to the economic reform programme
launched by the prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao.
The BSE-30 share index, which opened 1.2 per cent lower, lost 83.39 to
3,884.48 with several foreign mutual funds said to be booking profits.
TAIPEI was mixed as positive corporate fundamentals were offset by investor
nervousness over sales by funds to meet year-end redemptions and dividends.
The weighted index closed down 0.11 at 6,722.40, off an intra-day high of
6,763.50 in moderate turnover of TDollars 60bn.
SEOUL rebounded after four days of declines, although profit-taking among
the blue chips emerged as soon as prices edged higher. The composite stock
index added 9.50 to 1,042.77.
Construction shares were in demand on active bargain-hunting combined with a
belief in a construction boom next year. Banking shares also gained momentum
on rotational buying. The Bank of Seoul went limit up, gaining Won400 to
Won7,880.
MANILA was lifted by late demand for oversold heavyweight issues, and the
composite index rose 12.17 to 2,619.83.
Petron led gainers as it advanced 1.3 per cent to 20 pesos.
SYDNEY was weaker in thin volume, the All Ordinaries index losing 8.9 to
1,842.0, as selling in the resources sector pared erased an early advance.
WELLINGTON was on hold ahead of today's monetary policy statement from the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the interest rate changes at both the
wholesale and retail level that result from it.
The NZSE-40 Capital index closed down 11.86 at 1,878.09 in very light
volume.
COLOMBO's market index fell 34.71, breaking through its 1,000-point support
level to 988.54, as the US and domestic interest rate outlook, compounded by
labour unrest in the country, prompted widespread sales.
JAKARTA closed 1.4 per cent lower in quiet trading with attention focused on
Indosat as it came under heavy pressure before finding support at around
Rp7,200.
The JKSE market index fell 6.33 to 447.76 as Indosat closed Rp375 or 4.9 per
cent lower at Rp7,225.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Lira and French franc weaken on political
worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political developments caused both the lira and the French franc to weaken
yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Worries about the Berlusconi government falling lay behind the lira falling
to a record low of L1,040 against the D-Mark. It eventually closed in London
at L1,039, from L1,033 on Friday.
The decision of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, not
to stand for the French presidency next year undermined the franc. It closed
at FFr3.439 against the D-Mark, from FFr3.430.
Amid quiet, pre-Christmas trading conditions, the other main movements were
in German and UK short term interest rate futures, which exhibited
generalised weakness.
Sterling had a quiet day. It finished marginally weaker against the stronger
D-Mark, closing at DM2.4597 from DM2.4601. Against the dollar, it closed at
Dollars 1.564 from Dollars 1.5597.
The dollar was weaker in Europe, closing at DM1.5728, from DM1.5773. Against
the yen, it closed at Y99.875 from Y100.165. Most investors stayed on the
sidelines, preferring to wait for market signals from US inflation releases,
today and tomorrow.
A New York Times report, suggesting that the Fed might wait until January,
or early February (instead of next week), to raise rates, prompted some
selling.
The franc came under selling pressure as the market reacted to Mr Delors's
announcement. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at HSBC Markets,
said the franc had weakened 'because Delors was seen as the candidate who
would have pushed hardest for closer European integration. He was a strong
supporter of the franc fort and, as the architect of the EMU convergence
criteria, sound on the public finances and inflation.'
He said Mr Delors would also have been the candidate most likely to defeat
the right-wing leader, Mr Jacques Chirac. 'Mr Chirac is seen as much more
sceptical about Europe and more willing to throw money at unemployment.'
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said Mr
Delors's decision had increased uncertainty in the short term, hence the
selling of francs.
'The market is also saying that we will have a squabble among right-wing
candidates, and could lead to lots of insults being hurled at the EU and the
idea of a single currency' he added.
In the longer term, Mr Persaud said he had 'no doubt that Mr Trichet
(governor of the Bank of France) would keep the franc closely linked to the
D-Mark, and monetary policy tight.'
Lira weakness was prompted by comments from Mr Roberto Maroni, interior
minister, and a member of the Northern league, who said he 'could envisage a
different government, with a different leadership, and a different
majority.'
His comments came ahead of the appearance today, before magistrates, of Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, to answer allegations of corruption.
They also come against the backdrop of Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern league
leader, saying the governing alliance, of which the league is a part, must
be reviewed.
Mr Persaud said lira weakness was also due to renewed strength in the
D-Mark, helped by recent data suggesting Germany's economy was one of the
strongest growing in Europe. 'That is disturbing for other European
countries because it means Germany may be raising rates much earlier than we
had anticipated.'
'It would certainly jeopardise some of the higher yielding European
currencies,' said Mr Persaud. Higher German interest rates would make it
more difficult for countries like Italy and Spain to attract capital
inflows.
Analysts were unable to explain the movements in sterling and D-Mark
futures. They stressed that volumes were low, making firm conclusions
difficult, and hence not too much should be made of the moves. 'It was a
case of mid-summer madness in December,' quipped one observer.
The D-Mark contracts set the tone for trading, with sterling simply
following suit. Traders said the pattern of German markets this week would
be set by developments in the US, particularly the inflation data.
The Bank of England supplied UK money markets with Pounds 936m of
assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn shortage. Overnight money moved
between 4 1/2 and 7 1/4 per cent.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal buyers face a sellers'
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese steel mills may reach agreement with their Australian and Canadian
suppliers this week. Price rises are inevitable but the risk faced by the
mills is that if no settlement is arrived at over the next few days, the
rises could be large.
Already one producer - Coal and Allied of New South Wales - has tabled a
demand for an increase of Dollars 6.90 a tonne. This seemed to the steel
producers more than a touch ambitious but in the ensuing weeks it has become
clear that 1995 is going to see price rises across the whole spectrum of
coal qualities.
All prices set to date for next year relate to steam coal - and almost all
for buyers in Europe. In contrast to previous years, when early settlements
set something close to a benchmark for all European buyers, 1995 prices have
steadily risen since the first agreement in October, between the Belgian
power company Electrabel and South African producers at around Dollars 30.50
a tonne, fob Richards Bay. Subsequent South African sales have been struck
at around Dollars 32 into Portugal and - for one customer suddenly facing a
shortfall - at around Dollars 37.00 to a German utility for a high calorific
value coal.
While no one expects contract prices to reach the heady levels seen on the
spot market, the rising trend was reinforced with some very large purchases
by Enel, the Italian power company, at Dollars 32.60, fob.
Two big power groups have yet to settle their South African business - Dutch
buyer GKE and Danish power producers Elsam and SK Power. The South Africans
are thought to expect very high levels from these customers, higher even
than the Enel price, not least to balance some of the very low prices that
these companies achieved for their 1994 deliveries. One South African
producer has already won a Dollars 10 price rise from the Danes, although
this came from a very low level, in the low Dollars 20s, for this year's
business.
The view that prices will rise throughout the period of settlement is backed
by the strength of the spot market with the McCloskey Coal Information
Services North-west Europe marker price having risen Dollars 1.49 to Dollars
42.22 between November and December. This rise is second highest ever
recorded in the index - the highest, of Dollars 1.84, was in the preceding
month.
The rise in the MCIS index reflects not only higher fob prices but also a
very strong ocean freight market. Some buyers, like National Power, saw the
threat of this rise back in the early summer and booked their shipping
tonnage according. Those who have waited or have still to settle, will pay
dear.
For the Australia coal producers, and the Australians are the most powerful
selling group in the Japanese coking coal negotiations, very few settlements
have been made with European power companies. Partly this reflects their
very robust price rise demands of Dollars 6 - at which one piece of business
has already been struck.
Their efforts to sustain a rising market will receive vigorous support from
the Colombian producer Carbocol, which has yet to settle any of its 1995
business. Its expectations match those of Australia, as does its belief that
producers should not be in any hurry; the biggest prizes are expected to
fall to those who wait.
No doubt these rises, which could well be sustained into 1996 and beyond,
will encourage those who have backed the RJB Mining bid for the English coal
mines. The RJB assumption for international prices is of Dollars 39, cif, a
tonne in 1998. But while today's international prices will close the gap
with UK costs, it is one of the oddities of the UK coal market that its
highest value product of house coal is in glut. This is partly a result of
the mild northern winter, but also reflects increased competition from
imports and from RJB's major UK competitor, Coal Investments.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RSPB attacks industrial fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial fishing in the North Sea is endangering the marine food chain and
should be phased out, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said
yesterday.
The RSPB, backed by a majority of UK fishermen, is campaigning for controls
on the upsurge in industrial fishing in the run-up to tomorrow's fisheries
debate in the House of Commons and next week's meeting of the European
Union's council of fisheries ministers.
Industrial fishing fleets catch small shoaling fish such as sandeels,
capelin and sprats, which are usually eaten by larger fish, seabirds and
dolphins. The small species are turned into fertiliser or feed for livestock
and farmed fish.
This type of fishing, carried out mainly by Denmark, now accounts for about
50 per cent of the total catch from the North Sea by weight, says the RSPB.
Landings of sandeels, which are not subject to quotas, have doubled over the
past 20 years to 800,000 tonnes a year and represent half the industrial
fishing catch in Europe.
The UK charity is calling for quotas for sandeels and for a ban on all
industrial fishing in areas where fish are spawning or where there are
important colonies of seabirds or other wildlife.
It also wants the UK to stop granting licences for industrial fishing and
says the European industrial fishing fleet should be phased out by
decommissioning vessels.
Fishery scientists have calculated that yields of commercially valuable fish
such as cod and haddock on the Dogger Bank, an important North Sea fishery,
would increase by 10-20 per cent if the Danes stopped catching sandeels
there.
Mr Euan Dunn, RSPB marine policy officer, said: 'Fish stock enhancement is a
compelling argument for the government to press for controls on industrial
fishing, especially at a time when it is investing heavily in other measures
like decommissioning to reduce fishermen's impact on roundfish stocks.'
One model for regulation is a government plan for restrictive quotas when
the sandeel fishery off the Shetland Islands is reopened next summer, he
said.
The fishery was closed in 1990 after a sharp fall in stocks, which had a
crippling impact on breeding of arctic terns, kittiwakes and puffins. The
Scottish Office is proposing a quota of 3,000 tonnes, based on the two
lowest annual catches of sandeels in the area before its closure.
