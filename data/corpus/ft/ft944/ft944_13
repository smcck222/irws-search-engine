FT  09 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool prices in the main international primary markets continue to fluctuate
narrowly. Finer merinos which eased just recently were unchanged or a
fraction dearer at this week's closing auctions in Australia, and prices for
middle range merino fleece have remained firm. The market indicator closed
down again on the week, at 768c/kg compared with 774c/kg, but the mid-week
quotation was 763c/kg. New Zealand crossbred prices eased more definitely,
with the indicator down 18 cents to 521c/kg. The overall impression is one
of a fairly firm market passing through a period of uncertainty. In the UK
sentiment has not been helped by the latest interest rate rise, which is
likely to depress consumer confidence further in an already fragile
situation.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME copper market recovers
strongly - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices staged a strong recovery at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday afternoon in expectation of a sizeable LME stocks fall being
announced today.
NICKEL edged lower on a report from the Norilsk mine at Talnakh, Russia,
that repair work was almost complete and the mine had been working at
capacity for three days. Power problems at Norilsk have been buoying nickel
prices for the past month.
ALUMINIUM took heart from copper's strength but a repeat of recent fund
liquidation capped the rise.
COFFEE futures ended down after speculators and jobbers liquidated long
positions built up ahead of Wednesday's Brazilian stock audit, which was in
line with recent estimates.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: VAW decides to shut Bavarian
aluminium smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEUSS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VAW will permanently shut its Toeging aluminium smelter in Bavaria at the
end of next year but the rest of its smelters in Germany have been reprieved
at least till the year 2000.
Mr Karl Wobbe, the VAW board member responsible for aluminium production,
said yesterday a sudden change in power availability in Germany played an
important part in the decision to keep open the smelters here, at Stade and
at Hamburg (the last is one third owned by VAW).
Various factors, such as the severe drop in industrial activity in the
former East Germany and closures in the country's chemical industry had
ended Germany's power shortage.
Electricity suppliers had offered power contracts to the Neuss and Hamburg
smelters to 2000 at prices that made them internationally competitive.
Negotiations were going on about the Stade smelters' contract but Mr Wobbe
was optimistic about the outcome. He was also optimistic about Neuss
surviving beyond 2000.
Costs had also been cut by the streamlining forced on VAW by the crisis in
the global aluminium industry, which last year saw the group cut its
workforce by 2,000 to about 14,000.
However the Toeging smelter, despite being supplied by hydro-electric power
and using modern technology, could not be made competitive because its
essential raw material, alumina, had to be trucked 600km through Germany,
which was much more expensive than shipping the material to other smelters
from Australia.
Toeging's annual capacity is 90,000 tonnes but at present it is producing
only 30,000 tonnes. The smelter, which as recently as 1989 employed 850 will
be converted into a recycling plant with 100 employees.
The Neuss smelters annual capacity is 210,000 tonnes but output is more than
10 per cent below that because VAW has joined in the round of global
production cuts that followed the international trade agreement between some
aluminium producing countries, signed in February in Brussels.
Stade's capacity is 70,000 tonnes but it is operating at 10 per cent below
that. VAW operates the Hamburg smelter, where Reynolds Metals of the US and
Austria Metall own the other two thirds equally between them.
Mr Wobbe said despite the recent sharp improvement in aluminium prices, VAW
would continue to keep to the spirit of the February agreement and he felt
other big producers would do the same. That suggested capacity would not be
reactivated before the middle of next year.
VAW also has a 20 per cent shareholding and is operator of the Alouette
smelter in Quebec. Mr Wobbe said Quebec Hydro had given the partners an
extension to March to make up their minds about taking up an option on low
cost power and to more than double the smelters' capacity to 460,000 tonnes.
Many of the partners were in favour of the expansion, which would cost
USDollars 1bn and be completed by 1998. The project made excellent economic
sense but VAW would not need extra metal as early as that and strategically
his group would prefer to spend its capital on downstream operations closer
to the ultimate consumer. Nevertheless, VAW was looking for ways to remain
involved in the Alouette expansion, he said.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia plans to step up oil
exports as output tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is to increase its exports of oil - in spite of still tumbling oil
production. At the same time, Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, has
made a strong plea for extra financing from the budget to invest in the
industry.
Ministers are now counting on energy exports doubling in the next 10-15
years, as part of a strategic decision to export oil in order to raise funds
for the modernisation of the industry.
Oil exports are expected to amount to 85m tonnes this year (80m tonnes in
1993) while gas exports should hold steady at about 100bn cu m, according to
Mr Vitaly Bushuyev, the deputy energy minister.
These aspirations assume cutting back further on sales to the former Soviet
states, most of which cannot afford to pay world prices for their oil - and
on restricting the supply to the domestic market by energy saving measures.
'The most important part of the strategy is increasing the efficiency of
energy consumption,' Mr Shafranik told a commission of ministers on
Wednesday.
Figures released yesterday to the official news agency, Tass, show some
275.2m tonnes produced from January to November this year - down 12 per cent
on the same period last year. Gas production was also down, but much less
markedly, at 549.8bn cu metres, a 2.1 per cent fall.
The production of the main Russian oil companies was: Rosneft (a holding
company including several enterprises), 111.4m tonnes; Lukoil, 39.9m tonnes;
Sidako, 31.8m tonnes; and Yukos, 24,8m tonnes.
Mr Shafranik, also in comments to TASS, warned that at least Rbs24,000bn
(Pounds 4.7bn) were needed for modernisation and reconstruction schemes this
year. The coal sector, he said, was in particular need of modernisation -
and of the closing down of exhausted pits, something the coal industry
committee has yet to tackle.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar market 'could go higher'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sugar market could move higher in coming months after breaking through a
four-year high of 15 cents a pound recently, according to the latest
analysis of the market by ED&amp;F Man, the London commodities house.
'In this situation, even routine offtake is enough to reinforce the
underlying support for prices,' the report says.
But a market report from the International Sugar Organisation, which
represents the world's leading producers, cautions against expectations of
big price increases. The organisation believes that price growth above 15
cents a pound will 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive
importers which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade'.
Purchases from China have fuelled much of the excitement in the sugar market
in recent months. The country is facing shortages of sugar after its second
successive domestic shortfall in supply of over 1m tonnes.
Russia is also likely to import sugar this season following a 40 per cent
drop in the beet harvest to 1.5m tonnes. ED &amp; F. Man estimates consumption
at 4.5m-4.8m tonnes, indicating a need for substantial imports.
The sugar organisation estimates that the 1994-95 world sugar balance will
be in deficit by 1.9m tonnes with production at 112.5m tonnes and
consumption at 114.4m tonnes. But it points to the fact that the current and
previous deficits must be viewed in the context of surplus output in the
preceding two cycles.
'Thus the present situation is tight but we believe still manageable in
statistical terms,' the organisation says.
Man agrees that global supply tightness may have been exaggerated to some
extent. But in the medium term points to 'further upside potential' on the
back of Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern offtake.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Concerns linger over seabed
settlement - Doubts about the effectiveness of a new UN authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the back-slapping and mutual congratulations on a job well done, some
long-standing concerns lingered after last month's inaugural meeting of the
International Seabed Authority.
Uncertainty remains about how well the new United Nations agency, which will
monitor the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the international seabed,
will implement the Law of the Sea Convention, the broad treaty which took 12
years of contentious negotiation before it could be kneaded into a shape
digestible to all UN members.
Despite this, there is consensus that the treaty, and the establishment of
the ISA, was no mean achievement.
The prevailing sentiment was captured at the inauguration by Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general. 'The convention is a repudiation of
the pursuit of progress through a competition for spoils,' he said. 'It is a
rejection of the notion that economic might can transcend fundamental
national rights. It is a strong disavowal of the tactics of gun-boat
development. This is a historic day.'
The creation of the Authority was made possible by changes to a section
(Part X1) of the convention, which was adopted by the UN in July. It went a
long way towards meeting the competing demands of developing and
industrialised countries about how best to share the trillions of dollars
worth of polymetallic nodules that are lying on the international seabed,
outside the economic zone of any country.
The nodules contain copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, and a variety of
other minerals.
With the resources of the international seabed having been declared the
'common heritage of mankind' by the UN, developing countries wanted a treaty
that would guarantee that they would benefit from deep seabed mining,
despite their lacking the technology and financial resources. This 'parallel
system' for sharing concerned the governments of industrialised countries,
who argued against a government-controlled agency that would not adhere to
market principles.
The Part X1 compromise aims at resolving problems relating to the deep
seabed mining provisions of the treaty, including the costs to some
countries, the mandatory transfer of technology, production policies,
financial terms of mining contracts, and the conduct of the Enterprise, the
economic arm of the Seabed Authority.
'We still have problems with Part X1,' said Mr Joseph Warioba of Tanzania,
one of the architects of the convention. 'Some say it has killed the
parallel system, while others say it has removed obstacles so that many
states have accepted the Convention.'
The changes appear to have done neither for the US, one of the harshest
critics of the early efforts to fashion the treaty and establish the ISA.
While the convention is important for securing solutions to the problems of
the use and conservation of the oceans, said Mr Wesley Scholz, leader of the
US delegation to the ISA, there are three factors which will determine
broad-based support for the authority.
'First is the recognition of the importance of free market principles,' he
said. 'Second is the recognition that those with major economic interests
affected by the actions taken by the authority must be given a role
commensurate with those interests.
'Third is the recognition that the evolution of the International Seabed
Authority and the elaborating of the regime for commercial purposes must be
in response to the evolution of commercial interests in mining.'
Mr Scholz warned against over-regulation of seabed mining, interference in
the market, excessive fees and taxes and political interference, saying the
authority should act in a manner that would earn the confidence of potential
investors.
Delegates from several developing countries said the US position was not
new, but was surprising in the light of 'magnanimous' concessions made by
the developing countries to satisfy the concerns of industrial states.
China, which has already invested heavily in deep seabed mining, admitted
that the convention was an imperfect instrument.
The industrialised countries, which have or can develop the technology for
deep seabed mining, do not all appear as concerned as the US about the
future operations of the ISA. The European Union 'is looking forward to
co-operating fully with other members of the authority, and trying to ensure
that the system works effectively and efficiently,' said Mr Tono Eitel,
chairman of the German delegation, who spoke on behalf of the EU.
By all indications, Japan is satisfied with the agreement reached for mining
the international seabed. 'By streamlining the structure of the authority
and removing excessive regulations. . . the agreement provides an
economically sound and viable framework which will improve the climate for
investing in deep seabed mining,' said Mr Hisashi Owada, Japan's permanent
representative to the UN. 'The development of deep seabed mineral resources
is of considerable importance to Japan, whose economy relies on imports of
such metals as manganese, cobalt and nickel, which can be produced from
polymetallic nodules.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Sweden to resume index-linked
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden said yesterday it would resume index-linked treasury bond issues in
the new year.
'We have now left the worst market turbulence behind us, as well as sources
of unrest such as the general election and the EU referendum,' said Mr
Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office. Sweden
is the world's biggest sovereign issuer on international bond markets.
The debt office raised SKr3bn by issuing index-linked bonds in the spring,
but it had to abandon the practice during the summer because of Swedish bond
market turbulence. It was the first time that a bond linked to the Swedish
consumer price index had been launched.
The debt office says index-linked bonds lower its funding costs providing
inflation remains low while covering investors 'against unanticipated
increases in the inflation rate'. Investors in fixed-rate Swedish bonds have
been demanding a risk premium on fears of a resurgence in inflation. Swedish
inflation is currently 3 per cent, while the benchmark five-year bond yields
10.34 per cent.
The debt office aims to raise about SKr7bn through a series of index-linked
bond auctions in the first four months of next year. In the first issue,
planned for January 16, bonds with a nominal value of SKr1bn will be
offered.
There will be a new tranche in an existing 20-year loan and a new 10-year
loan. Sweden has a total of SKr500bn of treasury bonds outstanding.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Eddie George's view on inflation heartens
gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds were heartened by reassuring comments yesterday on
inflation from the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, who
said it would reach a plateau soon.
Gilts had opened weaker but then rose on his comments, with one dealer
saying prices were marked up by about  3/8 of a point.
The 'mini-budget' by chancellor Kenneth Clarke seemed to leave gilt prices
largely unmoved, although some dealers were quick to point out that the
increase in the tax on drinks would take effect from January, whereas the
now-abandoned fuel tax increase which it replaced would not have taken
effect until April.
However, some estimates suggest that while the tax on fuel would have added
0.5 of a point to inflation, the taxes which replace it would add 0.2 or 0.3
of a point to inflation.
Mr Adam Chester at Yamaichi said the 'mini-budget' left the inflation
outlook 'broadly unchanged'.
By the end of the day the December long gilt future had moved up  1/8 of a
point to trade around 101 13/32 . The spread over bunds had moved to about
131 basis points.
Trading was slow, with dealers reporting some switching out of gilts as the
spread over bunds approached 128. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'Buying has
trickled away. People are waiting for next week's data.'
There is a raft of data due out in the UK next week, with producer prices on
Monday, earnings and inflation figures on Wednesday, retail sales figures on
Thursday and the public sector borrowing requirement on Friday.
Mr Chester said: 'I think it will be another welcome set of data for the
market.' He thinks the gilt market will enter the new year on a reasonably
firm note.
Analysts said most big investment decisions would probably be driven by the
data due out in the UK next week and the data due from the US, rather than
recent political developments.
German government bonds opened weaker on third-quarter gross domestic
product figures but then rose slightly.
The third-quarter GDP figure was 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, against
market expectations of around 1 per cent.
Mr Paul Campayne at Paribas Capital Markets said: 'There is very little
momentum or activity. A lot of domestic investors have closed their books
for the year, and the market will probably stay in range-bound trading.'
He said that while bunds had been hit by the stronger-than-expected GDP
figure, there was evidence of technical support for bunds at the 90 level.
The March bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.08 on the day to 90.29.
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday in thin trading as investors
continued to sort through signs that the Federal Reserve intends to raise
interest rates again in the near term and ramifications of the bankruptcy of
Orange County, California.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/32 at
95 13/16 , yielding 7.859 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 9/16 , yielding 7.473 percent.
With little economic news out yesterday, the market focused on Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan's Wednesday testimony to Congress' joint economic committee.
Mr Greenspan said he was concerned that inflationary pressures would
ultimately be reflected in rising consumer prices.
Investors interpreted the testimony as a signal that the Fed would boost
interest rates again by early next year. The Fed has already raised rates
six times this year.
The interest rate fearsled to a sell-off of short-term bonds. The long end
of the market, however, firmed as the market judged that the Fed's actions
would slow the economy.
At one point, the decoupling of the long and short term segments of the
market pushed the spread between the two-year and 30-year bonds down nearly
35 basis points, before it bounced back close to where it was late on
Wednesday.
The long end also gained support from the dollar, which rose against the
Japanese yen and the D-Mark. A rising dollar helps the market by encouraging
foreign investors to put their money in US government securities such as
Treasury bonds.
Also troubling the market were concerns about the fall-out from the
financial troubles of Orange County - the largest municipality ever to
declare itself bankrupt. Investors fear other counties may face similar
difficulties.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Heinz joins high profile string with
Dollars 300m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar-denominated offerings dominated the eurobond market yesterday in
spite of volatility in the eurodollar market caused by fears that Orange
County, California, would be forced to liquidate its Dollars 7.5bn bond
fund.
This fuelled fears that a flood of bonds would flow on to international
markets, and spreads in the dollar market widened significantly. Orange
County filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday evening after being hit by a loss of
Dollars 1.5bn from its dealings in the bond market.
In spite of the volatility, another US corporate borrower moved yesterday to
exploit the relatively low cost of borrowing currently available in the
eurodollar market.
H. J. Heinz, the US food group, launched a Dollars 300m offering of
three-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 27 basis points over US Treasury
bonds of the same maturity.
This is the latest in a string of offerings by high-profile US corporate
borrowers who have taken advantage of the strong demand for their credit
among European retail investors.
This enables them to achieve funding at up to 10 basis points below that
available in the US domestic bond market.
'US investors focus closely on the borrower's credit rating and on the
spread being offered, whereas European investors look to the coupon and to
the name. And these are great names,' said one dealer in London.
'Borrowers can get funding at a price significantly better than their
credit-rating warrants,' he said.
A deal brought at around 27 basis points over US Treasuries in the
euromarkets would require a price to yield at least 35 basis points in the
US market, one dealer estimated.
Walt Disney and PepsiCo both turned to the eurodollar market last week with
Dollars 300m and Dollars 250m offerings respectively, both targeted at
European retail investors.
The Heinz offering found a similar pattern of demand, lead manager Goldman
Sachs said. 'There was some UK institutional interest but primarily the
bonds were sold to Swiss retail investors,' a syndicate official said.
Heinz last came to the eurodollar market in 1988.
Kyushu Electric Power, the Aa1-rated Japanese electric power company,
launched a Dollars 300m offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds priced to
yield 33 basis points over US Treasuries.
This was the first electric power company to come to the US dollar market
since July 1993, traders said.
'Most of the electric utilities have been doing their funding in yen over
the last year because of the attractive rates available on fixed-yen. But
the attractiveness of yen is now and the dollar market is coming back into
vogue again,' said one trader.
'As a result, we expect to see more Japanese electricity companies coming to
the market in January and February,' he said.
Demand for the offering came from European and Japanese institutional
investors, joint lead manager IBJ said.
Syndicate managers said that the spread of 33 basis points was wider than
initially anticipated due to the general widening of spreads on the back of
worries over Orange County.
South Africa's Dollars 750m global offering was priced at 193 basis points,
at the lower end of its 193 to 198 basis point launch spread.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a Baa3 rating to the global
bond issue.

Merrill Lynch, global co-ordinator of last month's share offering by Finnish

Underwriters of a Dollars 700m loan to a Saudi petrochemical project hope to
take the loan to general syndication early next year, bankers said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai.
They said the loan for the Saudi-US joint venture Saudi Petrochemical
(Sadaf) would be governed by English rather than Saudi law.
'The deal is attractive to banks because Sadaf's credit is good and because
of the English law,' one said.
Bankers said Citibank and Chase Manhattan have joined the underwriters with
Dollars 100m each. The other six underwriters had committed themselves to
Dollars 500m. The bankers said the 8 1/2 -year loan will be priced at 125
basis points over Libor.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Restructure helps James Hardie

James Hardie, the Australian building materials group undergoing a
comprehensive restructuring and management changes, yesterday reported
improved profits for the six months to end-September, at ADollars 37.1m
(USDollars 30.2m) after tax. The company said it was firmly on track to
achieve its forecast of a strong recovery in profits for the full year.
The first-half figure was almost double last time's ADollars 19.5m, and
scored on sales up to ADollars 955.4m from ADollars 862.9m. Earnings per
share for the first half were 9.9 cents, compared with 5.3 cents in the
first half of 1993-94. The interim dividend goes up to 6.5 cents from 6
cents.
Hardie attributed the improvement to its extensive restructuring programme,
and more focus on the core building sector markets.
It said all divisions had posted better results, with the exception of James
Hardie Pipelines in Australia. Here, PVC costs increases and 'unruly trading
conditions' ate into margins.
It said a number of divisions which had made losses last time moved into the
black. These included the bathroom products division, the New Zealand
building services operations and the irrigation unit in Australia.
There were gains in the US, where Hardie posted an operating profit of
ADollars 10.9m, on sales of ADollars 172m.
The bottom-line figures were also helped by lower interest charges, down to
ADollars 7.9m from ADollars 10.1m.
Hardie shares closed unchanged at ADollars 1.96 yesterday.
Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian-based soft drinks company which is 51 per
cent owned by the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola group, said yesterday it was about
to start manufacturing soft drink products in the Ukraine, in a joint
venture with the Kolos brewery in L'viv.
The production company will be 57 per cent owned by CCA and 43 per cent by
Kolos, with CCA granted management rights.
Its capital will be about USDollars 11.5m.
CCA has been building interests in central and eastern Europe, and has
representation in Austria, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak republics. This
year, it announced moves into Belarus and Slovenia, and is in talks to
acquire companies supplying Coca-Cola products to much of Poland.
The company said a wholly-owned sales and distribution operation was
supplying Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, from Hungarian bottling plants, but
the L'viv plant, which was close to completion, would service the western
part of the country.

MacPhail Holdings, the South African coal distributor, said it planned a
rights issue in early 1995 as the first step in a local and international
expansion programme, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
At a meeting on January 6 shareholders would be asked to approve a proposal
to increase authorised share capital to R15m (Dollars 4m) divided into 30m
ordinary shares of 50 cents each, the company said in a statement. 'Subject
to this approval the company will then proceed with a rights offer early in
the new year.'
The proceeds would be mainly used to repay short-term debt which the company
said was raised earlier to fund two essential growth projects, continued
expansion of its materials handling infrastructure, and an investment in a
new bulk coal distribution centre on the East Rand. The rights offer would
also provide additional working capital to fund stockpiling ahead of the
1995 winter.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson steps into private
arena - The flotation paves the way for further injections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-Thomson, the Franco- Italian semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday
launched an offer of up to 19 per cent of its shares on the New York and
Paris stock markets, and took its first step out of state ownership.
It seems a far cry from 1987 when two state-owned companies - Thomson
Semiconductors of France and SGS Microelectronics of Italy - decided to pool
their resources in an attempt to fight back against US and Japanese
competition, and pull themselves out of a trough of financial problems and
declining market share. At the time, the challenge of making the joint
venture work seemed a particularly tough one. As one analyst puts it: 'If
you can't turn a semiconductor company round in five years, you're lost.'
However, seven years on, SGS-Thomson is nearing the top 10 in the
semiconductor sector.
Mr Bill McClean, vice-president of Integrated Circuit Engineering, the
Arizona-based industry research and consultancy group, forecasts sales
growth of about 30 per cent this year - from Dollars 2.04bn in 1993 - which
makes the company the 11th or 12th biggest company in the industry. 'They
are definitely regarded as a serious competitor by the dominant US and
Japanese groups,' according to Mr McClean.
Helped by the recent upswing in the cyclical semiconductor industry,
SGS-Thomson has seen profits jump to Dollars 253.3m for the first nine
months of this year, nearly double the figure for the same period in 1993.
Investment in new plant and fast-growing technologies, diversity of products
and geographical spread have improved the group's medium-term prospects.
For example, SGS-Thomson produces mixed signal devices - which combine
analog and digital systems and whose uses range from cars to telecoms -
Eproms and Flash memories. The company is the world's biggest producer of
Eproms, non-volatile semiconductors in which memory is retained once the
power source has been removed, and has pushed ahead with the development of
the next generation Flash products, helped by its pre-eminence in Eproms.
The group is taking an aggressive step in the microprocessor market.
In April, it announced it was collaborating with Cyrix of the US to produce
microprocessors. The project faces potential legal hurdles because of court
battles between Cyrix and Intel, the dominant microprocessor manufacturer,
which is seeking to protect its patent rights.
However, most observers believe it is a significant strategic move for
SGS-Thomson. 'They have the capacity in place at their Phoenix plant and
they should be up and running pretty quickly,' says one Paris-based analyst.
'This is critical because the timing will be vital in winning market share.'
As for geographical spread, 'unlike Phillips and Siemens, which are still
fairly reliant on Europe, they have a pretty well-balanced exposure,' says
one electronics analyst at a French merchant bank.
Like its European counterparts SGS-Thomson still faces a problem of size. Mr
Mike Glennon, semiconductor analyst at Dataquest, the UK technology research
consultancy, says there are three fundamental elements to success in the
microprocessor market: produce an industry-standard product; sort out patent
issues with Intel; and make sure you have the ability to produce to meet
market demand. 'You need to be able to invest millions of dollars because
manufacturing plant costs in the region of Dollars 1bn,' he says. 'The 'in
between' position is going to be tough,' adds Mr McClean, who believes
SGS-Thomson needs to 'get big, and keep rolling'.
Mr Pasquale Pistorio, the company's Italian chairman, sketches a scenario in
which the financial and technological requirements of the sector will divide
it into two broad categories - general, broad-range semiconductor suppliers
and small specialist producers. The dividing line, he believes, will be
determined by market share and the crucial level will be about 5 per cent, a
few points higher than his company's present slice of the market.
To lift the company out of what he describes as 'the grey zone', Mr Pistorio
has pursued a policy of expansion. This has meant strengthening the group's
capital base. Last year, SGS-Thomson received two capital injections of each
from its state shareholders, reducing debts to about Dollars 275.5m at the
beginning of this year, compared with a peak of about Dollars 904m at the
end of 1991.
Such financing has prompted criticism from US rivals, who oppose the state
financing of their European competitor, but it is no longer an option
because of budget pressures on both the Italian and French governments.
Hence the move to the market. The initial offering of shares - 16.3 per cent
of the total number - should net receipts of about Dollars 470m. More
importantly, it prepares the path for further capital injections from
private shareholders and an eventual move from public sector control.
The French industry ministry describes such a scenario as premature.
However, the Italian and French governments are both enacting an ambitious
programme of privatisation aimed at easing the financial burden of the
state's involvement in industry.
In many cases flotation is followed by privatisation. The capital
requirements of SGS-Thomson and the industry in which it is competing,
suggest it may follow a similar course.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T forced to issue results for
one month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T has been forced for the first time to publish financial results for a
single month.
This is a consequence of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
regulations relating to the 35.86m AT&amp;T shares held by British
Telecommunications as a result of AT&amp;T's merger with McCaw Cellular
Communications announced last year and which BT wishes to sell.
AT&amp;T said in October it had net income of Dollars 429m, or 27 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 6.28bn but warned against drawing conclusions about
the full quarter on one month's results.
It said the figures reflected the trend for the first nine months. Full-year
results are expected in late January.
BT last year held a 17 per cent stake in McCaw which it intended to sell; on
the merger in September this year it received an equivalent number of AT&amp;T
shares. It has always said it did not intend to hold its rival's shares on a
long-term basis.
AT&amp;T yesterday filed a registration statement with the SEC as a prerequisite
to BT's disposal of its shares through an underwritten public offering. The
holding was valued this week at about Dollars 1.7bn. At the time of the
merger announcement the shares were valued at Dollars 2.2bn.
The timing of the sale remains at BT's disposal. Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley have been appointed lead managers for the offering.

Worldsource involves no equity exchange, but is an attempt by AT&amp;T to

National Semiconductor, the US chip maker, yesterday reported improved
second-quarter net income, up at Dollars 67m from Dollars 60m on sales up
slightly to Dollars 584m from Dollars 582m, Agencies report.
For the half year, net climbed to Dollars 126m from Dollars 117m, which
included a gain of Dollars 4.9m for the cumulative effect of an accounting
change. Half-year sales were virtually flat.
National Semiconductor said: 'New order rates are up 20 per cent to 25 per

support our moving and shaping markets.'
The company said analog and mixed signal products represented 56 per cent of
total sales in the second quarter, compared with 52 per cent a year ago, and
orders for analog and mixed signal devices were up more than 35 per cent.
The company also said its power management segment led bookings growth with
additional strength shown by our Super I/O and local area network product
lines.
National Semiconductor said: 'Orders improved throughout the (latest)
quarter, with November showing strong results.'
Intel, the leading US microprocessor manufacturer, has announced plans to
build a new chip manufacturing and development plant in Hillsboro, Oregon,
spending Dollars 565m on the first phase, Reuter reports from Hillsboro.
That phase, to begin immediately, will include a 500,000 sq ft wafer
fabrication facility, and office and support buildings. Intel expects
completion by 1997.

Lufthansa, the German airline, is on course to post a parent-company pre-tax
profit for the fourth quarter and resume paying dividends for the full year,
AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. It also said it was taking a stake in a
Frankfurt-based travel company.
The airline confirmed parent-company nine-month pre-tax profit of DM325m
(Dollars 207m). Lufthansa does not publish group figures on a quarterly
basis.
In November, it predicted it would post a profit for the full year and
resume the payout.
The airline said a report given by Mr Jurgen Weber, management board
chairman, at the final meeting of its supervisory board showed that
Lufthansa's cost-cutting measures, begun 10 months ago, had continued to be
successful.
It also said it planned to take a 25 per cent stake in Alpha Holding tourism
company, as well as an option to buy a further 5 per cent. The move is aimed
at strengthening the tourism business of Lufthansa's Condor charter unit.
Alpha Holding includes the wholly-owned unit Air Marin Flugreisen, which
organises trips. Alpha Reisebueros, the travel bureau chain, also belongs to
the holding group.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Shares in US airlines plunge on
profit warnings

Shares in Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines, two of the biggest US
carriers, plunged to 12-month lows yesterday after the companies warned
their fourth-quarter results would be badly hit by fare wars in the US
market.
Other airline stocks took a hammering as gloom over the industry's prospects
reasserted itself. Earlier this year a spate of good results had given rise
to hopes that the sector was recovering from years of losses caused by
overcapacity and cut-throat competition.
The biggest disappointment came from Southwest Airlines, which until now had
enjoyed a long period of unusually strong profits growth by offering
no-frills services at fares well below those of other airlines.
Southwest was able to offer these low fares because its costs were much
lower than those of the other big carriers. But the other airlines have been
hitting back, trying to mimic the Southwest formula with their own low-cost
services and forcing Southwest's fares even lower.
On Wednesday, Southwest warned that its passenger yield - the average fare
per passenger per mile - could be down by as much as 9 per cent in the
fourth quarter, resulting in net earnings well below the comparable period's
26 cents a share.
Its shares closed Dollars 3 down at Dollars 16 7/8 yesterday, a fall of 15
per cent.
Shares in Continental Airlines were even worse hit - at the close, they were
down Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 8 7/8 , a fall of 35 per cent - after the
company warned that losses in the fourth quarter would be significantly
deeper than expected and capacity would be reduced by 7 per cent in January
as a result.
Analysts had already been predicting a loss of 70 cents a share for
Continental because the airline's no-frills Continental Lite service,
launched last year as a rival to the services offered by Southwest Airlines
and other low-cost carriers, has run into difficulties.
Airline stocks sank on fare wars fears. UAL, United Airlines' parent, was
down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 87 5/8; AMR, American Airlines' parent, was
down Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 48 3/4; USAir was down Dollars 1/8 at Dollars
4 3/8; and Delta Air Lines was down Dollars 2 at Dollars 46 1/4.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: US investors put pressure on
Dylex to restructure board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of US investors appears to be on the verge of forcing Dylex, one of
Canada's biggest fashion retailers, to accept new corporate governance
rules, including a shake-up of its board.
River Road, a Connecticut-based limited partnership which owns about 13 per
cent of Dylex, has been putting pressure for some time on members of the
Posluns family, who hold a majority of the group's voting shares. River Road
is controlled by the Paloma Group, a widely-held investment fund.
'We feel that Dylex has been under-performing given its asset base and
potential,' Mr Bob Poile, River Road general partner, said yesterday. Dylex
owns about 1,000 stores in Canada and the US, with 1993 sales of CDollars
1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn). But it had losses totalling CDollars 140m in four
of the past five years.
The outside investors' disquiet centres on Dylex's unwieldy 18-member board,
most of whom are members of the Posluns family, their advisers and senior
Dylex managers. 'We're looking to shake up the status quo and get a new
board in place,' Mr Poile said.
The company's three independent directors are expected to echo these
concerns in a report, which is due to be released later this month.
River Road cemented its position earlier this week by buying all Dylex's
Class C preference shares. These shares are convertible into Class A
preference shares.
Class A shareholders will gain voting rights at the end of this month if
Dylex fails to reinstate dividends on the stock, which were suspended almost
two years ago.
The outside investors were concerned that the Posluns and their allies would
use their voting control to approve a dividend. However, Mr Wilfred Posluns,
chairman and chief executive, said that 'any indication that we would oppose
the elimination of the next dividend payment is erroneous'.

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Unisource, a consortium of European
telecoms operators, are thought to be close to announcing a joint venture
aimed at Europe's telecommunications market.
Yesterday, neither company would comment on reports that they would announce
the formation of the company next week. The telecoms industry, however, has
been expecting the move since AT&amp;T and Unisource became partners in the US
company's Worldsource venture earlier this year.
Worldsource involves no equity exchange, but is an attempt by AT&amp;T to
marshall leading operators to help provide its international business
services. Worldsource is strong in the Asia Pacific region where its
partners include Singapore Telecom and Telstra, the Australian operator, but
weak in Europe.
A joint venture between AT&amp;T and Unisource, which comprises the national
carriers of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, moves a step beyond
this marketing affiliation. Press reports suggest Unisource would have a 60
per cent shareholding.

<TEXT>
Wasserstein Perella, the US financial house, has emerged as a large investor
in the privatisation of Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer.
Wasserstein is the single largest member of a consortium headed by Bozano
Simonsen, the Brazilian investment bank, which won control of Embraer at an
auction at the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
The consortium, which will control 45 per cent of the voting stock, is made
up of Wasserstein Perella, which holds 41 per cent of the consortium's
shares, and the pension funds of the government-controlled companies
Telebras and Banco do Brasil, which together hold about half the capital.
The rest of the consortium is made up of Bozano Simonsen and a foundation of
Cesp, a state-controlled electricity company.
Mr Paulo Ferraz, chief executive officer of Bozano Simonsen, said that
Wasserstein, partly-owned by the Japanese financial house Nomura, had been
examining Embraer for some time and was acting as an investor and not as a
representative of other overseas buyers.
Hundreds of riot police and troops with machine guns closed streets around
the exchange before the sale, after fears of demonstrations by disgruntled
workers. However, the auction passed off peacefully.

deals

<TEXT>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said yesterday it would create a centralised
trade processing organisation for the large over-the-counter market in
interest rate swaps. The CME plan offers swaps dealers trade valuation and
collateral depository services, while stopping short of clearing or
guaranteeing transactions.
The exchange, whose membership includes most of the world's top swaps
dealers, said the swaps collateral depository would help increase the
stability and security of derivatives transactions worldwide. However, swaps
dealers said the CME's facility would attract business only if less
expensive than the current system, where dealers process their own swaps
trades bi-laterally.
Several banks and derivatives dealers have attempted to organise similar
swaps-processing services. However, competitive concerns have limited their
use. The CME will be the first independent entity with enough experience to
offer swaps processing services.
The exchange has two high-profile partners for the venture. The
international bank data communications and processing system, known as Swift
(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) will be used
to deliver the transactions to the CME depository.
The depository will use software supplied by SunGard Capital Markets to
value, or 'mark to market', the transactions and administer the collateral.
The Swift message system and the SunGard software are widely used in the
global derivatives industry.
CME officials said they expect the collateral depository would be organised
as a separate legal entity and would open for business next autumn.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Foreigners lift Wall Street
blues - Bankers are thankful for overseas IPOs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the market for initial public offerings of stock (IPOs) in the US
suffering a sharp drop in activity this year because of rising interest
rates and a slumping stock market, Wall Street investment bankers have been
thankful for one thing: sustained interest from foreign companies in seeking
US listings for their shares.
Although US companies raised only Dollars 25.8bn in the first 11 months of
this year - well down on 1993's record total of Dollars 40.8bn - the volume
of flotations by foreign companies is up on a year ago, albeit only
slightly. Foreign issuers - many of them newly-privatised companies of Latin
America and Europe - have already raised Dollars 5.8bn this year, and are on
target to just exceed 1993's record 12-month volume of Dollars 6.3bn.
Apart from the international side, however, the IPO market remains
disheartened, mostly because the secondary market is in such a sorry state.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 6 per cent since approaching
its year high in late October, and investors are fearful that the Federal
Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy this year will undermine
economic growth and corporate profitability.
In expectation of further rate increases and lower earnings, some investors
have begun to switch funds out of stocks and into fixed-income investments,
where yields are higher. To Wall Street underwriters, this is worrying:
mutual funds have been big buyers of IPOs in recent years. Mr Ernesto Cruz,
head of equity capital markets for North and South America at CS First
Boston, says: 'The material that fuels the IPO mutual fund buyer is cash
inflows, and they are slowing down as individual investors become cautious
about putting further money to work in the stock market.'
Against this background, selling new paper is likely to be difficult.
Although contraction in US economic and earnings growth will not affect the
performance of foreign equities, the market's sourness may reduce demand for
non-US IPOs. Increasingly wary investors are likely to adopt a safety-first
approach - and among US institutions and individuals, foreign stocks do not
top the list of low-risk investment vehicles.
However, many investment bankers on Wall Street believe that US investors'
interest in foreign stocks is less fickle than it was. Although investors
have been looking overseas because returns there have looked more promising
than at home, growing demand for non-US issues has reflected their eagerness
for diversification.
Mr Tom Davies, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch, the world's
busiest underwriter, says: 'There is a pretty strong desire on the part of
US institutional and retail investors to increase their asset allocation to
non-US equities - it's a portfolio rebalancing.' Such a trend is not easily
reversed by a temporary deterioration in investor sentiment, say analysts.
There are other reasons why non-US IPOs have continued to find willing
buyers. Ms Kathleen Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a
Connecticut-based consultancy which advises institutional investors on the
IPO market, believes the quality of foreign issuers lately has tended to be
higher.
She says that, while there are still plenty of attractive foreign IPOs in
the pipeline, domestic IPO issuance is at a more mature stage and most of
the high-quality issues have come and gone.
'Coming up on the calendar before the year-end, our favourites are all
international companies,' she says, singling out two deals: the Dollars
1.37bn IPO for the British Sky Broadcasting satellite television venture (a
consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, owns 17.5 per
cent) which was priced and sold earlier this week, and yesterday's Dollars
467m IPO for SGS-Thomson, Europe's top semiconductor company.
Mr Tom Davis, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch, says December
is shaping up to be a tricky month for issuers and underwriters. 'From now
to the end of the year, you will have a highly selective and highly
price-sensitive market. It has not been a great year for most portfolio
managers from a performance standpoint, so you have a very cautious
institutional investor environment right now.'
Recent declines in share prices, and evidence that money is flowing out of
equity funds, have created a more hostile investment environment for new
stock issues.
A clearer picture of investor sentiment should emerge by mid-December, says
Mr Cruz of CS First Boston. Four large IPOs - BSkyB, Thomson, Guident (a
spin-off from the US pharmaceuticals group Eli Lilly) and Crown Pacific
Partners, a US timber group - are due to be priced by then, and the progress
of each issue is being closely watched for any signs of a deterioration in
demand.
Yet, in spite of anxiety about the December calendar, bankers say the IPO
market is in better shape than during the summer, when activity fell sharply
because of concern about rising interest rates and falling share prices.
'There was an awful lot of offerings downsized, downpriced, postponed, and
withdrawn,' says Mr Davis. One banker estimates that whereas between 50 per
cent and 60 per cent of IPOs in the summer were priced below their range,
only 20 per cent to 30 per cent of deals in October and November were
similarly under-priced.
Moreover, bankers can be sanguine because a good part of the slowdown in
issuance activity is attributable to cyclical forces. As Mr Davis explains:
'1994 is the fourth year of the equity financing boom in the US, and there's
been an awful lot done. Much of the business in the early part of the decade
was driven by deleveraging. That's behind us now. A lot was done by cyclical
companies, whose stocks were rising ahead of earnings and cash flow. Now
that earnings and cashflow is coming through, there is a less pressing need
for equity.'
Over the longer term, the outlook for the IPO market remains uncertain.
The head of equity capital markets syndication at a prominent Wall Street
firm says the calendar for the first quarter of 1995 is pretty full, but
warns that if the current difficult environment carries through into next
year, many companies will be forced to compromise on both the price and size
of their issues.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bank report supports derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivative instruments are more a consequence than a cause of instability in
currencies and interest rates, according to a report issued by the central
banks of the G10 countries.
Concern has been expressed that growing use of derivatives might add
volatility to financial markets and create the risk of a system-wide
financial crisis.
The report, prepared by a working group headed by Mr Herve Hannoun, deputy
governor of the Bank of France, says that derivatives are only one of the
innovations which have altered financial market behaviour. The report argues
that derivatives make markets more efficient and should, under normal
conditions, have a stabilising influence.
However, in times of stress the derivatives can amplify price movements.
Central banks can avoid contributing to market instability by following a
'strategy that is predictable and well-explained to the public' and by
implementing that strategy 'in a consistent manner so as to aid the
formation of non-inflationary expectations'.
Derivatives do not diminish the control that monetary policy has over
inflation, and the limited evidence available suggests they have yet to
alter significantly the efficacy of monetary instruments.
Macroeconomic and monetary policy issues raised by the growth of derivatives
markets: a report by a working group established by the Eurocurrency
standing committee of the central banks of the Group of 10 countries,
published by the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Akzo-Nobel arm merges with US
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Akzo-Nobel, the Dutch/Swedish chemicals company, is to merge its rubber
chemicals division with that of US rival Monsanto.
The new company, forecast by Akzo to have sales of Dollars 600m in 1995,
will be based in northern Belgium.
It will initially employ 1,400, but job losses 'cannot be ruled out', Akzo
said.
The merger is the result of overcapacity among suppliers, consolidation
among the sector's customers - for example in tyre manufacture - and aims to
improve performance in a slow growth industry.
The 50-50 joint venture is scheduled to begin operations in January. Its
products will largely be additives that improve the performance of rubber,
such as helping car tyres withstand cold. The two companies have
complementary product lines.
Akzo would not say whether the transaction included a cash element. It said
the joint venture would be 'in the top three' in its sector by turnover.
Competitors include Bayer, the German chemicals company.

as 15 per cent of Lukoil shares to foreign investors would be completed in
1996.
He was speaking yesterday in London, where senior Lukoil officials met City
financial institutions and other potential investors. Earlier this week, the
Russian executives made a similar presentation to US investors in New York.
Some Lukoil shares are already held by foreigners, including a 3.5 per cent
stake by Credit Suisse First Boston. However, substantial work has yet to be
done on valuing the company's assets and presenting the information in an
internationally-recognised format before it can expand its foreign ownership
base.
KPMG, the international accounting firm, and McKinsey, the consulting group,
are working with the company, as are several western banks seeking to take
part in the tender offer. The company has not, however, chosen an
international market on which to list its shares.
Mr Alekperov said Lukoil, whose fields in western Siberia produce a sixth of
Russia's oil, intended to enhance its attractiveness to investors over the
next year through internal restructuring and further acquisitions.
The company will take full control of its biggest producing subsidiaries in
1995. It also plans to acquire at least five additional companies.
Lukoil has begun to transfer some of its social responsibilities, such as
housing, to local governments in the areas in which it operates. It also
wants to shed some of its extensive ancillary services, such as running
railways to transport oil.
'If we can get better services more cheaply, then we will divest
immediately,' Mr Alekperov said.
Lukoil's long-term strategic goal was to become a fully private company, he
said. However, the Russian government, with which Lukoil has close links,
still has a 45 per cent shareholding.
Mr Alekperov held out the prospect of additional tranches of shares being
offered to foreign investors to fund specific projects.
'Our first priority is to broaden our sphere of activity in Russia,' he
said. Another priority for Mr Alekperov, who is from Azerbaijan, was
participation in oil development projects in the Caspian Sea region.
Lukoil has a 10 per cent share in a British Petroleum-led consortium to
develop three offshore fields in Azerbaijan. Mr Alekperov said Lukoil also
wanted to take part in large oil developments in all the other countries
bordering the Caspian.
Mr Alekperov expressed confidence that a new oil and gas law governing
production-sharing contracts and joint ventures in Russia would soon be
passed by parliament.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank holds fall to 6%
despite markets downturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bayerische Hypo-Bank yesterday announced a set of 10-month results that
compare favourably with those of other leading German banks, which have
suffered steep declines in profits as a result of weak bond markets.
The Munich-based bank said group operating profits were 6.5 per cent lower
at DM807m (Dollars 514m). Mr Eberhard Martini, chairman, said the year-end
figure should be about the same as 1993's.
Like its German competitors, Hypo-Bank suffered from the downturn in bond
markets, with its own-account trading in securities, foreign exchange and
other financial instruments showing a loss of DM63m against a profit of
DM174m in the same period last year.
However, the bank showed a 9.4 per cent rise, to DM1.6bn, in partial
operating profits, which reflect basic loan, savings and other customer
business. This was mainly attributed to a 12.5 per cent increase in the
interest surplus, to DM3.4bn, reflecting an improved interest rate margin
and an expansion of its mortgage banking business.
Hypo-Bank's commission surplus eased by 4 per cent to DM731m. This was
mainly because of lower securities business, with payments transactions up
considerably and lending fees showing a slight improvement. Loan-loss
provisions were 9 per cent lower at DM873.
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, wants to build up a strong
investment banking unit in London, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Dresdner said there was no question of it turning its back on the Frankfurt
financial centre. 'We want, rather, to build up successively a strong
investment banking unit in London,' it said.
It said any large international bank seeking a role in investment banking
had to have a presence in London.
The bank was responding to a question about an article in the financial
newsletter Platow Brief which said Dresdner was planning a strategic
restructuring of its activities in London.
In October, Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said it planned to
concentrate all its investment banking activities under a single management
structure in London.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kymmene cancels FM1.5bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kymmene, Finland's second largest forestry group, yesterday unexpectedly
called off plans to raise more than FM1.5bn (Dollars 307m) in a domestic and
overseas share issue. The proceeds would have been used to reduce debt and
strengthen the group's balance sheet.
Kymmene said the issue of up to 15m shares, originally announced on November
7, had been oversubscribed, but did not reach an acceptable price level. It
blamed the 'sensitive situation' in US stock markets and the threat of
strikes in the Finnish forestry sector for the price shortfall.
It is the second time this year that Kymmene has pulled back from a
significant strategic move.
In June, it withdrew from merger talks with United Paper Mills, the forestry
unit of fellow Finnish company Repola, also over a disagreement on pricing.
At the the subsequent share issue launch, Mr Harri Piehl, Kymmene chief
executive, said the offer was a 'very significant' step toward strengthening
the group's balance sheet and 'providing a firm financial base for our
growth'.
Finnish analysts said they feared the withdrawal could undermine goodwill
towards Kymmene among foreign investors, who were offered up to 12.9m
shares.
However, Mr Piehl said yesterday Kymmene was not prepared to offer a
discount on its share price, which has traded recently in a range of FM122
to FM128. The share price returned to the upper end of that range yesterday
following the announcement of the deal's withdrawal. It had dropped sharply
on Wednesday.
Mr Piehl acknowledged that the issue decision meant Kymmene would lose some
capacity to mount acquisitions or make other new investments. Nor would it
reach as quickly the 40 per cent equity-to-assets ratio it has set as a
minimum target.
He insisted, however, that group cashflow and earnings prospects were
sufficiently strong to ensure Kymmene would reach that target within the
life of the upturn in the forestry industry, expected to peak around 1997.
He said Kymmene had based its decision not to concede a discount on this
anticipated strong earnings flow.
The company would be able to achieve its present strategic development plans
and pay down its debt (net debt to equity stands at 210 per cent) without
the share issue.
Kymmene reported a FM545m pre-tax profit in the first eight months of the
year, compared with a (restated) loss of FM337m in the same period in 1993,
on sales of FM12.11bn. It forecasts full-year earnings of FM1bn.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: CS Holding proposes single class
share plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has
proposed creating a single class share structure, converting its bearer
shares into registered shares and eliminating all voting restrictions.
The move follows the controversial unification plan adopted at Union Bank of
Switzerland last month. But the form of the CS proposal is embarrassing and
potentially damaging for UBS because it provides for the registered
shareholders to vote separately on the removal of their extra voting power.
The UBS plan is being contested in the courts partly because the bank did
not allow its registered shareholders to vote separately.
The bank's directors claimed there was no legal requirement for a separate
vote, even though several precedents exist.
The UBS registered shares trade at a substantial effective premium to the
bearer shares. But the bank offered no compensation for the loss of that
premium. Thus, it was highly likely that a meeting of registered
shareholders would have rejected the plan.
In the CS case, the registered shares trade at a slight effective discount
to the bearer shares so there is unlikely to be any resistance to the
conversion.
The proposal calls for the bearers, which have a par value of SFr100, to be
split five-for-one and then exchanged one-for-one for the SFr20 nominal
registered shares. The registered shares closed at SFr105 yesterday, the
bearers at SFr528.
The CS plan, which will be put at the annual meeting in May, also differs
from the UBS scheme in retaining the registered share.
'A registered approach will enable easier and direct communication between
CS Holding and its shareholders and be consistent with the principle that a
modern corporation should know its shareholders,' the group said.

FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tough times for Swatch-maker -
Doubts on SMH's future have hit the share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors seem to be having their annual case of jitters over SMH, the
dominant Swiss watchmaking group.
The registered shares of the maker of Swatch, Omega, Tissot, Rado, Blancpain
and Longines watches have tumbled 14 per cent in the past three weeks to
reach a two-year low yesterday of SFr137.
A year ago, a similar burst of selling pressure greeted the news that Mr
Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss financier, was withdrawing from the board and
reducing his investment in the group.
This time, the decline follows the announcement by analysts that they had
lowered their forecasts of SMH's profits for the current year. However, the
analysts themselves dismiss this as a cause, because it was already
widely-known that this year's earnings would be hard hit by the effects of a
strong Swiss franc.
The worries today are more fundamental: there are doubts over the staying
power of the vital Swatch brand, over the potential for the so-called
Swatchmobile micro-car project with Germany's Daimler-Benz, and over the
eccentric style of the 66-year-old chairman and controlling shareholder Mr
Nicolas Hayek.
Of these, the future of Swatch is the most important in the near term. These
cheap and cheerful plastics watches have long since become the group's core
product, with sales of over 20m units annually.
With prices deliberately kept low, Swatch sales do not produce big profits,
but rather huge cashflow which helps to cover the cost of developing and
producing all watch components.
After a decade of phenomenal growth, Swatch sales stagnated last year,
leading to questions over whether the brand's popularity was slipping into
irreversible decline.
Unfortunately, SMH's erratic disclosure policy makes it difficult for
investors to gather evidence and make an informed judgment. In August, it
said Swatch exports were down by between 10 and 15 per cent in the first
half, but Mr Hayek said last month sales had been growing again since the
autumn.
The group belatedly acknowledged Swatch's failure in the US and most east
Asian markets, where plastic is not seen as fashionable. It has just
launched a line of 'Swatch Irony', low-cost metal watches, to try to regain
ground in these markets.
If this product line can restore stability in the Swatch range, then the
potential for a group profit recovery next year, boosted perhaps by a
weakening of the Swiss franc, becomes tantalising.
'If they can stabilise the Swatch, that is enough to ensure growth in
earnings,' says Martin Newson of Goldman Sachs International.
'I could see profits of SFr450m (Dollars 339.2m) next year,' says Mr Marc
Polydor of Banque Scandinave en Suisse in Geneva. That compares with
estimates averaging around SFr370m for this year, and implies that the
registered shares are trading at less than 10 times next year's earnings. In
1993, the group recorded profits of SFr440m.
Mr Pierre Tissot of Geneva bankers Lombard, Odier says those inclined to buy
would do better to pick up the bearer shares, which are at a 14 per cent
effective discount to the registered.
But even if the Swatch problem is solved, analysts remain nervous about
other factors.
After three years of rumours about the Swatchmobile, SMH and Daimler-Benz
finally announced last week that they would this month choose a site in
France or Germany for an assembly plant.
SMH's record with putting the Swatch brand on other products, mainly
telephones, is not strong, and the car project represents a much bigger
investment.
Still, analysts point out that SMH has large liquid reserves and a very
healthy cashflow. 'It is not a financial problem,' says Mr Tissot. 'It is a
question of profitability. Margins in the car business are not like those in
watches.'
He also worries about signs of nepotism. Mr Hayek's son Nick has become a
Swatch marketing director and his grandson Marc is also involved. 'The grip
of the Hayek family is a source of concern,' he says.
Mr Polydor is more relaxed. 'It could be a problem in the medium term, but
for the time being there is a management team that is making the strategy.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Drummond rises to Pounds 393,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drummond Group, the cloth-ing fabrics manufacturer, achieved a 6 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 370,000 to Pounds 393,000 on
a 12 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 25.8m.
This is Drummond's third consecutive set of improving results since it
reported a loss of Pounds 3.38m for the year to March 31 1993.
At the operating level, profits to September 30 were 43 per cent ahead at
Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 469,000). In the comparable period there was Pounds
196,000 profit on the sale of a discontinued operation.
The result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 277,000 (Pounds
295,000).
The board was still cautious enough to pass the dividend, but Mr Stefan
Simmonds, chairman, said a final dividend was likely if recovery continued
as planned.
Drummond recruited Mr Zvika Pollak, an Israeli, as chief executive three
years ago, and embarked on a vigorous investment programme at the James
Drummond worsted mill in Bradford.
It was now investing in efficiency improvements at John Crowther &amp; Son, the
woollens and dyeing plant at Huddersfield and had sold its small bunting
fabric business.
Earnings per share improved 15 per cent from 1.17p to 1.35p.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Aukett progress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a 'difficult and unpredictable' market, Aukett Associates, the
design and architectural services group, turned in a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 317,000 for the year to September 30.
The result, which arose from cost controls and improved efficiency, compared
with a Pounds 2.25m deficit last time, but which was after a Pounds 2.06m
loss on the disposal of a discontinued operation.
Work done amounted to Pounds 7.08m. This compared with Pounds 6.72m, of
which Pounds 0.4m related to discontinued activities. Earnings per share
were 1.81p (16.82p losses) but the dividend has again been omitted.
Aukett said Mr Michael Aukett was stepping down as chief executive 'to
operate his own practice outside the public arena.' Mr Andrew Lett has been
appointed managing director.

Pre-tax profits at Eve Group, the USM-traded civil engineering company, were
little changed at Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 2.51m, for the six months to
end September. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 33m to Pounds 33.8m.
Mr Roger Ames, chairman, said recessionary conditions still affected parts
of the business, adding that it was difficult to predict the future with any
certainty. However, he was confident that the full-year's results would be
'at a level similar to the previous year'.
Earnings per share were down 1p to 16.1p but the interim dividend is again
3p.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cowie cash call for Pounds 16.3m buy -
Acquisition of last of London Regional Transport's bus franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday became
London's largest bus operator, through the purchase of the last of London
Regional Transport's 10 franchises, South London.
The company is to raise Pounds 33.1m from a rights issue to fund the Pounds
16.3m acquisition, which follows Cowie's recent Pounds 29.9m purchase of
Leaside Buses, based in north London.
The 1-for-8 rights issue is priced at 190p. Cowie's share price rose 6p
yesterday, to close at 224p.
The group will now operate 1,000 local London buses. It has forecast that
its bus and coach businesses - including Hughes Daf, the bus distributor,
and Grey-Green bus and coach operator - will account for 25 per cent of next
year's profits.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, described South London as a 'distressed
sale'. It has been threatened with the loss of its licence if it does not
improve vehicle maintenance standards by April 30. He is confident this can
be achieved.
The franchise made Pounds 23,000 profits on Pounds 18.8m turnover last year.
However, a programme of fleet renewal will substantially lower maintenance
costs.
In addition, management will be centralised to cover Cowie's two London
franchises, taking out more costs. Cowie is targeting 15 per cent operating
profit margins, representing profits of Pounds 2.8m.
Mr Hodgson said Leaside was already achieving double digit margins, compared
with the 1.4 per cent achieved last year.
The consideration for South London includes the payment of Pounds 6.2m of
intra-group loans and goodwill of just Pounds 1.4m.
Cowie also announced that pre-tax profits for 1994 would be at least Pounds
41m and that it would propose a final dividend of 6.4p, making 9.125p for
the full year, up from 7.85p.
Mr Hodgson said the group was looking to build up its bus operations in the
UK further. 'We don't intend to stop here.' The group gets the additional
benefit of selling new vehicles through its distribution arm.
COMMENT
Yesterday's rise in Cowie's share price was a fitting response to an astute
realignment of the group. Motor retailers are hitting harder times, and
their shares have acted accordingly. But by the end of next year, Cowie will
make more money from buses than from car sales. Bus operators benefit from
substantial economies of scale, and with three London operations, margins
should rise sharply. Meanwhile the finance business continues to perform
well, making up for flat car sales. On the company's own forecast, the
shares are on a 1994 p/e of 9.8. Profits should reach Pounds 50m next year,
representing a 9.5 p/e. Given the higher quality of earnings, and the
management performance at Leaside, they offer good value.

Julian Hodge Bank, the family-owned Cardiff concern specialising in
commercial and industrial lending, improved pre-tax profits by 12 per cent

Mr Jonathan Hodge, chairman, said that despite a difficult environment for
new business, the bank had increased its asset base by nearly 15 per cent to

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hill Hire finally floats at 94p per share
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was third time lucky yesterday for Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle
rental business as it finally announced its placing price of 94p per share,
for a value of Pounds 25.5m, which is 2 per cent less than original
estimates.
The company, being floated by Birkby, the business property manager, had
suffered two successive days of delay primarily because of market
fluctuations.
Birkby is to retain a 44 per cent holding worth Pounds 11.2m. It is also
selling Ember Rental, its other vehicle hire arm, to Hill Hire for Pounds
2.7m. The two operations had net assets of about Pounds 5.3m at the end of
September.
Despite the delay Birkby is pleased with the float, surpassing the group's
initial predictions of a placing in 1997.
Mr Bill Cran, Birkby chief executive, said: 'It's a sign of (Hill Hire's)
strength that it has gone in a market that's not particularly brilliant.'
The placing will raise about Pounds 6.4m net for Hill Hire which will be
used to repay an estimated Pounds 2.1m owed by Hill and Ember to Birkby and
finance expansion.
Birkby will gain estimated cash proceeds of Pounds 8.7m net from the
transaction, before a payment relating to the variation of the original
acquisition deal for Hill Hire. Hill Hire was founded in 1990 by its current
executive team and acquired by Birkby last year for Pounds 6.5m.
For the year to March 31 1994 Hill Hire made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m
(Pounds 750,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.1m) and Ember made
pre-tax profits Pounds 189,000, against losses of Pounds 100,000 for the
previous 14 months, on turnover of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.9m).
Hill Hire will have some 2,050 vehicles within its newly formed operation
and seven sites, prior to the new development, neatly sitting around the M62
corridor.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: DC Cook jumps 55% to Pounds 1.57m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DC Cook Holdings, the motor retail group, saw interim pre-tax profits surge
55 per cent from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 1.57m on turnover 15 per cent up at
Pounds 86.7m, against Pounds 75.1m.
Mr Derek Cook, chairman, said: 'the performance of the motor division has
once again been outstanding and fully justifies the decision to concentrate
on this our core activity.'
The division had performed better than at any time in the last five years,
he added. New car sales were up 31 per cent on last time, when sales were
already 61 per cent higher than the previous year.
Used car sales rose by a further 13 per cent this year, following last
year's 40 per cent increase. The after sales contribution had also shown a
significant rise of 29 per cent.
Earnings per share in the six months to October 31 grew from 1.71p to 2.46p
and the interim dividend was stepped up 50 per cent to 0.45p (0.3p).
Mr Cook said a non-executive director would be appointed in January and a
further appointment would be made by the spring.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Institutions contribute to MPE fund-raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Montagu Private Equity has raised Pounds 170m from four UK and continental
European institutions and Pounds 250m from HSBC Group, its parent, for
investment in unquoted companies.
Montagu intends to raise Pounds 500m in what it is calling a Private Equity
Partnership Scheme. HSBC is committed to invest at least as much as each
co-investor in every deal.
This is the first time that Montagu Private Equity (MPE) has raised this
amount of capital from institutions other than its parent and signals HSBC's
intention to increase its presence in private equity investment.
The move confirms MPE as one of the UK's three largest providers of private
equity capital.
The new funds will add to the weight of new money raised by UK venture
capital and management buy-out financiers recently. The British Venture
Capital Association says that in the eight months to August, UK fund
managers have raised over Pounds 2bn - more than three times as much as in
the whole of 1993.
MPE's investors committed the funds for five years, but Mr Ian Forrest, its
managing director, said he hoped to develop a long-term investment
partnership with this small number of investors.
Mr Forrest said these institutions had not been significant investors in
private equity before.
MPE has invested about Pounds 100m a year recently and intends to continue
to invest at a similar rate. 'We are saying we have a lot of money for this
class of asset and the ability to be a long term partner (with businesses),'
Mr Forrest said. 'HSBC is saying this is a core businesses for investment
banking.'
The fund raising not only increased MPE's management fees, but also provided
the firepower to underwrite the total equity requirement of any transaction.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Compass to Pounds 55.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compass, the catering and healthcare group, lifted profits by a third and
turnover by 85 per cent on the back of acquisitions in Europe and the US.
Pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to October 2 rose from Pounds 41.5m to
Pounds 55.7m on turnover ahead from Pounds 497m to Pounds 917.9m.
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 216.2m to the latest sales figure. The
figures include the first full year from Scandinavian Service Partner, the
European caterer, and 15 weeks from Canteen Corporation, the third largest
US caterer bought for Pounds 311.7m in early summer.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the acquisitions had settled in
comfortably and were performing well. 'There are no surprises and no black
holes,' he said of Canteen. 'If anything we feel more optimistic about the
prospects than when we acquired it.'
Shares in the group closed yesterday 5p down at 330p, still well ahead of
the 270p of the 6-for19 rights issue that raised Pounds 146m towards buying
Canteen.
Earnings per share rose from 17p to 19.2p. The board is proposing to lift
the final dividend to 4.56p (4.06p), taking the total for the year to 6.75p
(6.06p).
The acquisition of Canteen almost doubled the catering division's turnover
to Pounds 851.2m, yielding operating profits of Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 33.7m).
Margins fell from 7.7 to 5.7 per cent.
European catering turnover rose almost fourfold to Pounds 196.5m, and
profits rose to Pounds 10.8m from Pounds 2.9m. Again, margins were easier at
5.5 per cent (5.8 per cent.)
In the UK profits edged ahead to Pounds 31m on sales of Pounds 456.1m
(Pounds 382.2m). The group estimated that the 23 days of the rail strike
cost it Pounds 1.7m in lost profits. After adjusting for the rail strike,
margins declined from 8 per cent to 7.1 per cent. The lower margins
reflected the effect of the new businesses, said Mr Mackay. Underlying
margins were moving forwards.
Margins at Canteen were flat at 3.3 per cent, which the group believes
indicates a bottom. It believes it can lift US margins, which are generally
lower than those in Europe, to 5 per cent in the next three or four years.
In contrast the healthcare group margins are more than 21 per cent. Sales
and profits from the group's 15 hospitals were up 10 per cent at Pounds
66.7m and Pounds 14.4m respectively.
Net debt at the end of the year was up from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 213.4m.
Interest payable rose from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 7.1m, covered 8.8 times.
COMMENT
The City was looking for reassurance following the bold acquisition of
Canteen. Compass is acting swiftly, building up its management teams,
relocating the headquarters, investing in new systems, and getting out of
loss making contracts. There appears no reason to doubt that margins have
bottomed out. The group is now well positioned to take advantage of good
growth opportunities in three big markets, so further large scale
acquisitions can be ruled out. Pencilled-in profits this year are Pounds
75m, with earnings more than 20 per cent higher at 23.5p. The prospective
multiple of just over 14 still looks attractive for a group with so much
still to go for.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat makes Pounds 3.5m and focuses on
offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greycoat, the property developer which raised Pounds 47m from a rights issue
in June, has returned to the black with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.5m, against a Pounds 43.5m loss previously.
The company, which was rescued from the brink of collapse a year ago and has
since restructured its board of directors, also said that it planned to
concentrate on developing offices in central London.
Mr Peter Thornton, managing director, said office buildings were likely to
outperform retail or industrial premises in a relatively low growth, low
inflation environment.
In central London, demand for modern space far outstripped potential supply,
the company said. It expects its investment to deliver an annual total
return of about 11 per cent until the end of the decade.
Greycoat has an interest in three large central London development sites:
Paternoster Square, next to St Paul's Cathedral, where planning permission
has been granted for 750,000 sq ft of offices. The company is attempting to
arrange funding with institutional investors for the Pounds 375m development
and hopes to start work by the middle of next year.
Moor House in the City, which will not be considered for redevelopment until
1997, when break clauses in existing leases come into effect.
Victoria Interchange, adjacent to Victoria Station, where Greycoat will next
year submit a planning application for 275,000 sq ft of offices. However,
rents have to rise significantly before development is worthwhile.
Mr Thornton said Greycoat was in talks which could lead to the acquisition
of an interest in two or three additional development sites.
In the six months to September 30, gross rental income fell from Pounds
20.1m to Pounds 16.7m, although last year's figure included Pounds 4.9m rent
from Britannic House in the City, which has since been sold.
Included in this year's figure is Pounds 2.1m rental income from 123/151
Buckingham Palace Road, where Greycoat took full control in August. In a
full year, rental income from the building should be Pounds 13.3m.
Administrative costs were unchanged at Pounds 1.7m. Last year's interim loss
included Pounds 5.7m expenses relating to the rescue package.
Mr Michael Beckett, who took over as non-executive chairman in September,
said the company was committed to keeping administration costs steady in
real terms.
Profits from the sale of two investment properties in London and Newcastle
contributed Pounds 2.8m, against a loss on disposal of Pounds 25.2m in the
first half last year. Finance costs fell to Pounds 12m (Pounds 21.2m).
Earnings were 3p, against a loss of 228.7p, adjusted for the rights issue.
The company is not paying an interim dividend, but expects to declare a
final dividend of 0.6p.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Racal Electronics rises to Pounds 23m -
Shares fall 6% after downward revision of margins prediction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics' share price fell 6 per cent yesterday, after the company
revealed that it would fall substantially short of its stated target for
profits from its data communications division this year.
In June, the communications, radio and network services group predicted
profit margins of 'well over 5 per cent' for the division, on about Pounds
400m of revenue.
It admitted yesterday that margins were more likely to be 4 per cent, and
most analysts reduced full year profit forecasts from Pounds 70m to Pounds
60m. The shares closed 13p lower at 203p.
For the six months to October 14, Racal reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
23.5m compared with losses of Pounds 400,000, after taking account of a
Pounds 26.8m loss from discontinued operations.
The company has been restructuring its data communications business, which
had over-extended in a highly competitive market. However, poor data product
sales in Germany and Italy, combined with difficulties in merging two
manufacturing operations in the UK, have reduced projected profits.
It has made significant advances in network services, which will benefit
from the National Lottery contract, and provide a steadier revenue stream.
However, divisional operating profits fell from Pounds 2.93m to Pounds
834,000.
At the year end, Racal will have spent Pounds 10m on a restructuring,
reducing staff by 400 to 11,200, which will benefit the second half.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 487.3m (Pounds 430.2m), including Pounds 4.91m
from acquisitions and Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 14.4m) from discontinued
activities. Operating profits from continuing operations increased from
Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 25.2m, including Pounds 993,000 from acquisitions.
Marine and energy division sales suffered from the impact of a weak oil
price, and profits fell from Pounds 7.54m to Pounds 3.48m. However,
specialised businesses profits grew by 51 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds
8.95m).
There was a net cash outflow of Pounds 64.5m, reflecting acquisitions, and
costs associated with the National Lottery but it should be cash positive in
the second half.
At the interim stage gearing was 14.3 per cent, against 10.4 per cent 12
months earlier.
The interim dividend is raised to 1.75p (1.5p) from earnings of 5.71p
(losses 0.07p).
COMMENT
The danger of giving profit forecasts is that investors get upset when they
are not reached. It is hardly surprising that Racal's failure to achieve its
own targets should swamp some positive factors in its performance. On
reduced forecasts of Pounds 60m for 1994-95, Racal is on a p/e of 15.1. If
management is right, profits could hit Pounds 78m next year, leaving the
shares at a discount to the market. But credibility is hard to win back, and
Racal operates in tough markets, with the pressures of developing a steady
stream of products with short lifespans. The lower rating looks deserved.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trident steps up its Lloyd's involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trident, a Bermuda-based company investing in insurance and reinsurance, has
increased its involvement in Lloyd's of London by providing funds for a new
company investing in syndicates run by Venton managing agencies.
Trident was formed a year ago by Marsh McLennan, the world's largest
insurance broker, J P Morgan, Mid Ocean, a Bermuda reinsurance company, and
Byrne Sons, a small investment bank.
Venton has raised a total of Pounds 18.5m in corporate capital to invest in
three insurance syndicates via two vehicles, one capitalised exclusively by
Trident. Venton has not disclosed how much Trident, which is also connected
with the Hiscox managing agencies, has invested.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone at Pounds 2.6m in difficult
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest costs underpinned a six-fold increase in pre-tax profits at
Hartstone, the hosiery and leathergoods group, in the six months to
September 30.
However the company, which launched a Pounds 30m rescue rights issue this
year, experienced 'difficult' trading conditions in its leathergoods markets
in the US and the UK.
Group sales fell to Pounds 111m (Pounds 185.1m) as turnover from continuing
operations declined by 8 per cent. Operating profit were lower at Pounds
5.65m (Pounds 5.82m). However the pre-tax figure rose to Pounds 2.65m
(Pounds 428,000), after interest costs fell from Pounds 5.39m to Pounds 3m.
Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, said: 'Customers are leaving purchasing
decisions fairly late in the year, while retailers are pretty conscious
about margins and are also ordering stock late.'
The rights issue helped to reduce gearing from 298 to 39 per cent at the end
of November, as net borrowings fell from Pounds 127.3m to Pounds 39m. The
company hopes to be ungeared within 18 months.
The core US leathergoods business, Etienne Aigner, reported operating
profits down 38 per cent to Pounds 4m (Pounds 6.5m), as unsold stock was
sold at discount prices. The company intends to expand its chain of factory
outlet stores from 54 to more than 60.
Operating profits at Michael Stevens, the handbags supplier, fell to Pounds
1.5m (Pounds 1.6m) as it withdrew from vinyl goods at the bottom end of the
market.
The UK leathergoods business reported operating losses of Pounds 1.9m.
Hartstone now plans to contract out its UK distribution and cut staff from
199 to less than 60 next year.
The hosiery division reported a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to
Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1m), including a contribution from Cogetex which was
sold to Courtaulds Textiles for Pounds 45m this year.
Earnings per share rose to 1.1p (0.3p). There is no interim dividend, but
the board hopes to recommend a final of 0.32p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing focus on margins helped TGI, the loudspeaker systems group, to
increase pre-tax profits by 40 per cent on turnover 5 per cent ahead for the
half-year ending September 30.
The Pounds 703,000 (Pounds 501,000) result was struck on sales of Pounds
18.2m (Pounds 17.3m).
Earnings per share worked through at 2.8p (2p).
The Pounds 725,000 settlement made to the group during the period by its
previous auditors has been used to reduce the goodwill written off on
acquisition of the Audix companies in 1989.
The board has declared an interim dividend of 0.85p (0.6p).

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Smith New Court down 35% but shares up
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult conditions in the financial markets sent pre-tax profits at Smith
New Court, the equities market maker and broker, down 35 per cent from
Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 20.2m for the six months to October 28.
However, Smith shares, which fell initially on the news, rallied sharply
following the announcement of merger talks between SG Warburg and Morgan
Stanley, amid speculation that it could become similarly involved.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, refused to comment on Smith's intentions
in this direction. But he predicted that there would be further
consolidation in the securities industry. 'We are beginning to see the
second big fall-out from Big Bang. As we move towards globalisation of world
markets, further mergers and acquisitions are inevitable,' he said.
Smith shares ended the day 23p ahead at 396p.
The first-half results were undermined by significantly lower trading
volumes in the group's south-east Asian markets, with some down 70 per cent
year on year. These were compounded by levels in the London market down by
20 per cent. Smith blamed lower institutional demand for the decline, which
in turn was a consequence of investor concern over volatility and rising
world interest rates.
Mr Marks described the group's overall performance as 'satisfactory', with
all areas of business staying in profit. He added that while the group was
seeking to identify areas in which to save costs, large-scale staff cuts
were not under consideration: 'Our customers expect a high level of
consistency from our service and we have to maintain that.'
Return on capital was 17.5 per cent compared with 36.6 per cent. Earnings
per share fell from 44.4p to 19.3p and from 25p to 14.4p on a fully-diluted
basis. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p.
The lower level of trading activity was also reflected in a lull in Smith's
overseas expansion with no new offices opening. But the company confirmed it
was seeking to become a full member of the Tokyo stock exchange when a seat
becomes available.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro-Electric declines 23% to
Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Hydro-Electric, the northern Scotland power generator and
distributor, saw profits fall in the first half because of regulatory price
changes and the cost of government debt redemptions.
However, the company's sales in England and Wales rose sharply, cushioning
the impact on the results.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell 23 per cent from
Pounds 45.6m to Pounds 34.9m.
The interim dividend was raised by 10 per cent to 4.34p (3.96p) in line with
policy of lifting the pay-out by between 6 and 8 per cent in real terms.
Earnings fell by 25 per cent to 6.57p (8.81p). However, the company said the
underlying growth was 18.5 per cent.
Mr Roger Young, the chief executive, said that revenues in Scotland were
reduced by a new regulatory requirement which will cut the generation
component of prices in stages over the next four years. By 1998, the prices
should be in line with the Great Britain yardstick (GBY), which represents
the actual price paid for electricity by regional distributors in England
and Wales. The effect in the first half was Pounds 3m.
Hydro also redeemed Pounds 116m of government debt, at a premium of Pounds
18.8m, but this will result in cheaper borrowing.
Offsetting these factors was strong sales growth south of the border, where
Hydro has three projects which are beginning to produce results.
'The strategy of expansion in England, which we've talked about for some
time, is coming through quite strong now,' said Mr Young. By next year, 15
per cent of generation capacity will be in England.
Hydro-Electric is the only electricity company which did not accept the
price formula proposed earlier this year by Offer, the industry regulator.
Offer has referred the proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr
Young said discussions had begun with the MMC, but it would be several
months before the outcome was known.
COMMENT
The factors shaping these results had been well flagged, and they contained
no surprises. The big question mark hanging over the company is the MMC
inquiry. Although Hydro is thought to have a strong case for rejecting the
Offer formula because of its unusually dispersed market, its commitment to
an annual dividend increase of 6-8 per cent in real terms suggests that the
cost of serving this market will not impact unduly on earnings. But until
this uncertainty is resolved, the shares are likely to show a yield above
the sector average.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Benson makes Pounds 2.4m foam buy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Benson, the engineering group, is acquiring Designstart, which trades as
Stadex Industries, for Pounds 2.43m, from Thama Holdings.
The consideration will be met by the sale of Benson's agricultural vehicles
spares business to Thama for Pounds 1.36m and the issue of 12.6m new shares
to Thama. There is also a contingent consideration of up to Pounds 150,000
depending on the availability of tax losses.
Stadex, the largest maker of rubber latex foam in the EU, achieved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 67,000 in the 10 months to October 31, having been
lossmaking in the previous three years. Net assets at December 31 1993 were
Pounds 2.25m.
Benson also announced the sale and leaseback of two properties which
generated about Pounds 1.5m in cash, realising a profit of about Pounds
200,000.
The directors of Benson said it was their intention to increase the interim
dividend by 20 per cent to 0.12p as sales for the half year to November 30
were 'significantly ahead' across the group.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wellman in black aided by margins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellman, the specialist engineer, returned to pre-tax profits in the six
months to the end of September.
During the period the company increased in size fivefold by the Pounds 46m
acquisition of businesses from FKI. However Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said
that the biggest impact on the figures was the improvement in sales and
margins at the existing businesses.
Profits were Pounds 1.88m pre-tax, against Pounds 527,000 losses from
turnover of Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 9.87m). Acquisitions provided operating
profits of Pounds 854,000 on turnover of Pounds 11.3m for the period from
August 13. Existing activities reported turnover up 55 per cent and
operating profits of Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 454,000 losses).
At the end of the period the company had net cash of Pounds 2.7m. Gearing
stood at 36.4 per cent 12 months earlier.
From earnings of 2.7p (losses 1.8p) the interim dividend is lifted to 0.4p
(0.3p).

Sep Industrial Holdings, the engineering group, reported an 81 per cent rise
in full-year pre-tax profits and announced the acquisition of Fastening
Driebergen of the Netherlands for Pounds 1.28m in shares and cash.
Sep estimates that Fastening Driebergen, which makes fasteners and fixings,

1994. Net assets at end-1993 stood at Pounds 698,000.
Exceptional profits of Pounds 689,000 from disposal of assets helped lift
Sep's pre-tax outcome from Pounds 2.08m to Pounds 3.77m for the year to
September. Sales rose to Pounds 43.3m (Pounds 37.7m). Earnings per share
including exceptionals were 4.03p (2.87p). A final dividend of 0.6p (0.45p)

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Misys and RM talk over new proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research Machines and Misys were locked in talks last night over a new
proposal from the latter for the educational computer group.
Misys, the acquisitive computing services company, made an initial approach
on Wednesday afternoon, making a conditional Pounds 38m cash offer of 235p a
share for RM, which is due to come to the market in the next two weeks.
RM - its shares are likely to be priced at about 170p - rejected the Misys
offer out of hand, saying it seriously undervalued the company and that the
cultures of the two groups were too different.
Misys' second proposal, tabled yesterday, is thought to involve it taking a
significant stake in RM. Neither company was available for comment.
RM's flotation is set to raise Pounds 30m, although none is to be new money
for the company, which has about Pounds 6.5m in the bank. The intention is
to improve the profile of the 21-year-old company, which is relatively
unknown outside the UK education market.
Last year, RM reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.52m on turnover of Pounds
66.2m.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Union Pounds 4m deal to aid futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union, the financial services group, is restructuring its loss-making
futures business via an acquisition which it claims will create one of the
few large independent derivatives broking businesses in the UK.
Union is buying CAL, a foreign exchange trader, derivatives broker and fund
managers, for Pounds 2.8m in cash plus Pounds 1.4m in convertible loan
stock.
The complex deal in effect amounts to a Pounds 150,000 premium to net assets
and a three-year earn-out. The loan stock can be converted at rates which
depend on profits achieved over three years. The number of shares available
for conversion is limited to 5 per cent of the enlarged company a year.
Mr George Blunden, Union's chief executive, said the deal limited the
downside for his company. If the maximum earnout payments were made, he
would be 'deliriously happy', as this would represent a substantial jump in
profits.
Union would merge its own derivatives operation, which focused on low
margin, high volume execution business, with CAL's higher margin broking
business.
The integration was expected to result in exceptional costs of between
Pounds 1.8m and Pounds 2.3m. The business was expected to break even in the
first half, due to restructuring costs.
Last month Union issued a profits warning, due to the low volumes in its
markets. Analysts, who had been expecting profits of Pounds 6m at the
beginning of the year, revised forecasts to losses of Pounds 1.5m. These
will now be higher due to the restructuring charges.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Insurers left adrift after losing their
selling ties - The future for Standard Life and Guardian Royal has been
doubly disrupted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many life insurance companies feel they have taken a battering over the past
year or so.
Sales have been hit by public concern about standards of selling, and the
sector faces a heavy task in identifying and compensating the victims of bad
advice to buy personal pensions.
Companies are also redesigning their policies and, in some cases, cutting
margins ready for the new regulatory regime requiring them to disclose more
information to customers about products and charges.
Against this generally bleak background, two life companies - Standard Life,
the UK's largest mutual life insurer, and Guardian Royal Exchange, the
composite insurance group - face a particular 'double whammy' in how they
sell their policies.
Both are losing the links which allowed them to sell through the branch
networks of the UK's two biggest building societies. At the same time
competition among insurers to sell through independent financial advisers,
their other main sources of sales, is intensifying as the number of advisers
falls.
In September last year Halifax, the UK's largest society, said it was ending
its tie with Standard and setting up its own life insurance and unit trust
subsidiaries. These will become operational in January.
This spring, Nationwide Building Society announced it was to stop selling
Guardian policies and setting up wholly owned life and unit trust
operations, which are due to open in the middle of next year.
In each case, the insurer is saying goodbye to a substantial amount of
business. Halifax is thought to provide about 20 per cent of Standard's new
life business. For Guardian the blow is even more serious. In 1993, 30 per
cent of its new life business came through Nationwide.
Although clearing up after the personal pensions debacle and meeting the
rising cost of regulators' requirements are taking their toll of independent
advisers, both Standard and Guardian sound optimistic.
'While the sector will probably shrink in terms of the numbers of
independent adviser companies, with smaller ones going to the wall, I don't
think that necessarily means their share of the market is bound to
decrease,' said Mr Richard Wood, marketing director of Guardian. 'Those
which survive will become more efficient and get more customers.'
Mr Tom King, sales general manager at Standard Life, said those leaving the
market may represent only about 2-4 per cent of the premium income generated
by independent advice.
However, the departures, and the pressures leading others to join together
to share costs, are concentrating the market in the large firms and networks
of independent advisers, which can decide on a panel of six to eight life
companies from which their advisers can choose for any particular product.
'If you're not on the panel you're wasting your time going out to individual
advisers,' said Mr King. 'An individual adviser would have to come up with a
special reason for ignoring head office.'
Standard said it was well placed to be on panels. Guardian admitted it had a
problem.
'We are on virtually all panels for protection policies such as critical
illness cover,' said Mr Wood. 'But our investment performance has made it
more difficult to get on to panels for investment policies.'
He believed Guardian's future would be helped by strong general insurance
product and other new policies being developed.
New policies are part of Standard's plans as well. Its announcement last
month that it would provide better early surrender values for long-term
policies, while continuing to pay commission as now to advisers, was seen by
competitors as an aggressive move to grab market share.
But the distribution squeeze also means both companies are gradually
building up direct sales forces.
Guardian's direct sales force is now growing slowly, after falling to 180
from its peak of more than 1,000 in 1990. Standard's direct sales force has
grown from nothing in 1990 to 330.
Mr King said that in three to five years time he would like direct sales to
generate about 25 per cent of new business. The aim would be to run on the
same cost basis as sales through independent advisers, but Mr King admitted
that this had not yet been achieved.
Though the plans for larger direct sales forces make sense in terms of
expanding distribution, both companies are embarking on them as regulation
makes running sales agents more expensive. And the new disclosure
requirements together with the generally low levels of investment returns
make controlling costs more important.
If Standard and Guardian can come through these immediate pressures, they
will be well-placed for the following years when the prospects for new
business are likely to improve. Even so, it is a test neither would have
sought.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Former Medeva directors join lossmaking
Hewitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hewitt Group rose 60p to 158p yesterday after the lossmaking
industrial ceramics company appointed two former Medeva directors to the
board.
Hewitt also announced a rescue rights issue to raise a maximum of Pounds
4.3m as the company revealed that its accounts to December 31 would breach
its banking convenants.
The company, which reported Pounds 2.34 pre-tax losses at the half-year
stage, named Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith as non-executive deputy chairman and Mr
David Lees as chief executive.
Nine months ago, Mr Gowrie-Smith resigned as managing director of Medeva,
the acquisitive pharmaceuticals group which he founded. Mr Lees also
resigned as finance director.
'We are very excited to be involved with such a promising company which has
good potential,' Mr Gowrie-Smith said.
'It is not commonly appreciated that David and I spent years developing an
industrial and engineering group, so for us it is like returning to our
roots after so many years devoted solely to the pharmaceutical sector.'
Hewitt proposes a 1-for-1 rights issue of 3.39m shares at 68p to raise about
Pounds 2m after expenses. If the issue is fully subscribed, the company
plans additional equity capital to raise a further Pounds 2.3m.
The company also proposes to allocate three warrants attached to every 10
rights shares. The warrants can be exercised six months after issue at 68p a
share.
The rights issue is underwritten by brokers Hichens Harrison, and
Summervale, which is controlled by Mr Gowrie-Smith's family. Summervale will
be left with a minimum stake of 33 per cent and a maximum of 45 per cent.
The cash raised will be used to repay borrowings and fund working capital.
Losses on Hewitt's German activities resulted in a Pounds 2m write-down of
assets and other costs at the interim stage.
The rights issue is subject to an extraordinary meeting on January 10, and
dealing is expected to begin the following day.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Shares slide as Fine Art sees 'difficult'
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Fine Art Developments tumbled 44p to 376p yesterday as the mail
order and greetings card group reported disappointing profits for its first
half and warned that trading conditions remained 'extremely difficult'.
In the six months to September 30, profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 5.78m
(Pounds 5.51m) pre-tax on turnover ahead 6 per cent at Pounds 122.3m (Pounds
115.4m).
Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, singled out the charities and wholesale
businesses as the weakest performers. However, he stressed that in the past
strong parts of the group had more than counterbalanced 'the odd problem
here and there'. This time, trading conditions and the downturn in consumer
spending meant there had been no 'good performers' to offset the laggards.
On the charities side, turnover fell 23 per cent. Rwandan appeals, the
public's move towards local rather than national charities, and the
cataloguing, products and pricing policies of Fine Art's charities had all
had an impact.
The wholesale side of the card and paper products division had been hit by
the change in Sunday trading laws, which were squeezing independent shops.
Mr Chapman expected it would be 'some time before we get back to where we
were'. However, last year's management and systems problems which had
affected deliveries in the direct-to-retail side - supplying supermarkets
and large chains - had been sorted out.
On the plus side, in Express Gifts the group has reduced the cost/sale
ratio, cut the agency base, improved the conversion to customers rate, and
introduced structured credit.
The mail-order educational business performed well, lifting turnover 10 per
cent. Mr Chapman stressed that this rise was achieved at a time when many
schools were not fully using their budgets.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.5p (3.3p) payable from earnings of 4.97p
(4.87p) per share.
COMMENT
Is Fine Art accident-prone or simply buffeted by forces beyond its control?
Some say a raft of influences - Sunday trading laws, changes in the pattern
of the public's charity giving, the National Lottery - have compounded an
already depressed trading environment. Problems lurking round the corner
include raw material price rises and consumer resistance to more expensive
cards and paper products. However, from a lower base things are expected to
improve, or at least not get worse. Forecast pre-tax profits for the current
year have been scaled back from Pounds 42m to Pounds 39m, or earnings of
about 32p, for a multiple of about 11.7. At the current price that is a
decent discount to the market, but the shares will not be going anywhere for
a while.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: LIG back in black with Pounds 1m - A
'meaningful' final dividend forecast if recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group, the condoms and gloves manufacturer, yesterday
heralded a return to the dividend list as it swung back into the black with
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m, against losses of Pounds 5.1m last
time.
Mr Nick Hodges, chief executive, said LIG intended to pay a meaningful final
dividend if progress achieved in the first half continued.
'It will not be a nominal dividend,' he said, 'but nor will we be looking to
return to the levels of previous years.' Dividends in future would be
covered at least twice by earnings.
LIG came close to collapse last year as a result of its disastrous foray
into photo processing, a business which has since been sold. In the year to
March, the company incurred losses of Pounds 174m. It was then forced to
call on shareholders for Pounds 115m to repair the balance sheet.
Mr Hodges said LIG was not yet out of the woods. While the right steps had
been taken, he said, 'we now have to prove that we can grow the business
organically and deliver the profits everyone is expecting of us'.
LIG's return to profit in the first half showed it had made good progress,
Mr Hodges said. Costs had been cut, with staff numbers down from 10,250 to
4,360, and operating cashflow had improved. LIG was on track to achieve net
margins of about 15 per cent by 1996.
Operating profits for the six months to September 30 had also almost doubled
from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.7m.
Sales fell by 18 per cent from Pounds 197.1m to Pounds 161.4m because of the
sale of the photo business. Excluding discontinued businesses, sales rose by
5 per cent to Pounds 130m.
At the pre-tax level, profits were helped by a Pounds 1.6m drop in interest
charges to Pounds 5.9m and the exceptional Pounds 2.2m gain on the sale of
the Wright's Coal Tar Soap business.
The condoms business grew 10 per cent in the first half. LIG reversed a
long-term decline in the US by adding 1 percentage point to its market
share, giving it 24 per cent. Mr Hodges was optimistic of further progress
after the launch of the new Avanti condom, made of polyurethane.
The surgical gloves division improved sales by about 31 per cent.
Gearing fell from 137 per cent at the-year end to 69 per cent.
Earnings per share were 0.32p, against losses last time of 3.93p. The shares
closed 5p ahead at 85p.
COMMENT
This appears to be the turning point for a company that has had somewhat of
a rollercoaster ride over the last year. Management is taking all the right
steps and the value of the core businesses is beginning to show through. The
question now will be whether LIG can fund the promotion of its strong brands
internationally. If it cannot, then with a share price still a long way from
last year's 272p it is vulnerable to takeover. These results, however, may
be the first indication that LIG should be given the chance to go it alone.
Forecasts are for between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m this year, with an
equally wide dividend range of 0.5p to 1p. On the low-end p/e of 33 times
this is still only a stock for the risk-takers. However, those already in
might want to hang on for what could be an interesting ride.

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Consummation could spark
further marriages - The background to the investment banking industry's
biggest leap yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS, JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The birth of the international investment banking industry has not proceeded
smoothly in the past 15 years. Many initiatives have proved disastrous - the
ill-fatedmoves by US commercial banks like Citicorp and Chase Manhattan into
the London stockmarket in the mid-1980s, for instance.
But the proposed combination of Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg would be the
industry'sbiggest leap yet. A consummation of the deal could also spark
mergers and acquisitions among other investment and commercial banks,
according to industry executives and analysts.
The growth of international investment and cross-border takeovers - and a
general belief that, given the heavy costs involved, there is only room for
a small number of banks with global reach - lie behind the move.
'There are likely to be only a handful of banks dominating international
capital flows,' says Mr William Hartman, until recently a New York-based
investment banking analyst with JP Morgan. 'They want to get a headstart on
the rest of the world.'
The logic in combining a US and a European bank has been apparent for some
time, and has led to serious debate in recent years. UBS is understood to
have discussed a takeover of Lehman Brothers, but backed off partly out of a
concern about the culture clash that might result from absorbing a pushy US
investment bank.
Barclays revealed recently that it is looking to expand in the US, either
through an association or by takeover. Warburg's name has frequently been
linked in takeover rumours with JP Morgan, the US bank which was forced to
part with Morgan Stanley by the 1933 Glass Steagall Act.
There are some obvious reasons why Morgan Stanley and Warburg might consider
the timing for such a deal is finally right.
First, international capital flows - and in particular overseas investment
from the US - have picked up fast in the past two years. Wall Street's
so-called 'bulge bracket' firms, long used to making their profits in the US
markets, have found that the trading technology and skills developed in the
US can be exported profitably to other markets. Morgan Stanley is estimated
to be making around 60 per cent of its profits overseas.
Second, recent poor results at Warburg have highlighted a strategic dilemma
the bank has faced for some time. Though generally acknowledged as the
leading home-grown investment bank in the UK, it has lacked both the capital
base and the trading skills - particularly in the bond and derivatives
markets - to compete internationally with its bigger US rivals.
The US banks, meanwhile, have invested a large slice of what until this year
were strong domestic profits in building their international presence. This
has resulted in a massive build-up of resources by US banks in London in
recent years: Morgan Stanley, for instance, employs nearly 2,000 people in
Europe's financial centre.
The third explanation for the timing resides in Morgan Stanley's own
financial position. In common with its main rivals, the bank's capital base
expanded fast in the early 1990s on the back of record profits. Putting that
capital to productive use has become something of a challenge.
At the end of last year, Morgan Stanley's shareholders' funds stood at
Dollars 4.5bn, half as much again as two years before. With weak financial
markets, it has been hard to earn a good return on this bigger capital base
 -though at around 10 per cent, the bank's post-tax return on equity still
puts it ahead of most competitors this year. Only Merrill, at over 15 per
cent, has done better.
A big investment overseas would provide Morgan Stanley with a higher profile
in more overseas markets.
By contrast, the relative weakness of Warburg's capital base and revenue
stream has been seen by analysts as one of the factors preventing it
competing with US firms. Warburg had shareholders' funds of just over Pounds
1bn at September 30. Although this amount is enough to run existing
businesses, it meant it would have had difficulty expanding by acquisition.
'This was inevitable,' said a partner at one of Warburg's US-based
competitors. 'They were trying to build an international investment bank
without an international bank's revenue base.' For all the success of its UK
and European equities business, Warburg found it hard to generate profitsto
match the US banks, in what is still a highly fragmented market.
'This says that Warburg believes its strategy is not ever going to succeed,'
said the chief executive of one UK-based investment bank which has also
pursued an integrated approach, albeit on a more modest scale.
'They had no hope of ever overtaking the Americans in their own backyard,'
he added, noting that without a significant sales and trading presence in
the US, it is impossible to be a global bank.
But the merger also represents a reversal of strategy by Morgan Stanley.
Both firms have invested substantial amounts in each other's markets in
recent years. Warburg, for instance, has built up a 300-strong US equity
business in New York in the past two years, and bought a Chicago-based
derivatives company.
There are even bigger overlaps in the London operation. Although Morgan
Stanley has a far bigger presence in the non-sterling fixed income markets
than Warburg, many of the two banks' activities are similar. Referring to
London, one person close to the deal says: 'It's obvious where the biggest
redundancies are going to be'.
However logical the deal, there remain many questions about how effective it
would prove in practice. The most prominent: how would the bank be run, and
how easily would the two banks' cultures combine?
There are considerable challenges in bringing together businesses with
different cultures and pay scales. 'It will be a hell of a force if they can
pull it off, but the first year or two will be spent sorting out all the
places where they are doubled up, and that will divert quite some energy,'
said one chief executive of a UK investment bank.
Given their respective sizes, it seems inevitable that the new group will be
dominated by Morgan Stanley. According to one executive close to the deal,
the objective is to integrate the two banks' businesses, rather than to run
them as separate geographic entities.
This echoes the trend among other investment banks of organising global
operations around business lines, such as equities or bonds, rather than
around geographic regions. But it would also tend to leave the bigger
shareholder in firm control.
'This is not a takeover of Warburg by Morgan Stanley,' says the executive.
Some of the enlarged bank's operations may end up being run from outside the
US. Indeed, the head of Morgan Stanley's equity business is based in London
already, and the bank's board occasionally meets outside the US. But such
arrangements will not disguise where the true power in the merged firm lies.

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Exchange stamps on rumours -
Share trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange again demonstrated yesterday its commitment to force
companies to make public statements when there is an unexpected surge in
trading in their shares, Robert Peston writes.
Yesterday's victim was SG Warburg, one of the Exchange's own member firms.
After a flurry of trading in Warburg's shares when the market opened at
8.30am, the merchant bank was forced to announce - a week ahead of schedule
 -that it is in merger talks with the US investment bank, Morgan Stanley.
However the rumour sweeping the stock market which led to this surge made no
reference to Morgan Stanley. The speculation was that Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation was about to launch a tender for 14.9 per cent of
Warburg. The previous day there had been a rumour linking Warburg with JP
Morgan - speculation that has surfaced several times over the past few
years.
The announcement of the actual transaction being negotiated by the two banks
was made at 10.48am. Prior to that, 2.1m Warburg shares had been traded,
almost four times the total for Wednesday, a typical day.
Because of this unexpected increase in trading volumes, the Exchange had
telephoned Warburg's stockbroker, Cazenove, at around 9am, to inquire
whether there was a reason to put Warburg's shares on 'indicative' status.
That would have temporarily relieved market makers, the wholesaler of
shares, of their obligation to deal at prices quoted on the SEAQ
computerised share price system - and would have been a signal to the market
that a statement would be coming. Before the shares went indicative, at
9.35am, Cazenove contacted its client, Warburg - which then woke up the
management of Morgan Stanley in the US.

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Caught in the blast of Big
Bang's second barrel - The rivals react
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of Warburg's London-based rivals were putting on a brave face
yesterday. But most admitted privately that a merger would pose a powerful
new competitive threat to them and could precipitate a fundamental
restructuring of investment banking in London.
Eight years after London's Big Bang, some of the changes predicted then may
be about to happen.
'The second barrel of Big Bang is being pulled. There are many more deals to
come,' said one senior merchant banker.
Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said:
'Although it does not change the landscape completely, it points to a period
of more consolidation in London.'
Analysts said the merger proposal might prompt other banks which have looked
at Warburg in the past to improve on Stanley's terms or, more likely, to
look elsewhere in London.
'The merger throws down a gauntlet to other international investment banking
groups. The likes of HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner are keen to expand in
London but there are not many properties to go round,' said one analyst.
Deutsche recently announced plans to centralise all its investment banking
operation in London and most observers argue that the Warburg merger will if
anything strengthen London's position as a financial centre.
In competitive terms, the deal would appear to threaten other London banks
which have pursued the same integrated strategy as Warburg, offering a full
range of trading services, as well as fee-based advice to their clients.
'Firms like Kleinwort Benson will now look even smaller in global terms. The
merged company will be a more formidable competitor for the international
issue work, where Kleinwort has been so successful,' said one analyst. The
head of another investment bank said Warburg's move will force his own board
to examine more closely its strategy, which has employed a more cautious
approach to overseas expansion and to the development of an international
distribution network.
Such integrated investment banks were introduced into London with Big Bang.
The City still remains dominated by the old structure of independent
merchant banks and brokers. But many of the market practices which support
the existing structure - notably the traditional rights issue, and
pre-emption rights - are coming under attack.
'The old idea that merchant banks can merely give advice, without providing
equity distribution as well, has had its day,' said the head of one
independent stockbroker. 'Warburg's strategy has been absolutely right. The
problem is that it is just not big enough to compete with the Americans
internationally.'
Yet many of the independent merchant banks, such as Schroders and Lazard
Brothers, have continued to thrive and believe change, if it comes, will be
slow.
Many are sceptical about the reasons for the proposed merger and claim that,
if it goes ahead, it will present opportunities for them.
One leading merchant banker said: 'This is an elegant way for both companies
to address their excessive overheads. There will be blood on the carpet in
London and New York, enabling their rivals to pick up good staff cheaply.'
Others state confidently that Warburg will lose clients. 'Some of Warburg's
more conservative UK clients may think twice about staying with a
US-dominated firm,' said a rival investment banker.
But most observers believe the merger will accelerate London's move towards
the US system of integrated investment banks.
'Ten years from now, distribution will be much more important than it is
now,' said the chairman of one merchant bank which has eschewed building a
worldwide distribution network. 'What we do remains to be seen.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: A promising merger that
crosses different cultures - The Fit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are like chalk and cheese: the
former an understated UK merchant bank, the latter a powerful Wall Street
investment house.
Yet, while the two houses might find it challenging to reconcile their
sharply differing corporate cultures, they do have some traits in common -
including a certain blue-blooded history - and many aspects of their
businesses are complementary.
In particular, Warburg has a very modest presence in the US capital markets,
while Morgan Stanley is among the leading Wall Street houses. It is a
prominent force in all areas of US activity - equities, bonds and corporate
finance - and is also a leading player in global fixed-income, foreign
exchange and commodities.
In Europe, Morgan Stanley has been building up a sizeable presence from its
London base. but it would benefit from Warburg's strong corporate client
list and trading position in the UK and on the continent. In the UK, in
particular, Warburg enjoys one of the biggest and most prestigious lists of
clients for corporate advisory work.
Despite Morgan's European expertise in equity research and cross-border
takeovers, it has made little headway in UK corporate finance and
distribution, observers say.
A merger could put the banks at the top of the cross-border mergers and
acquisitions league table. According to Securities Data, Morgan Stanley
ranked second in the year to date, with deals worth Dollars 77.8bn, while
Warburg was in 10th tenth place at Dollars 19bn.
The combined bank would also be a powerful force in the fast-growing area of
international equities issuance. So far this year Morgan Stanley ranked
third in the world, with bookrunning mandates worth Dollars 2.9bn, while SG
Warburg ranked fifth, with bookrunning mandates of Dollars 2.3bn.
The jewel in Warburg's crown is Mercury Asset Management, the highly
profitable fund management arm, of which it owns 75 per cent.
Here too the banks are complementary: Warburg is strongest in UK/European
equity and international fixed-income investment, while Morgan Stanley
shines in US and emerging market investing.
The main area of overlap between the two is in the Far East, where both
companies are significant players in the primary equity markets.
There is also likely to be substantial duplication of resources on the
research side of the business, particularly in Europe.
Both houses have a reputation for excellent investment research, especially
in equities. This year, Warburg topped the closely-followed Extel league
table of UK-based analysts for the fourth year running, Morgan Stanley was
in eleventh place, but also boasts several highly regarded equity analysts
in London.
In the US, the 1994 survey of US brokerage analysts by Institutional
Investor magazine ranked Morgan Stanley sixth best, a slight slip from its
fifth ranking last year.
Probably its best-known analyst is emerging markets strategist Barton Biggs,
whose bullish stance on China last year prompted a remarkable surge in Hong
Kong share prices.
The risk of merging two high-powered research teams is that some of the most
highly-rated analysts may feel eclipsed by the competition - and leave. 'You
can only have a limited number of prima donnas at any one bank,' says one
analyst. Indeed, merging two institutions with such distinct cultures could
be a painful and complicated process. 'You've got to do a lot of smoothing:
strategies, technology, and, most importantly, people's egos,' says one
banker.
This bears the risk of demoralising staff, leading to defections. 'The best
people often leave when companies undergo such radical overhauls,' he says.

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Elite child of a depression -
Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley was born, sixty years ago next September, an offspring of the
1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. Amid the economic
calamities of the era, a Congress eager to strengthen the foundations of the
nation's financial system passed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, enshrining
the separation of the commercial banking and securities businesses in the
US.
Forced to choose between the two businesses in 1934, JP Morgan - Wall
Street's dominant firm - elected to concentrate on banking. Within a year, a
group of senior partners at JP Morgan resigned and joined forces with
several partners of the Philadelphia firm of Drexel &amp; Co to form 'a new
organisation for the underwriting and wholesaling of investment securities.'
Under the leadership of Harold Stanley and Henry Morgan, the grandson of JP
Morgan, the firm of Morgan Stanley set up business at Number Two Wall Street
on September 16, 1935.
In its first full-year, Morgan Stanley managed or co-managed Dollars 1.1bn
of public offerings and private placements, or 24 per cent of the entire
market, and from that auspicious start it never looked back. In the ensuing
40 years, Morgan Stanley grew into Wall Street's most successful and
prestigious wholesale securities firm.
Throughout its prime, Morgan Stanley was sustained by a corporate culture
that set the firm apart from the trailing pack. Hiring the best and the
brightest from the country's top families and universities, the firm molded
its executives into an elite corps which cultivated a mystique that
impressed clients and intimidated rivals.
By the 1970s, although the firm was one of the biggest underwriters of
securities in the US, it began to diversify into securities trading and
later, the rapidly-growing and glamorous business of mergers and
acquisitions, where Wall Street's pre-eminent dealmaker, Mr Robert
Greenhill, led the way throughout the M&amp;A boom years in the 1980s.
But the firm's dominance began to slip as its competitors adapted faster to
a rapidly-changing world. In 1986, the firm went public to secure access to
the capital the biggest securities houses increasingly needed to compete in
US and global capital markets.
Although it was still regarded as the best-managed of Wall Street firms  -
its return on equity consistently outstripped those of its rivals in the mid
and late-1980s - the future appeared to belong to the new giants of Wall
Street, such as Goldman Sachs (which took over Morgan Stanley's mantle as
the elite of the industry).
By the start of the 1990s, Morgan Stanley was just one of several dominant
'bulge bracket' firms in the securities industry. The balance of its
business had shifted away from stock broking and underwriting and towards
proprietary trading, and its M&amp;A business was enduring the sharp decline in
deal activity apparent across Wall Street. The M&amp;A department later suffered
a blow when Mr Greenhill left the firm in June 1993 to join securities house
Smith Barney taking a dozen top investment bankers with him.
In the last two years, the firm has bounced back, moving rapidly into the
burgeoning derivatives business. Although its earnings have been hit by the
sharp downturn in the securities industry this year, it has pursued an
aggressive expansion strategy, focussing primarily on building up its
presence in overseas markets. Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's ambitious
president, said recently that the firm's goal was to be the 'Number One
global investment bank'.

FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Sir Siegmund's rich legacy -
SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One banker likely to have been sceptical about the merits of a merger
between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley would have been the late Sir Siegmund
Warburg, who founded the London-based firm after the second world war.
In a rare interview given to Euromoney in 1980, he suggests that the sheer
size of the combined businesses would have troubled him: 'What worries me,
very much quite frankly, is that we are already getting too big on both
sides of the Atlantic,' he said.
He would also have been concerned about whether the cultural differences
between the two organisations might cause problems: 'One general reservation
which I feel about some . . . of the US investment banking houses is that
they put too much emphasis on measuring, almost from month to month, what a
specific partner produces. I don't even like the way they pronounce the word
 -not produce, but 'prodooce'. All this emphasis on producing - that is all
right for a cow, but not for a human being.'
SG Warburg has come a very long way since that interview. Then it employed
around 650 people. At the end of its last financial year, staff numbers were
4,472.
Under Sir Siegmund's stewardship, it was in the tradition of a European
Banque d'Affaires, concentrating on giving advice to companies on a variety
of deals. It occasionally thought up new securities (Warburg is often
credited with creating the Euro markets) and it initiated the UK's first
hostile takeover attempt. Periodically, it made slightly wacky investments
(for example, in an advertising company).
A variety of picaresque stories about Warburg entered into City of London
folklore, most of them true.
These included the use of a Swiss graphologist, or handwriting analyst, to
assess potential employees (still used today), the practice of eavesdropping
on colleagues' business phone calls to eliminate the notion of secrecy
within the firm (no longer widespread because of City regulations) and
holding two lunch sittings, to double the number of clients who could be
entertained (though frugally, without wine).
The strategy which has brought Warburg to consider a merger with Morgan
Stanley was adopted in 1984 by Sir David Scholey, soon to retire as the
bank's chairman, and who was regarded by Sir Siegmund as his 'adopted son'.
That was when Warburg decided to become an 'integrated' investment bank, or
financial supermarket for big companies, combining the traditional advisory
functions of a merchant bank with securities trading.
It bought two London stockbrokers, Rowe &amp; Pitman and Mullens, and a
stockjobber, Akroyd &amp; Smithers. Offices opened all over the world - at last
count, the firm operated out of 24 countries.
Warburg had one outstanding success in its fund management arm, Mercury
Asset Management, the UK's biggest money manager. But the core investment
banking business has produced a lower return on capital than some of its
bigger US rivals, such as Goldman Sachs, or its more specialist domestic
rivals, such as Schroders, Smith New Court or Cazenove &amp; Company. In the six
months to September 30 , its profits, excluding MAM, were negligible.
By considering a merger with Morgan Stanley, it is adopting the argument
that 'critical mass' is vital to its success. So perhaps Sir Siegmund should
have the last word: 'The danger is that the bigger a company becomes, the
more difficult it is to deal with it on a personal basis, and the more you
become slaves of a big bureaucratic machinery.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / GUS gives Pounds 300m back to shareholders in special
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, property and financial
services group, is to hand Pounds 300m of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile back to
shareholders in the form of a 30p per share special dividend.
The proposed dividend was announced as the group revealed a 5.5 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30, from Pounds
213.2m to Pounds 225m.
But with the special dividend payable only to those holding shares
yesterday, and the smaller than expected profits - GUS shares fell 35p to
496p.
Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said the group had been seeking ways of
redistributing some of its cash for some time. It decided a special dividend
was the 'most equitable' way of giving money back to shareholders, but had
to stay 'within certain parameters' to gain approval from the Inland
Revenue.
The move by GUS last year to enfranchise its non-voting shareholders sparked
hopes in the City of a change of culture in one of the more conservative and
low-profile FT-SE 100 companies.
Speculation that GUS might launch a share buy-back resurfaced following the
Pounds 508m buy-back by fellow retailer Boots last month, and some analysts
were disappointed that GUS instead chose a special dividend.
Other analysts were disappointed by the size of the payout and suggested GUS
might pay further special dividends in future.
Mr Pugh said the group would continue to look for appropriate ways of using
its cash. It was still seeking an acquisition 'which complements our
existing business and has a good, continuing management'.
He added that GUS was ready to use its strength in mail order to launch
electronic shopping services, once the infrastructure - national fibre-optic
cabling - was in place, and consumer demand was strong enough.
'We have got the systems ready, they have been tried and tested, but the
public demand is not there yet,' Mr Pugh said.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds 1.54bn. The trading profit
increased 11.2 per cent to Pounds 176.7m, although interest receivable fell
from Pounds 51.6m to Pounds 46.3m.
Sales in the home shopping division, which includes the Kays and Marshall
Ward catalogues, increased 6 per cent to Pounds 868.1m. Operating profits
grew 13 per cent to Pounds 77.5m, thanks to cost control.
Sales in the Burberrys and Scotch House clothing and retailing division grew
from Pounds 85.4m to Pounds 102.2m. The overseas retailing division
increased sales 9 per cent to Pounds 96.5m, and operating profits from
Pounds 11m to Pounds 11.8m. Profits from property rentals grew from Pounds
26.8m to Pounds 29.4m.
Turnover in the finance division, which includes consumer and corporate
finance, banking and business information services, jumped from Pounds 398m
to Pounds 472.5m, with profits up from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 40.4m.
The interim dividend, which will be paid together with the special dividend,
rose from 4p to 4.5p. Earnings per share rose from 14.1p to 14.8p.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Allianz plans to make its shares more affordable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Allianz, Germany's biggest insurance group, wants to make its costly shares
more attractive to small investors by cutting their nominal value and thus
splitting them into smaller units, according to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle,
the chairman.
His statement, in an interview with the Financial Times, comes in the same
week that Dresdner Bank became the first big German concern to announce firm
plans to reduce the nominal value of its stock units from DM50 to DM5. This
is allowed under new legislation to promote the attractiveness and
efficiency of German financial markets.
'If we can make sure that trading in our shares is made easier, then of
course we are interested in this whole development,' Mr Schulte-Noelle said.
However, because of technical procedures over the handling of its shares
(registered under individual names rather than in more easily processed
bearer form) and the costs of moving to lower-denominated shares, he said
this may take two years.
With a closing price yesterday of DM2,466 (Pounds 1,006), Allianz's shares
are among the most expensive in Germany. Dresdner's were DM408.50 and those
of Deutsche Bank, also considering such a move, were DM729.
Mr Schulte-Noelle said smaller denominated shares could play a role in
encouraging German investors to invest more in equities.
'For small investors, it makes a difference whether they have to pay around
DM2,500 for one Allianz share or DM250.' Allianz shares are among the most
heavily traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
Many big foreign investors see them as a proxy for the whole German market
because Allianz has extensive stakes in companies and banks as part of its
investment portfolio, earnings on which offset losses on insurance
underwriting. Thus Mr Schulte-Noelle expressed strong concern over political
moves in Bonn to restrict industrial holdings of banks and maybe other
financial institutions.
'This is a debate we follow very, very carefully because it could possibly
affect us in various ways.' If shareholdings were limited to, say 5 per
cent, 'this would have a great effect on our industrial investments.'
Companies in which Allianz has minority stakes above 10 per cent include
BASF, Bayerische Hypo-Bank, Dresdner Bank, BHF-Bank, Munich Re, Veba and
RWE.
In turn, 60 per cent of its equity is owned by Munich Re (with 25 per cent),
Deutsche Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Dresdner Bank with 10 per cent
each, and Hypo-Bank with 5 per cent.
Mr Schulte-Noelle said action to curb financial stakes in industry would put
a 'tremendous burden' on the stock market. 'It would drive prices down and
that cannot be in the interests of the government.'
He also opposed moves to limit further the number of seats anyone may hold
on a company's supervisory board. 'We are big investors and if we own maybe
10 per cent of a big company, we have a definite interest in sitting on the
supervisory board to see what's happening.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Firm start for SGS Thomson's IPO launch

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer,
yesterday launched an initial public offer of 21m shares in the Paris and
New York stock markets, which could eventually raise more than Dollars 470m
(Pounds 286m) for expansion.
The shares began trading in Paris yesterday at a slight premium to the
French offer price of FFr119.95. In New York, the price was set at Dollars
22.25 per share, the upper end of a Dollars 21-Dollars 23 range set when
plans for the offer were announced last month.
The sale of some 16.3 per cent of the company's enlarged capital marks
SGS-Thomson's first move away from state control since its formation in 1987
from a merger between two loss-making, state companies, Thomson
Semiconductors of France and SGS Microelectronics of Italy.
Since then, the company has grown to challenge the world's top 10
semiconductor manufacturers. In October, the group reported net profits for
the six months to July of Dollars 166.1m, more than for the whole of the
previous financial year.
Some 18.6 per cent of the company could be sold in the offer, if
underwriters exercise their right to issue a further 3.15m shares which is
is expected to close next Thursday.
The Franco-Italian holding company which owns 95.49 per cent of the company
will reduce its stake to about 80 per cent, while Thorn EMI of the UK, will
be left with 2.8 per cent.
Morgan Stanley is acting as global coordinator of the issue.

FT  09 DEC 94 / BSkyB plans to increase links with BT: Raymond Snoddy looks
to the future as the shares are priced at 256p and open at a premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, which yesterday
made its stock market debut in New York and London, is planning a close and
growing relationship with British Telecommunications.
BSkyB shares, priced yesterday at 256p, opened at a premium. In London, the
shares closed at 268 1/2 p. In New York, American Depositary Shares offered
at Dollars 24.05 were trading at Dollars 25 1/4 .
Last month BSkyB, valued yesterday at Pounds 4.4bn, and BT announced a
marketing tie-up to offer discount telephone services to satellite
television subscribers. Other more extensive links between the two
organisations, which see themselves as natural allies, are now possible.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake, has been planning for some time a move into digital television. The
'black boxes' now being developed have an internal modem to enable data
communication down existing telephone lines.
The aim is to use a telephone data link to enable viewers to order
automatically films of their choice using a keypad. At least at the outset
the intention is to offer 'near-video-on-demand'. Such a system involves
broadcasting a small number of the top films on a large number of channels
with staggered starts so viewers are never more than 15 or 20 minutes away
from the beginning of a film of their choice.
The system which would involve extra business for BT could also be developed
for home shopping services.
BSkyB, which plans to add the Disney Channel to its roster of channels next
autumn, would also like to provide programming and marketing services if BT
launches video-on-demand nationally using telephone lines.
More than 500 financial institutions around the world bought into the BSkyB
share offer which was more than five times subscribed in the UK and nearly
six times in the US. The UK retail offer, which raised Pounds 93m, was 1.3
times subscribed.
Overall, the net proceeds of the issue are estimated to be Pounds 824m which
will largely be used, together with a new bank facility, to pay off
guarantees entered into by BSkyB's main banks.
None of the original shareholders sold shares. Chargeurs, the French
communications group, actually bought new shares to prevent dilution of its
stake. After the flotation, on a fully diluted basis, the public will own 17
per cent of BSkyB and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International will hold 40
per cent. Chargeurs will be just below 17 per cent with Pearson on 14 per
cent and Granada 12 per cent.
Granada has long said it will ultimately be a seller of its BSkyB stake
because it usually wants to own 100 per cent of the businesses it is
involved in. If Granada sells it would mean that BSkyB would be able to
enter the FT-SE 100, almost certainly giving a further boost to the shares.
In the UK retail offer, applicants for shares worth Pounds 50,000 or less
will receive all they applied for. At higher thresholds, these allocations
apply: up to Pounds 60,000 - 95%; Pounds 70,000 - 90%, Pounds 80,000 - 85%,
Pounds 100,000 - 80%, above Pounds 100,000 - 62.25%.

FT  09 DEC 94 / GrandMet makes new charge on sale of US canneries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, has agreed to sell its US
vegetable canning plants to streamline the operations of its Green Giant
brand. A similar move on the frozen side of Green Giant, the leading US
brand, has helped it to increase market share.
The deal will entail a Pounds 42m charge in the current year only a week
after GrandMet announced at its year-end results that it had identified all
such restructuring charges for the 'foreseeable future'. Although it had
left open the possibility of small charges arising on transactions, the
timing surprised the City.
'It is a little bit niggling to have this stream of restructuring charges.
It's typical of GrandMet,' one analyst said.
GrandMet's Pillsbury subsidiary is selling six largely seasonal plants to
Seneca, a New York-based company with canneries across the US. The UK group
will receive Pounds 46m over the next 15 years. Pillsbury will take the
charge for closing another four plants.
Pillsbury estimates that economies of scale from the deal will save it
Pounds 21m a year, plus releasing Pounds 172m in fixed and working capital.
Pillsbury will retain control over seeds supplied to farmers, which it said
was the key element in Green Giant's quality. Pillsbury will retain the
brand, marketing and distribution of the canned vegetables.
'We are in a position to concentrate on product development and marketing
and let our processing partners do what they do best,' Mr Paul Walsh,
Pillsbury's chief executive, said.
Canned and frozen vegetables account for equal shares of a Dollars
4.3bn-a-year US market. Green Giant is number one and growing in frozen but
number two to Del Monte and declining in canned. Seneca's greater geographic
spread will help protect Green Giant from bad crops in the Midwest where its
canneries are based.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Mitsubishi breaks ranks to buy steel from S Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A significant crack has appeared in Japan's traditional corporate
relationships with the unprecedented decision by Mitsubishi Motors to import
steel from South Korea, long seen by Japanese manufacturers as their chief
rival.
Mitsubishi Motors, the carmaker within the Mitsubishi group of companies,
broke an industry taboo by signing a contract with Korea's Pohang Iron and
Steel to buy steel sheet on a long-term basis.
The agreement reflects growing pressures on Japanese manufacturers to lower
costs following the yen's appreciation. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, in its annual survey of Japan's economy,
warned yesterday that the yen's strength was the biggest threat to the
country's emerging recovery.
Mitsubishi would not disclose the price of Korean steel sheet, but it is
believed to be 15 to 20 per cent cheaper than the Japanese product. Nissan,
Japan's second largest carmaker, and Honda also said they were testing
Korean steel sheet.
Reports of the Korean imports, decided on Wednesday, depressed the share
prices of Japanese steel companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Nippon
Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, was the most actively traded issue,
down Y6 to Y368 (Dollars 3.7). NKK and Kobe Steel were also among the 10
most actively traded issues, with NKK down Y9 to Y269 and Kobe down Y5 to
Y311.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Lloyd's in new moves to settle with Names out of court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is to make a fresh attempt at striking an out-of-court
deal to end the mass of legal action blighting the insurance market.
A 'step-by-step' strategy for breaking the impasse between lossmaking
members pursuing claims totalling at least Pounds 3bn, and professional
Lloyd's agencies being sued, was unveiled yesterday by Mr David Rowland,
Lloyd's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive.
The process - which at first will not involve negotiations between the
parties - is expected to last a few months, with March suggested as a
possible deadline.
The Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market
 -are seeking compensation in court for heavy losses incurred in the late
1980s and early 1990s. As an early concession, Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland
announced the shelving of plans to force them to use any damages won in
court to settle their debts at Lloyd's.
The proposals have themselves become the subject of legal action with groups
representing lossmaking Names saying the plan sought to make Lloyd's a
preferential creditor and amounted to a retrospective change in regulations.
Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton said they wanted to learn lessons from the last
attempt at an out-of-court settlement, worth Pounds 900m, which Names
rejected in February. The first stage this time would be to tackle the
dispute between Names and those who provided insurance to the Lloyd's
agencies being sued, over settlement funds available.
Solicitors will be asked to verify computer figures showing sums that might
be available from 'errors and omissions' (E&amp;O) policies, which provided
insurance against negligence.
The calculations will be controversial because they depend on the strength
of Names' claims, the detailed wording of policies and on assumptions about
whether the first cases in the legislative queue should scoop most of the
E&amp;O 'pot'.
E&amp;O insurers believe Names have overestimated the sums available, and they
are opposed to fresh negotiations.

FT  09 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Micro-budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's chosen method to compensate for the income lost through
abandoning additional VAT on fuel was almost the least damaging available.
The worst option would have been to take the money from contingency
reserves; cutting next year's public expenditure was probably politically
unviable, given the tightness of the spending negotiations; and increasing
business taxes risked damaging the corporate sector's recovery.
Instead, raising duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol has proved
politically and economically seductive - politically, because it punishes
the Conservative rebels for blocking VAT on fuel; economically, because the
additional duty is inflation friendly: the duties will increase the retail
price index by only 0.26 per cent compared with the 0.43 per cent the higher
VAT on fuel would have produced.
The chancellor, however, did not select the best option economically. He
could have raised the money without any inflationary impact if he had
increased direct taxes, for example by not indexing allowances. This would
have significantly boosted his chances of achieving the challenging target
of keeping underlying inflation below 2.5 per cent during the second half of
the parliament. Perhaps he is betting that brewers, tobacco groups and
petrol companies will be forced by the acute competition in retailing to
absorb the increases rather than pass them on to consumers.

FT  09 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Great Universal Stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like East Midlands Electricity, Great Universal Stores argues that a special
dividend is the fairer way of repatriating surplus cash to shareholders -
fairer, that is, than a Boots-style share buy-back. To some extent, this is
true, as all GUS shareholders get the 30p-a-share dividend, whereas in
practice the method by which Boots bought back its shares favoured
institutional investors over private shareholders. But how fair the GUS move
is depends on the investor's tax position. While those institutions which
pay no tax will appreciate the dividend bonanza, private investors who are
high rate tax-payers face a tax bill in addition to a paper loss on GUS
shares. They fell yesterday by 35p, more than the 30p a share special
payout. The near 7 per cent drop in the share price is not just a technical
adjustment to a share going ex-dividend. It reflects disgruntlement over the
size of the payout - Pounds 300m out of a cash pile five times as big - and
the modest earnings dilution expected for 1995.
This criticism is fair enough but the share price reaction is overdone. By
its own conservative standards GUS is becoming more adventurous. The
enfranchisement of shareholders last year and now the special dividend show
the group taking investors' interests more seriously than in the past.
Moreover, the solidity of the underlying business, proven over decades, is
once again underscored by the 11 per cent increase in operating profits in
the first half. Looking out to 1995, the price fall yesterday has put the
shares back on a market rating; they deserve to regain a premium.

FT  09 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Merger merchants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg is selling control of itself to Morgan Stanley without receiving
a control premium. That would be a cynic's verdict on yesterday's
announcement of merger talks which, if successful, will leave the US
investment bank's shareholders owning two-thirds of the combined entity. It
may be an unfair verdict, but Warburg will have to convince its shareholders
that a merger advances their interests more than would a straight cash sale.
At present, Warburg's holding statement merely talks about the 'uniquely
complementary' nature of the two businesses. One way of reading this is that
Warburg has finally reached the conclusion that, in trying to create an
integrated global investment bank from its own resources, it has bitten off
more than it can chew. October's profit warning rammed this home. Warburg is
not merely under-capitalised compared with its larger US rivals; despite
great effort and expense, it is weak in the all-important US market. Merging
with Morgan Stanley will fill that hole.
Morgan Stanley, which lost its competitive edge in the late-1980s, has
strategic weaknesses too. Adding Warburg's expertise in the UK and some
other markets will potentially enable it to achieve global reach faster and
more effectively than building the business organically. So there is some
theoretical logic in the tie-up.
Whether a merger will pay off, in practice, is less clear. On the positive
side, the combined group may be able to generate more advisory,
capital-raising and fund management business by leveraging off its enhanced
international reach. There should also be plenty of scope to cut costs;
expensive staff could be made redundant and capital tied up in duplicate
operations could be released.
But successfully merging these people businesses will be hard. In hundreds
of cases, it will be necessary to decide whether a Warburg or a Morgan
Stanley employee is in charge of a particular operation and whether, indeed,
one of the two must lose his/her job. There will also be upward pressure on
Warburg salaries; though its staff are paid more than most British bankers,
they are paid less than their US counterparts. While all this is happening,
some of the best staff may walk. There is also a risk that the banks will be
so involved with such internal matters they may take their eye off the ball
of winning business.
Still, if the merger succeeds, it will be a powerful force in global
investment banking. The likes of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch would then
face a tougher competitor, but there will be a silver lining. The number of
banks operating on a global scale will have shrunk by one. The industry
could even settle down into a stable oligopoly, with large profits for all.
But smaller UK merchant banks and brokers are likely to feel naked. Banks
such as Schroders and Rothschild may come under pressure to team up with
brokers like Cazenove and Smith New Court to create integrated houses.
Meanwhile, integrated groups such as Kleinwort Benson may well conclude they
too need US partners. Such restructuring may lead to the control of famous
names slipping out of British hands. But if it enhances the City's position
as a global financial centre, that may be a price worth paying.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Post Office faces fresh investigation by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful committee of MPs is to reopen its inquiry into the Post Office's
future. The decision will intensify pressure on ministers to find ways of
enabling the Post Office to secure its commercial future after the forced
shelving of privatisation.
The Commons trade and industry committee expects to question Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, early in the new year, probably
in January.
Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's chief executive, will also be invited to
give evidence, along with other senior managers.
With privatisation off the agenda many MPs are worried about the Post
Office's ability to combat mounting competition unless it is given greater
commercial freedom within the public sector. But in a decision that boded
ill for the organisation's prospects of securing this increased freedom, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last week rejected pleas by the Post Office
board for a Pounds 100m cut in next year's Pounds 213m government levy on
post service profits.
The Post Office campaigned for the reduction when plans to privatise Royal
Mail, its letters division, were shelved last month after opposition from a
small number of Tory backbenchers.
Mr Cockburn said that a cut in the levy - known as the external finance
limit (EFL) - was essential to increase capital investment.
However the organisation has been cleared to handle a significantly greater
range of transactions than previously permitted through its extensive retail
network.
Post Office managers are keen to exploit the guidelines to push into new
areas, particularly in the financial services field. It recently presaged a
possible move into selling general insurance products by announcing a deal
with General Accident, the composite insurer, to sell travel insurance at
many Post Office branches.
The cross-party committee's first Post Office report, published in March,
said the EFL and the 'traditional Treasury restraint' on the organisation's
activities were having a 'detrimental impact'.
It came out in favour of the organisation being given the freedom to raise
money on the commercial markets without it being classed as government
borrowing.
Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, said at the time: 'The
committee strongly feels that the status quo cannot prevail.'

Buried in a commentary written by accountants Kingston Smith on this year's
(first) Budget is a passage on new tax breaks for venture capitalists. Bit
of a yawn? Kingston Smith obviously thinks so too, judging by the reference
to a package designed to 're-enervate the British Entrepreneur'.

Whatever one thinks of the cogency of the arguments advanced by British Gas
to support chief executive Cedric Brown's remuneration levels, the logic at
work in the lower echelons of the utility is certainly less than perfect.
Promoting a monthly direct debit system for settling the gas bill, the
company writes to an FT reader proudly announcing that, 'as a valued
customer, we thought you should be among the first to know about an
important new way to save money'. Sadly, the impact, if any, was rather
blunted by the accompanying sign-off: 'Act now and join the other three
million customers who already use this method . . .'

Whose were the long faces outside the manager's office of the Sheraton Hotel
in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, yesterday? Following an order from high up the
military regime, the hotel's management confronted 90 of the VIPs residing
at the hotel courtesy of the government's coffers, double-locked their rooms
and asked them to pay cash in advance or leave. They left.
The government is both the hotel's leading shareholder and by far its worst
debtor. This year the state has run up a bill at the Sheraton of 240m naira
(Dollars 11m at the official exchange rate), by retaining for its use 95
rooms and suites at an average cost of Dollars 50,000 a day. 'The government
departments footing the bill claim that most of these people were supposed
to have left the hotel months ago,' explains a civil servant. Anyway, who's
counting, when the national debt runs to a tidy Dollars 30bn?
Meanwhile, the departing guests should have seen it coming; in a broadcast
last month, on the anniversary of his coming to power, General Sani Abacha
warned that all Nigerians must make sacrifices because the economy was in
such poor shape.
Salt was rubbed into the wounds of the poor souls forced out: a few close
presidential advisers are being allowed to remain and enjoy their customary
state-funded plushness.
At least everyone now knows who is in and who is out - literally.

Well, what indeed should be the moniker attaching to this impending grand
union? Image consultants get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for this
sort of thing, but here is Observer's first try, gratis.
The most obvious, Morgan Warburg, has to be ditched right away - too close
to Deutsche Bank-owned Morgan Grenfell. Warburg would want a sharper
distinction from its old rival - even if a degree of fellow feeling might be
kindled between proud Brits forced to fall back on foreigners' superior
resources.
Warburg Morgan or Warburg Morgan Stanley is a non-starter, seeing that the
Americans will constitute two-thirds of the new company. Stanley Warburg, on
the other hand, is worse - sounds like a long-lost relative of old Sir
Siegmund's.
All of which suggests that the pair will wind up with the most obvious:
Morgan Stanley Warburg. A bit of a mouthful, but not so dreadful in a
business which has suffered handles such as Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp;
Smith.

All right, so it is the wrong Morgan that is in 'merger' talks with SG
Warburg. While everyone was squinting stage left in the direction of JP
Morgan, enter stage right the boys from Morgan Stanley. The latter had even
helpfully sent up a smoke signal last month by taking another 350,000 square
feet on the Isle of Dogs. Pity no one thought to ask the Americans how they
intended to fill the pristine new space.
So, while a large number of Warburgers were yesterday wondering whose
graphology test they should now be sitting, the more securely seated looked
yet more anxious - at the dreadful possibility of having to operate from
Canary Wharf.
Morgan Stanley president John Mack may wax lyrical to anyone who'll listen
on the subject of his marvellous London premises - but he works in New York.
At least the Corporation of London will be fighting the reluctant commuters'
corner, though. Having probably lost BZW's dealing floor to Docklands, the
Corporation will be mustard keen to keep Warburgs, or whatever it is called.

What do John Major, Douglas Hurd, Michael Heseltine and Sir Edward Heath
have in common? Why, all are committed to putting Britain at the heart of
Europe, of course. How curious, then, that not one of the four saw fit to
support the government when the Commons voted to give the European Union
finance bill a third reading in the early hours of yesterday morning.
And what happens to members of parliament who defy the government in
confidence votes? Well, last time, the eight Conservatives who defied the
whips over the bill's second reading were suspended from the parliamentary
party.
Quizzed as to why the four bigwigs did not vote yesterday, Downing Street
swiftly pointed to the size of the government's majority - an admittedly
hefty 272.
But one of last week's rebels, Michael Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth, was
stripped of the whip after abstaining on a confidence vote the government
won by 285 votes. Grounds for a choicely worded letter to the chief whip?

FT  09 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Clarke fills his VAT hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Parliament sank VAT on domestic fuel on Tuesday evening. Yesterday, Mr
Kenneth Clarke responded, in a sensible fashion.
The idea of VAT on fuel is not in itself objectionable. A uniform VAT would
distort consumer choices less than the VAT the UK has; combined with
suitable tax and benefit offsets for those on low incomes, a uniform VAT
could also be more progressive than the taxes the UK has. What was wrong
with this proposal was the inadequate compensation to lower-income
households, other than pensioners.
The measure was thrown out for other reasons as well. Among them was the
perception that taxes were being raised this year, to be lowered next. Such
a switch may be politically acceptable if the unpopularity of the increases
is less than the popularity of the subsequent reductions. In the case of VAT
on fuel, that was hardly the case.
The chancellor could have forgotten about the lost revenue, on the grounds
that it was marginal. But total revenue is raised from a series of
individually marginal taxes. Once made, a budget judgment needs to be
adhered to, unless economic circumstances have altered dramatically. More
important, the Commons has to appreciate the basic disciplines of
budget-making. Once a budget has been devised, any loss of revenue entails
additional revenue or additional expenditure cuts.
As the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, yesterday's changes are
progressive. Because the replacements are also taxes on sin (in which
category driving is now included), there should be little political
opposition.
What are the lessons of this experience? One is to avoid multi-year budgets,
since taxes may not look as urgent when they are introduced as when they are
announced. Another is to eschew particularly unpopular taxes if you have a
small majority. They seem painfully obvious now. They have certainly been
painful.

FT  09 DEC 94 / The mending of India's backbone: Private investors are
flocking in, as the government opens infrastructure projects to them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes four days to drive 1,500km from Delhi to Bombay, three months to
get electricity connected in Madras, and up to five years to obtain a
telephone line in Calcutta.
Such poor infrastructure is acting as a drag on the Indian economy, and
threatens to undermine the market-oriented reforms launched three years ago
by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister.
Out of necessity, rather than ideological conviction, Mr Rao has been forced
to open telecommunications, power and basic services to private investors,
in an effort to raise the billions of dollars needed to build the backbone
of a modern economy.
In electricity, government planners estimated in the early 1990s that the
country would need to expand its generating capacity of 70,000MW by 48,000MW
in 1992-97 to meet forecast increases in demand. In fact, less than 20,000MW
will be built, because of the squeeze in public spending. Simply making up
the shortfall would require about Dollars 28bn of private investment.
As for telecommunications, India has one of the world's least developed
networks, with just eight telephones per thousand people compared with 14 in
China and 130 in Malaysia. The government estimates that clearing the
existing waiting lists would require Rs230bn of private investment - on top
of Rs330bn earmarked from public funds for 1992-97, the period of the
current five-year plan.
And in transport, the ministry has listed construction schemes worth Dollars
6bn, including motorways, roads and bridges for private companies to build,
own and operate by charging tolls. Officials are also seeking investment in
shipping and ports, including a Dollars 500m scheme for a new terminal at
Bombay.
With only China and Indonesia offering opportunities on this scale,
companies have flocked to India. The power ministry boasts of proposals from
more than 100 consortia, including international companies such as General
Electric and Bechtel of the US, National Power of the UK and ABB, the
European combine. No fewer than 84 companies bid for contracts to provide
telecoms paging services. And 42 companies have asked for detailed project
information on roads.
As Mr Rajeev Talwar, a senior transport ministry official, says: 'The
amounts of money we need to invest are immense. But we have had an
overwhelming response from private industry.'
However, there have been few actual commitments. Investors are still unsure
that India represents a good long-term bet, and there have been delays on
the Indian side. Time and again, the government has raised expectations with
sweeping policy announcements, but dragged its feet in deciding important
details. Mostly, this is because few countries have any experience of
private investment in infrastructure on such a large scale.
Mr John Mail, project director for National Power, which is developing a
Dollars 1.8bn power station scheme in the central state of Andhra Pradesh in
partnership with the Hindujas, a London-based business family, says:
'Nowhere in the world has a project of this size been done.'
The delays have also been caused by the complexities of Indian
decision-making. Both the ruling Congress (I) party and the bureaucracy have
long been wedded to socialist traditions. Genuine converts to free-market
capitalism are few, and decisions are taken cautiously.
Often officials have deliberately kept rules governing private sector
investment vague, to maintain their discretionary powers - and opportunities
for demanding bribes.
As Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, recently said: 'There are
complaints that the opening up process is not transparent. I think there is
merit in these complaints and we have to attend to improving the system.'
In addition, power is shared in India by many institutions, both central and
local, including the state administrations. The world's largest democracy
dislikes government by fiat. Legal challenges are frequent: for example, the
award of licences for cellular telephone operators was delayed for more than
18 months by court action.
Nevertheless, progress is being made, notably in power, where the government
is encouraging up to six fast-track schemes, which it hopes will be
finalised next year. The framework for private power operations has been
worked out in negotiations with the would-be investors, notably Enron, the
US energy group, which is planning a 695MW plant in the western state of
Maharashtra in partnership with General Electric and Bechtel.
The investors' main concern was ensuring payment from the loss-making state
electricity boards, which dominate power distribution and are politically
controlled. The boards are required to supply low-cost or even free power to
favoured customers such as farmers.
After negotiations, it was agreed that state administrations would guarantee
the boards' payments, and Delhi would counter-guarantee the states, at least
for the first few projects. This has been criticised in India for relieving
investors of some of their commercial risk and allowing politicians to
postpone the reform of electricity distribution.
However, such guarantees should see construction begin on the first new
private schemes late next year and, by 1998, India's first new private
generating stations should be in place.
The 3,000MW of power that the first private projects are set to produce will
represent only a fraction of the extra electricity that India needs,
however, with the state remaining the country's main source of power. Of
crucial importance will be the efforts to increase and improve public
capacity - possibly with the help of private companies, such as Rolls-Royce
of the UK, which have offered to manage renovation schemes.
There has been less progress so far in telecommunications, where the
government has run into a series of political, bureaucratic and legal
tangles. For example, licences for operating cellular telephones in the four
biggest cities of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras were originally granted
two years ago. But losing companies challenged the awards and it was not
until this autumn that new licences were handed out. Even now, the companies
are not free to launch services, with important operating conditions still
to be settled.
The government an-nounced in principle only in May this year that private
operations were to be allowed in basic telephone services. Now officials are
working out guidelines and plan to float tenders in January. But for foreign
companies one important rule is in place - for both cellular and basic
services the maximum level of foreign ownership is to be 49 per cent.
As pent-up demand is released, executives believe the investments could flow
fast. At least 100,000 mobile phones, and up to 300,000 or 400,000 according
to some estimates, could be sold in the first year of operation. The total
investment in two years could reach Dollars 200m-Dollars 500m. In basic
services, it could be Dollars 10bn in five years, say industry executives.
An official of Alcatel, the telecommunications equipment maker, says: 'We
believe India is the next China. The growth rate in telecoms will be the
same.'
Private investment in roads is a more remote prospect. India has attracted
some extravagant proposals, including one from Renong, Malaysia's biggest
group, to build 12,000km of motorway for Dollars 25bn. But there are serious
doubts about whether toll roads can be successfully run, given the
widespread reluctance in India to pay commercial rates for public services.
Nevertheless, building companies, like their counterparts in power and
telecommunications, are swarming into India. As Mr Amit Sharma, director for
central and south Asia at Motorola, the US electronics group, says:
'Everybody wants to be in Asia, especially China and India. Today they want
to be in India even more than in China. But lots of patience is required.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Personal View: Jobs for life still available to many
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON BURGESS and HEDLEY REES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a widely held belief that 'lifetime jobs' have become a thing of the
past. This view informs debates on a wide range of topics including the
future of the welfare state, employment policy and training.
Presenting the report of Labour's Social Justice Commission, Sir Gordon
Borrie, the commission's chairman, wrote: 'Governments have failed to keep
pace with revolutionary changes that have transformed the nature of work and
society. There has been an economic revolution in skills and competition. It
. . . killed the notion of a job for life.'
Management expert Charles Handy also believes that 'no longer can one expect
to sell 100,000 hours of one's life to an organisation'.
The general argument is that with greater international competition and the
introduction of new technology, pressures on the labour market to adapt have
meant jobs of shorter duration.
Our research has found little evidence of such changes. In an annual series
of large, representative surveys, workers have been asked: 'How long have
you been with your present employer?' In 1975 the average for men was 10.4
years, and 6.3 for women. Nearly two decades later in 1992, the average for
men was 9.5 years and again 6.3 for women.
Two points follow from these figures. First, they provide scant evidence
that the pattern of a typical working life has changed fundamentally. For
men, this is a decline of about 8.5 per cent over 18 years; for women there
is essentially no change.
These small differences suggest that popular assumptions about a
transformation in the nature of jobs are misleading.
Second, it is clear that, on average, people hold their jobs for a long
time. These data relate to the length of time people have been in their
present jobs so far. We can use estimates of the chance of them continuing
in those jobs to calculate the average completed job tenure. In 1990, this
is about 18 years for men and 12 years for women.
Such numbers suggest that most people can still expect a stable long-term
job at some stage of their careers.
In fact, these averages summarise quite a complex pattern. The figures show
a lot of people with short jobs and a lot of people with very long tenures.
This is particularly marked for men, with 29 per cent having completed
tenures of less than five years, and 24 per cent with jobs lasting more than
30 years. If jobs lasting 20 years or more can be labelled 'lifetime' jobs,
the UK labour market in 1990 is still capable of offering such jobs to 45
per cent of all male workers.
It is also true, of course, that a substantial fraction of the workforce has
jobs that last only a very short time. But this has been the case for at
least the past 18 years, and there does not seem to be any substantial
increase in the number of jobs of short duration.
Looking back over the past 18 years, there has been a gradual increase in
job duration as the labour market worsened from 1979 to 1983, and a
subsequent fall as times improved through to 1990. Job duration increased
slightly between 1991 and 1992, as unemployment began to rise again.
There are two reasons that explain this cyclical pattern. First, fewer
people are hired in a recession, so there are fewer people who have been
working in their jobs for only a short time.
Second, those who are in work tend to remain in their jobs for longer. These
two factors mean average job duration tends to rise in recessions.
For men, the fall in the average length of a job has been greater since 1984
than the rise in the years before. It may be that part of this fall is due
to the sort of longer-term changes in labour markets that have been
discussed recently. But while there has been some change, the fall has not
been substantial.
One explanation of the relative constancy of these averages might be that
increases in the rate of job changes were cancelled or offset by changes in
the proportion of young and old workers. But analysing the changes by age
shows much the same pattern across age groups.
It may be that we are on the verge of a new world where jobs for most people
do not last very long. However, there is little evidence of such change
during the 1980s and early 1990s. The British labour market still offers
'lifetime jobs' to a substantial fraction of its workforce.

SG Warburg has always looked the UK merchant bank most likely to succeed in
the fiercely competitive global investment banking business. Its decision to
accept the status of junior partner in a proposed merger with US investment
house Morgan Stanley will thus be seen as a blow to the prestige of the
British-owned merchant banking fraternity. Yet it is hard to see how Warburg
could win a lasting place at the top if it continued to go it alone. For
while it has long been the most internationally-minded of merchant banks, it
has signally failed, over decades, to make convincing inroads into the
world's tougher markets, most notably the US.
That is not to decry the achievements of Warburg's management. The
successful completion of the merger of the separate broking, jobbing and
merchant banking businesses of Rowe &amp; Pitman, Mullens, Akroyd &amp; Smithers and
SG Warburg at the time of the Big Bang was a remarkable achievement. Equally
striking has been Warburg's strength in the rapidly growing cross-border
financial business and in a wide range of domestic activities. Yet the
figures fail to impress if measured by the highest standards.
The net income of Warburg's potential partner, Morgan Stanley, grew around
seven-fold from before the firm's flotation in the mid-1980s to Dollars 731m
last year. Over the same period its capital rose more than fourteen-fold
from Dollars 314m to Dollars 4.5bn. In dollar terms, Warburg's post-tax
profits rose from Dollars 86m to Dollars 280m betweem 1986 and the end of
1993, while its capital increased only four and a half times from Dollars
509m to Dollars 2.3bn. Morgan has lost some of its edge since the early
1980s and has suffered defections. But in a global game where a capital of
Dollars 5bn is probably the minimum entry fee, it was still in with a
chance.
While the figures are not wholly comparable, Warburg has clearly found the
going tougher. Yet its preferred solution should not give cause for concern
about the City's international competitiveness. The readiness of Deutsche
Bank and others to locate much of their capital market activity in London
reflects the very opposite of the branch plant syndrome. Within the European
time zone, London still has most to offer and has seen substantial jobs
growth since Big Bang, much of it in foreign firms. Part of London's
strength has precisely been its openness to foreigners, as the names of
British merchant banks so eloquently attest.
It is nonetheless worth asking why one of the best managed British banks has
failed make it to the very top. Wall Street firms enjoy an undeniable
advantage in the size of their domestic corporate sector. Yet Morgan Stanley
had less capital than Warburg in the mid-1980s and has outgrown it by a huge
margin. Warburg, meantime, failed to pull off a merger with Kuhn Loeb in the
1960s, an alliance with Paribas in the 1970s or to make a success of the
joint acquisition with Paribas of US commercial paper firm AG Becker later
in the 1970s.
That inevitably raises questions about the attempt to resolve a strategic
problem via a merger. Management cultures in banking rarely mix well.
Cross-border alliances in this area have, in the main, been fraught. The
wider question is whether the fully integrated global investment banking
game, which is increasingly dependent on low-grade trading profits, is worth
the candle. Warburg's founding genius, Sir Siegmund Warburg, had little
doubt that small was best.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A new Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has changed a good deal in the year since the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development's last assessment of the country's
economic prospects. The economy has finally begun to emerge out of
recession. And the political turmoil of recent years - though far from over
 -has given birth to a clear challenge to the one-party rule of old.
The Japanese electorate will tomorrow gain a credible alternative to the
ruling Liberal Democratic party, with the inauguration of the New Frontier
Party, to be led by Mr Toshiki Kaifu. A few days later, the country will
also gain a new central bank president, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who takes over
from Mr Yasushi Mieno on December 16th. The OECD survey, published
yesterday, gives reasons for both new arrivals to be optimistic about the
future, but little cause for complacency.
The report confirms that the economy entered a 'phase of gradual recovery in
the second half of this year'. The organisation now predicts real GDP growth
of 1 per cent in 1994, a little more than it forecast in June. GDP growth is
expected to pick up further in 1995, to 2.5 per cent, though this will
depend heavily on the strength of the yen and Mr Matsushita's approach to
his new job.
His predecessor's overriding objective was to foster economic growth without
the barest hint of inflation. Consumer price inflation has indeed fallen
steadily since the middle of 1993. The domestic deflator for GDP - a less
distorted measure of domestic prices - fell in the third quarter of this
year, for the first time in seven years. Most believe that official
measurements significantly under-state the extent of the decline in prices,
which shows little sign of being reversed.
Signs of economic recovery recently appeared to be pointing Mr Mieno in the
direction of tightening monetary policy. While the discount rate - at 1.75
per cent - has been unchanged for over a year, he has made sporadic attempts
to push up overnight money market rates. Each has been foiled by further
strengthening of the yen, and weakening of the stock market. Both should
serve as a reminder of the other tasks which Mr Matsushita will inherit,
none of which is as close to being achieved as the first.
As the OECD point out, the feeble state of domestic demand argues for a
further lowering of interest rates, if anything, since real rates remain
relatively high. Mr Matsushita should also give a higher priority to
speeding up the recovery of the financial sector, still burdened by
misguided lending of the bubble era. He must lend weight to the government's
still disappointingly tentative deregulation efforts.
Another wave of such reforms is due to begin in the spring of next year. As
the OECD admits, important steps have been taken in recent years to ensure
that the fragile, consumer-led recovery of the past few months will lead to
a longer-term re-balancing of the Japanese economy. In the medium term, the
development of a new source of political authority in the Diet ought to
facilitate more rapid reforms of the regulatory and fiscal systems.
Japan is unlikely ever to repeat the heady export-led growth of the past few
decades. Some of the seeds of a new kind of growth have been laid in recent
years. They will need active nurturing, however. Japan's new, and not so
new, leaders ought to convince themselves that it is a welcome task - and
press on with it.

FT  09 DEC 94 / The peace prize: Investment in N Ireland could benefit
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, addresses the international
investment conference in Northern Ireland next Wednesday, he will almost
certainly be aware that Britain could reap considerable dividends from peace
in the province.
The UK exchequer currently subsidises Northern Ireland to the tune of Pounds
3.5bn annually. This is the net subvention after taxes and other receipts,
and excludes the direct costs of the British army presence, which could add
a further Pounds 500m to the bill. In total, the province is costing UK
taxpayers the equivalent of about 2p on income tax.
Government spending per head of Northern Ireland's 1.6m population is about
50 per cent higher than for the UK as a whole. Security does not account for
all of this difference. Public spending per head is also higher in industry,
agriculture, health and education. Subsidies to these areas, with spending
on security deducted, accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the
province's gross domestic product of nearly Pounds 12bn.
The evidence of such large subsidies is manifest. The modern port at Larne
is considered more efficient than Dublin's, and handles much of the
Republic's exports. Some of the new housing estates in inner-city areas rate
among the best in the UK. The transport system is heavily subsidised, and
the capacity of the province's road network far exceeds traffic needs.
The province also receives money from the European Union, under the
Objective 1 programme, targeted at areas on Europe's fringes with per capita
income of less than 75 per cent of the EU average. The province is due to
receive Pounds 1bn between 1994 and 1999 from EU structural funds under this
programme.
Objective 1 finance paid for a recent expansion of Belfast International
Airport, which is now handling 2.3m passengers a year on direct flights to
11 destinations. It also funded the installation of electricity on Rathlin
Island, the only inhabited island in the province.
The moves towards peace are generating further aid commitments. EU leaders
are expected to agree new aid to bolster the peace plan at today's Essen
summit. These peace grants could total Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) between 1995
and 1999.
Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, has been a
tireless and successful fundraiser for Northern Ireland. He was instrumental
in setting up the multinational International Fund for Ireland, which
promotes cross-border co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. This fund
has drawn contributions from the US as well as the EU, and now stands at
Dollars 150m.
Sir George Quigley, former permanent secretary at the finance department of
the Northern Ireland Office and now chairman of Ulster Bank, defends the
level of spending, claiming that in Northern Ireland special factors are at
work.
'Given the unique situation here with sectarian divisions, and employment
problems it has been necessary to spend money to achieve a degree of
stabilisation. It is important to try and mop up unemployment.'
In education, for example, extra spending is needed to fund three different
kinds of schools: church schools, predominantly Protestant state schools and
non-sectarian state schools, he says. He also points out, as do many others,
that Northern Ireland has the best A-level results in the UK.
Spending on health and hospitals has been necessary not just because of the
violence, he says, but also because Belfast and Londonderry have suffered
from inner-city deprivation, leading to higher than average levels of
ill-health.
However, Sir George concedes that Northern Ireland has become a largely
public sector economy - described by many commentators as a dependency
culture. Forty per cent of those in work are employed by the public sector,
double the UK average.
In particular, the security industries have been an important provider of
jobs, especially for Protestants, with 12,000 full- and part-time members of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are also 6,300 full- and part-time
members of the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Jobs in the police
mean income and mortgages and money pumped into local economies.
And Northern Ireland has the highest level of unemployment in the UK. Its
traditional industries such as shipbuilding, engineering and textiles have
been in long-term decline, with manufacturing accounting for 18 per cent of
employment.
The violence created difficulties in attracting outside investment, and
inward investment has been drawn only through the liberal use of grants.
This year the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland will spend
Pounds 148m in attracting new investment, in one of the most expensive job
creation schemes in the UK.
However, the alternative - unemployment - has also placed a heavy burden on
government spending. At 12.7 per cent, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland
reflects the higher proportion of women in the labour force than in the rest
of the UK. But it has also been exacerbated by the birth rate, which is the
highest in western Europe - higher even than the Republic of Ireland. This
has generated a constant stream of young entrants to the labour market, even
after allowing for emigration.
Against this background, Sir George estimates that a lasting peace could
mean a loss of 20,000 jobs, which would be a considerable addition to the
100,000 already out of work.
Ultimately, peace will mean a reduction of the public sector's role. Of
course, the job losses would not happen all at once; the dependency would
not end overnight; and Mr Major cannot expect to cut the public bill very
quickly.
In the longer term, employment is likely to be created in a revived tourism
industry and from closer integration with the Republic, but it will not
compensate for jobs lost in the public sector unless there is considerable
inward investment. Hence next week's conference.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Frankfurt brushes up its act: Germany's financial capital is
improving its appeal as a regional centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frankfurt has not always had the most inspiring of images, either as a place
to live or as a centre for financial activity. Several years ago, foreign
bankers posted there often saw it as something less than an enhancement of
their career prospects.
But while some still complain about the lack of lively wine bars in which to
unwind after hours, Frankfurt's appeal as a financial centre is improving.
Foreign banks are stepping up their activities, the big German banks have
learnt new tricks in global equities and the complex financial instruments
called derivatives, and the authorities have introduced changes in the
markets to make them more attractive to foreign investors.
While these improvements will not put Frankfurt right up in the ranks of
global centres such as London, they will reinforce its role as Continental
Europe's leading regional financial centre.
These plans will be put to the test when one of the biggest state sell-offs
in the 1990s - the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the
telecommunications concern - takes place. Success in selling the shares to
big international institutions and retail investors at home and abroad will
depend on how well the DM15bn (Pounds 6bn) issue, due in 1996, is managed
and marketed.
Mr Andre Teeuw, head of the German operation of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
UK investment bank, is confident that the Deutsche Telekom issue 'will
contribute to international awareness that Frankfurt is growing in
importance as a financial centre'.
If the Deutsche Telekom share sale is successful, it could encourage big
institutional investors to take more interest in Germany. Only Dollars 2.7bn
of the net flow of Dollars 68bn into foreign equities by US investors last
year went into Germany, said Mr Andreas von Buddenbrock, head of investment
banking at the German operation of Merrill Lynch, the US investment house.
Compared with the UK, the number of new issues on the German equity market
has been small. Last month saw one of the largest such offerings, the DM530m
sale of 25 per cent of Hanover Re, the world's fifth biggest reinsurance
group; the oversubscribed issue was the seventh biggest in 10 years.
But there will have to be many more if Frankfurt is to play the important
regional financing role, serving west and east Europe, that many
participants see as its main future.
Investment bankers look forward to such a development as German companies
seek new funds to stay competitive in a fierce and fast-changing world
business environment.
'I expect to see a lot of new entrants to the German stock market,' said Mr
Piers von Simson, head of European operations at SG Warburg, the UK
investment bank. 'There will be a lot more Mittelstand (medium-sized)
companies coming; the new issue market will open up.'
An acceleration in the sluggish pace of new listings would benefit
Frankfurt, which dominates German trading in securities, futures and
derivatives. Home of the Bundesbank, Germany's powerful central bank, the
city's status was enhanced last month when the European Monetary Institute,
forerunner of the planned European Central Bank, moved into its new
premises.
The surprise decision last week by BASF, the German chemical group, to
delist its shares from the seven regional bourses and concentrate on
Frankfurt is a further boost. Other companies are likely to follow, thus
reinforcing the Frankfurt stock market, which accounts for three-quarters of
share dealings. The others may eventually be confined to an advisory rather
than a trading role (though local politicians will resist this).
Not everything is going Frankfurt's way, however. Its financial self-esteem
was shaken by the recent decision of Deutsche Bank to put its international
investment banking activities in London, home of Morgan Grenfell, its UK
merchant banking subsidiary.
Most bankers accepted that Germany's biggest bank needed to be in London to
develop a more credible presence in this highly competitive and innovative
business. But Deutsche Bank's move highlights the strengths and weaknesses
of Frankfurt, located in Europe's most powerful economy.
'I remain very positive for Frankfurt as a financial centre and I think it
is right to say it is the financial centre of the continent,' said Mr Hilmar
Kopper, the bank's chairman.
'It may, over time, backed by the strength of the D-Mark and the size of our
economy, be in a position to extend its lead on the continent,' he added.
'But I still maintain that, for many years to come, London will remain the
more international marketplace.'
This week's announcement by Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank,
that it is to strengthen its investment banking activities in London
reinforces that point.
It is in New York, Tokyo and London that the biggest concentrations of
financial talent and banking strength lie. Located around each of these are
smaller but thriving regional markets, and Frankfurt's aim is to be
pre-eminent among those on the continent of Europe.
'The reason Frankfurt is so important is that it's in the most important
economy in Europe,' said Mr Tim von Halle, Merrill Lynch's capital markets
director in Germany. But in spite of housing Europe's second busiest stock
exchange outside London and its biggest bond market, it has not always
capitalised enough on its location in generating investment business.
The government, market authorities and banks have taken several steps to
help Frankfurt meet the growing demands put on it.
New legislation has been passed to overhaul financial markets, evolved in an
era when banks and companies were wedded to the cosy house bank style of
corporate lending.
Insider trading is no longer outside the law; it has been illegal since
August and next year, a new supervisory authority will start policing
securities dealings.
More stringent share disclosure requirements are being introduced, so
holdings exceeding 5 per cent will have to be made known (the disclosure
level is currently 25 per cent).
German companies wanting to raise new share capital can now do so without
having to offer pre-emptive rights to existing holders.
On the trading and settlement side, Frankfurt has introduced advanced
electronic systems and has a successful futures market, the Deutsche
Terminborse (DTB).
'By German standards, they (the government and market authorities) are doing
a pretty good job,' said Mr Christian Klein, treasurer at Landesbank
Hessen-Thurigen (Helaba), the Frankfurt-based regional bank. 'The insider
trading law is really tough.'
But there is still further to go, according to bankers. Action is needed to
protect minority rights in takeovers; there is no takeover code or set of
rules to guarantee fair treatment for all classes of shareholders.
Nor are there enough quoted companies to satisfy many big investors; and
liquidity in many stocks is restricted by the existence of large stakes by
banks and institutions.
German companies also need to make their accounts clearer and more
transparent, said Mr Buddenbrock. 'From a corporate perspective, a major
decision has to be made to open up information more to international
investors.'
The prospect of the Deutsche Telekom share sale alone will not right these
deficiencies. For Frankfurt's growing status, said Mr Teeuw, the sale 'will
be a confirmation rather than a big push'.
The government is keen for the issue to attract private investors to the
idea of share buying and will put strong pressure on the banks to see this
happens. The next year will show whether Frankfurt proves up to the job.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Democracy wins in VAT vote uproar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From WILLIAM BAKEWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why all the uproar surrounding the defeat of the UK government's plans
to increase value added tax on domestic fuel? Surely this is how proper
democracy should work?
A measure which is clearly unpopular with the majority of the electorate,
and is now not necessary because of the improved borrowing requirement,
should not be allowed to proceed.
MPs should not be forced to vote against their beliefs and constituents'
wishes for narrow party interests.
Were Parliament more representative of the electorate, bad and unwanted
measures would be put forward less frequently. The various political
parties, whose policies seem increasingly similar, would be obliged to work
together, and we might get away from the appalling confrontational system
which serves us so badly and continues to exacerbate the divisions in our
society.
Unfortunately, while we the electorate are so apathetic on these matters and
mainly inherit the way we vote - against, rather than for, anything - we are
stuck with the stale dead-end status quo, whichever of the two main parties
is in power.

Sir, Your survey of business travel ('When smoke gets in passengers' eyes',
December 5) contained a small error concerning smoking on aircraft. While in
the Middle East recently, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gulf Air
has a no-smoking policy on all intra-Gulf flights  - a great relief after
earlier trips in the region where, as you say, some airlines have smoking on
the right, no-smoking on the left.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong competition for council
cleaning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your one-sided article, 'Council cleaning overspend revealed' (December
6), shows that Dr Stefan Szymanski has once again chosen to produce a report
using dubious methodology to attack the public sector.
His claim that in a significant number of local authorities 'competitive
tendering is little more than a fiction' does not stand up to closer
scrutiny. According to comprehensive data collected by the Local Government
Management Board, building cleaning is the most competitive of the services
subjected to CCT.
Here, the private sector has managed to win almost 57 per cent of contracts
let to date. This compares very favourably with the other defined
activities, where private sector penetration is, on average, just 38 per
cent. In addition, the LGMB data reveal that only 15 per cent of current
tender awards have been retained in-house with no outside competition.
What Szymanski's report does reveal most clearly, however, is the shocking
level of wages paid to workers by some private firms. Wage costs in the
building cleaning industry account for 80-90 per cent of total costs. It is
hardly surprising, therefore, that firms paying subsistence-level wages to
workers drawn largely from the most vulnerable sections of society, many
operating in the black economy, are able to undercut more realistic wage
rates offered by councils' direct service organisations.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simple way to determine fair pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From KEITH MCNEISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Blackaby pursues the line favoured by some Japanese companies
(Letters: December 7) - that there should be a simple ratio between the
chief executive and the lowest paid in any company.
Unfortunately, the ratio approach ignores important differences between
companies, particularly structural ones. Some companies are very flat. In a
cleaning firm, for instance, Mr Blackaby's cleaner may be only one or two
layers down from the chief executive. Therefore the appropriate ratio may be
5:1. On the other hand, a hotel conglomerate may justifiably have 10 or more
layers between the two positions, requiring 50:1.
The simplest way to approach pay fairness is to look at the differential
which should be paid to someone when he has to take on a position at the
next level of responsibility. Just as a tradesman needs a salary enhancement
to take on the foreman's job, so a director should expect to receive a
differential for being appointed as the chief executive and ultimate can
carrier.
Determining what the differentials should be in percentage terms has to vary
from company to company - again, it is affected by factors like structure
and decision-making style. However, if shareholders wish to cast aside the
market factor as the most important determinant of executive salaries, they
would make more headway with the differential approach than by searching for
a universally applicable ratio.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prey to the Hong Kong mini-trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PB HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the article '1000 days of uncertainty' (December 3-4), Simon
Holberton and Peter Montagnon state: 'The transfer of sovereignty is full of
seemingly innocuous details that turn out to be traps for the unwary.'
Indeed so, for they describe the Basic Law as a 'mini-constitution for
post-1997 Hong Kong'.
While you can have mini-skirts, mini-buses and mini-cars, you cannot have
mini-constitutions because sovereignty cannot be parcelled out in
mini-portions. Sovereignty is, or is not. Failure to understand this implies
a failure to understand anything about the Hong Kong conundrum.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A bit offside on set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ROBERT STURDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Maitland's article 'Farm leaders attack set-aside delay'
(November 29) on the National Farmers' Union concerns about the European
Parliament's delay in agreeing to a reduction in set-aside was spot on. As a
farmer, I heartily agree with Sir David Naish's fury at 'verbal sparring' by
politicians at the expense of farmers, and their urgent need to get on with
winter drilling.
But not all politicians are the same. As Conservative agriculture spokesman,
I made precisely this practical point during the November sessions of the
European Parliament in Strasbourg. For a farmer, set-aside is a waste of
valuable resources. Any reduction, however small, is a step in the right
direction.
And the Conservatives and their Christian Democratic allies - alas, no
longer a majority in Strasbourg - were consistent in urging swift approval
of this measure. Those who held things up were the Socialists and Greens, 25
of whom walked out of the debate in Strasbourg last month to ensure there
was no quorum.
Fortunately the issue came before the parliament again last week, and this
time we overcame plans - from the same people - to delay it further. When
the vote was taken, we got the measure through.
Labour says it objects to the Common Agricultural Policy. But presented with
a golden opportunity to do something about one of its worst elements, we saw
it instantly bend with the wind, or possibly some passing hot air. My
political colleagues on the left ought to take a peek outside.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Peter Pan - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomfool Theatre's engaging, dynamic adaptation of Peter Pan (at BAC,
Battersea) is a world away from the usual staging - there are no green
tights, no glittery sets and no special effects. This is not the version to
attend if you want to spot the flying wire. Instead, this young company
relies on the force of the story and simple, but inventive staging to hold
your attention.
Director Tom Smith has drawn on Barrie's novels and play to put together his
own interpretation, but while the mood may be playful, the storytelling is
largely direct. This allows many of the unsettling themes at large in the
story to emerge clearly without being forced home.
The action takes place on an empty set with one piece of furniture: a high
hospital bed that features both in the Darling household and
Never-Never-Land. When the Darling children fly away with Peter, they simply
jump on to the moving bed. This is a neat device, since most children, at
some time or other, have jumped off their beds, eyes closed tightly, hoping
to fly - and the production is liberally sprinkled with such moments to
reinforce the idea that the real world and the land of fantasy are closely
intertwined.
Objects from the Darlings' neat Edwardian home reappear in Never-Never-Land:
the metronome used by Mr Darling to keep time becomes the sound effect for
the crocodile with the ingested clock, who pursues Captain Hook. The actors
who play Mr and Mrs Darling appear in different guises in the fantasy world,
as characters in dreams do, and this underlines the way ideas about
abandonment and fear of adolescence echo through the story.
The Darling parents are a sweet, earnest couple, scarcely grown up
themselves. Though Mr Darling has a moustache and says stern things, he is
clearly far less worldly than Peter, played by Max Mackenzie as a streetwise
urchin in a tail coat. When Peter and Tinkerbell arrive in the children's
bedroom, instead of sprinkling fairy dust over the little Darlings, they tap
a little ash from the end of Tinker's cigarette - a nice touch that suggests
how Peter sums up all Mrs Darling's protective fears about losing her
children to the wrong sort.
The production incorporates a nod to the panto tradition with one moment of
audience participation, several hat tricks and a fair amount of tomfoolery.
It loses impetus in the second half, becoming more muddled, and is much less
successful in dealing with the darkest aspects of the story. Jake
Nightingale's Captain Hook avoids being the pantomime baddie, but he also
avoids being sinister at all, and by the time we reach the walking-the-plank
passage on Hook's ship, the production has lost its edge. But overall this
is an absorbing thoughtful reworking that encourages you to ruminate on the
interesting psychological terrain explored by Barrie.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Fascinating Aida's sugar-coated pill - Alastair
Macaulay writes a letter to his niece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Darling Rachel,
Well, even if you weren't going to see Fascinating Aida, you'll sooner or
later find yourself quoting them anyway; so you'd better go sooner. Not that
I'm saying that you yet have any cause, while you're still only 20, to quote
a song like 'Fell in Love with a Man in Love with Another Man' . . . But the
pc song is bound to come in handy. 'We're politically correct, politically
correct, All phallocentric language we reject. It's no use agreeing, We hate
you just for being'. Try it some time over Christmas at your father?
The great thing about Fascinating Aida, though, is not that you find
yourself quoting their words. Kit and the Widow are quoteworthy too, for
instance, but their music? The joke with those boys is that you've heard
just about all the music before.
With these three women - Adele Anderson, Issy van Randwick, and, most
delectably, Dillie Keane - it's the music that lodges the words under your
skin; the music, and their musicality in singing it. More particularly, the
contrast between what they're saying (mainly breathtakingly tough) and how
they're singing (mainly very sweet) develops an astonishing irony - like a
sugar-coated pill.
The way their swingle-jazz item, 'My Favourite Tool', also becomes a rap
number too is, I think, musically brilliant, and it has the audience
laughing long before they take in the words. But about half their songs are
quiet waltzes, and it's typical of them that to the most tenderly Victorian
of these they address, dolcissimo, 'Dear little two-headed baby . . . the
very last word in genetic mutation . . . What joy to give birth at a hundred
at eight . . .' As I quote the mere words, their cynicism sounds all too
horrid; but when you hear the music, the honeyed lullaby-like hush of it
adds the most bewildering charm to it.
Still, their lyrics are a marvel of polish. Triple rhymes abound. (On being
back with an old boyfriend: 'I'm deranged/ To think that you have changed/
I'd like to see your features rearranged.') Camilla Park-and-Ride is there,
and Mrs Major, and Naomi Campbell, and Portillos. There's already a little
song about the cancellation of extra VAT on fuel. Especially in the second
half, I guffawed at a number of unquotable lines.
But maybe their most wonderful feat is in putting together a whole clutch of
soft blues numbers in Part One - numbers that cause a ripple of sympathy or
approbation but scarcely one laugh. The mood darkens, and the tender plight
of modern women is expressed in several different facets. 'Fell in Love with
a Man in Love with Another Man' is actually the most beautifully haunting
song of the evening.
I sound like a groupie, but no. After years of hearing about them, and
hearing cassettes of them, this is the first time I've actually been to see
them. Which is worth it from the first moment Dilly Keane appears, with her
dolorous face, big, hooded eyes, and the sagging corners of her dejected
mouth. Adele Anderson looks like a suave society lady from the 1950s; and
Issy van Randwick like what used to be called a calculating little minx. All
of which heightens the comedy; and turns the knife in the wound.
Come and stay if you're passing through London. Otherwise I'll see you at
Christmas.
Much love from your wicked uncle,
Alastair
Garrick Theatre, WC1 until January 21

FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Grimm Tales - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA SOUTHWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few tales in the Brothers Grimm more unlikely than the history of
the Young Vic over the past year. Since salvaging the artistic directorship
from a crisis of confidence that eventually heralded the departure of his
co-director Julia Bardsley, Tim Supple has drastically re-scored the
theatre's signature tune.
Supple has put commercial credibility back on the agenda with a little less
of the inconvenient ideals, and a little more populist nous. Hot on the
heels of John Byrne's The Slab Boys Trilogy, the theatre's first major
critical success this year, comes Grimm Tales, a selection of eight
disparate rumbles from the 201 stories the Brothers managed to collate from
the dark ages of European folklore.
The striking feat of Supple's devised production is that it spans the
adult/child age gap. A predominantly older audience might have preferred a
grimmer night - some of the real gamey ones have been left on the shelf -
but Carol Ann Duffy's adaptations have taken off many of the Disney filters
that have domesticated the stories since the first edition in 1812.
When the cast first spill out onto Melly Still's slatted stage in Hansel &amp;
Gretel, dressed as if headed for one of Bruegel's peasant orgies, there is
little to disguise the atmosphere of desperation that winds through the
characters as they spin in and out of the story as narrators or in
character.
With Chris Davey's lighting spiking the gloomy atmosphere through the floor,
and Adrian Lee's mesmeric triumvirate of acoustic musicians kneading eerie
medieval rhythms, this is no frothy ride from backwoods poverty to an MGM
Oz. Rather it is a dark and disturbing journey through childhood fears
harnessed compellingly by Linda Kerr Scott's Mother, who transforms from
hard-edged Scottish drabness to the skeletal short-sighted crone. Even when
Sarah C. Cameron's Gretel bundles her down a stage trap into the oven, her
grasping hands with six-inch fingernails continue to rear out of the stage
smoke, forcing Gretel to dispatch her with a kitchen knife.
If more epic tales, like Iron Hans, fail to grip with the same direct
expediency as Hansel &amp; Gretel or the seminal Ashputtel (Cinderella), this is
because they lack their rough-hewn, gothic immediacy. Similarly The Golden
Goose, though obviously emblematic, is a lesser, more pantomimic force. But
Ashputtel is undoubtedly Supple's tour de force in this highly physical
staging. There is little on the evening's menu to equal the moment when
Linda Kerr Scott and Sarah C. Cameron as Ugly Sisters wincingly slice off
their toes and heels to fit the feted shoe; until, that is, Dan Milne's
Mother Spirit plucks out both Sisters' eyeballs on the day Natasha Pope's
cindered Ashputtel marries her Prince. But the most vindictive scenes are
shared by Alan Perrin's improbably lugubrious Step Mother, when she hands
out the scissors to her daughters, and Paul M. Meston's creepily aloof
Father who rebutts the Prince with 'there's only a grubby little kitchen
maid my wife left behind'. Retribution is rarely so sweet in Grimm.
With such uncomplicated sentiments and spoken fears, Grimm Tales has a rare
potency that usefully challenges the relentless numbing violence of a video
age.
Grimm Tales continues at the Young Vic until January 21

FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: A well-conducted partnership - An eventful year for
the newly-knighted Simon Rattle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are not many knights under the age of 40. When the news broke of Simon
Rattle's knighthood in June this year, one of the musicians in the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra told his colleagues, 'Our Simon has been made
a saint'. Typically, Sir Simon's own reaction was more down-to-earth: 'The
first thought I had was 'I'm not dead yet]''
Seeing that one of its exclusive younger artists was breaking into the top
league, EMI Records had already decided that 1994 would be the year of Simon
Rattle. The plan was to tie in new recordings with major appearances
worldwide, such as Rattle's debut with the Vienna Philharmonic last December
and the CBSO's visit to Warsaw, for which journalists were flown in from
around the world. EMI says it wants 'to give a sense of focus' to a
highly-valued artist, but a hard-nosed businessman will recognise a
marketing plan when he sees one.
The major classical record companies are having to work hard to maintain
profitability. As recordings from the 1960s and '70s are reissued at ever
lower prices, the market is being saturated with versions of the standard
symphonies and concertos. It is no surprise that some of the big companies,
with their expensive conductors recording Beethoven's symphonies for the
third time, are struggling to balance their books.
EMI regards itself as well placed with Rattle. Unlike many of the top
conductors, he has made his central interest the music of the 20th century.
The bulk of his recordings are of Mahler, Stravinsky, Britten, Bartok and
other modern composers, rather than the classics. Promoting living British
composers - such as Mark-Anthony Turnage, who was the CBSO's
composer-in-residence - is a serious responsibility in Rattle's eyes and his
record company is encouraged to see it the same way.
He persuaded EMI to record Nicholas Maw's Odyssey, a hugely expensive
undertaking, which will not break even for years, if at all. The company
denies that this was the price it had to pay to keep Rattle on board. Roger
Lewis, Director of EMI's Classical Division, says that it is a 'crude
simplification' to weigh up the account in that fashion. 'We want to look at
our relationship in an enlightened and mature way. There is a synergy: the
benefit from making that recording gets reflected throughout the rest of his
catalogue'.
He stresses that the company's commitment to Rattle is long-term - a phrase
which means what it says in this industry. After 17 years with EMI, Rattle's
recordings have only recently gone into profit. The pay-back on investment
with classical musicians has to be counted not in years, but in decades.
(With that in mind it will be interesting to see what EMI intends to do with
Franz Welser-Most, its other exclusive young conductor, only in his 30s, but
wobbling in his career at the moment.)
As 1994 comes to a close, the Rattle year is being counted a success. Lewis
says that the effect of the marketing blitz has been 'measurable in sales
terms' with a significant uplift in the US, where Rattle conducts in Boston
and Los Angeles. They would expect to adopt the same approach again.
Meanwhile, for Rattle, the path ahead looks assured, not least at EMI, with
whom he has signed a new contract which stretches into the next century.
In Birmingham, he is unassailable. The CBSO will want to hold on to its
music director as long as it can, certainly until the climax of its 'Towards
the Millennium' project, which lasts until the year 2000. This year's
programme exhibits every sign of confidence. The season opened with a
performance of Schoenberg's massive Gurrelieder, which sounded glorious in
the fine acoustics of Symphony Hall and was warmly received, despite less
than ideal soloists.
Then, last week, Rattle and the CBSO presented a major premiere by the
Russian emigre Sofia Gubaidulina. Entitled Zeitgestalten, this is described
by the composer as 'a desire to convert the vertical time of timeless
imagination into a linear form'; whereas to the listener it is more a
succession of very striking sounds that may, or may not, have any deeper
meaning. What is impressive is that it was done at all. The orchestra it
demands (including six horns, electric guitars, accordion and an array of
percussion) is vast and the cost surely enormous.
Abroad, Rattle is said to have enjoyed himself immensely in Boston, which
rumour suggests may offer a serious ambition for the future. He is also a
regular visitor to Berlin, where he offers characteristically unusual
repertoire. His first recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, issued this
autumn (another Rattle landmark), was Liszt's Faust Symphony and he also
plants a feather in his cap as the first conductor to have put Rameau on the
orchestra's music-stands. 'After the initial chaos - and it was utter chaos
 -they took to it with such warmth and vitality. I was delighted, because I
was as nervous as I've ever been there, and I'm never less than petrified.'
The steady rise of his career is mirrored in his philosophy. 'You learn in
increments. Every month I am learning some great truth and wonder how I
managed without it before. But I do suspect people who say it gets easier,
because every little bit of wisdom brings its complications. Almost all
musicians have areas that are easy for them, but it doesn't mean those are
the ones they will do the best. With some pieces of music one is fated to
fail.'
At so early a point in his career the knighthood raised other problems. 'My
misgivings were personal. I considered very quickly what it meant for the
orchestra, what it meant for my parents. The thing that convinced me was
thinking of the use that Ian McKellen has made of his knighthood, turning it
into extra ammunition for an extraordinary crusade. There is going to be
another big fight for the arts in this country over the next 12 months. I'm
amazed that people can so blithely take the existence of the orchestras in
this country for granted, because extinction is close for many. I have the
feeling that we'll have to use those extra three letters for whatever
additional weight they may carry. It's just a shame that a knighthood can't
be backward-looking. My mother would make an ace Lady Rattle.'

If you thought such traditional English characteristics as irony, fairness,
a vague but nagging sense of decency and (for better or worse) a love of
animals were vanishing, Short Stories: Pet Patients (8pm, Channel 4) should
reassure you of their survival.
I am unsure whether the Barleycorn family are real or intended as a pilot
for a future sitcom. Their south London council flat is a haven for dogs,
cats, rodents, reptiles and two pigs. This is deliberate. They like it. They
love it.
So do the devoted workers of the local Blue Cross animal hospital. It throws
up as much drama, comedy, tear-jerking and social issues as Casualty.
Maurice Melzac's film is quirky, original, sharp-eyed and unsentimental
about its dramatis personae, however many legs they have.
How different from the callous inhabitants of Chicago who flush unwanted
pets down the loo. Alligator (11.35pm, BBC1) makes an entertaining pendant
to the above; a 1980 feature film with a third-league cast but something of
a cult for post-closing time viewing.

FT  09 DEC 94 / People: Reece: a class act for London Scottish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second time in its history, Manchester's London Scottish Bank has
turned to Great Universal Stores for its chief executive. Roy Reece, 47,
group marketing director of GUS Home Shopping, has joined the consumer
finance group as chief executive (designate).
London Scottish Bank, which celebrates its centenary next year, has been
seeking a new chief executive for some time since most of its senior
executives are approaching the company's retirement age of 57. Jack
Livingstone, whose grandfather founded the company, plans to retire as
chairman next March and will hand over to Martin West, 56, who succeeded him
as chief executive in 1988.
West, who joined as finance director in 1976, says that the company wanted
somebody who was young enough to take the group into the next century and
bring some new ideas. West had known Reece from their time together at GUS
and believes that Reece's marketing skills will complement his own finance
background. Reece is not a banker, but West does not regard this as a
problem and stressed that the type of people London Scottish deals with are
the same as Reece's mail order customers.
London Scottish, started in a terraced house in Wigan, has around 100,000
mainly working class customers and a network of over 100 offices around the
country. It specialises in lending sums of around Pounds 600 to people who
find difficulty getting credit from the High Street banks. With an average
of 2m county court judgments a year, West says that there are plenty of
people who are refused credit under traditional credit scoring techniques.
Although London Scottish gets to know its customers through home visits, it
still had bad debts of Pounds 2m out of Pounds 32m of gross income last
year. Fortunately, the group has its own debt collection business which
helps explain why profits are expected to be up by nearly a quarter to
Pounds 5.6m this year.

Spain, Switzerland and Greece are experimenting with solar-powered parking
meters in areas that lack a direct supply of electricity.
Metric Parking, a UK ticket machine company, has designed a ticket machine
with a 305mm by 610mm south-facing solar panel, which is placed on a 1.5m
pole to keep it out of the reach of vandals. This provides enough power to
issue up to 250 tickets if it receives eight hours of sunlight filtering
through clouds on a grey day.
Heavily-used machines would require auxiliary solar-powered batteries in
poor climates.

<TEXT>
Xenova, the low-profile UK biotechnology company quoted in New York, has
identified a member of a new class of heart drugs it will now take into
human clinical trials, writes Daniel Green.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is a natural constituent of blood that
controls another substance, plasminogen activator (PA), which clears blood
clots. A PAI disorder can cut the PA in the body and trigger clots.
Xenova acknowledges that the heart drug field is crowded with successful
products. But it claims there are potentially dangerous side-effects with
other drugs.

Shoplifters are the chief target of closed-circuit TV cameras within stores.
Yet the same security cameras can be adapted to give retailers extra
information about the movements of their customers, the popularity of
particular displays and the length of queues at checkouts.
This extra information can be obtained by using a system called SensUS,
developed by Molynx Holdings, a Welsh company. It works by capturing images
from a closed-circuit camera and isolating areas of movement. It then uses
neural network software, which detects patterns, to count the number of
customers in each camera scene.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Surgeons face up to a 3-D
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Engineering Laboratory has developed a three-dimensional
computer modelling system which could help surgeons plan facial surgery more
accurately.
Surgeons carrying out reconstructive or plastic surgery traditionally rely
on 2-D information from photographs and X-rays of the patient's face. The
limitations of this method can result in operations being repeated.
Glasgow-based NEL, working in conjunction with St George's Hospital, London,
has designed a system using white light that can capture 3-D data from a
patient's face in two seconds. It uses a 'moire fringe' contouring method,
which relies on the interference of light patterns to detect the contours of
a face.
The developers of the system, known as OrthoForm, are now developing
software that would allow surgeons to simulate facial surgery on computer.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology: Talking tough
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The formidable difficulties posed by speech recognition are rivalled by
those involved in converting text to speech.
Scientists still have a limited understanding of the way in which speech
signals are produced. Moreover, a convincing representation of speech
depends on pronunciation, pitch and intonation, which often obey complex and
loosely defined rules. The monotone voice produced by synthesisers often
sounds more robotic than human.
Nonetheless, researchers are increasingly optimistic about text-to speech
technology. 'Today, the quality of synthetic speech from text has improved
to such an extent that real world applications are now viable,' says a
report by BT Laboratories, part of the UK telecommunications company.
Some applications are already being commercialised. Novell, a US software
company, is about to launch a system that will read out E-mail messages over
the telephone, allowing people to check their electronic messages when they
are away from a terminal.
Potential applications are wide-ranging. Telephone-based systems would allow
recipients to listen to their fax messages, doctors on call to gain access
to their patients' records and information services to provide regularly
updated bulletins.
The technology could also be used in reading machines for the blind and
navigation systems for drivers. Other applications would arise because
speech stored in text form takes much less computer storage space than
digitised speech.
Most of these applications will not materialise until further refinements
have been made to the text-to-speech process. This usually begins by
stripping punctuation out of the text and converting numbers to words.
It then converts the text to phonemes, the smallest segments of sound in the
language and assigns stress to words. These are then used to synthesise
speech, a process that either depends on extremely complex conversion rules
or else on concatenation methods, such as threading together stored samples
of speech.
But voice technology companies eyeing a potentially large market are not
deterred by the research effort required, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, a
market research company. 'Text-to-speech technology will be a key focus of
many vendors' research and development efforts,' it says.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology: Say the word - New developments mean
speech-recognition systems may soon be a common tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades the prospect of computers capable of recognising speech has
fired the imagination of researchers and science-fiction writers alike.
But early speech-recognition systems required users to speak frustratingly
slowly, with pauses between their words.
Now, speech recognition technology could be at a turning point. As
processing power increases and prices fall, manufacturers of voice
recognition equipment, such as IBM, Dragon Systems and Philips, are
optimistic about the prospect of making it a common, practical tool.
In October, Philips announced a breakthrough in the form of a speech
recognition system capable of recognising continuous speech, as well as
coping with more than 50,000 words. This development, it believes, makes
speech recognition 'mature enough to be used on a large scale in a wide
variety of applications'.
Its first specialist application is for radiologists, who produce dozens of
reports on clinical findings every day. Philips believes that its system
cuts the time taken to produce a report by 40 per cent.
Enthusiasts talk about speech recognition systems replacing keyboards, mice,
dictation machines, handwriting recognition equipment and even copytypists
and telephone operators. 'It will be months, rather than years, before
keyboards are redundant,' says Kurt Lynn, sales and marketing president of
Kolvox, which has developed software applications for speech recognition for
legal and office users.
Nicholas Stewart, a barrister who has tried out the Kolvox system, is not
totally convinced. He thinks competent typists will prefer keyboards for
typing long texts. Nonetheless, he thinks the system could be 'very helpful'
to barristers in coping with large amounts of administration.
Shoosmiths &amp; Harrison, a legal firm which has been using the AllVoice
DragonDictate system, is also enthusiastic. It says speech recognition saves
time, since texts no longer go back and forth to secretarial staff for
transcribing, proof-reading and revision. Moreover, it appeals to users who
are not computer literate or good typists.
The range of applications for voice recognition technology goes well beyond
dictation. In the home, voice recognition can turn on the television, dim
the lights or open the garage door. Mail order companies use speech
recognition for telephone sales.
Speech recognition systems are even being used for language training. French
drivers of the Eurostar high-speed trains are using a training program
produced by Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computer services company, which checks
each element of a user's sentence and rates their pronunciation.
The speech recognition market is currently valued at Dollars 289m (Pounds
176.2m) and is expected to grow at 25 per cent a year over the next four
years to Dollars 800m by 1998, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, market
researchers.
Different applications of the technology call for different approaches.
Telephone-based voice recognition systems use small vocabularies because
they need to be able to recognise a wide range of voices. Their scope is
also limited by the quality of telephone microphones, the likely presence of
background noise, and the narrow bandwidth of telephone lines which render
'f' and 's' sounds indistinguishable.
As a result, the capabilities of telephone-based voice recognition systems
are typically limited to yes, no and numbers from zero to nine.
By contrast, dictation systems which require large vocabularies, of for
example 60,000 words, are trained to recognise a particular voice. It
typically takes a few hours for the machines to become attuned to the voice
of the speaker, which involves storing examples of the speaker's phonemes,
the smallest acoustical component of a language.
The process of speech recognition begins with the microphone, which
transforms a user's spoken words into an analogue signal which is then
transformed into a digital stream of ones and zeros. Decoding software then
searches for patterns that match the stored models of phonemes. This
involves complex acoustic and statistical models that calculate the
probability that a particular pattern matches a certain sound or word. The
system also uses a language model, which contains information about the way
sentences are composed and the word order in a sentence.
The easiest languages for a computer to recognise are those providing the
most clues. So languages such as German with long words and rigorous
grammatical rules are easier to recognise than, for example English. Within
the English language, some vocabularies are easier to recognise than others:
the long words and stock phrases used by lawyers, doctors and dentists make
them an attractive market for voice recognition tools.
The take-up of voice recognition technology is influenced by a number of
factors, not least of which is national culture. North Americans, who tend
to be more comfortable than Europeans and Asians about talking to machines,
provide overwhelmingly the largest market for voice technology.
Another potential obstacle arises from the feeling of confusion or even
panic that often accompanies a user's first encounter with a speech
recognition-based telephone service. 'There are a lot of unsolved problems,'
according to BT's Fred Stentiford, who carries out research into the design
of automatic telephone dialogues. Inexperienced users speak before a prompt
has finished, hesitate, or use too many 'ums' and 'ers'. A long dialogue
that relies on simple 'yes' or 'no' answers may also deter users who find it
too tedious.
Users' growing familiarity with speech recognition systems may ease some of
these problems. But some researchers believe speech recognition systems will
only become really acceptable once there has been a breakthrough in the
theory of natural language processing, allowing a machine to cope with the
complex structure and grammar of ordinary speech.
Meanwhile, many basic aspects of speech recognition technology are capable
of considerable improvement. Researchers are trying to build systems with
larger vocabularies that can cope with continuous speech more cheaply.
'Speech recognition is a technology that is never finished,' says Bernie
Woollaston, divisional director of Philips Dictation System. 'It can always
be faster, with fewer errors.'

Jerry Brand, 37, who runs the privately-owned Brand Group, a fast-growing
contract caterer, has taken a step closer to fulfilling his stock market
ambitions by recruiting his first independent non-executive director -
Stirling Gallacher.
Gallacher, 62, was managing director of Gardner Merchant Caterers, the
industry leader, in the mid-1970s and went on to do the same job at
Sutcliffe Catering, another of the big three UK contract caters. He retired
as chairman of Sutcliffe in 1992 after Granada had bought the company.
Brand started his own catering company in 1988 and annual turnover has grown
from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 30m in the current year, with Pounds 40m
budgeted for next year. Brand expects to make pre-tax profits of Pounds
600,000 in 1994 and is hoping to get his company floated on the stock market
by 1996. He says that he is looking for an additional non-executive director
with financial experience.

Signet, the UK-based jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, is
strengthening its transatlantic ties with the appointment as a non-executive
director of the leading US retailer Lee Abraham (above).
The move reflects the fact that 60 per cent of Signet's turnover now comes
from the US, where it owns the Sterling chain.
'Abraham will bring balance to the (board's) thinking, and make sure the US
gets the time and attention it deserves,' says Signet.
Abraham, 66, is currently senior non-executive director of Liz Claiborne,
the US fashion group. He is perhaps best known as the former chairman, from
1977 to 1993, of Associated Merchandising Services, the New York-based
retail merchandising and sourcing organisation which worked with many of the
leading department and speciality stores in the US.
He built up AMS from a business handling Dollars 140m of shipments in 1977
to more than Dollars 1bn by 1989. By the time Abraham retired, it had 31
offices in five continents.
Abraham was one of the first US retailers to start developing connections
with China. 'He has a widespread merchandising and retailing background in
the US, and tremendous international experience,' says Signet.
Before AMS, Abraham was chairman and chief executive of May Merchandising,
part of the May department store group in the US.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Property: The square in a hole - Investors, not architects,
will decide the future of London's Paternoster Square
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Paternoster Square - the ugly concrete precinct next to St
Paul's Cathedral in the City of London - will be decided in the next few
months.
But after almost a decade of public wrangling about what should occupy
London's most sensitive development site, it will be investors rather than
architects or planners which will determine the outcome.
The planning process is finally chugging to a conclusion. Last week,
Standard Life, the UK life insurance group, won detailed planning permission
to redevelop Juxon House, in the south-west corner of Paternoster Square,
directly opposite the cathedral.
Paternoster Associates - a joint venture between UK developer Greycoat, Park
Tower Realty of the US and Mitsubishi Estate of Japan which owns 4.2 acres
of the seven-acre site - should clear the final planning hurdle in January.
It was in 1987 that proposals for a modernist design for the site were
scrapped when the Prince of Wales described the competition which produced
it as 'demoralising'.
The City of London planning authorities granted outline permission for
Paternoster Associates' new neo-clasical design in October 1992.
These envisage 750,000 sq ft of offices and more than 80 shops and
restaurants to a plan which aims to recapture the pattern of streets and
lanes which existed before the area was levelled in the second world war.
Standard Life is now free to build 185,000 sq ft of offices to a design by
Whitfield Partners, the architectural practice run by Sir William Whitfield,
who is also a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission.
Including Sudbury Tower, which is owned by Nuclear Electric, the UK utility,
the entire Paternoster Square site could accommodate more than 1m sq ft of
office space.
But when will the developers have the confidence and financial resources to
start work?
Although Standard Life now has full consent, it is by no means clear that it
will press ahead with redevelopment of Juxon House. The existing building is
let to Barclays Bank on a lease with about 70 years left to run. The
landlord would have to be sure of finding a new tenant at rents above
current levels to make redevelopment worthwhile.
Mr Alex Watt, property investment manager at Standard Life, said: 'The main
question is financial: when is the right time for us to build. We also have
to ask whether tenants will want to occupy offices next to a major building
site. It could make sense for us to wait until the rest of the Paternoster
development is finished.'
The initiative, therefore, is with Paternoster Associates as owners of the
majority of the site. The consortium paid Pounds 160m for its slice of
Paternoster Square in 1989. However, after five years of delay and planning
battles the total cost is thought to be about Pounds 260m.
But the market value of the site is now much less - possibly as low as
Pounds 30m, according to other developers.
Each of the partners originally contributed Pounds 15m equity, with the rest
of the acquisition funded with debt provided by Mitsubishi. Greycoat and
Park Tower Realty have since written down the value of their stake to zero,
so the site is, in effect, in the hands of Mitsubishi.
The Japanese company, part of the powerful family of companies which
includes Mitsubishi Bank, was once seen as the main supplier of long-term
development finance to Paternoster Associates. However, the Japanese group
has suffered from a domestic property recession as fierce as anything
experienced in London.
Under these circumstances, the estimated Pounds 375m development costs will
have to be found elsewhere. Greycoat is trying to organise a group of
financial institutions to fund the six new buildings planned.
The snag is that work can not start in such a sensitive area until funding
for all six phases has been committed. Paternoster Associates cannot run the
risk that its grand design will end up half finished.
Trying to find a funding formula which satisfies six or more financial
institutions and all three partners in Paternoster Associates will not be
easy.
The biggest hurdle could be Mitsubishi's reluctance to recognise the true
value of Paternoster Square. It made loans of about Pounds 200m to
Paternoster Associates to fund the initial acquisition of the site and work
carried out since.
Conventional institutional funding would effectively involve selling the
finished development forward, which could force the Japanese company to take
an unwelcome write-down on the loans.
There are doubtless ways in which these problems can be overcome - such as
keeping the ground lease with Mitsubishi and granting long sub-leases to
institutions. But time is running out if Paternoster Square is to capitalise
on the shortage of City office space.
On paper, Paternoster should provide attractive accommodation with floors of
up to 30,000 sq ft - exactly the type of office space which is now in short
supply.
But Paternoster is not the only potential City development looking for
institutional funding.
The authorities have already granted planning permission for an extra 13.6m
sq ft of office space within the City. Of this, more than 7m sq ft covers
sites which are currently empty and waiting for work to start.
The lead-times on property development are such that Paternoster Associates
can be fairly confident that there will not be an oversupply of new offices
much before 1999.
To get the whole development finished by then, though, demands that cranes
are erected by the middle of next year at the latest.
Mr Peter Thornton, managing director of Greycoat, conceded that the
timetable is tight. 'With a three and a half year development schedule ahead
of us we really need to be ready to roll by the middle of next year,' he
said.
'I would not like to be starting later than the summer. Trying to get the
funding sorted out over the next three months will be critical.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Management: Riga's recruits - The challenges faced by two
new business schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandwiched between a dilapidated former Soviet military barracks and a dingy
Soviet-style apartment block, the renovated Stockholm School of Economics in
Riga gleams like a jewel in the winter gloom.
Inside the building the mood is equally bright. 'This school will give me
opportunities I would never have had otherwise. It is the best in Latvia,'
says Uldis Kalnins, an 18-year-old, high-school graduate and one of 56
students in the first-year intake.
SSE Riga, inaugurated last month, is a unique collaboration between Swedish
and Latvian partners designed to help the Baltic states grow into
fully-fledged market economies. It will provide 100 students a year from
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with intensive undergraduate tuition in
economics and business.
The aim is to create a new breed of entrepreneurs, academics and
administrators - people who can quickly assume positions of influence and
transform attitudes in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union
until three years ago.
The school's name reflects the leading role played by the Stockholm School
of Economics, both in initiating the project and providing management.
Indeed, it was a casual chat between Staffan Burenstam Linder, the SSE's
president, and some Baltic state students three years ago that first gave
rise to the idea. Burenstam Linder seized on it eagerly. 'I like bold ideas
and I like entrepreneurship,' he says.
There were plenty of hurdles, but eventually Burenstam Linder received
financial backing, co-operation from the Latvian authorities, and a
distinguished building in central Riga to house the new school.
Funding is being provided by the Swedish and Latvian governments, the Soros
Foundation, and a few private donors. The Swedish government will provide as
much as SKr80m (Pounds 7m) over 10 years, mainly to cover education costs.
The Latvian side meets local charges, such as heating and electricity.
The Soros Foundation gave Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) to renovate the building
and build a new auditorium. The school is 51 per cent owned by the SSE and
49 per cent owned by the Latvian government.
Three years of normal university teaching will be crammed into two. This
saves costs and gets the graduates into the system as soon as possible. The
first year's intake - for practical reasons, Latvians only - are aged
between 18 and 25 and come from a mixture of backgrounds.
They do not have to pay tuition costs or fund their own maintenance,
avoiding a common situation in eastern Europe where students have to take on
part-time jobs to finance their studies.
Teaching will initially be carried out almost exclusively by SSE staff,
although a much greater local and international input is desired in the
long-term. Indeed, great store is being placed on the school's international
credibility, which is one reason why the teaching language is English.
The programme is deliberately being pitched at undergraduates, as there are
currently too few good graduates for effective courses to be run at a
Masters level. There will also be a doctoral programme, but this will be run
out of Stockholm until it has been built up in Riga.
The worry with this arrangement is that it increases the risks of a
'brain-drain'. If students decide to continue their education abroad after
the two years in Riga, the chances of them staying abroad rather than
working back home increase.
The hope is that over the next 10 years the school will attract donations,
building up a sufficient endowment to stand on its own feet. When this point
is reached, it would no longer be run by the SSE.
If the venture is successful - and the early signs are promising - Burenstam
Linder sees no reason why the concept should not be transplanted to other
former Soviet cities such as Tallinn or St Petersburg.
The project is seen as a practical way for Sweden to support the Baltic
states while helping to cement long-standing cultural and historic ties. 'A
lot of aid to eastern Europe disappears down a black hole. Here we have full
control over how it is spent,' says Per Unckel, a former Swedish education
minister who was involved with the project.
But there are also voices of caution. Peter Wallenberg, one of many top
Swedish industrialists who attended the inauguration, says the school can
only do part of the job of transforming the economies of the Baltic states.
'It is very important that the students come out into an environment which
they recognise from the instruction they have had. Otherwise they will go
abroad,' he warns.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Management: Mouthwatering multiple found in Kiev - The
challenges faced by two new business schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bohdan Hawrylyshyn, chairman of the board of International Management
Institute of Kiev, and Andrew Masiuk, director general, know all about
starting a business school in the old eastern bloc.
Established in 1989 as a joint venture between the then International
Management Institute in Geneva (now merged into IMD of Lausanne) and the
Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, IMI-Kiev claims to have been the first
institution in the former Soviet Union to offer an MBA based on the western
model. 'Izvestia carried an article in 1990 saying that if you want to learn
about management you need to go to Kiev,' says Hawrylyshyn, a Canadian who
is also adviser to the Ukrainian president.
Hawrylyshyn and Masiuk are in London this week, in part to try to drum up
more support from British companies and promote the attractions of Ukraine
in the wake of recent economic reforms.
Backed with Ecu2.3m (Pounds 1.8m) of grants from the European Union,
IMI-Kiev has developed consultancy links with the likes of Gaz de France,
Credit Lyonnais and General Electric of the Netherlands.
But apart from British Petroleum, which subscribed to the school's initial
Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 270,000) of capital, it has so far drawn a blank in
the UK.
Masiuk says the school 'started out very much teaching the core MBA courses
which would be found in Europe and the US' - despite the shortage of
successful new businesses as case studies it soon added sessions on local
economic developments. 'In management you need to teach what is universally
valid, what is transferable and what is culturally specific,' he adds.
Both men acknowledge the challenge of teaching management in a country such
as Ukraine, which is why only 20 per cent of the course is devoted to
knowledge transfer, 30 per cent to skills development, 'and the rest to
encouraging a new way of thinking, new values and new beliefs'. Hence the
need for external consulting partners to give students team-based
experience.
Fees at IMI-Kiev are steep by local standards but Hawrylyshyn claims
students who arrive earning Dollars 10 per month have been recruited into
jobs paying Dollars 1,000 per month - a mouthwatering multiple for western
MBAs more than happy these days to increase their market worth by 50 per
cent.
Of the 160 alumni, whose number includes Roman Shpek, the Ukrainian minister
of economics, the vast majority have stayed at home setting up new
businesses or working for foreign joint ventures.
IMI-Kiev's so far positive experience contrasts with the mostly
disappointing attempts by western business schools to export management
education to the east.
'They have mostly done virtually nothing,' scoffs Hawrylyshyn. 'Very few
people knew anything about eastern Europe, while their interest coincided
with the economic crisis and tight budgets.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Management: Time is up for 35-hour week - The European trend
towards flexible working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reducing the hours people work is seen by many in the European Commission
and inside European trade unions as an important means of alleviating mass
unemployment.
But as a conference in Dusseldorf organised by the European Trade Union
Institute (ETUI) has painfully revealed this week, devising a credible
Europe-wide strategy applicable to a diverse range of labour markets is
going to be difficult.
Many European trade unions appear to be shifting their position over working
time, becoming increasingly flexible as they adapt to the more complex world
of work. 'They have come to realise that a rigid working time policy, geared
exclusively to a 35-hour working week, is no longer appropriate in the
current state of society,' says Reiner Hoffman, the institute's research
director. 'What is needed is a broad-based discussion of a variety of
innovative working time policies.'
For the past 18 years the European Trade Union Confederation - the
organisation that represents most of the trade unions inside the European
Union - has been committed to the goal of a 35-hour working week without
loss of pay achieved through collective bargaining. This has mainly
reflected a German male manufacturing manual worker point of view.
But this no longer seems to be a relevant goal in an increasingly fragmented
and divided labour market where a substantially large number of workers are
now in part-time jobs or working in shifts around the clock.
They recognise that new systems of production and new human resource
management techniques have been accompanied by an increasing trend inside
industries and services across the EU towards specific forms of working time
flexibility.
'The major concern of the European employers is to reduce unit labour costs
to a minimum in the interests of competitiveness,' explains Hoffman. Global
market pressures have added to the need of many companies to change the ways
working time is organised. More often than not this is being done without
bargaining.
Trade union responses to these developments have been defensive, piecemeal
and grudging. However, there are growing signs of change. Dieter Schulte,
president of the DGB, the German Trade Union Confederation, argues that the
unions must establish a co-operative strategy with employers over working
time. He also acknowledges that economic growth alone is unlikely to create
enough jobs to resolve Europe's unemployment crisis.
But the often confusing discussion revealed an enormous variety of
contrasting union attitudes from the different EU countries.
Some are coming to terms with the vast increase in part-time employment,
most significantly the Dutch FNV union confederation which wants to
encourage the spread of part-time employment among workers. 'It is an
instrument for social change to achieve a better distribution of work for
all, an improvement in women's employment participation and a fairer
distribution of unpaid work outside the workplace,' argues Ieke Van den
Berg, an FNV board member.
Trade union officials from elsewhere in Europe, though, emphasised the need
to annualise the number of hours people work as a means of reducing
excessive overtime work and ensuring more stability in shift working.
What was missing from the conference, however, was any real awareness of the
conflicting views of European employers. Many union officials remain frozen
in the views of nearly 20 years ago when trade unions in western Europe were
stronger and more self-confident.
Notwithstanding the ETUI's research papers which emphasised the need for
productivity gains in return for cuts in working time, there seemed little
awareness of the global pressures being imposed on employers to keep their
unit labour costs under control.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Northern Rock first to lift rate -
Mortgage increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than an hour after Mr Kenneth Clarke stood up to deliver his
mini-Budget, Northern Rock became the first mortgage lender to announce a
rise in its home loan rate after the 0.5 percentage point increase in base
interest rates on Wednesday.
From December 19 the standard variable rate at the UK's 10th largest society
will go up by 0.4 percentage points to 8.54 per cent. About 230,000 of the
society's 250,000 borrowers pay this rate. The move will add Pounds 11 a
month to payments for a Pounds 40,000 loan. Mr Adam Applegarth, general
manager, said Northern Rock had felt it prudent to wait until after Mr
Clarke's statement to respond.
Other mortgage lenders did not follow suit yesterday, but Northern Rock's
move adds to the pressure for increases.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Brown hits out at 'panic measures' -
Labour's response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour said the mini-Budget showed that the government was out of touch with
public opinion and unfit to be in charge of the nation's finances.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the statement 'shows a government
that has been stumbling from crisis to crisis, from panic measure to panic
measure; a government that is, at its core, incompetent and unfair'.
Mr Brown said that the country had been relieved by the chancellor's
decision to scrap the second tranche of value added tax on heating fuel
after Tuesday's Commons defeat.
But voters would ask 'why it has to take 18 months and four Budgets to bring
forward the alternative measures that the government could have proposed in
the first place'.
Mr Brown said that the tax rises announced by the chancellor would cost
taxpayers an average of Pounds 22.36 a year, increasing the total impact of
tax changes since 1992 to Pounds 875 a year for a typical family.
'That is in breach of election promises that were made that there would be
no tax rises at all,' he said.
Mr Brown accused Mr Clarke of withdrawing not only the additional 25p a week
compensation for pensioners promised to Tory backbenchers during the VAT
debate on Tuesday, but also 30p a week promised last year.
'Will you now explain to 10m pensioners and others on low income why you are
so out of touch . . . that you are clawing back the compensation for
pensioners while you insist on going ahead with cuts in the price of
champagne?
'You are punishing pensioners when it is the Conservative party that should
be paying the price for the government's mistakes,' he said.
Mr Brown said the government had no need to raise taxes to replace the lost
revenue because its forecasts made no provision for up to Pounds 1bn in
capital gains and corporation tax due from the flotation of the National
Grid.
He told Mr Clarke: 'The underlying truth of your Budget measures today is
that, to pay for the sole remaining policy this government now has, which is
tax cuts next year, the government will contemplate any tax rises.'
Mr Clarke, in a robust attack cheered wildly by Tory MPs, dismissed Mr
Brown's comments as 'infantile'. He accused him of 'trying to deceive people
by pretending there are accountancy devices which will produce money from
nowhere'.
Mr Clarke told Labour MPs who voted against the second tranche of VAT:
'These are not my first options. These are my second options - and you have
discovered there are disadvantages with some of them.' Recalling a favourite
saying of Lord Healey, the chancellor told Mr Brown: 'A previous Labour
chancellor was fond of using the phrase 'silly billy'. I think that is
flattering for you.'
However, Labour officials believe that the mini-Budget has greatly increased
the authority of Mr Brown, who was yesterday praised by Mr Tony Blair,
Labour leader, for his skilful parliamentary campaign to force a vote on
VAT.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Revenue raising wins approval - City
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City took the chancellor's package in its stride, with analysts saying
the measures were roughly in line with expectations.
Economists were pleased that Mr Kenneth Clarke had announced revenue-raising
measures, rather than making adjustments to public spending targets, which
might not then be achieved.
Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, said 'we were concerned
that he was going to announce further cuts in the (public spending) control
total', which might have been simply due to a reduction in the contingency
reserve. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist of UBS in London, said the fact
that Mr Clarke 'didn't use smoke and mirrors will be taken very well'.
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said the chancellor 'needed to do
something which gave a rap on the knuckles to the rebellious backbenchers by
imposing small but unpopular tax increases. He can lay the blame for the tax
rises fairly and squarely with the rebels'.
Most analysts were also encouraged by the reduction in future inflation
which would result from the package. The Treasury said that, had the rise in
VAT on domestic fuel and power gone ahead, it would have added 0.43 per cent
to the retail prices index in April. The new package will add 0.26 per cent
to the RPI from January, accordingly lowering the rate of inflation later in
the year by about 0.2 of a percentage point.
But Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Markets, was disappointed with
the package. 'The chancellor had a golden opportunity to deal with the RPI,'
he said, adding that a change in indirect taxes would have saved the full
0.4 per cent.
Mr Shepherdson said: 'When inflation is around 2 per cent, 0.4 of a point is
a hell of a lot.' A lower RPI would have reduced the pressure for higher pay
increases, he added.
Mr Shepherdson also pointed out that, by delaying the changes, the RPI
impact would not come through in the December inflation figure, which was
often used as a guide for January pay settlements.
Furthermore, the drinks industry might not pass on the full impact of the
excise duty increase to consumers. Mr Shepherdson said: 'Even at current
duty levels, cross-Channel shopping is crippling the off-sales trade in the
south-east.'
Poor households will be the biggest percentage winners from the government's
tax-raising switch, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The institute said the poorest 10 per cent of the population would gain 0.58
per cent of their net income, as a result of the replacement of the 17.5 per
cent band of value added tax on fuel with higher duties on alcohol, tobacco
and petrol.
The richest 10 per cent of the population gained only 0.11 per cent. The
institute said the progressive nature of the change was due to 'the removal
of a tax that bore very heavily on the poor, and its replacement by taxes
that are spread more evenly across the population'.
However, the institute said pensioners gained, on average, less than the
overall population.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Rumbustious style that cannot disguise
harsh reality - Philip Stephens considers whether the chancellor has been
weakened in the past days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has lived at the Commons despatch box these past 10 days.
It was the chancellor who opened the fateful debate on European Union
finances which tore open the party's wounds over Europe. Then the Budget.
Then a vain attempt to rescue the proposed increase in value added tax on
domestic fuel.
Finally yesterday came the 'mini-Budget' - or as he preferred to describe
it, the 'corrigendum' - to plug the financial gap left by the government's
worst parliamentary defeat since 1979.
On each occasion Mr John Major had sat by his side - most of the time
passive, sometimes scowling, occasionally chuckling, but always wondering
whether Mr Clarke's combative self-confidence was helping or hindering his
government's attempts to climb out from an ever deeper political hole.
Behind the two men, Tory MPs on the restless, rebellious back benches have
looked on with mixed emotions.
Many have contrasted the chancellor's rumbustious dismissal of the
government's calamities with the tired demeanour of the prime minister.
Journalists in the Commons press gallery have nodded assent as Mr Clarke has
soaked up the political punches from the opposition and Tory rebels alike.
Ken, after all, is an insider's politician, relaxed, witty and never lost
for a riposte at the despatch box.
But the admiration has not been universal. Others in his party judge that Mr
Clarke has been seriously damaged these past few days.
Politics is often as much about perceptions as about reality, he declared
during one of this week's Commons performances. But the chancellor cannot
disguise the reality that he is the first holder of the post to lose an
important tax measure since Mr Denis Healey in the chaotic final days of the
last Labour government. Nor can he hope that yesterday's package of tax
increases to fill the financial gap will be popular either in the country or
with his critics on the Tory right.
Some of his friends blame the party whips. They miscalculated, the argument
runs, the extent of opposition from the nine Eurosceptic rebels exiled from
the parliamentary party last week.
But Mr Clarke too failed to appreciate the anger in the country at the
imposition of higher-rate VAT on fuel - an anger which emboldened usually
loyal Tory MPs to join the irreconcilables in the revolt.
Then there is Europe. The original idea to make the vote on higher
contributions to the EU budget a life-or-death affair for the government
came from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. But Mr Clarke, a fervent
pro-European, needed no convincing.
Impatient at the appeasement of the sceptics during the battle over
Maastricht, the chancellor is said to have assured rightwing cabinet
colleagues that only one or two would defy the government in a vote of
confidence. In the end nine lost the party whip, leaving Mr Major heading,
technically at least, a minority government.
Some on the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party see, as in most things, a
dark conspiracy in all this. The chancellor, after all, wears his
pro-Europeanism on his sleeve. He is the only senior member of the cabinet
willing to admit he favours a single European currency. Somehow Mr Clarke
has calculated that however damaged he is, Mr Major will fare worse. With
the prime minister's leadership under threat again, the chancellor can
demonstrate that he is made of sterner stuff.
Not so. Mr Clarke has been true to his political instincts. He is not, as an
old friend in the cabinet puts it, a man for measured argument. His
pugnacious style is frequently a strength. But the delight he takes in
antagonising opponents - the sceptics on the Tory back benches were brushed
aside yesterday as mere Euro-rebels and Mr Gordon Brown, his Labour shadow,
dismissed as infantile - is sometimes a weakness.
Mr Clarke's relationship with the prime minister is good, though neither
would describe it as warm. The chancellor consulted closely with Mr Major on
the Budget but made it clear that he was the one running the Treasury.
He would jump at the chance of the leadership if Mr Major fell but he is not
plotting his removal. Mr Clarke judges that his best chance of the
succession lies beyond rather than before the next election.
He thinks the prime minister is determined to fight that election. He sees a
common interest in the government winning. Then Mr Major probably would step
down. As the man who delivered the economic recovery, Mr Clarke would be the
front-runner to take over.
Maybe. The assumption that the Conservatives still have a reasonable chance
of winning the next election looks more heroic by the day. Mr Clarke's own
prospects also look more uncertain.
Income tax cuts before the election will repair easily the damage of the VAT
debacle. But the chancellor's contemptuous dismissal of his party's growing
band of Eurosceptics has narrowed his support among the electorate which
will chose the next Tory leader. He is still favourite but he needs to start
winning friends as well as kicking enemies.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Clarke wins broad support - Conservative
backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A broad cross-section of Conservative backbenchers yesterday welcomed Mr
Kenneth Clarke's revised Budget proposals, hoping that they would swiftly
defuse the recent row over value added tax on fuel.
MPs said the chancellor had delivered a bravura performance in the Commons,
regaining the initiative against the Labour party following Tuesday night's
defeat on VAT.
Rightwing MPs expressed reservations, however, that the chancellor had opted
for tax-raising measures rather than taking another opportunity to make cuts
in public spending.
Some MPs said that the tone of the statement had been too vengeful towards
Tory rebels who had brought about the government's defeat.
One said: 'There was too much of an air of 'serves you right for voting me
down'. We could have done with a bit more humble pie.'
The chancellor's tax-raising measures - on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol -
were seen by mainstream backbenchers as the safest option after the row over
VAT on fuel.
A backbencher said: 'Booze, fags and gas are regarded as the three 'sin
taxes' in this country, so it was safe for him to go for those.'
He felt that any adjustment in the general rate of VAT to make up the
shortfall in revenue would have led the government into a further rebellion.
Mr Phil Gallie, the Tory MP for Ayr who abstained in Tuesday night's vote,
said he was satisfied with the measures.
He said: 'I am relieved that he did not put 2p a litre on petrol. If he had
done that, the rise would have been tough on Scottish rural constituencies.'
Mr Clarke's performance in the Commons, in which he accused Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, of having the 'brass neck' of complaining about tax
rises he had instigated, also drew warm applause.
However, others expressed concern that the increases in cigarettes and
alcohol would have a negative impact on local industries.
According to one prominent rightwinger companies in his constituency were
facing much tougher competition following the relaxation of customs and
excise duties and the growth of cross-border shopping.
Two Euro-rebels also made clear that they remained unhappy at the
chancellor's refusal to tackle spending on Britain's contribution to the
European budget. They could not understand why the European budget remained
'sacrosanct' while the chancellor undertook sweeping tax rises.
Last night the divisions in the party appeared to be as great as ever after
a row broke out at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbench MPs.
Mr Terry Dicks, a strong ally of the prime minister, turned on dissident MPs
at the meeting, accusing them of 'conspiring behind John Major's back'.
Mr Dicks accused Sir George Gardiner, a leading rightwinger, of 'two-faced,
sanctimonious hypocrisy'.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Lib Dems attack 'politics of pique'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Clarke of 'demonstrating the politics of
pique'.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's treasury spokesman, said that Mr Clarke's
decision to replace one tax increase with three 'demonstrates the enthusiasm
with which the Tory party now increases taxes'.
Mr Bruce said the gap in the Budget could have been filled by cutting
spending on consultants and advertising.
He said: 'This pain and anguish could have been avoided if you had only
listened to the people in the first place.'
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said the mini-Budget
had 'replaced one anti-Scottish tax of VAT on fuel with two anti-Scottish
taxes on petrol and on whisky'.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Motor industry condemns increase - Petrol
duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The additional 1p per litre duty to be imposed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, on petrol and diesel fuels was widely attacked by motor
industry, freight transport and motoring organisations last night, John
Griffiths writes.
The Freight Transport Association said the change would add Pounds 100m to
the industry's costs in addition to the Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m burden it
already faced from higher fuel taxes announced in last week's Budget. Both
increases come into effect on January 1.
Yesterday's 1p increase applies to leaded and unleaded petrol and follows
Budget increases of 2.5p a litre on leaded and unleaded petrol and 3.2p per
litre on diesel.
It equates to an increase of 4.5p a gallon and brings the post-Budget price
increase to 15.75p on a gallon of petrol and to 18.9p on a gallon of diesel.
On average, a gallon of unleaded petrol or diesel will cost Pounds 2.50, and
leaded Pounds 2.75.
The Automobile Association, which in the immediate aftermath of the Budget
accused the government of regarding the UK's 20m motorists as 'wallets on
wheels', said last night: 'This proves what we've always said. Whenever the
Treasury is short of a few bob, the chancellor mugs the motorist.'
It estimated that the combined increase would add about Pounds 51 to the
average private motorist's annual costs.
The Royal Automobile Club said that the new rise would particularly hit the
elderly, disabled and those living in rural areas. 'Motorists in the shires
may well vote with their wheels,' it said.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was 'disappointed'
but not surprised by the extra increase, and warned that it could put extra
upward pressure on inflation.
The increases are, however, more likely to cause minor shifts in the
structure of the new car market, with increased emphasis on diesel and
economy models, than significantly affecting new car demand.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Manufacturers 'paying for ineptitude' -
Drink and tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's increases in drink and tobacco duties drew a chorus of
criticism from producers who thought they had detected in November's Budget
the first signs of government sympathy for their loss of trade to
cross-channel shopping.
'We're shocked. We're picking up the tab for the Tories political
ineptitude,' said the Wine and Spirits Association.
'We're outraged and quite shocked. We really feel he's panicked and made an
irrational decision,' the Scotch Whisky Association said.
Distillers, brewers and tobacco companies had lobbied with unprecedented
force before the main Budget, arguing that the flow of low-duty paid imports
and smuggled goods had reached damaging proportions.
Brewers claim that such imports account for about 4 per cent of total beer
consumption and 15 per cent of the take-home trade. The UK's third largest
brand of tobacco for hand-rolled cigarettes, Drum, is not officially for
sale in this country.
'No chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this,' Mr Kenneth Clarke
said in his November Budget speech. However, he said the government could
not cut alcohol excise duties without raising other taxes to compensate for
the lost revenue.
Recognising the inroads made by imports, the November Budget left duty on
beer, wine and cider unchanged but cut it on sparkling wine by 27p per 75 cl
bottle and by 13p a bottle on fortified wine to remove anomalous tax rates
between different types of alcoholic drinks.
Yesterday, Mr Clarke added 1p on a pint of beer and litre of cider, 5p on a
bottle of wine, 7p on sparkling and fortified wine and 26p on a bottle of
spirits, effective from January 1.
'This is a kick in the teeth of British beer drinkers,' the Brewers and
Licensed Retailers Association said. The increases will make cross-border
shopping even more of a problem, it added.
The government's strategy for reducing the attractiveness of cross-Channel
imports is to negotiate with Continental governments to raise their duties.
'The solution is for the government to work with our European partners to
bring duties more in line,' the chancellor said in his November Budget
speech.
'The forthcoming review of Europe-wide minimum excise duties gives us the
opportunity to make a start at that.'
But the Scotch Whisky Association said: 'The chancellor now goes into those
European talks with a weakened position.'
'This is a bad decision and bad timing,' said Mr Anthony Greener, chairman
of Guinness, the largest distiller. In November, the chancellor 'made it
clear that for the sake of British exports to Europe the discrimination
should not be increased. Today he has done just that.'
The chancellor raised tobacco taxes in November in line with government
policy of increasing prices faster than inflation to curb consumption for
health reasons. Duty on a packet of cigarettes was raised 10p in November
and 6p yesterday, cigars were raised by 5p and 3p, and pipe tobacco by 6p
and 4p. Hand-rolling tobacco was raised by 12p in November but left
unchanged yesterday.
A packet of cigarettes will typically cost Pounds 2.70 in the UK against
Pounds 1.70 in France, the Tobacco Manufacturers Association said. 'The
chancellor has handed tobacco smugglers two wage increases in a fortnight,'
the association said.
The government has expressed some scepticism about the claimed level of
drinks smuggling, while acknowledging that criminal gangs operate in
tobacco. Tobacco retailers are losing Pounds 980m a year and the government
is losing Pounds 750m a year in taxes, the Tobacco Alliance, a lobby group
for retailers, said yesterday.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: 'My objective remains to reduce spending'
 -The full text of the Chancellor's announcement to the House of Commons /
Smokers, drinkers and motorists feel the brunt of indirect tax increases as
the chancellor refuses to change spending settlements and income tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement.
Following the vote on Tuesday night, I told the House that the government
remained committed to taking all the necessary measures to put the public
finances on a sound footing. The reductions in the public sector borrowing
requirement I announced in my Budget were welcomed at the time by the
business community, the financial markets and this House. During the course
of the Budget debate few Rt Hon and Hon Members questioned that judgment. To
keep these borrowing plans intact, I said I would be bringing forward
measures to make good the gap in the public finances from holding the rate
of VAT on domestic fuel and power at 8 per cent.
I can now tell the House what those measures will be. A press note filling
out the details of my proposals will be available from the Vote Office as
soon as I have sat down.
Holding the rate of VAT at 8 per cent will reduce revenue by about Pounds
1bn in 1995-96 and, reflecting the quarterly profile of payments, Pounds
1.5bn in subsequent years. These are the amounts that I have sought to
recover.
Since VAT on fuel will remain at 8 per cent, it would be quite wrong to
increase social security expenditure by providing the full compensation
package previously announced to help people with VAT at 17.5 per cent. We
will adjust the amount that would have been paid if VAT on fuel had been
increased, saving around Pounds 200m in 1995-96 and subsequent years. We
will of course keep in place the help already given for 8 per cent VAT on
domestic fuel and power. We will increase benefits fully in line with the
relevant cost of living index including the component reflecting the impact
of last year's VAT increase.
After these adjustments pensioner couples will receive help of at least
Pounds 1.05 a week from next April. This will be more than the average
weekly cost to pensioners of paying 8 per cent VAT on fuel. I am also
keeping unchanged the increases in cold weather payments and spending on the
Home Energy Efficiency Scheme which I announced in the Budget and in last
Tuesday's debate.
This small change in the previously announced pension rates has a knock-on
effect to the national insurance system, since the lower earnings limit is
automatically linked to the single pension. National Insurance contributions
will therefore start at Pounds 58 rather than Pounds 59 a week from April
1995. The upper earnings limit will be unchanged. This will have the effect
of raising receipts from National Insurance contributions by some Pounds 50m
next year.
The remaining gap for 1995-96 amounts to some Pounds 800m. My first step was
to look at public spending. In my last two Budgets I have been able to find
savings of Pounds 43bn in public spending over the four survey years. This
is much larger than the increases in taxation that we have found it
necessary to make to restore healthy public finances after the recession.
We have managed to find these savings while increasing spending in real
terms on key public services such as the NHS and the police. My objective
remains to reduce government spending to below 40 per cent of total national
output. Both of my Budgets have made that objective much more achievable.
The details of this year's extremely tight public spending settlement have
already been announced by the relevant secretaries of state. I do not
consider it practicable or sensible to reopen those settlements today.
At the time of my Budget I struck a balance between spending and revenue
designed to ensure that the economy remains on track for steady and
sustainable growth. Nothing that has happened since then has led me to
change that judgment for this year's settlement.
The next area I considered to recover the shortfall in revenue was direct
taxation. Since 1979 this government has reduced the basic rate of taxation
from 33p in the pound to 25p. And we also introduced the new lower rate of
20p. One-fifth of all taxpayers now pay tax only at this lower rate.
When seeking to raise revenue in the 1993 Budgets, my Rt Hon Friend and I
considered it necessary to freeze personal allowances, reduce the married
couple's allowance and the mortgage income relief allowance.
I considered then that these increases in direct taxation were a sufficient
and reasonable contribution to our revenue needs. That remains my view
today. I do not intend to reverse my decisions to index the personal
allowances and to over-index above inflation the elderly persons allowance
and the 20p band.
I also considered raising additional revenue from business taxation. In my
Budget I provided as much help as I could for the business community. The
reason was simple. Strong and thriving businesses are essential for a strong
and thriving economy.
I have also listened during last week's debate to the Labour Party's
proposals for closing loopholes and introducing a windfall tax on utilities
and I have done some work on studying them. They are not serious options for
revenue raising. This government has never been a friend to the
tax-avoidance industry and Conservative chancellors have changed loopholes
year after year. The last two Budgets speak for themselves. I raised nearly
Pounds 3.5bn between 1994-95 and 1997-98 by closing loopholes. The Hon
Gentleman's proposals on loopholes are undesirable changes in taxation on
legitimate business.
I have looked many times at his proposal on executive share options. The
policy behind tax relief for executive share options is geared to
encouraging companies to motivate key employees and benefit all
shareholders. Executives are liable to capital gains tax once they sell
their shares.
The Rt Hon Gentleman exaggerates the cost of the scheme. The Rt Hon
Gentleman has claimed that I could raise Pounds 200m by 'reforming' it. The
actual total cost of the relief is estimated at around Pounds 50m.
The suggestion of a windfall tax is by definition a one-off tax. It could
not replace permanent annual loss of a flow of revenue. In any event, it
appears to be based on the suggestion of taxing profits on gains which, as
the Rt Hon Gentleman appears to have discovered in this mornings press, are
already liable to taxation.
A windfall tax would simply be another tax on a particular sector of
industry. Like other taxes on business it would inevitably have adverse
effects on that business sector's investment and prices.
My third, and remaining option for 1995-96, therefore, has been to look to
indirect taxation. As the House has rejected an increase in indirect
taxation to which it had previously agreed it is wholly consistent with my
Budget strategy and it preserves the shape of the Budget to fill the hole
with increases in indirect taxation. I have decided to bring forward certain
increases in taxation in addition to those announced in my Budget, to take
effect from midnight, 31 December 1994.
I propose that the duty on tobacco products, with the exception of
hand-rolling tobacco, will increase by just under 4 per cent, equivalent to
6p on a packet of 20 cigarettes. This further increase in tobacco duty is
consistent with our policy of increasing prices to discourage smoking.
I also propose that the duties on road fuels will rise by a further 1p a
litre. I have kept these increases to the minimum to limit the burden on
business users and the rural motorist.
Even after the increases, petrol will still be cheaper in real terms than a
decade ago and cheaper than in our main European competitors. The increase
will also play a part in our strategy for curbing emission of CO2. We remain
fully committed to the target of reducing CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by
the year 2000.
Finally, I propose that duties on alcohol will rise by around 4 per cent.
This is equivalent to 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a bottle of wine, and 26p
on a bottle of whisky. For the reasons set out in my Budget statement I had
hoped to spare these industries any increase in duty this year. But in
present circumstances, as a result of my need to raise revenue from sources
other than VAT on fuel, I have reluctantly judged it necessary to raise some
additional revenue from them.
Taken together these increases will raise Pounds 180m in the current year
and nearly Pounds 800m in 1995-96.
In total this is sufficient to meet the shortfall next year. I expect the
public sector borrowing requirement next year to be the same as I announced
in my Budget statement.
Let me turn now to the following year, 1996-97. For that year I need to
raise Pounds 1.5bn.
The tax measures that I have announced today will raise an additional Pounds
850m.
The impact of the higher duties that I have announced today on the RPI will
not be as great as the impact would have been from the second stage of VAT
on fuel.
Inflation will therefore be very slightly lower than expected, leading to
further public spending savings on benefits of around Pounds 160m in 1996-97
and later years. And there will be savings of around Pounds 200m from the
withdrawal of help to compensate for the second stage of VAT.
There will, however, remain a further gap of around Pounds 300m to be filled
in 1996-97.
I propose to finance this gap by reducing the public expenditure control
totals for those years. For the time being I will score that reduction
through a reduction in the provision that I had made for the reserve. The
eventual consequence for Departmental programmes will be addressed in next
year's spending round.
I expect the public sector borrowing requirement to be as I announced in my
Budget statement in 1996-97 and in subsequent years.
Resolutions under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act to hold VAT on
fuel at 8 per cent with effect from 1 January 1995 will be tabled very
shortly.
My Rt Hon Friend the Leader of the House will then be arranging a debate
before the House rises for the Christmas recess.
Madam Speaker, I said in my Budget speech that the British economy is
currently facing the most favourable set of economic circumstances it has
seen for many years. Trade figures published only this morning show that
exports are up 14 per cent in the last year and once again at record levels.
The trade deficit is the lowest it has been for almost 10 years. The outlook
for jobs and future prosperity for men and women in this country is
improving day by day.
This House has an obligation to keep this healthy recovery on track. We have
an obligation to act responsibly, and not be tempted by short-term populist
measures, which would undermine confidence in the government's commitment to
sound public finances. The measures I have announced today ensure that that
commitment is fulfilled.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Banks get guidelines on marketing of mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A voluntary code of practice on the information banks should give customers
choosing mortgages was launched yesterday by the British Bankers'
Association.
It has not, however, headed off demands for new regulation of the sale and
marketing of home loans.
The code was agreed in discussion between the bigger high street banks. They
said they already met its terms.
The Office of Fair Trading welcomed the guidance as 'a step forward but not
the end of the road'. In February, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
fair trading, called for lenders to be required to give borrowers the most
appropriate advice.
The guidance is more limited than the plans for a code being discussed by
the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies
and centralised lenders which sell through intermediaries rather than branch
networks.
The CML code is likely to include telling the borrower in writing after the
sale the reason why a particular type of mortgage was recommended as
appropriate.
Mortgages involving investments - such as endowments - will be included in
new financial services regulations next year which require more information
to be given to customers.
The annual report of the banking ombudsman, published earlier this week,
said requiring banks to give 'best advice' on mortgages would make
complaints about mortgages - the third biggest category of complaint - much
easier to deal with.
It also highlighted the difficulty of resolving mortgage complaints on the
basis of what the bank said when the loan was taken out, as this was usually
several years before the complaint.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Management blamed for half of business failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management is to blame for half of businesses failures, according to a
survey published today.
And three-quarters of businesses are beyond rescue by the time they enter
insolvency.
Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the Society of Practitioners in Insolvency,
said its annual survey showed better management training was vital to avoid
corporate failure.
Mr Bradbery said: 'Management failure is rising as both a principal and a
contributory cause of company insolvency. Management helps push its own
enterprise over the edge in more than half of all cases.'
The survey showed that in one case in 10 management was principally to blame
for the failure through fraud, bad planning, imprudent accounting, or lack
of information.
Mr Bradbery added: 'There must have been a time in the history of most of
these companies when failure was avoidable. Management often seems incapable
of seeking advice until it is too late.'
Dr Anne Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, said she was
not surprised by the figures. 'We have to have better trained managers. It
is absolutely essential,' she said.
It was vital for businesses that incorporated to have a sound business plan
as many companies that failed were 'doomed from the start'.
Dr Robinson said the institute opposed the Budget proposal to introduce a
28-day moratorium for companies in trouble. 'If poor management is the
problem this will make no difference,' she said.
More than 1,500 companies went into liquidation in November this year, a 14
per cent fall from the same month last year, according to Austintel, the
insolvency data group.
The number of personal bankruptcies fell 30 per cent to 1,800.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Grim outlook for Tories in Black Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks bad for the Tories. Very bad. With less than a week to go to the
Dudley West by-election, there are signs that it might even be disastrous.
After a week like the one Mr John Major's government has just been through,
few people expect the Conservatives to hold on to this quiet constituency in
the heart of the Black Country.
On paper, it ought to be a tough task for Labour. The seat is number 101 on
its list of Tory targets. It has been held by the Conservatives break since
1979. And its local population is made up of the kind of hardened middle
class voters who epitomise rank-and-file Conservative supporters.
But few Tory candidates can ever have fought a by-election in conditions as
unfavourable as those facing Mr Graham Postles, a 37-year-old insurance
executive who lives in the area.
His party is now a record 39.5 points behind Labour in national opinion
polls. Its divisions have been fully exposed in debates on Europe and value
added tax in the Commons throughout the by-election campaign. And there is
no powerful Liberal Democrat challenge here threatening to split Labour's
vote.
Above all, the majority of 5,789 which Mr Postles is defending seems
trifling compared with the hefty Tory leads overturned at Christchurch and
Eastleigh in the past 18 months.
A senior Tory party official admitted this week that Labour should get a
majority of 6,000 next Thursday. But his demeanour let slip that even this
might be an underestimate. 'It's just been too difficult on the doorstep,'
he said.
A government minister who had campaigned in the constituency also admitted
at Westminster yesterday that the result could be disastrous.
At first glance the constituency of 80,000 electors occupies the kind of
industrial landscape which evokes the recent recession and discontent with
the Conservative administration.
Manufacturing in the Black Country is a shadow of its former self. Much of
it can be found in museums dotted around the area.
But rows of detached and affluent-looking houses in towns such as Sedgley
and Upper Gornal are an indication that this area has one of the highest
levels of owner-occupation in the country. Local unemployment is down to 8
per cent from 22 per cent in 1992. According to Tory statistics, 71 per cent
of local business leaders expect turnover to rise in the next 12 months.
A Conservative Central Office official working on the party's campaign said:
'It's not all that different from fighting Guildford or Chingford. It's very
much C2 territory - without the Essex accent.'
Mr Postles is confident the constituency is, at last, enjoying the promised
economic upturn. And he can certainly count on the support of a few
hard-core Conservatives.
'This isn't Christchurch or Eastleigh,' he says. 'In the Black Country
people are steeped in local tradition, they care about local issues and they
like stability.'
There are signs of that. Mr John Guest, a retired refuse collector, said:
'The government has its problems. But Tories here will stick with the
government through and through.'
Others say that the decline in regional unemployment is making itself felt.
Mr Roy Hampton, a gas engineer, said: 'I'll vote Tory again. You just need
to give the Tories time to let the economic changes make themselves felt,
that's all. People aren't being patient enough.'
But Labour's campaign is milking national discontent with the Tories to good
effect.
A mother-of-two in the Merry Hill shopping centre said: 'I voted Tory last
time but it will be Labour now. The Tories don't understand what the tax
rises have done to families like ours.'
A pensioner who is also thinking of switching said: 'I'm impressed with Tony
Blair. He appears sensible in a way Labour didn't before.'
Mr Fraser Kemp, who is masterminding Labour's campaign to take the seat,
refuses to get too excited about his party's chances. 'We cannot just assume
that the Tories are losing voters,' he said this week. 'We need to go out
and win them over.'
If the government loses this seat, its position at Westminster will be even
worse. But the parliamentary arithmetic is not the main issue. A Labour win
here would show that Mr Tony Blair's party can attract voters who have never
thought of supporting it before. That could signal a vital turning-point in
its fortunes.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Gauge of 'green' damage launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven environmental groups yesterday joined forces to produce the first
comprehensive index of damage to the country's environment.
The new 'green gauge' index covers 10 sensitive areas, such as river
pollution, rural land loss and biodiversity.
According to the sponsors, which include the World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Friends of
the Earth, standards have fallen steadily in six of the 10 sectors examined.
By contrast, the situation has improved in just one sector, while matters
have remained stable in the remaining three.
The environmentalists want to develop the green gauge into an annual study
of environmental standards.
The next issue, due in January 1996, should come shortly before the
establishment of the UK's planned Environment Agency.
Legislation for the agency has been tabled in the House of Lords and is
expected to take effect next year, leading to the creation of the new body
in 1996.
The green gauge is a cross-section of 46 environmental standards tracked in
a wider study, produced for the sponsors by the New Economics Foundation, a
recently formed environmental, social and economic policy think-tank.
The 10 areas were selected on the basis of degree of public understanding,
ease of assessment, reliability of data and public interest.
In presenting their findings the sponsors called for more reliable and
consistent data on environmental factors, such as animal stocks, to allow
accurate measurement of future changes.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Lloyd's reporting change delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has postponed plans for ending its three-year accounting
system after discovering that the change requires European Union rules to be
modified.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said the setback was 'frustrating'. For
new corporate members, allowed to invest in the insurance market for the
first time this year, the move means 1994 profits are likely to published in
1997, not 1996 as expected.
Lloyd's regards the three-year accounting system as outdated, with the
insurance market becoming more dependent on investment from companies rather
than Names - individual's whose assets have traditionally supported it.
It hoped to move to a two-year accounting period next year when it was
planning to report results for both 1992 and 1993. That would have meant
expected losses in 1992 being reported with figures showing the market
returning to profitability in 1993.
Lloyd's said yesterday that when the plans were unveiled in September legal
opinion was divided over whether references to the market in the EU
insurance accounts directive would require modification.
It said: 'It is now clear that the text will have to be changed and the
Department of Trade and Industry has advised that this may take up to two
years or possibly longer.'

The BBA said, however, that it was 'questionable' whether a 'reason why'
letter would be appropriate when a mortgage was taken out.
The deadline for bringing the BBA guidelines into effect is the end of June
next year. Sir Nicholas Goodison, BBA president and chairman of the TSB
group, said this time lag would enable smaller banks, which had not been
consulted, to change their practices if necessary.
The BBA published a leaflet with the code suggesting questions customers
should ask when choosing a mortgage. This is available from Citizens Advice
Bureaux and the BBA itself.
The Consumers' Association said the guidance was 'better than nothing'.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Management 'to blame' in half of company failures
</HEADLINE>

Management is to blame for half of businesses failures, according to a
survey published today.
And three-quarters of businesses are beyond rescue by the time they enter

Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the Society of Practitioners in Insolvency,
said its annual survey showed better management training was vital to avoid
corporate failure.
Mr Bradbery said: 'Management failure is rising as both a principal and a

Dr Robinson said the IoD opposed the Budget proposal to introduce a 28-day
moratorium for companies in trouble. 'If poor management is the problem this
will make no difference,' she said.
The survey, based on nearly 3,000 cases in the year to June, showed that
loss of market caused failure in 37 per cent of cases - down 9 per cent.
Unavailability of finance was a worsening problem, up 3 per cent to 22 per
cent.
Mr Bradbery said managers should realise that calling in a licenced
insolvency expert could save jobs. The survey showed that one in three
people working for a failed company kept their jobs - compared to one in
four in the survey for 1992-93.
Small company insolvency was also growing, with companies of less than
Pounds 1m turnover representing 45 per cent of the liabilities of insolvent
companies - 9 per cent higher than in the previous year.
More than 1,500 companies went into liquidation in November this year, a 14
per cent fall from the same month last year, according to Austintel, the
insolvency data group.
The number of personal bankruptcies fell 30 per cent to 1,800.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Grid plan faces further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest upgrading of Britain's electricity grid network since the 1950s
faces further delay with the decision to hold two more public inquiries into
sections of the proposed route.
The Department of Trade and Industry has announced that inquiries will start
in March into two route diversions proposed by the National Grid Company
after previous options were rejected by the DTI in May.
The company says its proposed Pounds 200m upgrading of transmission lines
through 50 miles of Cleveland and North Yorkshire is necessary to permit
transmission of more, cheaply generated, electricity from gas, hydro and
nuclear stations.
Objectors to the proposals, first submitted in 1991 and already the subject
of a six-month 1992 public inquiry, say that the upgrading is unnecessary
and will despoil the countryside.
This week at North Yorkshire wayleave hearings at which the Grid is fighting
landowners who have refused consent for installation of new pylons and
lines, the company said that in 1993-94 the electricity market had to pay
Pounds 67m in compensation to northern generators because of transmission
constraints.
Yesterday it confirmed that Nuclear Electric's Hartlepool station and the
new gas-fired Pounds 850m Teesside Power station were among the recipients.
The company said that the compensation charge arose because competitively
priced electricity offered by the generators could not be fully handled by
the present transmission system. Similar compensation costs seem likely in
the current year.
In May the government gave approval in principle for 80 per cent of the
route but the company still faces opposition from landowners refusing
wayleave.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Power generators warned on plant disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday showed
impatience with the two main generators over plant disposals and said he was
considering regulatory changes to allow regional power companies to buy
plant from them.
Prof Littlechild said neither National Power nor PowerGen had submitted
proposals which would meet the objectives of an undertaking to try to sell
off 5,000MW to 6,000MW of capacity to increase competition.
He said he had told the generators that 'arrangements which left either
company with a continuing involvement in or significant influence on the
commercial operation of the plant would not resolve the underlying
competition issues'.
He added: 'I have asked both parties to explore a range of alternatives.'
The generators have until the end of next year to try to sell the plant, but
Prof Littlechild is believed to be concerned about their lack of progress to
meeting the commitment.
His statement comes a month before the government publishes the prospectus
for the sale of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and
PowerGen. The potential problems arising from the plant disposal commitments
are a concern for investors.
Prof Littlechild has previously warned that he will refer the matter to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission if he is not satisfied with the outcome.
Writing in a consultation document, Prof Littlechild said several regional
electricity companies had asked about the possibility of relaxing limits on
generating their own electricity needs. The limit is about 15 per cent.
Some companies want it lifted to allow them to bid, either alone or as part
of consortia, for the National Power and PowerGen plant. Eastern Group and
Southern Electric are thought to be among them.
The prospect of regional electricity companies buying more electricity from
their own subsidiaries raises monopoly questions, however.
Prof Littlechild said even after 1998, when full competition is planned for
power supply, the companies 'would be likely to retain a significant degree
of de facto market power for a period'. He added: 'Where such market power
exists, a (company) which is purchasing electricity from a power station in
which it is a shareholder may face a potential conflict of interest.'
The regulator is suggesting a system under which regional electricity
companies would be prohibited or restricted from buying hedging contracts
from power stations in which they had an interest.
This, he says, could allow a company to 'contribute more fully to the
development of competition in generation without the allegation that it was
exploiting its captive market and local monopoly position'.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Doubts remain over MoD housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubts over whether the Ministry of Defence will be able to plug a Pounds
500m gap in its 1995-96 budget by privatising its housing stock are to be
unresolved until next year.
Mr Nicholas Soames, armed forces minister, said yesterday a decision on
whether to proceed with the transfer would not be taken until 'the first
part of next year'.
It was 'too early to be confident that such a transfer will be possible on
terms which will satisfy our requirements'.
Failure to raise the money would force the MoD to look for savings elsewhere
in its budget, including possible cuts in procurement plans.
Two months ago it abandoned plans to privatise the Pounds 3.5bn housing
stock by setting up a non-profit trust, blaming 'technical difficulties'. It
appointed NatWest Markets to advise on options.
Mr Soames said in a Commons written answer that the initial work undertaken
by NatWest Markets had been 'productive and encouraging'.
The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed that 700 jobs are to go at the
Rosyth naval base. Part of the base will remain open with more than 900 jobs
as a Royal Navy Support Establishment.

FT  09 DEC 94 / No evidence of growing skills gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no hard evidence that skills shortages are increasing in the
British economy, according to the latest Employment Gazette, in spite of
several published surveys which have cited increasing recruitment
difficulties.
The latest Skill Needs in Britain survey, funded by the employment
department, finds that 21 per cent of employers this spring reported
hard-to-fill vacancies over the previous 12 months, compared with 16 per
cent in 1993 and 1992.
The gazette says: 'The rise in recruitment difficulties can be partly
explained by an in-crease in recruitment activity.'
Although surveys by the Confederation of British Industry and the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce have reported recruitment
difficulties, the gazette says that this is not necessarily due to a lack of
skills in the labour force.
It says: 'Recruitment difficulties may be caused by several other factors:
by employers making jobs unattractive (poor pay, poor conditions); by job
seekers with unrealistically high expectations of terms and conditions;
because the nature of the work is unpopular; or because potential recruits
have little or no relevant work experience.'
Occupational groups which contained large shares of hard-to-fill vacancies
included sales and services, catering, nurses, engineers and technologists.
This year 63 per cent of employers reported that the skill needs of their
workforce were increasing - up from 60 per cent. However, the survey says
this increase in needs does not always produce a skills shortage. Only 12
per cent of employers said that a skills gap existed among their employees,
down from 17 per cent last year.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Battle over Ulster fraud stepped up: Renewed fears on
racketeering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government officials have drawn up proposals to combat financial crime in
Northern Ireland, in the expectation that some former paramilitaries may
continue racketeering even if a lasting peace is achieved.
Some senior security officials believe that a number of former
paramilitaries will continue to engage in fraud and extortion, either in
their own right or in organised criminal groups. They consider that
investment generated by the 'peace dividend' may present opportunities for
financial crime and are insisting that any significant investment from the
US and the European Union be closely controlled by civil servants.
They fear that current legislation may not be adequate in the changing
political circumstances. Under the Northern Ireland Emergency Powers Act the
security forces act against racketeering and extortion on the basis of
evidence that these are contributing to paramilitary organisations.
The Northern Ireland Office's terrorist finance unit, which has co-ordinated
a secret war against IRA fundraising for four years, is considering options
based on legislation against organised crime in Italy and the US.
The recent armed raid on a Newry post office, in which IRA members acting
under orders from their local commander killed one man and stole Pounds
150,000, highlights how entangled terrorism and financial crime have become.
It is understood that the IRA leadership has privately indicated to Irish
officials that the money from the raid could be returned as a sign that
armed robberies have been discontinued to mark the organisation's commitment
to the peace process. But some IRA members who are less supportive of the
ceasefire process are concerned that the organisation is being financially
weakened.
The IRA's 'operational requirements' just before the ceasefire are thought
to have been running at about Pounds 3m a year, half the figure estimated in
the early 1990s.
It is thought that it is now using its funds for intelligence gathering and
to support members who remain fugitives from justice as well as families of
political prisoners. There is little evidence of big arms purchases.
The government claims success in cracking down on one of the main sources of
fund-raising for the IRA in recent years by closing numerous Belfast
drinking clubs associated with the paramilitaries and reopening them under
strict licences.
The NIO's finance unit claims to have found no evidence of companies being
used as IRA fronts, although such companies are widely believed to exist.
Officials remain anxious to control another traditional source of IRA
funding - from Irish-American supporters.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, announced plans in Washington this
week for Cairde Sinn Fein, a new fundraising organisation in the US on
behalf of the IRA's political arm. He pledged 'accountability and
transparency'.
Mr Adams is aware that Noraid, an organisation once stigmatised as the IRA's
main fundraising arm in the US, has openly defied a court order to file
regular reports with the US Justice Department.
The organisation's last filed accounts cover the 12 months to July 1991 and
involve claimed funds of Dollars 1.8m.
According to Department of Justice officials the last Northern Ireland group
to register a fundraising organisation was Mr John Hume's Social Democratic
and Labour party in March this year.
British officials have long suspected that funds raised on behalf of
republican prisoners in the US were being diverted to the IRA.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Company director jailed for canoe deaths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The managing director of a leisure company was yesterday jailed for three
years for the manslaughter of four teenagers who died on a canoe trip.
And in a landmark ruling his company was also found guilty of four charges
of manslaughter - the first time a company has been found guilty of such an
offence. Establishing that companies can be held criminally liable has
proved exceptionally difficult in the past.
Mr Peter Kite had denied the charges which arose from the trip organised by
an activity centre run by his company. The company - OLL, formerly Active
Learning and Leisure - also denied the charges and was fined Pounds 60,000.
The four school pupils died in Lyme Bay after setting out from Lyme Regis in
Dorset. They spent hours in the water when their drifting canoes were
swamped.
Sentencing Mr Kite, of Richmond, London, Mr Justice Ognall told Winchester
Crown Court that safety procedures at activity centres could not be 'left to
the inadequate vagaries of self-regulation' and called for an immediate and
thorough appraisal by the government.
He said his comments should be conveyed to Mrs Gillian Shephard, education
secretary, and Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, responsible for the
coastguards.
Mr Kite was found guilty by a majority after a 16-day trial. OLL was also
convicted on a majority verdict.
Mr Justice Ognall directed the jury to return not guilty verdicts for Mr
Joseph Stoddart, 53, the centre manager.
Mr Stoddart, of West Lulworth, Dorset, had denied the manslaughter of the
pupils from Southway School, Plymouth, Devon, on March 22 last year. The
judge told Mr Kite he had been found criminally responsible for the deaths
of Dean Sayer, Simon Dunne, Claire Langley and Rachel Walker - although he
had not intended harm to the victims.
But the judge, referring to a letter written by two former instructors
warning about safety standards at the centre, said Mr Kite had been given
notice in 'chilling, clear terms' of the risks he was running. 'That
forecast became a reality because of your complete failure to heed it.'
The judge said Mr Kite had a duty to put in place and enforce a system
designed to protect his charges from unnecessary risk. Mr Kite must have
known what was required of him.
He said: 'I regret to say it seems to me there is force in the suggestion
made - to a degree you were more interested in sales than in safety.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein names its Stormont delegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading republicans who were instrumental in persuading the IRA to
commit itself politically to the peace process lead the Sinn Fein delegation
attending today's talks with government officials at the former parliament
buildings in Stormont Castle.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, and Mr Gerry Kelly
have both served terrorist-related prison sentences. Mr McGuinness, an IRA
commander in Derry in the 1970s, was convicted in the Republic of Ireland
for being a member of the IRA. Mr Kelly was imprisoned for his part in an
IRA bombing campaign in Northern Ireland.
Although officially leading members of Sinn Fein, both retain strong links
with the IRA leadership.
In the past 18 months they have been involved as members of Sinn Fein in
secret contacts with both the Irish and British governments, preparing the
ground for the declaration of the IRA ceasefire at the end of August this
year.
The role of Mr McGuinness in tomorrow's talks - in the eyes of civil
servants - will be as a broker between the republican movement's politicians
and its hardline men-at-arms.
Mr Kelly, an active republican from the Belfast area, was involved in a mass
break-out from the Maze prison in 1983, and arrested three years later in
the Netherlands. He was extradited to the UK where he served the remainder
of a prison sentence related to terrorist offences.
The Sinn Fein delegation was selected after a period of intense discussions
in the republican movement, and in consultation with the IRA, where there is
some unease at the continuance of the ceasefire.
The delegation aims to be broadly representative of republican opinion.
Delegates have been drawn from a wide geographical area and there is a
strong presence of women.
Among the leading delegates is Ms Lucilita Breathnach, general secretary of
Sinn Fein since 1989. A polyglot, she is thought to be closely involved with
developing international contacts on behalf of the party.
Another is Ms Siobhan O'Hanlon, a member of the party's northern executive,
who works closely with Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, and will
report to him.
Mr Adams and other leading republicans plan to become involved in direct
talks with the British government early next year.
The fifth member of the Sinn Fein delegation is Mr Sean McManus, a former
chairman of Sinn Fein and a member of the party's national executive. He is
a district councillor in County Sligo, in the Republic of Ireland.
A sixth member of Sinn Fein is expected to attend to take notes.

FT  09 DEC 94 / TUC plea over deaths at work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new offence of 'manslaughter at work' should be created to target
negligent company executives responsible for workplace safety, the TUC urged
today.
More than 400 people die at work every year due to poor safety standards but
manslaughter charges are rare even when unions prove that an employer is
negligent, said the TUC.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'Prison should be the final
deterrent to careless, recalcitrant employers who cut corners for a quick
profit.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Ex-Nissan UK head loses case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday dismissed the application from Mr Michael Hunt,
the former managing director of Nissan UK, for leave to appeal against his
conviction for involvement in a Pounds 55m corporate tax fraud.
Mr Hunt was jailed for eight years in 1993 after being found guilty of the
biggest corporation tax fraud in UK history.
He lost his appeal against both conviction and sentence before the Court of
Appeal in May, but in July the Court of Appeal certified that the case
raised a point of law of general public importance enabling a petition to be
made to the law lords for leave to appeal.
The point of law concerned whether cheating the Inland Revenue was an
offence under common law.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Accounts partner quits over probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A partner with a London-based firm of accountants has left the business
following a probe into apparent financial irregularities, Jim Kelly writes.
Mr John Goldring, a partner with Casson Beckman, is well known in the music
industry, where many of his clients work. It is understood that the apparent
irregularities involve about Pounds 2m.
The executive chairman of Casson Beckman, Mr Geoff Barnes, said: 'We are all
extremely shocked at the circumstances which have led to the departure of
John Goldring. I have taken personal charge of this matter and will head the
dedicated special team which will continue to work hard and do everything it
can to resolve this matter as soon as possible.'
In a statement issued last night the firm said the departure had 'resulted
from on-going investigations carried out by the executive board and their
advisers into certain apparent financial irregularities concerning funds
over which John Goldring had control by virtue of personal appointments he
held in relation to certain clients'.
It added: 'As soon as Casson Beckman became aware of these matters a special
team was set up to investigate the full extent of these apparent
irregularities and the few affected clients have been contacted personally.
'The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has been
informed.'
Mr Goldring's lawyers, Jay Benning Levine &amp; Peltz, said that no statement
would be made on the matter.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Guardian journalist quits after KGB links alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior journalist on The Guardian newspaper, Mr Richard Gott, last night
resigned after The Spectator magazine accused him of once having close links
with the KGB.
In a resignation letter Mr Gott, a well known leftwing journalist and the
newspaper's literary editor, denied allegations in the right-of-centre
magazine that he had accepted money.
Mr Gott, best known for his coverage of Latin America, admitted however that
the Russians had paid for trips to Vienna, Athens and Nicosia to meet Soviet
representatives in the 1980s. The trips were apparently known to MI6.
In a letter printed in today's Guardian Mr Peter Preston, the paper's
editor, wrote that he accepted Mr Gott's resignation 'with the heaviest of
hearts' and said he hoped his distinctive voice would still be heard in the
paper in the future.
But of the trips Mr Preston said: 'I should have known. I should have been
told. You have resigned from the staff. That is accepted.'
The Spectator has used the information on Mr Gott for a broad attack on The
Guardian, set clearly in the context of the paper's coverage of unorthodox
behaviour by MPs. The front of this week's issue is dominated by part of a
Guardian front page on Mr Jonathan Aitken and the affair of the bill from
the Ritz hotel in Paris.
The Spectator also alleges that Mr Gott is only one of a list of British
citizens, some still in positions of authority, who are known by British
intelligence to have had connections with the KGB.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Life sales by phone 'would need discounts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Significant cuts in charges for life insurance would be needed before most
people would be prepared to buy policies over the telephone, according to a
survey conducted by MORI-On Line.
The poll found that 60 per cent of those questioned would be ready to buy a
Pounds 100-a-month premium life insurance or an investment policy premium on
the telephone if charges in the first year were 40 per cent less than they
would pay in buying from a sales agent face-to-face.
On average, only 11 per cent said they would be prepared to buy financial
services over the telephone without a discount. The range was from 15 per
cent for life insurance to 9 per cent for pensions and mortgages.
While life insurers are allowed to set their charges differently for various
ways of selling - for example through a direct sales force and through
independent advisers - they have shown little enthusiasm for doing so.
The danger for them is that if a customer can buy the same policy more
cheaply through a particular form of distribution, then the more expensive
one is undermined.
The survey showed that just over three-quarters of those questioned
preferred face-to-face contact with sales agents as a way of buying life
insurance.
Merchants, a financial services management consultancy which commissioned
the poll, highlighted the finding that 80 per cent of those questioned said
that the new regime for giving customers more information about policies -
including charges and commission levels - would make them shop around for
the lowest charge rates.
Answers to the previous question showed, however, that only about four in 10
of respondents were aware that the new requirements were coming into force.
MORI questioned 1,000 people by telephone in August.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Talks with loyalists start next Thursday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS, STEWART DALBY and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to start talks with loyalist representatives next Thursday
 -a year after the signing of the Downing Street declaration.
The announcement by Mr John Major came on the eve of historic talks in
Belfast between a government team led by Mr Quentin Thomas, number two in
the Northern Ireland Office, and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
The government is keeping open the option of upgrading the talks to
ministerial level at a later date.
It is hoped the dialogue will pave the way for both Sinn Fein and loyalist
representatives to join talks involving Northern Ireland's main
constitutional parties.
Yesterday's developments came amid mounting signs of a rapprochement between
the government and the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party.
A meeting on Tuesday between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary,
and a DUP delegation led by Mr Paisley is understood to have been viewed as
helpful by both sides.
Separately, Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, yesterday spoke out in
favour of the decision to invite some members of Sinn Fein to next week's
Belfast investment conference which is to be hosted by Mr Major.
Mr Brown, who is leading a US delegation to the conference, said he could
not conceive of 'a scenario that would bring peace and tranquility to
Northern Ireland that does not include Sinn Fein'.
Sinn Fein has not yet said whether it will attend the conference. It is
pushing for a more elevated representation in the form of Mr Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein president.
Mr Brown, dismissing the notion that there had been a poor response from US
business leaders, said there were no plans for the US to make a
public-sector contribution to infrastructure projects in the province.
Top of the government's agenda in talks with both Sinn Fein and loyalists
will be the decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals, which is seen as the
key to the two sides' participation in future political talks.
The prospects of making progress on this issue may have been complicated by
the power vacuum in Dublin, however. It is understood that before the
political crisis IRA leaders indicated to the Irish government that they
would be willing to identify some arms caches in the south in return for
British concessions on troop levels and IRA prisoners.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Rule on pensions solvency diluted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday confirmed that the UK's biggest occupational
pension schemes will have to meet a significantly weaker minimum solvency
requirement than was initially proposed, when new pensions legislation is
introduced next week.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced details of some of the
thorniest issues raised by the legislation in response to a parliamentary
question.
The government has been under heavy pressure from employers' groups to ease
a solvency requirement that many feared would force them to sell equities -
which have historically offered higher returns - from their pension funds
and buy gilts, which have lower, though more predictable, total returns.
They said such a requirement could have forced employers to put more cash
into their schemes.
Details of the government's plans to significantly weaken some elements of
proposals contained in a June white paper have been circulating in the
pensions industry for several weeks.
Mr Lilley said schemes with assets of Pounds 100m or more would be allowed
to hold equities in respect of about 25 per cent of their current pension
liabilities. At present, the actuarial profession considers it imprudent to
hold assets other than gilts against pension liabilities.
Also, employers with schemes falling short of the minimum solvency
requirement will have more time than originally planned to make up the
shortfall.
Schemes with assets covering less than 90 per cent of liabilities will have
a year to make up the shortfall, instead of three months as planned. Schemes
with between 90 per cent and 100 per cent cover will have up to five years
to regain full solvency.
Mr Lilley also outlined how new age-related rebates on national insurance
contributions will work.
Currently there is a flat-rate rebate for all those contracting out of the
state earnings related pension scheme through personal pensions and
occupational money purchase schemes, giving much more generous tax breaks to
young people but encouraging them to opt back into Serps as they age.
Mr Lilley said that because the provision of age-related rebates for those
currently nearing retirement age would be very expensive, the rebate would
be limited to 9 per cent of relevant earnings.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications faces unofficial walk-outs and a demonstration in
London today by managerial and professional staff in protest over a briefing
on their pay prospects for next year.
BT told the Society of Telecom Executives it intended to differentiate
between skills and jobs principally in the light of the external market,
rather than traditional internal relativities. Pay would be linked to
performance.
The society said this stance threatened to drive down pay and did nothing to
redress the effects of the pay freeze imposed this year. The next pay
agreement starts in April.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Medical Association leaders yesterday sought a meeting with Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, in an effort to avert a dispute over
performance-related pay.
Leaders of hospital consultants have prepared plans for sanctions if the
government tries to implement a shift from national pay arrangements without
agreement.
After a meeting of the BMA's consultants' committee yesterday Mr Jim

FT  09 DEC 94 / Germans may rethink Thorp deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German electricity companies were yesterday considering formal proposals
from BNFL, the UK reprocessing company, which will give them the option of
taking back up to 1,400 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel they are due to start
sending to the UK next year.
Under the terms of a Pounds 900m contract BNFL is not due to start
reprocessing the fuel until 2005. The contract, drawn up in 1989, makes no
mention of what would happen if the Germans wanted the fuel back unprocessed
before then.
Although the German companies intend to go ahead with reprocessing, they are
concerned that political pressures will force a rethink.
Environmentalists - a strong political lobby in Germany - are concerned
about reprocessing in the UK since the terms of the contract require the
German companies to take back the plutonium and waste material after
reprocessing.
The issue has been under discussion between BNFL and the utilities since
October. The Germans have been engaged in similar discussions with Cogema,
the French reprocessing company which has a contract to take other spent
fuel.
BNFL was yesterday unable to disclose the details of its proposals, which it
sent to Germany earlier this week. It is thought, however, that it will
agree to sending back spent fuel unreprocessed if requested, providing the
Germans agree a substantial cancellation fee.
BNFL will want compensation for the costs of transporting the spent fuel to
the UK, of storing it and of conditioning it for transportation back to
Germany.
The contract is the second negotiated between BNFL and the German utilities.
Spent fuel in the first contract is already being reprocessed.
It forms part of the 'base load' of fuel which is being reprocessed in the
first 10 years of Thorp's existence. BNFL says the base load, which includes
spent fuel from Japan and the UK, will pay for the building and
decommissioning of the Pounds 2.8bn plant and provide a Pounds 500m profit.
This is disputed by environmentalists. Thorp has been the subject of
considerable con-troversy for more than a decade.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Further rates rise warning by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday indicated
that further interest rate rises might be necessary to control inflation,
although he said he hoped rates would plateau 'fairly soon'.
The governor said it was too early to say whether Wednesday's half
percentage point increase in bank base rates to 6.25 per cent was enough to
curb inflation and whether the interest rate plateau would be established at
that level or higher. But because the authorities had acted early, the
interest rate peak would be lower than before.
Mr George said in evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee that he had initiated Wednesday's base rate rise. He recommended a
rise to the chancellor because of above-trend growth in the economy and
growing inflationary pressures.
He said: 'From my point of view, politics were irrelevant.' He conceded that
the government's Tuesday night defeat over value added tax on domestic fuel
might have influenced the readiness of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to
agree to the rate increase.
Mr George said that he asked the chancellor's office, before Tuesday's vote,
for Wednesday's meeting to be brought forward to 8.45am from the 9.30 time
originally scheduled.
This was a 'contingency' measure. The governor knew he would advise a rate
rise and, in the event of the chancellor agreeing, he wanted time to inform
the financial markets before that day's gilts auction.
The chancellor's office returned his call after the vote and agreed the new
time for the meeting.
Mr George pushed aside suggestions that the rate increase was politically
motivated. He said the bank had come close to recommending a rate increase a
month earlier at the November meeting between governor and chancellor. Mr
Clarke did not refer to the vote against the government in the meeting on
Wednesday, he added.
The governor firmly rejected any suggestion that the minutes of his monthly
meetings with the chancellor were doctored.
Mr George added his voice to a warning given earlier this week by Mr Alan
Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, about the risks of future tax
cuts.
These, he said, could be justified only if the productive growth of the
economy increased. Inappropriate tax cuts that encouraged inflation would
lead to higher interest rates, he said.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Operators find little waiting involved with London buses:
The Pounds 16.3m sale which completes disposal of the network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten in the space of just nine months. The bus passenger resigned to a long
wait for the arrival of his local service would be impressed with the speed
with which London Transport has sold off its bus companies.
Yesterday's sale of South London Transport for Pounds 16.3m to Cowie
completed the disposal of London's red bus network to a range of private
operators and buy-out teams.
London travellers will have to come to terms with a number of competing
liveries in the coming months. Only in the centre of town will operators be
obliged to keep their buses mainly red.
The acquisition of South London makes Cowie - a company with car leasing and
motor trading activities as well as bus and coach operations - the biggest
bus company in the London area. It owns Leaside Bus, bought from London
Transport for Pounds 29.9m in September, and Grey-Green, a coach and bus
business.
South London brings the total proceeds of the bus company sales to Pounds
233m, more than twice the figure initially pencilled in. London Transport
will keep the first Pounds 100m and 25 per cent of the remainder to spend
mainly on its cash-strapped Underground.
Six of the London bus companies went to established bus operators but, in
line with the government's wish to promote management-employee buy-outs,
four of the companies have been acquired by management-employee teams.
The speed of the sales and the prices at which deals were struck should
provide some compensation for the embarrassing climbdown forced on the
government over its plans to fully deregulate London's buses. This idea was
scrapped just over a year ago because of its unpopularity with government
backbenchers and local councillors.
Deregulation would have allowed a number of operators to run buses on a
route. This has led to fierce price wars in many provincial cities.
The privately-owned companies which have taken control in London will run
fully commercial services on most routes while a minority of unprofitable
but socially desirable routes will continue to be run with the help of
subsidies.
The attractions of the London bus companies are that they allow existing
operators to spread their overheads over a bigger operation while
negotiating better terms when it comes to renewing their bus fleets.
Operators also see the opportunity to cut the fat out of organisations
previously in the public sector.
The buy-out teams believe they can manage more effectively free from central
control.
Bus use across the UK has been in decline for many years but it is a cash
business with many passengers paying in advance for season tickets. Revenues
can be forecast with a fair degree of accuracy.
And the future for buses may be brighter. Increased congestion is likely to
lead to a spread of traffic control measures such as London's 'red routes',
which cut bus journey times.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Fifty in actions against Hoover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty dissatisfied customers yesterday started court proceedings against
Hoover, the electrical group, over the company's free flights offer.
Solicitors dealing with the cases, Merseyside-based firm J. Keith Park, said
it had a further 8,000 files in hand.
The promotion, which started in 1992, offered customers two free flights to
continental Europe or the US if at least Pounds 100 was spent on a Hoover
product. The company was overwhelmed by demand and thousands of customers
complained.
Maytag, Hoover's US parent company, said earlier this year that the
promotion had cost more than Pounds 48m to fulfil. About 220,000 people have
flown using the offer, but several thousand still say they are owed flights.
Yesterday's proceedings, in the small claims division of St Helens county
court, Merseyside, are for claims averaging about Pounds 1,000, plus costs,
said J. Keith Park.
The Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, representing claimants, said it believed
90 cases had already been brought to small claims courts, mainly by
unrepresented individuals. Hoover had won 68 of these cases.
Mr Harry Cichy, group founder, said the latest batch of 50 cases was 'the
start of many' and the group hoped to go ahead with High Court action. He
added: 'We don't want this to go on for ever. We want to try to negotiate a
settlement with them (Hoover) but they don't seem to want to.
'People who failed to get flights are still as determined as ever to get
justice and a fair deal.'
Hoover said yesterday that it had offered flights to everyone who was
entitled to them and would continue to defend cases where it considered it
had fulfilled its obligations.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: All-Americas free trade zone 'by 2006'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of 34 countries in the western hemisphere are expected to agree
plans to create a free trade area from Alaska to Cape Horn by 2006 during
the three-day Americas summit which starts today in Miami.
Just a week ago it seemed likely that no date would be set for completing
negotiations on setting up the free trade zone, but, barring any last-minute
veto when the leaders discuss trade tomorrow morning, a 2005 deadline for
agreement will be included in the summit declaration on Sunday.
A draft summit declaration calls for 'the conclusion of negotiations on the
Americas Free Trade Area no later than the year 2005' and for 'concrete
progress towards attainment of this objective by the end of this century'.
President Carlos Menem of Argentina said yesterday the next 12 years would
see further hemispheric summits to follow up the decisions made in Miami so
that a free trade zone came into effect by 2006.
US officials said the summit would lay down a schedule of official and
ministerial meetings to begin work immediately on the progressive
elimination of barriers to trade and investment, as well as a substantial
work programme for the Organisation of American States and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
The draft declaration says that free trade and greater economic integration
are key factors in raising living standards, improving working conditions
and protecting the environment.
While some countries had been reluctant to pin down a year, others, led by
Argentina, argued that it would be a severe setback if the Americas summit
were unable to agree on a date, when leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum last month had accepted a target date of 2020 for
establishing a free trade zone in the Pacific.
Argentina wanted the Americas Free Trade Area to be established by 2001, but
other countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, had resisted such an ambitious
target. Mr Menem said the best way to hemispheric integration was initially
to cement regional trade groupings, such as Mercosur - which groups
Argentina with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. However, progress towards the
final goal depended on the speed with which the North American Free Trade
Agreement could be extended - and that largely hung on the disposition of
the US Congress.
The declaration of an Americas Free Trade Area is expected to be accompanied
by the announcement that Chile will be invited to begin negotiations early
next year on joining the US, Canada and Mexico in the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said: 'I think we have to take
a lead. If we don't work with our hemispheric partners in building this
relationship on trade with the Americas, then we're going to find that the
Japanese and the Europeans are going to work to be their partners.'
The Miami summit is the first western hemisphere summit to be hosted by the
US - something that would have been difficult in earlier decades when the US
was viewed as a domineering imperial power by many Latin American countries.
Unlike previous regional summits in Panama in 1956 and in Uruguay in 1967,
this summit will be attended only by popularly elected leaders. The only
country not to be invited is Cuba.

The future of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a grouping
of 22 states committed to lowering regional trade barriers, has been thrown
into jeopardy by the reluctance of countries of the Southern African
Development Community, most them also part of Comesa, to give primary
allegiance to Comesa. Comesa, which aims to create a common market
throughout the region, was due to be officially launched in Lilongwe,
Malawi, yesterday, but proceedings were delayed by calls from southern
African countries for the body to be split into northern and southern
sub-regions.
Many members of SADC, which comprises South Africa, Tanzania, Malawi,
Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique, would prefer to focus on removing economic barriers in the
smaller body first rather than trying to pursue the more impracticable goals
promoted by Comesa. A joint SADC/Comesa summit to discuss the issue is
likely to be called soon, but analysts see little likelihood of Comesa
getting off the ground in the near future. 'Liberalising trade within SADC
is not particularly feasible in the short term, let alone co-ordinating
trade policy in 22 countries,' notes one regional analyst.

GPT, the UK-based telecommunications equipment maker, has been awarded a
Pounds 50m contract to modernise Moscow's telephone network. It is the
largest individual overseas order for System X, the GPT-designed exchange
which is at the heart of British Telecommunications' UK network, according
to Mr Piers Cumberledge, GPT sales director with responsibility for the
former Soviet Union. He said GPT would install System X exchanges and up to
170,000 digital subscriber lines over two years starting immediately.
The company, owned by GEC of the UK and Siemens of Germany, would also
supply and install fibre optic equipment, smart card payphones and
videoconferencing equipment. GPT's contract is with Comstar, a private
Moscow company formed in 1989 by GPT and the Moscow Telephone Network which
already offers customers in Moscow international, national and local
telephone services. Mr Cumberledge said contract negotiations had been
lengthy; the company had held back from announcing the deal until financing
was in place. Loan finance, denominated in dollars, will come from Midland
Bank backed by the UK Export Credit Guarantee Department. The Russian state
had agreed an inter-government credit to repay the loan in hard currency,
the first time such a mechanism had been used in Russia with a private
company as beneficiary.

chairman of Daimler Benz. The German company, in partnership with Ghabbour
Group, the Egyptian motor group, will produce 7,000 trucks and 600 buses a
year from a purpose-built plant at New Salheya outside Cairo. Assembly will
begin with 20 per cent locally-made components, rising to 40 per cent after
four years, Mr Reuter said. Mr Reuter said he was confident that manufacture
of Mercedes Benz cars in Egypt would follow soon. The truck and bus
enterprise will create 1,000 jobs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's campaign to re-establish itself as a trustworthy trading partner
was boosted yesterday with the underwriting of a Dollars 9.5m buyer credit
by Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department, the biggest such deal since
ECGD cover was restored in June 1993. The approval by the ECGD, which
suspended cover after the Falklands conflict in 1982, will be seen by
Argentina as a significant step towards repairing its damaged international
image. In spite of the ending of hyperinflation and the unleashing of very
fast growth rates, Argentina has not yet entirely overcome its past
reputation, tarnished by military governments and virtual economic collapse.
The ECGD decision follows the successful bid by Babcock International of the
UK to supply computer-controlled inspection equipment to the Atucha II
nuclear power station being built 70 miles north-west of Buenos Aires.
Although ECGD premiums to Argentina were reduced by Britain last December,
UK businessmen in Buenos Aires complain that the country-risk premium is
still too high, given Argentina's recent solid economic performance. Mr
Nicolas Grose-Hodge, president of the Argentine-British Chamber of Commerce,
believes British companies may have lost millions of pounds worth of
business because high ECGD premiums have rendered bids uncompetitive.

The growth rate of world trade in goods is expected to double this year to
around 7 per cent from 3.5 per cent in 1993, according to Gatt economists,
The increase reflects economic recovery around the world, especially in the
European Union and Japan. Giving these preliminary estimates, Mr Andras
Szepesi, chairman of Gatt's contracting parties (members), told the Gatt
annual meeting that significant cuts in trade barriers negotiated in the
Uruguay Round would give the international trading environment a new
dynamism and vitality. However, in a reflection of widespread concern among
Gatt members, he said more attention should be paid to scrutiny of regional
trading arrangements and called for a review of the Gatt working party
system which will be carried over into the World Trade Organisation. More
than 50 working parties have failed to agree on whether individual free
trade pacts are consistent with Gatt.

China has become one of the world's greatest consumers of expensive French
cognac, luxury liquor company Remy Cointreau said yesterday. Managing
director Patrick Bompoint, whose company produces champagne and speciality
liqueurs, said Remy Cointreau was selling more than FFr1bn (Dollars 190m) of
liquor to China each year. Speaking at an informal meeting of bank, stock
market and business officials hosted by Paribas Luxembourg, Mr Bompoint said
Russia ranked second, after China, in sales for his company. In 1988, the US
held top position for expensive liquor sales, and China and Russia did not
even appear in the top eight. The Pacific area, including Japan, Hong Kong
and Australia, accounts for 34 per cent of Remy-Cointreau's worldwide sales.

US software giant Microsoft signed an agreement yesterday with China to
create a new standard for Chinese personal computer operating systems.
Microsoft signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of
Electronics Industry to create the standard by developing and delivering a
Chinese version of Microsoft's operating system, Windows 95, in partnership
with Chinese companies.
The new operating system will accelerate the growth of personal computing in
China by making PCs easier to use and by providing a new generation of
Chinese software applications, Mr Charles Stevens, vice president for the
Far East region of Microsoft, said. The Chinese version of Windows 95 - the
next generation of its flagship Windows due for release next year - will be
fully compatible with Microsoft's worldwide Windows product engineering and
design. Beijing regulators had refused to accept the Chinese version of
Windows as a standard for China after Microsoft alienated electronics
ministry officials by developing the mainland version, nicknamed P-WIn, not
in China but in Taiwan, which uses a different form of Chinese characters
and dissimilar methods of keyboard entry.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Disputes mar launch of WTO - Inauspicious
start for new, more powerful, international trade body
</HEADLINE>

Trade envoys from more than 120 nations yesterday gave their formal blessing
to the creation of the World Trade Organisation on January 1, following
ratification of the Uruguay Round trade agreements by 50 countries. Mr Peter
Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
said at least 100 nations were expected to be members of the WTO on its
starting date.
But the launch celebrations for the new world trade body, which will have
much wider powers than Gatt to police fair trade rules and settle disputes,
were muted by continued uncertainty over choosing the head of the WTO and
over whether China will succeed in its attempt to become a founder member.
Trade diplomats said yesterday that the continued stalemate in the three-way
contest for the WTO top job made a decision before the end of the year
improbable. It now looks virtually certain that Mr Sutherland will be asked
to stay on in a caretaker role until his successor is chosen.
Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, the European Union candidate, is said to be
well ahead of the field, with over half Gatt's 124 members in his favour.
But he is far from mobilising the necessary consensus.
Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is supported by the US and Latin America,
has only just begun his campaign after leaving office as Mexican president
at the beginning of this month. Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea, with Japan
and most of Asia behind him, is also proving a more formidable candidate
than expected.
Meanwhile, intensive negotiations this month in Geneva on China's bid to
join Gatt and the WTO have made little headway. 'The Chinese are still
playing hardball,' Mr Andrew Stoler, deputy US Gatt ambassador, said
yesterday, commenting on four days of bilateral talks between China and the
US.
Mr Hugo Paemen, the EU's top trade negotiator, said China's membership
negotiations 'are not in good shape at the moment'.
Beijing, which wants WTO founder-member status, is insisting that
substantive talks must be completed before the end of the year, after which
it will make no more trade concessions.
However, the US and other western nations argue that China still appears
unprepared to accept fully the fair trading rules that are a condition for
Gatt and WTO membership, and has failed to offer sufficient access to its
domestic market for foreign goods and services.
Apart from the January 1 starting date, the WTO implementation conference
yesterday agreed that countries would continue to apply Gatt rules to
non-WTO members for a further year. Because of the lengthy fact-finding
procedures involved, complaints can be brought under Gatt's anti-dumping and
anti-subsidies codes for another two years.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU turns Mideast commercial matchmaker -
Mark Nicholson watched a 'dating agency' for Arab and Israeli businesses in
action in Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 1,000 small and medium-sized European and Middle Eastern companies
yesterday wound up a three-day commercial matchmaking forum sponsored by the
European Union to promote European-Middle Eastern business ties, and
cross-border alliances within the region itself.
It was the first time Israeli and Arab businesses had met openly to discuss
business deals on such a scale, and it was hailed by organisers and
participants alike yesterday as a success.
'The important thing was how completely normal it was to see Israeli and
Arab businessmen dealing with each other,' said Ms Anahid Harrison, the
project's co-ordinator. 'There was no sense of strangeness.'
The companies, embracing construction, tourism, electrical, electronic,
textiles, engineering and other industries, were brought together for 10,500
face-to-face meetings after being matched by the computerised equivalent of
a corporate dating agency.
The event was the first of a seven-year-old EU programme, known as
Europartenariat, to be held outside Europe. It was designed, according to Mr
Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, EU commissioner for internal markets, to
translate Israel's peace accords with Jordan and the Palestinians into
'practical programmes for economic development'. EU officials said they
hoped to repeat the event every two years.
Extrapolating from the results of previous Europartenariat events,
organisers say up to 40 per cent of the thousands of direct meetings result
in long-term business alliances or joint ventures. In an informal poll,
participants said they believed well over half their meetings would result
in future business co-operation.
On that basis, and judging from the enthusiastic reports of many Arab and -
particularly - Israeli businesses, the event is likely to have given the
most tangible nudge yet to Israeli-Arab commercial co-operation. 'The main
interest for Israeli companies has been to meet possible partners in the
region - for Israeli business there's no problem for them meeting European
partners. We're here to meet the Egyptians and Jordanians,' said Mr Michael
Admon of the Israel Export Institute.
Although Syria and Lebanon boycotted the meeting - as they have all
multilateral events involving Israel in the absence of their own peace
accords with the Jewish state - more than 540 Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian
and Jordanian businesses participated, alongside more than 400 European
companies.
Several Middle Eastern businessmen expressed disappointment at the quality
and representation of European companies at the meeting, the bulk of which
were from Germany, France, Italy and Belgium. 'Most of them are just here to
find ways of selling their products,' said one Jordanian businessman.
'The most activity was among Middle Eastern companies doing deals with each
other,' said Mr Wael Amin, manager of PIE, one of Egypt's biggest software
companies, who said he expected to enter agreements with Israeli partners to
develop and market Arabic software to the Gulf states. 'It's still a bit
premature for the Europeans to be treating the Middle East as a unified
market.'
Many Arab participants expressed surprise at how straightforward and
politically uncomplicated it proved to deal with their Israeli counterparts.
'I was expecting a wall as high as the ceiling,' said one Jordanian hotelier
after meetings with Jewish travel agents. 'I found I just had to step over a
little 10cm barrier.'
But there was also evidence that not all political barriers in the region
have quite vanished. A 38-strong Israeli dance troupe due to perform at a
gala soiree during the event, for instance, unaccountably failed to receive
visas from the Egyptian authorities.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Banks step up sale of Orange County holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A number of US investment banks yesterday stepped up their fire-sale of
Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.7bn) worth of bonds they hold as security against
loans made to Orange County, the affluent southern Californian local
authority that filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday.
The sales seemed set to provoke a legal battle between the county and Wall
Street, and added to pressure on US bond and equity markets yesterday
afternoon.
Among the banks which yesterday said they had sold bonds was Morgan Stanley,
which had held Dollars 1.6bn of bonds. Prudential Securities, which is said
to have held more than Dollars 1bn, was also widely believed to have been a
seller, although the bank would not confirm this.
The sales are thought to have brought to about Dollars 7bn the amount of the
county's bond holdings which have been sold in the past two days.
The liquidation of Orange County's huge bond holding looks set to force the
authority to absorb a large portion of the Dollars 1.5bn of losses it is
estimated to have suffered in the bond markets this year.
The county filed for bankruptcy to preserve its shrinking cash reserves and
protect itself from a forced sale of bonds. It was believed to be preparing
an emergency court action late yesterday to stem the sale of bonds. Lawyers
for the authority have argued that the banks are prevented by its bankruptcy
filing from selling securities.
Ms Kathleen Brown, California's treasurer, said the state would not provide
financial support to help the county. Faced with the need for cash to pay
for public services, Orange County could be forced to liquidate more of its
bond holdings.
Financial markets were also unnerved by rumours that other funds may be
concealing huge losses.
San Diego County, also in California, said it had paper losses of Dollars
357m on a fund worth Dollars 3.3bn, largely because of derivative holdings.
Meanwhile, Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which is investigating Orange County's investments, said that
better disclosure might have brought the problems to light earlier.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Art meets gambling - jackpots all round: A Canadian success
story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many eyebrows were raised last year when the province of Ontario picked an
art gallery in Windsor - a drab, motor industry city just across the US
border from Detroit - as the site of the first casino in Canada's industrial
heartland.
Art patrons were aghast that the gallery, a beacon of culture in a city
dominated by car plants, had agreed to move to the windowless bowels of a
suburban shopping mall. In contrast to the handsome riverfront property
which it occupied for 20 years, the gallery now abuts a bargain department
store.
For their part, the casino's operators were not sure whether the gallery's
red-brick building, which started life as a brewery, suited their purposes.
About CDollars 25m (Pounds 11m) was spent to convert the building into a
casino by, for among other things, installing a large staircase and a
spacious foyer.
But the partnership between gambling and culture is turning out to be a huge
 -and highly profitable - success for both the casino and the art gallery.
The casino, owned by the province but managed by a consortium of US casino
operators, opened last May. With revenues reaching CDollars 46m in October
and expected to total CDollars 350m-CDollars 450m for the first full year of
operation, it claims to be the most profitable casino per square foot in the
world.
'Some casinos would be pleased to have some of our worst days as some of
their best days,' says Mr John O'Brien, president of Windsor Casino, the
operating company owned by Hilton Hotels, Caesar's Palace and Circus-Circus.
Meanwhile, the move to the Devonshire Mall has invigorated the art gallery.
'We're a business,' says Ms Nataley Nagy, the gallery's lively director.
'The time has come for museums to show a little muscle, and this was an
opportunity for us to do that.'
According to Ms Nagy, 'The product remains the same, but we're looking at
different ways to deliver it.' For instance, the gallery is putting bigger
labels on its displays to appeal to a less high-brow mix of visitors.
Attendance has shot up by a third since the gallery opened in its new
premises a year ago. Gifts of paintings and sculptures are at record levels.
The richest irony is that the gallery may have a more secure future than the
casino.
Although the Windsor casino is the first in Ontario, it is just one of
dozens that have sprouted across North America in the past two to three
years. Deficit-strapped regional governments and impoverished Indian
communities have discovered gambling as a rich source of tax revenues.
Ontario and the US states close to Windsor have so far been slow to join the
stampede. With the closest casino about 400 miles away, Mr O'Brien estimates
that about 80 per cent of the money wagered at the Windsor casino's 1,740
slot machines and 68 tables comes from US gamblers.
The neighbouring state of Michigan has so far resisted pressure to reverse
its ban on gambling. But the tide may be overwhelming. After turning down
four previous proposals to legalise casinos, Detroit residents voted in
favour last August.
A month later, the state governor set up a commission to examine the issue
further. Its report is expected early next year. 'Every gaming interest has
a lobbyist in town,' says an official in the governor's office.
Similarly, Ontario - whose social democratic government came to office four
years ago promising to maintain a ban on gambling - agreed this week to
allow an Indian community north of Toronto to build the province's second
casino and is considering bids for casinos in several other cities.
Revenue Properties, a Canadian developer, announced last week that it was
setting up a division to invest in the gambling business.
'The market is large enough to support several casinos in the area,' Mr
O'Brien says. The one challenge is that 'we may have to work a bit harder
and spend a few more dollars from a marketing standpoint.'
Mr O'Brien hopes that Windsor's reputation as a safer city than Detroit and
US visitors' ability to stretch their dollars by gambling in Canadian
currency will keep the crowds coming. On the other hand, some gamblers
grouse about Canada's strict drinking laws, which bar casinos from serving
free drinks at the slot machines and baccarat tables.
However, the Windsor partners are confident enough about the future to plan
to begin construction next spring on a permanent CDollars 375m casino six
blocks east of the art gallery.
The art gallery will probably return to the riverfront property once the
casino moves into its own home. It will return in much better shape than it
left. The province will pay to convert the building back into an art
gallery. Rent paid by the casino during its three-year lease is expected to
provide a CDollars 4m nest egg.
The gallery's president, Mr Ron Ianni, wrote to donors recently that the
dalliance with the casino 'was a unique opportunity for us to build an
endowment fund which . . . we never could have managed, even in 50 years of
fund-raising.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Chiapas governor takes office

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eduardo Robledo was sworn in as the new governor of the troubled southern
Mexican state of Chiapas yesterday, despite threats by armed rebels there to
renew their attacks.
In a ceremony protected by more than a thousand soldiers and plain-clothes
police, and attended by the new Mexican president, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the
governor offered to resign, 'if that meant the Zapatistas putting down their
arms'.
A tense truce between the government and the Zapatista rebels has held in
Chiapas since January 12 after several days of fighting had killed more than
150 people. The rebels launched their rebellion on January 1, demanding more
scope for indigenous peoples in the state and greater democracy. They claim
Mr Robledo, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), won
August's gubernatorial election by fraud.
Despite Mr Robledo's offer, the Zapatistas show no sign of giving up their
struggle. The masked rebel leader known as Sub-commandante Marcos said late
on Tuesday his forces 'recognised Robledo's swearing-in as the formal
rupturing of the ceasefire by the federal government'.
In a speech immediately following Mr Robledo's inauguration, Mr Zedillo said
the government's unilateral ceasefire would remain intact. The president
also called for renewed negotiations between the federal government and the
Zapatistas. This call was rejected by the rebels, who say Mr Robledo's
resignation is a precondition of negotiations.
The governor's offer to resign is not seen as a real option for the PRI
because, if he were to quit, that would be taken as a precedent for other
elected PRI officials in Mexico, many of whom are also accused of fraud at
the polls.
Soon after Mr Robledo was sworn in, Mr Amado Avendano, who ran for the
governorship for the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary party, also
took an oath of office before thousands of peasant supporters in the central
square of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
Mr Avendano, who has the backing of the Zapatistas and claims electoral
fraud cheated him of office, said he would set up a parallel government in
the nearby city of San Cristobal de las Casas. His supporters say they will
pay no taxes to the Robledo government and will continue their civil
disobedience.
Officials say they will tacitly recognise Mr Avendano's role in the hope of
maintaining peace in the state and reopening negotiations with the
Zapatistas.

<TEXT>
Some 100 Cubans were still at large last night after about 1,000 inmates had
fled a US-run refugee camp in Panama yesterday. Most were recaptured hours
after they had run out of the camp, having torn down a barbed wire fence.
Some 60 US soldiers guarding the camp were injured - but none seriously - as
inmates rioted, US military officials in Panama City said.
Cubans had attacked US soldiers in stone-throwing protests on Wednesday and
yesterday.
The refugees were taken to Panama after being picked up by the US Coast
Guard during the summer, while fleeing their country by sea on flimsy craft.
They have protested at what they call the slow rate of transfers from the
camps to the US and other countries. There are nearly 9,000 Cuban refugees
at four camps near the Panama Canal.

Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr has notified Mr James McDougal, a former
business partner of President Bill Clinton, that Mr McDougal is a target in
the Whitewater investigation, the latter's lawyer said yesterday.
'Responding to my inquiries, Mr Starr has informed us that Jim (McDougal)
is, in fact, a target,' said the lawyer, Mr Sam Heuer. He said that Mr Starr
had informed him in a letter of his wish to interview Mr McDougal as part of
his probe of Whitewater.
Mr McDougal was the partner of Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary in the
Whitewater vacation real estate venture, in which the Clintons say they lost
Dollars 69,000 before Mr Clinton became president.
Mr McDougal also controlled Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the failed
savings bank seized by US regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of more
than Dollars 60m.
Mr Starr is investigating whether depositors' funds were improperly used to
keep the Whitewater resort solvent or improperly channelled to back one of
Mr Clinton's Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns.

The CIA has agreed to settle charges of sex discrimination by one of the
agency's senior female spies in a deal valued at Dollars 410,000 (Pounds
262,800) by the spy's attorney. The complaint, filed under seal in federal
court in August by 'Jane Doe Thompson', a pseudonym for the female CIA
employee, portrayed the agency as rife with womanisers and drinking and
generally hostile to women. Mr James Woolsey, CIA director, said in a
statement that he agreed to settle the case, but that the organisation 'does
not concede the assertions of gender discrimination Ms Thompson has made
against the agency or its individual officers'.
Ms Victoria Toensing, Ms Thompson's attorney and a former Justice Department
official, said the lawsuit alleged both sex discrimination and violations of
Ms Thompson's constitutional rights. Ms Thompson has been identified by
numerous press reports as Ms Janine Brookner, the first female CIA station
chief in Latin America and a 21-year veteran of the agency. The reports said
her ordeal began when she was sent to clean up the agency's operation in
Jamaica.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Crisis in Orange County rebounds on bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
said yesterday the financial crisis in Orange County, California, was
'significant' for investors and the market, and conceded that better
disclosure might have brought it to light sooner.
Fears the county may be forced to liquidate its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.8bn)
fund portfolio have caused sharp widening of credit spreads in US domestic
and Eurodollar bond markets.
Orange County filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday after being hit by a loss of
Dollars 1.5bn from dealings in the bond market. This has fuelled speculation
that it will be forced to sell much of its Dollars 7.5bn portfolio of bonds,
triggering a flood on to the world's markets and suppressing prices.
These fears sent spreads - the difference in the yield on agency and
corporate bonds and that on US Treasury bonds - significantly wider as the
price of US corporate and agency bonds fell relative to the higher credit
rated US Treasury bonds.
The widening was initially more pronounced in the US domestic market but the
nervousness spread to the Eurobond market yesterday, where spreads widened
by about 5 to 10 basis points.
Orange County's portfolio consists mainly of municipal and agency bonds, and
the spreads on these instruments were hit hardest. 'There was a flight to
quality and this put pressure on spreads,' said one bond trader in London.
The market was also unnerved by rumours that other municipal funds might be
concealing huge losses.
San Diego County, also in California, said it had paper losses of Dollars
357m on a fund worth Dollars 3.3bn, largely because of its holdings of
derivatives. Mr Paul Boland, county treasurer, was quoted as dismissing
comparisons with Orange County, saying his fund was not leveraged and had no
liquidity problems.
Mr Levitt said the SEC had been monitoring Orange County before the crisis
erupted there, and was watching other unspecified investment pools across
the country. 'I would hope the balanced, calm approach to Orange County on
the part of all participants will continue,' he said.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Falkland fishing rights talks stall
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between Britain and Argentina over fishing rights around the disputed
Falkland islands have temporarily broken down after the two sides failed to
agree on catch quotas.
Although a joint official statement maintained that talks held in Buenos
Aires had been 'cordial', the two sides remain far apart. Argentina, which
still claims sovereignty over the South Atlantic islands despite its defeat
by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict, has previously co-operated over
the setting of fishing limits.
Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina's deputy foreign minister, yesterday denied
reports that Buenos Aires had unilaterally declared a quota of 220,000
tonnes, but confirmed it 'believes there is no problem aiming for the
maximum catch possible'.
He said scientific reports indicated that levels of fish around the islands
were such that there was no need to repeat last year's bilateral agreement,
in which the Argentines and Falkland islanders agreed to limit their catch
as 'the resource was becoming scanty'.
The British government is likely to consider provocative a statement by Mr
Guido di Tella, foreign minister, late on Wednesday night. He said: 'Last
year we did not catch (our full quota of) 220,000 tonnes, but this year we
will do so because our scientific information indicates that this will not
affect the biomass.'
Both governments are insisting talks will be reconvened before the fishing
season begins early next year.

Antonio Carlos Jobim, the founding father of Brazil's bossa nova music who
composed The Girl From Ipanema, died of heart failure yesterday in a New
York hospital. He was 67. Jobim, Brazil's most prominent songwriter and
composer, burst on to the international music scene with the bossa nova
sound in the early 1960s. The Girl From Ipanema earned him and the late US
jazz saxophonist Stan Getz four Grammy awards.
Bossa nova's distinctive rhythms and catchy melodies became a musical craze
around the world and influenced jazz and popular music for years. Apart from
Getz, Jobim recorded with such stars as Frank Sinatra and British singer
Sting.

<TEXT>
Mr Edward Madigan, former secretary of agriculture and a nine-term US
congressman from central Illinois, died on Wednesday, aged 58. He was
diagnosed as having lung cancer earlier this year and was admitted to
hospital last week. Mr Madigan, a moderate Republican from Lincoln, was
elected to the House in 1972 but lost his bid in 1989 to become Republican
Whip to Mr Newt Gingrich of Georgia in a battle between the moderate old
guard and the Republican party's younger, more confrontational wing.
He was the ranking minority member on the agriculture committee when
President George Bush picked him in January 1991 to succeed Mr Clayton
Yeutter. As agriculture chief, Mr Madigan sought to make programmes more
farmer-friendly, improve nutritional education, and increase research on new
uses for farm products. In his last two weeks as agriculture secretary he
presented a plan for closing and merging 1,300 field offices. After putting
the plan on hold for a time, the Clinton administration this week announced
the closing of more than 1,000 offices in the fourth-largest federal agency.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Strong yen biggest risk for Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's strength is the biggest risk to the emerging economic recovery in
Japan, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned
yesterday.
Its annual survey of Japan argues that the high yen could force companies to
reduce capital investment and employment again, in response a decline in
export market share. At present exchange rates, gross domestic product is
expected to rise by 1 per cent this year - higher than the OECD's
preliminary June estimate of 0.8 per cent - and by 2.5 per cent in 1995.
The OECD does not expect Japan to revert to the high growth rates of the
1980s, though it says there is a 'good chance' that this upswing will be
more durable than last year's phantom recovery.
A cut in official interest rates could ease the pressure on the yen and lift
sluggish credit growth, says the OECD, a regular critic of the Bank of
Japan's cautious monetary policy. Yet the need for monetary relaxation is
being reduced as the economy strengthens, it admits. The OECD counsels
against risking another boom in asset prices, the main reason why the Bank
of Japan is reluctant to cut official interest rates below their already
record lows.
On the whole, the Japanese government wins the OECD's praise for the way in
which it has pulled the economy out of the deepest recession since the first
oil crisis, through a mixture of public works spending worth 10 per cent of
GDP over the past two years, income tax cuts, and easy monetary conditions.
This strategy has had success in compensating for the declines in private
sector investment and exports, where the recession was rooted.
Private consumption, stimulated by the tax cuts, appears to be leading a
turnaround which started in the first half of this year. Business investment
is expected to follow, to stabilise from a four-year decline in the second
half of the year and to start growing again in 1995.
However, output will continue to be below potential, so that the present
gentle decline in consumer prices will continue in 1995. Unemployment, now
at 3 per cent, is expected to drop slightly as growth recovers. Imports
should rise rapidly enough for the current account surplus to fall from last
year's 3.1 per cent of GDP to 2.8 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next.
The government should now turn its attention to controlling the budget
deficit, which has risen steeply since 1992, so as to fund the fiscal
packages. This piece of advice will please the austere finance ministry as
it fights other ministries' claims for increased spending in the final
preparation of next year's budget, due to be published late this month.
According to the report, the combined central and local government deficit
will rise by two percentage points this year to nearly 6 per cent of GDP.
This would bring gross debt, excluding a temporary surplus on the social
security budget, to 83 per cent of GDP, well above the OECD average.
A recently agreed increase in Japan's sales tax will help restrain the
deficit and contribute to finding an expected rise in welfare payments, says
the OECD. A further shift towards indirect taxation is recommended, because
the government is seen as over-reliant on revenues from direct taxation at a
time when the income tax take is set to decline because of a fall in the
number of wage-earners. The government should meanwhile seek more savings by
making the public sector more efficient, the OECD recommends.
In the medium term, the key to sustaining the recovery lies in economic
deregulation. says the OECD. Yet progress so far in reducing regulations on
business, representing 42 per cent of total value added, is too cautious and
slow, says the study. The four deregulation packages published over the past
year covered some of the issues in a 1988 deregulation scheme, much of which
remains to be adopted.
The government should switch its deregulation strategy from the present
focus on packages containing hundreds of small steps to the sweeping
approach advocated by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, former chairman of the Keidanren,
Japan's leading business federation, in a report to the government.

The strikes involved Kia Motors, its truck subsidiary Asia Motors, Daewoo

challenge by Samsung. A refusal to strike by workers at Hyundai, the

<TEXT>
Thailand's coalition government has been thrown into crisis after the New
Aspiration party of Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, interior minister, voted with
the opposition to defeat a government bill to democratise village
government.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, was quoted last night as saying he wanted
the NAP to leave the government, although this was likely to deprive him of
his majority. Mr Chavalit, who is to decide today what to do, had stuck to
promises he made to village headmen that he would try to block government
moves to open their posts to election.
Yesterday he said: 'This idea that all coalition allies must always vote
together is something drummed up by the government. We have to vote for what
we think is right.'
Parliament may not be dissolved as a result, however. Prof Suchit
Bunbongkorn of Chulalongkorn University said: 'I don't think any of the
parties really wants an election - elections are very expensive and even the
opposition can't be certain they'll gain seats.' Mr Chuan could try to
entice one of the opposition parties over to replace the NAP's 51 seats. But
he would find it uncomfortable to work with many old-style money politicians
in the opposition.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Tokyo's ruling coalition gets WTO ratified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday ratified the establishment of the World Trade Organisation,
the climax of a prolific parliamentary session, ending today, the results of
which will be felt for many years.
In passing the WTO bills, the three-party ruling coalition of conservatives
and socialists has defied its critics. Many thought it would be too divided
to govern effectively when it seized power at the end of June, ending the
Liberal Democratic party's humiliating year in opposition.
The government has in its first full 10-week session since taking office
passed laws to bring significant changes to the political and electoral
system, tax, pensions and farming.
The LDP's skill in cajoling and coercing its socialist partners enabled it
to dominate important parliamentary committees, where agreements are
prepared in private before public adoption in the chamber. The session's
achievements, obscured by the political wranglings of the past few months,
include:
Political reform. Japan's discredited old method of choosing members of
parliament, a unique multi-seat constituency system where politicians could
win a seat with as little as 10 per cent of the vote, switches on December
25 to a mixture of single-seat and proportional-representation districts.
Many MPs are uncomfortably aware that, as a result, they may now be sitting
out their final term.
Farming. Rice imports are to begin in January, breaking a historic taboo on
regular (rather than emergency) sales of foreign rice. This is to happen in
small stages, starting with 4 per cent of the market. It shows how the
balance of power has shifted from once influential farming communities to
cities, where consumers rather than producers are king.
To get agreement on this, the LDP had to resort to traditional methods - a
Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) pay-off, officially to help farmers adjust to cheap
international competition, also agreed during the last session.
But first, it needed the support of the Social Democratic party.
The price of that was another pay-off, to be enacted today, of Y100,000 per
family to those still suffering from the effects of the 1945 atomic
bombings. Nuclear victims constitute one of the few traditional left-wing
causes that the socialists still uphold.
Tax. An income tax cut, needed to stimulate demand as the economy enters a
painfully slow recovery, is to be followed by an equally important rise in
consumption tax, from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 1997, needed to compensate
for an expected decline in the income tax base. A botched attempt to achieve
this contributed to the collapse of one Japanese government over the past
year.
Pensions. An increase in the pensionable age, from 60 to 65, plus a rise in
national pension scheme premiums, against opposition from a weakened union
movement. This is needed to reduce demands on Japan's rising budget deficit
from the growing number of elderly. More than one in four Japanese will be
over 65 by the year 2020, up from around 13 per cent now.
Yet the performance has won little thanks from voters. The sales tax
increase is understandably unpopular.
Accordingly, the coalition's approval rating has plummeted during the
session, to 29 per cent according to the latest poll, five percentage points
lower than a previous survey published just before the session opened in
September.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Kaifu is elected to head new alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former Japanese prime minister, yesterday staged a
political comeback when the country's new opposition alliance elected him as
its first leader.
Mr Kaifu, only seven months ago a member of the Liberal Democratic party,
now leads the New Frontier party (NFP), the main political threat to his
former colleagues. It is the result of a merger of nine opposition groups,
to be formally launched tomorrow, dedicated to making Japanese politics more
responsive to the aspirations of the electorate than to the will of party
factions.
The NFP's birth comes two weeks before the introduction of the new political
and electoral system, pioneered by Mr Kaifu, which provided the impulse for
its formation.
He won 131 of the votes cast by the NFP's 214 upper and lower house members
of parliament, easily beating his main rival, Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime
minister of the last government, who attracted 52 votes.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most powerful behind-the-scenes political
strategist, who engineered the NFP merger, was elected unopposed as
secretary general.
Yesterday's vote reunites the pair who brought the LDP a general election
victory in 1990, when Mr Kaifu was LDP prime minister and Mr Ozawa his
secretary general. This brings some stability to formerly shaky opposition
politics, though the new party is marred by rivalries at the top.
It also gives Mr Kaifu, 64, some compensation for his failed attempt for
power on leaving his old party last June in protest at the LDP's decision to
back Mr Tomiichi Murayama, head of the Social Democrat party, to succeed Mr
Hata as prime minister. Mr Kaifu stood against Mr Murayama and lost by a
wide margin.
Mr Kaifu's first job will be to resolve discord between his most important
supporters, exposed by the election battle. Relations have cooled between Mr
Ozawa and Mr Hata, formerly close political partners who brought down the
LDP after 38 years in power by leading a defection to form an opposition
group early last year.
Despite the problems at the top, the pressure on party members to stay
united is strong.
The NFP has 187 seats in the lower house, well short of the ruling
coalition's 293. It can increase this only by wooing defectors and by
staying united in the general election, which some senior LDP officials
favour holding early next year. New funding rules favour large parties.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Time to end sky-high property price system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's sky-high land and property prices are to blame for some of its most
pressing economic problems, according to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Its latest report on Japan argues that more deregulation of the property
market would increase quality of life and boost consumption. The need to lay
aside nine times average annual income, at today's prices, to buy a small
home helps to keep Japan's savings rate the highest in the world, so
inflating its politically troublesome current account surplus, says the
OECD.
High land prices also explain why Japan's infrastructure is well behind its
economic wealth. Only 44 per cent of homes are connected to sewers and
Tokyoites have only 2.5 square metres of parkland a head, less than a tenth
of the green space available to Londoners, says the report.
The cost of commercial space is a barrier to investment by small and
medium-sized foreign companies, one reason why foreign corporate investment
in Japan runs at one twentieth of Japanese investment abroad.
By any measure, Japanese land prices are further above international norms
than its consumer prices, even after the one-third fall in property values
since the collapse of the asset price bubble in 1991. At Dollars 1,800 a
square metre, the mean price of Japanese residential land is more than 12
times that of the UK, the most expensive in Europe, says the OECD.
To achieve the Japanese government's target of reducing house prices to five
times average income from the current nine times, another 21 per cent fall
in prices is needed, estimates the OECD. Radical changes to the tax system,
to encourage a more liquid property market, are required. The OECD also
calls for more flexible land leasing laws, to make it easier for landlords
to change the use of properties.
This would enable a more efficient, and concentrated, use of land. Contrary
to popular myth, Japanese cities are not particularly crowded, just poorly
planned. Tokyo's population density, for example, is less than one-sixth
that of central New York City. Astonishingly, 15 per cent of Japan's three
largest cities is farmland, double the housing area. On top of that comes a
substantial acreage of vacant parking areas and derelict industrial sites.
City populations are high because cities are more spread out than their OECD
counterparts. Japan's largest cities sprawl across an acreage equivalent to
half its farmland; the ratio for the rest of the OECD is 8 per cent.
Urban Japan's underused expanses exist partly because capital gains taxes on
land decline the longer it is held, the annual rax on fixed assets is very
low and land transaction taxes are high. So land is cheap to hold and
expensive to sell. The law continues to give landlords no guarantee of being
able to repossess property at the end of a lease, so hindering better use of
underused land.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Mozambique queues for a better life: A wounded country, sick
of war, waits in hope for the fruits of UN-run elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the port of Beira, the war refugees who squat in the cages of an old zoo
are hoping life will get better after Mozambique's first democratic
elections, which were held last month.
It could hardly get worse. They have no jobs and little food, their children
do not go to school and, until recently, their lives were at risk from two
of the zoo's older tenants: crocodiles which had also survived Mozambique's
17-year civil war.
Beira voted solidly for Mr Afonso Dhlakama, the guerrilla
leader-turned-politician, as did five of the six most economically important
provinces of Mozambique. But Mr Dhlakama's Mozambican National Resistance
(Renamo) party did poorly in the capital Maputo and in the populous southern
provinces, which returned the Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo)
government to power.
The people of Beira have accepted the election results with equanimity.
Local Renamo leaders appealed for calm, and their calls were heeded. In the
Beira office of the Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration,
former Renamo and Frelimo soldiers queue together waiting for their monthly
demobilisation pay cheques and news of vocational training courses which
might help them start a new life.
'The first men we demobilised were not soldiers, they were slaves,' says Mr
Martin Wyss, who co-ordinates the IOM's work in Beira. He was surprised at
the lack of animosity between former combatants, and the absence of
political debate during the election campaign. 'They were sick of war. Most
have returned to their villages.'
At the Renamo headquarters in Beira, a filthy, dilapidated office block, the
local party representative admits he is relieved Renamo did not win. 'The
government's coffers are empty and we would be castigated for not being able
to rebuild the country,' Mr Manuel Perreira says. 'In another five years, we
will be stronger and have a better chance of winning the next elections.'
For the moment, all eyes are turned to Maputo, where the real political
bargaining has begun. President Joaquim Chissano yesterday opened the
country's first multi-party parliament, declaring: 'Mutual respect is the
first stage of tolerance, without which pluralism is impossible.'
Both he and Mr Dhlakama have had much to digest since the election results
were announced nearly three weeks ago. The Frelimo government, in power
since independence in 1975, was shocked to discover the extent of Renamo's
support. The former guerrillas won 112 of the 250 seats in the new
parliament, while Mr Dhlakama polled 33 per cent of the votes cast in the
presidential election, against 53 per cent for Mr Chissano. Mr Dhlakama is
no longer to be dismissed.
At the same time, Mr Dhlakama knows that his performance at the polls was
really a protest vote against Frelimo's autocratic 19-year rule. The
economic heartland of Beira, traditional and religious chiefs, and the
Makuas of northern Mozambique, the country's ethnic majority, have little in
common but their hatred for a government run by southerners.
Having spent the Dollars 17m (Pounds 10.3m) donated by the United Nations to
fight the elections, Mr Dhlakama has few resources with which to forge a
political party out of such a disparate group of constituents.
Western donors have warned Mr Chissano that the survival of Mozambique's new
democracy rests on his willingness to earmark state funds to finance all
political parties represented in parliament - including the rebels he fought
for 17 years.
They have also made the renewal of aid - which finances 55 per cent of the
state budget - conditional on Mr Chissano's commitment to fashioning a new
government which will encompass the country's ethnic and regional diversity
and prize competence above party loyalty.
'Mozambicans have shown Frelimo the yellow card,' says Mr Richard Edis, the
British ambassador in Maputo. 'The question is, will Frelimo take note and
stop fouling, or will it get sent off before the next elections?' Mr Edis
believes the donor community is willing to reward Mozambique's orderly
transition to democracy - if Mr Chissano displays the necessary pragmatism.
There are few illusions regarding the fragility of Mozambique's new
democracy or the difficult tasks that lie ahead. More than 3m people,
displaced by the war, must be resettled. Some 75,000 soldiers must be
re-integrated into civilian life and found jobs before their demobilisation
pay runs out in 18 months.
The country is still awash with weapons - the UN is leaving next month
without completing the search for hidden arms caches - and there are fears
that this may lead to increasing crime. Economic reconstruction will be
slow.
'For the past two years we have lived on hope,' says Mr Jose Luis Cabaco, a
long-standing Frelimo member. 'Now that the elections are over, people
expect democracy to bring prosperity, just as they believed Marxism would
bring development after independence. It may be just another unrealistic
dream.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / Japanese closure in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Noritake, the Japanese ceramics group, has closed its Sri Lanka factory, one
of the oldest foreign joint ventures on the island, amid a spate of
industrial unrest which is threatening economic problems for the new
government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The move by Noritake, which makes tableware in Sri Lanka and had been
expanding its plant, follows an eight-hour siege by factory workers on
Monday, during which three company executives, including one Japanese, were
held hostage. They were eventually rescued by police. The company was quoted
as saying that the plant would not reopen unless all labour issues were
resolved.
Korea-Ceylon Footwear, another foreign joint venture, has meanwhile seen its
shares slide on the local stock market, after a wildcat strike by workers
who demanded a 30 per cent pay rise and a large Christmas bonus. At a
graphite mine, workers held a senior executive captive at the bottom of a
graphite pit.
An attempt last month by a cabinet minister to organise a trade union at
Ansell, the Australian rubber products company, was halted by Mrs
Kumaratunga after the Australian High Commissioner had intervened.
Ansell operates in a free trade zone, where unions are prohibited.
According to a leading trade chamber, more than 100 labour disputes are
taking place this week. Most are connected with bonus demands, but unions
have gained confidence from the inclusion of left-inclined parties in the
nine-party People's Alliance coalition formed during the summer.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK holds back from Bosnia withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain decided yesterday to keep its peacekeepers in Bosnia for the time
being, while the US offered to contribute a 'substantial portion' of any
Nato force sent to provide cover for a withdrawal.
Defence officials in Washington said the US was willing to send about half
of a Nato force of 20,000 to 25,000 troops to provide cover for any pullout.
But a White House official added that the US did not immediately expect the
United Nations to pull its peacekeepers out of Bosnia.
The latest US pronouncements - acknowledging the peacekeepers' humanitarian
achievements, while standing ready to help withdraw them if necessary -
amounted to a gesture of reconciliation towards Washington's European
allies.
In London, senior ministers decided to keep the status of British troops in
Bosnia 'under very close review' after hearing gloomy assessments from Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary.
But no decision was made to withdraw the British contingent of more than
3,000 soldiers, and officials said they were still conscious of the tragic
consequences a pullout could have.
The officials said London's pessimism reflected the negative signals coming
from many different quarters in Bosnia, including Mr Radovan Karadzic, whom
they viewed as 'erratic and unpredictable' despite his offer this week to
enter negotiations.
British officials also viewed as 'disgraceful' an attack on UK policy in
Bosnia by Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador to the UN, who has
accused the UK of condoning the Serbs' conduct.
In Sarajevo, the UN accused the Croatian army of intervening directly in the
fighting in Bosnia and called for its immediate withdrawal. The allegations
of intervention by Zagreb have renewed fears of fighting between Croats and
Serbs.
Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, warned that if the UN failed to
act, Serb fighters would be 'forced to reclaim Serbian lands' from the
Croatian army in Bosnia.
Croatian intervention appears aimed at driving a wedge between Serb-held
lands in Bosnia and Croatia. Mr Milan Babic, a leader of the rebel Serbs
from Croatia, warned that Zagreb's military involvement would sabotage an
accord signed recently by the Croat government and Serb-controlled areas on
restoration of economic links. 'This participation of the Croatian army
clearly breaks international law and is a violation of the sovereignty of
the territory of Bosnia,' said Mr Thant Myint-U, a UN spokesman.
Bosnian Serbs, meanwhile, released a critically needed aid convoy headed for
the Serb-besieged 'safe haven' of Bihac and freed Canadian UN troops who had
been held hostage.

European Union unemployment fell fractionally to 10.7 per cent in October
from a revised 10.8 per cent in September, the EU statistics office said.
Unemployment fell in the UK to 8.9 per cent from 10.3 per cent, in Denmark
to 9.5 per cent from 10.7 per cent, in Ireland to 17.6 per cent from 18.4
per cent and in Spain to 22.1 per cent from 22.5, Eurostat said. In
contrast, more people were without work in Italy, where the rate rose to
12.1 per cent from 11.3 per cent and in Luxembourg, where it climbed to 3.5
per cent from 2.8 per cent. The EU's male unemployment rate fell to 9.3 per
cent in October from 9.6 per cent a year earlier, while the female rate rose
to 12.8 per cent from 12.6 per cent.
French non-farm market sector payrolls rose by 59,100 (0.4 per cent) in the
third quarter of 1994, after gains of 0.2 per cent and 0.6 per cent
respectively in the first and second quarters.
Industrial production in Denmark rose by 5 per cent in September compared
with the same month last year.

The former mayor of the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok, who was
forcibly deposed by the regional governor in March, demanded his
reinstatement yesterday with the support of citizens' groups. Mr Victor
Cherepkov was cleared last Friday of charges of taking bribes - allegations
levelled against him by Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of Primorskye Krai,
the far-eastern region. The Sevodnya newspaper reported Mr Cherepkov as
saying he would sue the governor - who was the object of a report by Russian
liberal parties that demanded his sacking on the grounds of arbitrary and
corrupt rule. A group of parties in Vladivostok - which has become a byword
for organised crime and corruption - issued an appeal to Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president, demanding the former mayor's reinstatement.

An agreement between Mr Rauf Denktash, president of northern Cyprus, and Mr
Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, over settlement of his estimated
Dollars 10m (Pounds 6m) debt to the government faced collapse last night
after shareholders of his companies disputed his right to use them to cancel
his debt. Mr Denktash announced after a nine-hour cabinet meeting on
Wednesday night that Mr Nadir would transfer the Cyprus-based Sunzest citrus
company, formerly part of his Polly Peck International group, to the
government. In return the government would waive his debts of about Dollars
10m. However, lawyers for PPI's administrators and shareholders denied Mr
Nadir's right to sell Sunzest. Although he is a director, they claim, the
company is actually owned by an offshoot of an Isle of Man company. They are
now threatening court action which could unravel the deal. Mr Nadir owes the
government back taxes, unpaid rent on leased government hotels he manages
and social security payments deducted from employees' pay but never
transferred to the Treasury.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's Socialist-led government yesterday agreed huge energy price rises
but backed off from the even higher price increases recommended by its
energy office and advisers working on the privatisation of the country's
electricity and gas companies. Mr Laszlo Pal, industry minister, said
electricity prices for households would rise by 65 per cent and for gas by
53 per cent from January. Details of price rises for industry were not
given, but Mr Pal said they would be significantly lower than those for
domestic users. To soften the blow, the government, which faces nationwide
local elections on Sunday, will allocate Ft9bn (Pounds 52m) from the state
budget to compensate those most hit by the increases. The price rises
increase the value of the state electricity and gas companies which the
government plans to privatise next year, but analysts estimate household
energy prices, which are controlled by the state, need to rise by 100 per
cent to bring them to world levels and cover production and modernisation
costs.

The Belgian defence minister, Mr Leo Delcroix, resigned yesterday after he
was implicated in a real estate scandal, the fourth senior government member
to be forced out this year. Mr Delcroix said he stepped down to keep the
government from becoming implicated in the scandal. Prime minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene announced that another Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat, Mr Karel
Pinxten, would become the new defence minister. Mr Delcroix had denied
earlier this year that he owned a villa in Provence, southern France, but he
admitted on Wednesday that he did, adding that the house was valued at
FFr15m (Pounds 1.78m) to FFr20m. But he denied that the villa was built with
illegal funds and illegal labour, as some allegations had claimed. In
January, deputy prime minister Guy Coeme, Mr Delcroix's predecessor at the
defence ministry, the minister-president of the Walloon regional government,
Mr Guy Spitaels, and his interior minister, Mr Guy Mathot, resigned after
their parliamentary immunity was lifted to investigate corruption
allegations. The three French-speaking Socialists denied any wrongdoing.

The European Union yesterday cleared a DM910m (Pounds 371.4m) aid package
for Eko Stahl, former east Germany's biggest steel plant, opening the way
for Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium to take over, modernise and eventually
privatise the loss-making enterprise. An initial package involving capital
injections of more than DM1bn was cut after other EU countries objected, in
particular the UK, which did not think sufficient capacity reductions were
accompanying the aid. Under yesterday's deal, Germany will cut 41,000 tons
of steel capacity at two other east German steel mills to justify the
subsidies. The deal should come into effect on January 1, when
Cockerill-Sambre will take an initial 60 per cent stake, with the option of
taking the remainder from the Treuhand privatisation agency by 1999. The aid
will be used to modernise the plant's cold-rolling mill and blast furnace,
but also to build a new hot-rolling facility.

Mr Vladimir Meciar will form a coalition government in Slovakia with extreme
right and left-wing parties on Sunday, more than two months after he won
national elections. Mr Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS) had previously planned to form a government only after the 1995 state
budget was passed. The HZDS - which won 35 per cent of the vote in October's
election on a populist-nationalist platform - said it would sign a pact with
the extreme right-wing Slovak National party (SNS) and left-wing Slovak
Workers' party. The parties have agreed that the HZDS will contribute 10
ministers, the Workers' party three and SNS two, the state news agency,
TASR, reported. Mr Meciar is expected to return as prime minister after
being ousted in March by a parliamentary vote of no confidence. He stunned
the caretaker government last month by pushing through a series of
controversial laws, effectively giving his coalition parties control of the
state broadcast media and state intelligence service. The all-night session
also reversed 50 privatisation decisions made by the outgoing cabinet before
the elections.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Turkey's jailing of Kurd MPs angers EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight Kurdish members of the Turkish parliament were sentenced yesterday to
jail terms of up to 15 years, in a verdict that will intensify concerns in
western Europe about Ankara's human rights record.
European Union MPs at the trial were visibly shaken and angered after the
verdicts were read and an immediate expression of concern about the
sentences was issued in Bonn by German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel. 'The
German government regrets that the court case ended in long jail terms. It
assumes that the verdicts will be reviewed in the appeals process,' Mr
Kinkel said in a statement.
Charges of treason against the Kurdish MPs, which would have incurred the
death penalty, were dropped. The defendants were accused of backing the
banned Kurdish Workers' party (PKK), a Marxist group battling for a separate
state in south-eastern Turkey.
Five of the defendants - including Ms Leyla Zana who denounced the
'political and legal absurdities' of her trial in an article in the
Washington Post this week - were given 15-year jail terms.
They were accused of acting on orders from PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan,
visiting his headquarters and urging people to support the PKK.
Another defendant was given a 7 1/2 -year term for urging support for the
PKK and praising its cause, while two more parliamentarians were given 3 1/2
years each for spreading separatist propaganda.
Mr Yusuf Alatas, a spokesman for the defence lawyers, said the
parliamentarians would appeal. 'We no longer have trust in Turkish justice,'
he said, adding: 'This trial has not been a legal but a political case.'
Diplomats said the verdict will cast a fresh shadow over a meeting of EU
ministers on December 19 at which a long-awaited Turkish-EU customs union
will be discussed.
German Parliament President Rita Sussmuth, a member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrat party, said the tough sentences would strain
Ankara's ties with the EU. 'Today's tough sentences are, especially on the
day before the EU summit in Essen, a highly questionable signal for future
relations between Turkey and the European Union,' she said.
In Germany yesterday, more than 350 police conducted raids on 76 homes and
offices to crack down on the PKK.
This followed the firebombing of Turkish companies in three German cities
earlier this week.
In London, the courts are considering a request for the extradition to
Germany of Mr Kani Yilmaz, European spokesman of the PKK, who was arrested
in October as he was about to enter the House of Commons and address a
parliamentary group.
Greece, in a discreet move to limit tensions with Turkey, has made it clear
that Mr Yilmaz would not be welcome in Athens. Turkey, while welcoming the
arrest of Mr Yilmaz, protested recently to Britain about the activities of
Amnesty International. It singled for complaint an Amnesty-sponsored
campaign in which schoolchidren were encouraged to write letters of protest
about Ankara's treatment of the Kurds.
Amnesty has defended the campaign, calling it a legitimate response to
Turkey's 'abysmal' record on human rights.
In another row, Turkish officials have expressed acute concern about a
conference in Russia for Kurds from all over the former Soviet Union at
which support was expressed for the PKK. Ankara is seeking urgent
clarification from Moscow over whether the conference was officially
sponsored.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Hopes of wider union turn to fear of no union: The EU's
summit in Essen is marked by divisions over Bosnia, unemployment and
enlargement

Today's European Council summit in Essen ought to be cause for celebration
but risks turning into a wake.
Essen was at first billed as a defining moment in the German-led strategy to
build a wider European Union incorporating the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe. To the dismay of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
however, the two-day summit seems certain to be haunted by Bosnia.
All 12 EU leaders present, and Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing president of
the European Commission and potential candidate for president of France,
recognise the corrosive effects of the Bosnian conflict as it poisons
relations within the Atlantic alliance and with Russia.
The question is whether the rift between the US and Europe over strategy
toward the Balkans will spread to the European Union, which next year takes
in Sweden, Austria and Finland. France and the UK are acutely aware of
German public opinion in favour of US calls to lift the UN arms embargo
against the warring parties, which would help the Bosnian Moslem government.
Yet lifting the embargo is anathema. It would trigger withdrawal of the
23,000-strong UN peacekeeping force, to which France and the UK have
contributed generously, and deepen the rift in Nato.
Mr Kohl will therefore do his utmost to prevent a split. He knows that it
would rekindle fears of France, Germany and the UK going their separate ways
in the Balkans - a repeat of history at the end of the 19th century and,
briefly, in December 1991 when Germany put pressure on its reluctant EU
partners to recognise its favoured states Croatia and Slovenia.
Even if Mr Kohl succeeds in papering over differences, he will not be able
to conceal the impotence of the EU in the face of a crisis in its own
backyard or its apparent indifference to the destruction of a multi-ethnic
state recognised by the international community.
'You cannot underestimate the psychological damage caused by Bosnia,
particularly on European public opinion,' says a Commission official.
The same debilitating effect is evident in the item second on the Essen
agenda - unemployment. True, the European economy is on the mend; but it is
a jobless recovery. Europe still has about 18m people out of work, and there
is little prospect of shortening the dole queues by much. 'The EU has failed
to answer the most fundamental question: What's in it for me?' says one
Commission official.
Today in Essen, Mr Delors will again spell out the competitive challenge
posed by the US and Asia. He will urge fresh measures to create jobs.
One idea is the multi-billion-dollar trans-European rail, road and
telecommunications networks; others are the new 'information highway' and a
more imaginative approach to labour markets.
The third item on the agenda is eastern Europe, and it remains the issue on
which the success of the summit is likely to be judged. In the run-up to the
Essen meeting, much has been made of Mr Kohl's hesitation about inviting the
leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania, which all hope to join the Union.
Doubts grew after the German presidency of the EU soft-pedalled on trade
liberalisation measures and avoided a commitment to reform of the structural
funds and the common agricultural policy, both of which are necessary if the
costs of eastward enlargement are not to be prohibitive.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, rejected much of the criticism
this week. He singled out a planned blueprint for EU accession setting out
steps for adapting laws, state aid, norms and standards to allow the six
eastern European states to adjust progressively to the single European
market.
German officials agree that the package for eastern Europe reaches the
limits of what other countries - notably the Franco-Spanish-led 'Club Med'
bloc - would tolerate.
France underlined the point by insisting that EU funds for eastern Europe
over the next five years would have to be matched with more money for the
Mediterranean, specifically North Africa.
This linkage between eastern Europe and the Mediterranean is new. Perhaps
France and Germany are striking a sensible bargain for joint EU action to
counter instability on the EU's periphery; but France may also be seeking to
counter the eastward pull of a unified Germany with its own shift to the
south.
This would mark a division of Europe into old-style spheres of influence, an
arrangement which falls short of the proclaimed European Union created by
the Maastricht treaty.
But, as Mr Delors is likely to point out to the leaders over dinner tonight,
the Union is not living up to its name: its common security and foreign
policy is a sham; and the loose inter-governmental co-operation supposed to
deal with justice and home affairs has failed to produce a single
achievement in the past 12 months.
The Commission blames British and Spanish blocking tactics, but also singles
out unyielding French opposition to diluting the power of its own national
police forces, led by Mr Charles Pasqua, the right-wing interior minister.
The Euro-activists, whose champion is Chancellor Kohl, believe they have the
answer: a faster route to political and economic union, buttressed by
greater powers to the European Parliament and the European Commission, led
by an inner core of integrationist-minded EU states. Their target date for
action is the inter-governmental conference of 1996 to review the Maastricht
treaty.
Those of a more passive persuasion, particularly UK prime minister Mr John
Major, will resist. Their political survival depends on stopping a Great
Leap Forward in Europe. Still, as Mr Major disclosed this week, there may be
contingency plans for referendums on Maastricht 2, specifically any move to
join a single European currency.
The struggle between these two opposing camps will be one of the sub-texts
of the Essen summit. Its outcome will have a decisive influence on how the
EU resolves the official item on today's summit agenda: the integration of
western and eastern Europe.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Western German growth speeds up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western German economic growth continued to speed up in the third quarter,
raising concern about renewed inflationary pressures next year and damping
speculation about a further cut in interest rates.
The rise of 1.5 per cent (adjusted) in gross domestic product over the
second quarter was more than expected, one cause being a surprise
improvement in private consumption. The increase over the 1993 third quarter
was 2.4 per cent, after annual rises of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter
and 2.3 per cent in the second, the federal statistics office said.
Mr Stephen King, economist at UK stockbroker James Capel, said growth should
easily exceed 3 per cent next year. 'The policy implications of this (GDP)
release are clear,' he added. 'There is no room for the Bundesbank to reduce
interest rates further.'
Instead, the central bank council, which left rates unchanged yesterday,
should be looking seriously at higher rates in the first half of 1995.
Although some economists still favour one more cut in the discount and
lombard rates (now at 4.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively) before these
move up again, support for anti-inflationary increases next year is
hardening.
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, said the rise in economic growth
should close the gap between actual and potential GDP in 1995. Inflation
should ease to around 2 per cent in the first half *something in here (HP) *
before edging up again. 'The strong 1994 economic rebound, which continues
to outpace expectations, renders further Bundesbank easing unnecessary and
unlikely.'
Reflecting the brighter economic picture, the unemployment figures in
Germany's two halves improved last month. For the first time since June
1991, the eastern total fell below 1m, cutting the jobless rate to 13 per
cent from 13.3 per cent in October. The western rate was unchanged at 7.9
per cent.
To help underpin the economic upturn by improving incomes of the less
well-off, the government announced plans to simplify the tax system and
raise the tax-free minimum income level. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister,
said income tax levels for the less well-off would be reduced to strength-en
economic growth and stimulate purchasing power.
Tax-free income levels will rise from DM5,600 (Pounds 2,276) a year to over
DM12,000 for a single person. Tax levels above DM12,000 will also be cut to
simplify the fiscal system and stimulate consumer spending.
Those earning DM13,000 will have their tax reduced by about 28 per cent of
what they now pay; those earning DM20,000 will pay 26 per cent less; at
DM50,000 they will pay 2.4 per cent less; and at DM122,364 1.8 per cent
less. The top rate stays 53 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Britain's Labour party says No to 'no veto'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Labour party left its calling card on the doorstep of the European
summit yesterday. It was a pointed reminder that if the time should come
when it is Britain's official EU representative, it will bring with it a
firm resolve to maintain the right (as the former Mrs Margaret Thatcher
would have it) to say 'No, no, no'.
The occasion was a pre-summit sub-summit called to allow leaders of European
socialist and social democrat parties to draft their would-be agenda for the
future of Europe, and wave farewell to Commission president, Mr Jacques
Delors.
In the absence of Mr Tony Blair, Labour's deputy, Mr John Prescott was left
to shepherd through a key amendment - in defence of the notorious right of
veto - to the meeting's final declaration.
Someone, it seemed, had sneaked in a cheeky paragraph proclaiming: 'We say
'No' to any individual state having a right to veto further development of
the Union.'
'This', Labour protested, 'is a major addition to the text which has not
been in any previous text or raised in previous discussions and which the
Labour party is unable to accept.' The clause accordingly disappeared from
the final version.
France's Socialists, represented by Mr Henri Emmanueli, had less luck with
their attempt to commit the movement to a policy of waiting until the end of
the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the reform of EU institutions
before even thinking about enlargement.
Just as Mr Emmanueli echoed the official French line, so Mr Rudolf
Scharping, Germany's Social Democrat leader, echoed that of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who will preside over the summit today.
Mr Scharping warned of 'negative consequences' should Germany's central and
eastern European neighbours be told to forget about entry negotiations for
two or three years.
Mr Delors ducked. 'It is really a question of linguistics,' he ventured. But
it was also a question of coping with enlarging EU membership from 12 to 15,
16 or even 27. What was important, he stressed, was to be clear about what
sort of 'marriage contracts' were needed or practicable.

FT  09 DEC 94 / EU nearer accord on data protection rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday took a big step towards adoption of EU-wide
data protection rules. Ministers believe they are vital for the development
of revolutionary services on the information superhighway.
Ministers meeting in Brussels agreed that plans to harmonise rules
protecting personal information would be adopted by the year's end, provided
a final text was agreed.
The decision overrode strong objections from Britain, which believes that
legislation is unnecessary and that the Brussels plans will impose heavy
costs on the private sector. However, with all other member states backing
the initiative, the UK (which has minimal data protection laws) will almost
certainly have to take the measures on board.
The Commission said the proposals were essential to speed cross-border
provision of financial and other services which are hindered by differing
data protection regimes.
Further, the development of new electronic highways will make it much easier
for EU consumers to choose mortgages, life insurance and other services from
outside their home country. Brussels says this will not be possible without
a single regime.
The plan gives countries 12 years to introduce rules covering information
stored on paper rather than on computers. Also, data protection will only be
applied retrospectively to manually held data where people actually require
access to the information.
At yesterday's meeting ministers also discussed progress in the single
market. Tables produced by Brussels showed Greece and Germany with the worst
records for adopting outstanding measures deemed crucial for the free flow
of goods, services and capital.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, reacted sensitively to
suggestions that Bonn was dragging its feet, saying much legislation had not
been adopted for technical reasons.
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single
market, said 1994 had been a disappointing year for the single market, with
a lack of political commitment from member states.
Greece, which has only implemented 77.9 per cent of the single market
legislation is the worst offender. Of 217 measures, it has made no progress
on 43. This compares with Denmark - the champion - which has only eight
outstanding.
The second slowest country is Germany, which has made no progress on 26
directives, followed by Ireland with 24. France is the second most
efficient, followed by Britain, which has still not adopted 14 bits of
legislation.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Gonzalez to 'take hostages' on fish issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, has thrown his weight around
before at European summits but never has he pushed brinkmanship quite so far
as he will today at Essen. When Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, criticised national governments on Wednesday for 'taking
hostages' in order to get their own way in the Union, he had Mr Gonzalez in
mind.
Mr Gonzalez's offence is that he served notice in a letter to German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week that Madrid would block the EU's
enlargement (to incorporate, Austria, Finland and Sweden next month) if
Spain, together with Portugal, failed to obtain legal guarantees on its
inclusion in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) by January 1 1995. The
Spanish premier is now poised to repeat his threat verbally to Mr Kohl in
the presence of Mr Delors and of the others meeting in the central Ruhr
town.
Although the CFP is not on the Essen agenda, 'the issue is very likely to
come up,' said Mr Miguel Gil, the Spanish government spokesman.
A veteran of a score of European summits, Mr Gonzalez dug his heels in over
revenue raising at Maastricht in 1991, over structural funds at Edinburgh a
year later and most recently over qualified majority voting during the Greek
presidency earlier this year.
On this occasion, however, Mr Gonzalez has a powerful legislative back-up to
his obstinacy. In October the Spanish parliament voted not to ratify the
accession of the three new members unless Spain first obtained guarantees
lifting restrictions on its fishing rights in EU waters.
'The prime minister wrote to Chancellor Kohl that the vote had been
unanimous and unequivocal and that he (Mr Kohl) should therefore concentrate
on the fishing issue,' said Mr Gil. Mr Carlos Westendorp, Madrid's EU
secretary of state, was more emphatic: 'Our position is well entrenched.
Parliament has closed off any retreats.'
Mr Kohl may be irked by the sight of a Spanish deep-sea trawler muddying the
clear waters of enlargement. Madrid, however, insists that it is up to the
German presidency to break the deadlock at the EU's fishing council, where a
series of bitter arguments continue to hold up what the EU had agreed in
principle months ago as part of the enlargement package.
In a concession allowing Norway to preserve its own fishing grounds, the
Twelve agreed in March to bring forward the entry of Spain and Portugal to
the CFP from 2003 to 1996 and to settle the terms of their inclusion by the
end of this year.
The fact that the Norwegian people in a referendum rejected joining the
Union does not in Madrid's view, alter a single sentence of the March
commitment. But the EU's council of fishing ministers meets on December
19-20 amid strong disagreements over what the CFP will look like with the
inclusion of Spain and Portugal and the fear that an 11th-hour consensus may
prove impossible. 'This month's council is the last cartridge because we've
used up all the others,' said Mr Westendorp. 'It has to receive a clear
message from Essen.'
Clarity is all too necessary because the fishing council has become confused
over the Commission's proposals to use the extension of the CFP to introduce
stricter rules on where and how trawlers operate.
The new rules are disliked by Spain, which has been subjected to similar
restrictions ever since it became Europe's 12th member in 1986, as much as
by the rest who view them as intrusive and unworkable. In addition, Ireland
and the UK have not abandoned their hopes of keeping Spain's 200-strong
fleet of large trawlers out of the 'Western Waters' on the grounds that the
'Irish Box' is a sensitive zone requiring biological protection.
The Irish-British objections cause considerable anger in Madrid, where
officials say the insatiable Spanish demand for fish has revitalised the
industry in the EU. 'Ireland exported 600 tons of fish to Spain in 1985 and
last year it exported 6.5bn tons, all of them high price and high quality, '
says Mr Rafael Conde, Madrid's director general of fishing.
At issue, in Spain's view, is whether the EU has a genuine common fishing
policy or a set of national ones and, specifically, whether the Union is
prepared to end the discrimination that it imposes on two of its present
members before it accepts any new ones. 'We must have an internal
house-cleaning over the fishing business before enlargement,' said Mr Conde.

France said yesterday it hoped the Essen summit would endorse proposals to
bring European Union aid to the Mediterranean into better balance with the
money flowing to the east.
'At a time when the European Union is reaching out to the east, it is
important that it should not forget its southern flank - the Mediterranean
region, stretching from the Maghreb to Turkey and including Malta and
Cyprus,' said Mr Jean Musitelli, President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman.
In recent years, EU aid to the Mediterranean has amounted to only 40 per
cent of that going to eastern Europe. France is backing Commission proposals
to increase Mediterranean aid to Ecu5.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) over the next five
years, compared with a planned Ecu7.5bn destined under the Phare programme
for east Europe.
France believes it has gained German support for more EU resources for the
south, as part of a trade-off in which Paris has shown itself steadily more
enthusiastic and open to Bonn's concerns about enlarging the Union to the
east.
While acknowledging that little can be usefully done for Algeria until that
country settles its brutal civil war, France wants the EU to press on with
negotiations for freer trade with neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EU affairs minister, stressed that the French
presidency in the first half of 1995 would strongly back a recent Commission
compromise proposal on imports of Moroccan tomatoes, a tender subject for EU
growers.
France plans to use its presidency of the Council of Minister to set in
train a summit meeting between EU and Mediterranean countries. But France is
already due next spring to host a gathering of purely Mediterranean
countries which it is organising with Egypt. So the EU-Mediterranean summit
is likely to be hosted by Spain, which takes over the EU presidency baton
from France next July.

FT  09 DEC 94 / East Europe impatient for seat at the top table

<TEXT>
A belated invitation from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the concluding
session of the European Union summit in Essen is not as humiliating as a
summons from the Soviet leadership to attend a Comecon meeting in Moscow
used to be. But neither is it the sort of open and frank dialogue which the
six aspirant members from central Europe had hoped to establish with the EU
in the five years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
Attitudes east of the Elbe have changed while Brussels dithered over plans
for the EU's Drang nach Osten (drive to the east). At first the nations
liberated from the Soviet yoke blithely assumed that they would be safely
scooped into the west's economic club, the EU, and its military safety net,
Nato. But that vision of bliss born out of ignorance did not survive long.
As central Europe plunged into painful shock therapy the EU sublimely sailed
on to Maastricht while the western alliance as whole was diverted by the
Gulf war and sucked into the Yugoslav vortex. To cap it all, recession
sparked off anti-dumping and other restrictions on iron, steel and textile
imports from eastern Europe and meat import bans for spurious sanitary
reasons.
The recipients of initial EU 'aid' also soon realised it took a form more
convenient to the donors, like surplus grain and redundant civil servants,
than useful to the recipients.
When negotiations for 'association agreements' began in 1990, the central
Europeans found that the Brussels view of trade was very similar to that of
Comecon commissars: 'A jungle of complex quotas and haggling over the
precise details of dried mushrooms', as Mr Andrzej Olechowski, in charge of
Poland's negotiations with Brussels, describes the drawn-out process.
Instead of a Marshall plan-like strategic vision of a united Europe,
Brussels opted for nit-picking bilateral treaties with the individual
applicants for eventual membership, adds Mr Janos Martonyi, Hungary's
European affairs expert.
The Copenhagen and Edinburgh EU summits and subsequent revisions to the
bilateral association agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Romania, Poland and Slovakia have improved market access and opened the door
to eventual full entry, without however specifying a timetable or clearly
laying down the necessary criteria.
Thanks to the relative openness of EU markets, Germany has replaced the
former Soviet Union as the principal market and source of imports for all
aspirant members, while trade with the EU states as a whole is also well
over 50 per cent of their total.
All aspirant members are showing strong, export-led growth and building up
their laws and institutions to be EU-compatible. They are also
re-establishing trade and other links with the former Soviet states - but on
a private trade and contact level, not the rigid, hierarchical inter-party
and inter-state basis of yesteryear.
The six central European leaders invited to Essen are glad of the
opportunity to be seen alongside their west European confreres at the
farewell photo opportunity. The fastest possible integration into the EU
remains the focal point of their economic and foreign policies. They see
economic prosperity and ever growing investment and trade links as integral
members of an enlarged EU as the more reliable basis for future security.
But above all they want to be part of the negotiating process which
redefines the political and economic shape of 21st-century Europe, not just
on the sidelines of great events.

Greece and Germany are trailing far behind other EU states in adopting
legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital across
the Union, and have contributed to a disappointing year for the internal
market.
Delivering its twice yearly roundup of delays to completion of the single
market, the European Commission said yesterday that a lack of political
commitment by member states had slowed progress.
On the eve of the single market's second anniversary, Mr Raniero Vanni
D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single market, told EU
ministers that developments had been most disappointing in intellectual and
industrial property, public procurement and insurance.
League tables compiled by the Commission show that Greece, which has only
implemented 77.9 per cent of the single market legislation, is the worst
offender by a long way. Of a total of 217 measures, it has made no progress
on 43. This compares with Denmark - the champion - which has only eight
outstanding.
The second slowest country is Germany which has made no progress on 26
directives, followed by Ireland with 24. France is the second most
efficient, followed by Britain, which has still not adopted 14 bits of
legislation.
On average, 89 per cent of the legislation necessary to ensure the free flow
of goods, services and capital has been adopted. But with some states
trailing badly, and progress differing markedly across sectors, Mr Vanni
D'Archirafi, stressed that much work remained to be done.
It was not enough for states merely to adopt the legislation on to their
national statute books. They had to ensure that national laws were of the
right quality, and corresponded to the requirements of EU legislation.
Brussels also accused member states of failing to respect the principle of
mutual recognition, whereby they recognise each other's standards for goods
and services where no harmonisation legislation is deemed necessary.
Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said the Commission had investigated 4,112 cases - half
of which concerned the single market - where it suspected that member states
were not respecting EU legislation. Of these, a majority were in France and
Germany.
Member states now look certain to back a Commission initiative that will
require them to inform Brussels every time any one of them intends to ban or
refuse entry for a product which has been lawfully produced in another
member state.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Warburg and Morgan Stanley seek merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the largest UK investment bank, announced yesterday that it
intended to give up its independence by merging with the US investment bank
Morgan Stanley in an effort to create a stronger global bank.
The announcement, prompted by widespread rumours in the London stock market
which drove up Warburg's share price, followed three months of talks on what
would be the most significant transatlantic merger the industry has seen.
The investment banks said their businesses were 'uniquely complementary,'
although the merger is expected to lead to cuts among Warburg's 4,472 staff
and Morgan Stanley's 9,300 staff as they eliminate duplication. Investment
banks have suffered from weakness and volatility in financial markets this
year, and both Warburg and Morgan Stanley have recently announced sharp
falls in profits.
Warburg has had difficulty fulfilling its aim to rival the large US
investment banks such as Goldman Sachs as a global player because of a
relatively small capital base and difficulty in penetrating US capital
markets.
Morgan Stanley is thought to view the merger as a means of making a stronger
impact in Asia and Europe. The bank has been expanding its staff recently,
partly to rebuild its position in the underwriting of stocks and bonds in
the US.
Large investment banks in Europe and the US increasingly believe they must
have a strong presence in many regions to gain business from cross-border
capital flows. This has led US banks to push strongly into Europe.
Heads of other UK investment banks said they thought the merger could create
a strong combined force, but it would face merger difficulties.
The banks said yesterday that they were 'discussing the possibility of
combining their businesses' by forming a new holding company. The company
will probably offer shares in exchange for existing Warburg and Morgan
Stanley equity.
The intended merger could be disrupted by a counter bid from another
institution. However, executives of both banks believe it would be hard to
mount a hostile bid, because much of the value of Warburg is in the
expertise of employees.
There is some uncertainty over Mercury Asset Management, the fund management
business 75 per cent owned by Warburg. The merged banks could be forced by
the Takeover Panel to offer to buy out minority shareholders.
The London Stock Exchange, which is trying to crack down on insider dealing,
contacted Warburg yesterday morning after a rise in its shares on rumours of
bids by JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and HSBC Holdings, the UK bank.
Its intervention forced Warburg to announce - a week ahead of schedule - the
merger talks with Morgan Stanley.
In London, Warburg's shares closed 119p up at 791p yesterday, after reaching
a high of 830p. In New York, Morgan Stanley shares closed down Dollars 1 5/8
at Dollars 55 1/4.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK trade deficit at lowest level for almost 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK trade deficit fell to its lowest level for almost 10 years in the
third quarter of this year, which could result in a significant turnround in
the country's balance of payments.
Official figures yesterday suggested that the UK may have recorded a
quarterly current account surplus in the third quarter of this year, for the
first time in almost eight years.
The recent improvement in the UK's current account has surprised many City
economists who were predicting last year that the British recovery would
suck in imports and lead to a deterioration in the balance of payments
position.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that rising exports and flat
imports caused the UK visible trade deficit to fall to a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter of this year, down from Pounds 2.4bn in
the second quarter.
The CSO is not due to publish official figures on the trade in invisible
items, which recorded a Pounds 1.7bn surplus in the second quarter of this
year, until later this month.
But unless the surplus in invisible items fell back significantly in the
last quarter, yesterday's figures showed that the recent improvement in the
visible trade balance would have pushed the UK into a trade surplus, after
recording a deficit of Pounds 664m in the second quarter. Although the UK
recorded a surplus in the first half of 1980s, it has since recorded a
deficit, apart from a temporary surplus in the first quarter of 1987.
The trade in invisibles is a difficult item to measure, since the balance in
investment income, which is key part of the figures, can be very erratic.
The data on investment income include items such as the profits on UK
companies' overseas assets.
However, Ms Alison Wright, director-general of the trade body British
Invisibles, yesterday said she believed it was 'very unlikely' that the
surplus on investment income had deteriorated in the third quarter.
The City welcomed the data, not least because of a further, surprise fall in
import volumes. The volume of UK exports, excluding oil and erratics, rose
by 1.3 per cent in September, compared with October, while the volume of
imports fell by 0.6 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 94 / GEC Alsthom beats ABB in Tube deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Anglo-French company GEC Alsthom has beaten the Swedish-Swiss-owned ABB
Transportation to win an Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m order to provide new trains
for London Underground.
The deal, to supply and maintain just over 100 new trains for the
Underground's ageing Northern Line, is the first significant contract under
the government's private finance initiative.
The decision means work for GEC Alsthom's Metro Cammell factory in
Birmingham but is a bitter blow to ABB. It said up to 600 employees at its
Derby rolling stock works now faced redundancy.
'We are extremely disappointed,' Mr Bo Sodersten, managing director, said
yesterday. 'A major retrenchment of the Derby factory (employing 2,500
people) is now inevitable.'
In March the company said it was axing nearly 700 jobs at Derby. This was
followed in September with 289 redundancies at its York plant.
Yesterday's deal provides for payment for the trains and their maintenance
to be spread over 20 years. This was what ABB had proposed to London
Underground in 1993. The Treasury blocked the deal for several months on the
grounds that it did not transfer sufficient risk to the private sector.
Pressure from Conservative backbenchers, London businesses and the private
finance panel finally persuaded it to give way but the government insisted
in March on opening the contract to competition.
ABB was completing the delivery of similar trains for the Underground's
Central Line and was thought to be well placed to make a competitive bid.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reaffirmed in last week's Budget the
government's commitment to encouraging the private sector to finance
projects traditionally carried out in the public sector. He expects
contracts worth Pounds 5bn to be signed over the next 12 months.
The order puts a value of about Pounds 400m on the new trains with the
20-year maintenance contract worth an additional Pounds 400-Pounds 500m.
London Underground will pay GEC Alsthom an annual fee of Pounds 40m-Pounds
45m. The contract can be extended by a further 16 years.
The deal breaks new ground because, under the recently formulated rules of
the private finance initiative, it transfers the expense and risk of
maintaining the new trains to the manufacturer.
If GEC Alsthom fails to provide the expected level of service, London
Underground can reduce its annual payments.

Mr John Major's government was last night faced with the results of a
devastating opinion poll which put Labour's lead over the Conservatives at a
record 39.5 percentage points and indicated a popular backlash against last
week's Budget, writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor.
The Gallup survey, published in today's Daily Telegraph showed Labour's
support at 61 per cent - the largest recorded for a political party in
Gallup's history. The previous record, 56 per cent, was set by the
Conservatives following Labour's devaluation of the pound in 1967.
With support for the Conservatives put at 21.5 per cent, the 39.5 point
Labour lead was similarly the highest ever recorded.
The snapshot poll of 1,061 voters was taken during the days before the
government's defeat this week over value added tax on domestic fuel and
ahead of yesterday's increases in fuel, alcohol and tobacco taxes. But 65
per cent judged the original Budget package as 'unfair' while only 23 per
cent said it was fair. The poll also showed 70 per cent of voters were
dissatisfied with Mr Major.
The results underline that the slump in the government's popularity now goes
far beyond the mid-term troubles associated with most administrations.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Clarke bridges Pounds 1bn gap with extra tax package:
Further duties on petrol, tobacco and alcohol after government's VAT defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday turned to smokers, motorists
and drinkers to plug the gap in the government finances caused by this
week's Commons defeat over value added tax on domestic fuel.
Addressing a packed House of Commons, a boisterous chancellor announced a 1p
per litre increase in petrol and diesel taxes and increases of about 4 per
cent in tobacco and alcohol duties from January 1 to make up for Pounds 1bn
of revenue lost next year.
He said the government would trim the social security compensation package
that was to protect pensioners and others on income related benefits from
the aborted plan to increase VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent. Mr Clarke also
signalled further cuts of Pounds 300m a year in public spending from 1996-97
onwards to make up further revenue shortfalls.
Mr Clarke told the Commons that holding the rate of VAT on domestic fuel at
8 per cent would reduce revenue by about Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and Pounds
1.5bn in subsequent years. He ostentatiously rejected cutting spending plans
for the coming financial year or levying more direct taxes on individuals or
imposing new taxes on businesses.
In a mini-Budget reminiscent of austerity Budgets in the 1950s, he chose to
raise Pounds 780m from higher excise duties on fuel, tobacco and alcohol.
The social security measures would save Pounds 190m in 1995-96 and more in
following years. A reduction in pension rates meant that national insurance
contributions would start on earnings of Pounds 58 a week, rather than
Pounds 59, from next April, raising receipts by Pounds 50m.
Mr Clarke's pugnacious performance in the Commons drew loud applause from
Tory MPs and raised hopes among ministers that the wounds in the
Conservative party inflicted by the VAT defeat would now begin to heal.
But the chancellor's colleagues were under no illusions that the increases
in duties will be popular. With many Conservatives already under pressure
from the brewing and off-licence industries regarding cheaper wine and beer
imports from France, the rise in alcohol duties attracted criticism from
several Tory MPs.
The package was given a rude reception by the Brewers' and Licensed
Retailers' Association: 'It is economic lunacy, French brewers and retailers
will be laughing their way to the bank.'
There was disquiet on the right of the Tory party that Mr Clarke had
confined cuts in public spending to the second and third years of the
expenditure programme. Some cabinet members were said to have made clear
that they would have preferred deeper cuts in spending totals.
But the chancellor was dismissive of criticism of his performance during the
past two weeks from the right of his party. He told journalists at a press
conference: 'I don't think the entire right is out to get me. One or two I
wouldn't be surprised. I feel the same about them.' He accused some of the
Eurosceptics of spreading 'malicious fiction'.
The chancellor admitted yesterday's plans were very much 'second choice
measures' involving 'serious snags' that he would have liked to have
avoided.
The increased road fuel duties would affect the rural motorist. The decision
to increase drink duties rather than to freeze them would affect distillers,
brewers and the licensed trade. He said he did not like putting up tobacco
duties because of large-scale smuggling, and for this reason left the tax on
hand-rolling tobacco unchanged.
But he insisted that the government was 'committed to taking all the
necessary measures to put the public finances on a sound footing' to keep
Britain's 'healthy recovery on track'.
Mr Clarke's new plans will put 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a standard bottle
of wine and 26p on a bottle of sprits. They will add 6p to a packet of 20
cigarettes.
Trimming the social security compensation would mean a single state pension
in the next financial year would be 30p a week lower than announced last
week and that for couples 35p lower.
Industry groups, such as the Confederation of British Industry and British
Chambers of Commerce, critical of Wednesday's interest rate rise, were
relieved that business had escaped punishment. Financial markets were
unmoved by the chancellor's package.
With Labour claiming that the latest measures add a further Pounds 29 a year
to the tax bills of the average family, ministers are expecting a crushing
defeat in next week's Dudley by-election.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour party shadow chancellor, said the net cut in the
average family's income as a result of all Budgets since the general
election would reach Pounds 800 a year by next April.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: SBC begins SFr121m rescue of
canton bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, today begins an
agreed SFr121m (Dollars 16.1m) rescue takeover bid for Solothurner
Kantonalbank, the first Swiss cantonal bank to be fully privatised.
The way for the bid was cleared on Sunday when a majority of the voters of
the canton of Solothurn supported privatisation rather than face the
uncertain costs of restoring the bank to health.
Other cantons are expected to follow the Solothurn example, as competition
in Swiss banking intensifies.
The bank's SFr170m share capital, entirely owned by the cantonal government,
is being completely written off. SBC, however, is paying a net SFr113m for
goodwill.
Holders of the 400,000 dividend participation certificates issued to the
public in 1987 at SFr220, and in 1989 at SFr200, are being offered SFr20 in
cash for each certificate, or a two-year option worth SFr22 to buy SBC
registered shares.
SBC is also offering each certificate-holder the right to open a savings
account up to SFr50,000 in the successor bank, to be known as Solothurner
Bank. These accounts will carry an interest rate 1 per cent above that on a
senior citizen's account for two years. SBC estimates the value of this
offer at SFr70 per certificate.
Solothurner Kantonalbank has SFr1.2bn in uncertain loans, against which it
has SFr475m in provisions.
The canton has agreed to pay SFr34m towards interest provisions in 1996 and
in 1997, and then guarantee a further SFr125m after 1998.
Its overall guarantee on the bank's affairs will stand until the end of
1996, or until the expiry of existing term deposits.
SBC will operate the new bank, with its 22 branches and 460 employees,
separately from its own retail network.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Thai minister resigns over resort land scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Suthep Thuaksuban, Thailand's deputy agriculture minister, has resigned
following claims that he had helped to assign land on the resort island
Phuket to 10 rich families under a scheme designed to help landless farmers.
The resignation should ease a political crisis that has threatened to stymie
the chances of Mr Chuan Leekpai becoming the first Thai premier to lead a
government to its full four-year term.
The land scandal has been given blanket coverage in the Thai press, partly
because Mr Suthep is seen to have perverted the government's much touted
promise to boost incomes of the rural poor. Opposition parties - delighted
to have some dirt to mar the Democrat party's squeaky clean reputation -
have warned that a censure debate due on December 14 will go ahead as
planned.
With Mr Suthep gone the opposition will now try to bring down the Democrat
party's agriculture minister, Mr Niphon Promphan. Mr Niphon was less
directly implicated but the family of his political secretary, a Democrat
MP, received one of the parcels of land.
Until the land scandal broke 10 days ago the opposition parties had been
unusually subdued this year, partly because of revelations that several
opposition members of parliament are banned from the US because of suspected
narcotics trafficking.
Although some embittered members of the coalition's Buddhist Force party
have threatened to vote with the opposition over the land scandal, most
government critics appear satisfied with one or two resignations and the
promise of a full inquiry.
The more serious threat to the five-party coalition, overshadowed by the
scandal, comes from within: General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the ambitious
interior minister has threatened to pull his New Aspiration party out of the
coalition if he is not permitted to vote against a key part of government
policy - the democratisation of local government. Mr Chavalit thinks that if
he campaigns against the proposal to have village leaders elected, grateful
local chiefs will ensure their communities vote for his party at the next
election.
Yesterday, however, the Democrats and NAP appeared to be edging towards a
compromise.

Lebanon's prosecutor-general is to study files handed over by President
Elias Hrawi accusing two top Moslem political leaders of corruption.
Judicial officials said yesterday that Mr Hrawi delivered files on Mr
Hussein Husseini, former parliamentary speaker, and Mr Omar Karami, former
prime minister, whom he accused last week of understating the price of
properties bought in order to avoid taxes. Mr Hrawi's son Roy has been
linked by a parliamentary deputy to drug dealing.
The president made the accusations against the ministers while rallying to
the defence of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, at the weekend after
the premier had offered to resign citing obstruction from critics accusing
him of corruption.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Balladur promises 'new EU impulse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday promised to try to
give the European Union 'a new impulse' during his nation's EU presidency in
the first half of next year.
In a speech that sought to cool the feverish French debate on Europe, he
steered a middle course between the Eurosceptical views of prominent fellow
Gaullists like Mr Philippe Seguin, national assembly president, and the
Eurofederalism espoused by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president.
Mr Seguin, who led the fight in France against the Maastricht treaty two
years ago, returned to the attack yesterday by saying the treaty was 'not
immovable' and could be drastically revised by the EU's planned
constitutional conference in 1996.
To Mr Seguin, who backs his presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr
Balladur replied that 'the nation state and Europe should not be put in
opposition to each other. . . . because both are needed to build the
future'.
To Mr Delors' statement this week that only a federalist Europe could
combine efficiency with minimum centralisation of the Union, he retorted
that the essential was to 'define clear goals and the will to pursue them'
without entering 'institutional debates that are often completely
theoretical'.
If Mr Delors has really decided to stay out of the French presidency race,
as his aides indicate, Mr Balladur will have less need to repeat his
critical remarks about Eurofederalism and be freer to pitch for more
pro-European ground.
But a Delors opt-out will by no means remove the conflicting domestic
political pressures on the French presidency of the EU, as events yesterday
made clear. President Francois Mitterrand used a cabinet meeting to remind
Mr Charles Pasqua, hardline Gaullist interior minister, that France had
'given its word' to Chancellor Helmut Kohl that it would do its best to
establish his project for Europol, a Europe-wide police network, which Mr
Pasqua has been resisting.
At the same time, the government exposed its other flank when Mr Jose Rossi,
industry minister, signalled to the National Assembly that France was ready
to accept an international ban on direct shipbuilding subsidies. Deputies
allied to Mr Chirac, who has made continued aid to shipyards part of his
presidential campaign, said the government was condemning the yards to a
slow death.
Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who is the main pro-Chirac 'cuckoo' in
the government nest, also made a statement about the increasing
'unsustainability' of French peacekeepers in Bosnia. The domestic politics
of the Bosnia impasse have been that no presidential candidate believes any
longer that French forces serve a very useful role there, but none wants to
open himself to electoral charges of cowardice by openly calling for their
withdrawal.

FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oftel's consultative document may contain few hard conclusions, but it does
have a clear philosophy - that the UK telecoms market should eventually be
less intensively regulated. Such a philosophy should be good for the
market's growth. BT, in particular, has finally woken up to the fact that
marketing can expand the use of telecoms services. Deregulation will give BT
and its competitors greater freedom to set prices. Further stimulation of
the market should follow.
That said, the details of what is finally decided will have a big impact on
the relative positions of the main operators. At present, it looks as if
Mercury Communications will gain in the short term but BT will benefit in
the longer run. Oftel seems intent on reforming and then abolishing the
ungainly system of 'access deficit contributions'. This should mean Mercury
will pay BT lower fees for shunting calls over its network.
But the likely quid pro quo is that BT will receive freedom to rebalance its
tariffs, by raising standing charges but cutting call prices. Such
rebalancing will not occur overnight, if only because BT will want to avoid
the resultant flak. But, over time, falling call charges will keep a squeeze
on Mercury, making this week's cost-cutting doubly important. The winners
will be the cable television industry. As BT puts up standing charges, the
cable companies will raise theirs too.

FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Woodrow active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction group Taylor Woodrow was the day's most actively traded stock,
with the group instigating a big buy-back programme aimed at mopping up 10
per cent of its equity. Turnover of 58m shares suggested that by the close
nearly 70 per cent of the repurchase target had been achieved.
The move pushed the shares 5 higher to 124p. Analysts saw potential follow
ups by other building companies as unlikely. With limited borrowings and a
big property portfolio - net rentals account for some two-thirds of group
operating profits - Taylow Woodrow is seen as unique within the sector.
Worries over political instability in the wake of the government's House of
Commons defeat on the VAT on fuel Bill hit utilities.
One suggestion was that the chancellor may instead opt for a special tax on
the proceeds of the impending sale of the National grid, which is owned by
the 12 generators. East Midlands fell 23 to 715p, Eastern surrendered 20 to
767p, National Power lost 17 1/2 at 484 1/2p in trade of 5.9m and PowerGen
shed 25 1/2 to 512 1/2p.
South Wales was one of a handful of stocks in the sector that managed to
resist the market trend after the excellent interim figures. The shares put
on 9 at 780p. Bid speculation continued to boost Northern, which moved 4
higher to 863p.
Water stocks also came under pressure on worries that the government may
reconsider a windfall tax on high dividend payments as an alternative source
of revenue. Market watchers also pointed out that the latest increase in
interest rates would render the sector less attractive to yield buyers.
North West tumbled 23 to 500p.
Brewing and leisure group Bass forged ahead 15 to 519p, the day's sharpest
rise among Footsie constituents, after full-year figures well ahead of
expectations.
Profits increased by nearly 9 per cent to Pounds 552m, against a range of
forecasts between Pounds 534m and Pounds 548m. The 21.1p dividend was also
better than anticipated.
Brokers upgraded current year forecasts - Kleinwort Benson added Pounds 13m
to its original estimate, lifting to Pounds 600m for the current year, and
by Pounds 14m to Pounds 669m for 1996. Turnover in the shares rose to 3.2m,
twice the daily average.
Barclays finished a penny lower at 599p after Hoare Govett reduced its 1994
profits forecast to Pounds 1.95bn from Pounds 2.05bn. The house said the cut
reflected redemption of US loan capital, and slightly lower than expected
turnover at the bank's BZW division. Dealers said Cazenove, one of the
bank's brokers, had also changed its figures.
BT was the most active Footsie stock, with 12m shares changing hands,
following the publication of Oftel's consultative paper on telecoms
regulation. The stock rose 6 to 376p, with Oftel's thinking seen as slightly
more generous to BT than expected.
The document confirmed stock market hopes for sizeable cost savings at Cable
and Wireless, with its Mercury unit likely to face a lower contribution to
BT's so-called access deficit.
C&amp;W gained 3 at 371p, but Vodafone, perceived as a marginal beneficiary from
telecoms changes, dipped 2 to 192p in 6.1m turnover.
The latest rise in interest rates added further pressure to an already
weakened retail sector. Retailing stocks have fallen sharply in recent
sessions on nervousness about Christmas trading, and analysts said the
interest rate rise could only add to the gloom in the sector.
Kingfisher declined 7 to 434p and Dixons shed 3 1/2 to 184p. MFI lost a
penny at 129p. Boots gave up 4 to 481p. Goldman Sachs, which turned negative
on the sector at the beginning of the week, yesterday issued a note
suggesting the shares were overvalued by 5 per cent.
Exploration and production groups Enterprise and Lasmo receded 5 to 376p and
a penny to 143p respectively as SGST reiterated its cautious view of the
stocks following a meeting with its energy consultant. The oils team came
away with its gloomy outlook for oil prices confirmed.
Oil major BP suffered from US selling and fell 3 1/2 to 407p.
Carlton Communications jumped 16 to 868p after the shares responded to
enthusiasm over the company's full-year figures.
The 50 per cent boost in profits to Pounds 190m was accompanied by what one
specialist des-cribed as 'a quantum shift to openness'.
Mirror Group Newspapers slipped 3 to 133p and Telegraph receded 5 to 345p on
concern that the government might introduce VAT on newspapers following its
defeat over increasing the tax on fuel.
Media conglomerate Pearson improved 3 to 586p as the market began to focus
on prospects for BSkyB, in which Pearson has a significant stake. Analysts
expect that the shares will be priced initially at above 250p when
conditional trading begins today, giving a capitalisation of around Pounds
4.3bn.
The possibility that De La Rue, the bank note printer, would make an agreed
bid of around 900p a share for Portals, the security and specialist paper
maker, saw Portals leap 45 to 816p.
Nevertheless, analysts argued that even around the 900p level a bid would
not be dilutive and De La Rue shares recovered 4 to 967p.
Car parts group Avon Rubber tumbled 26 to 494p following weak full-year
profits.

FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL sunk by OFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Submarine maker VSEL went into a crash-dive following the decision by the
Office of Fair Trading to refer the takeover bids from both GEC and British
Aerospace to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission.
The early afternoon announcement stunned the stock market, which quickly
marked VSEL down 200 to 1335p, against a high for the year of 1548p. BAe
retreated 4 to 433p and GEC hardened 2 1/2 to 275 1/2 p.
The OFT ruling led to widespread head scratching among analysts. Just about
the only sensible conclusion was that the VSEL takeover situation is now
firmly on hold until March 15 when the MMC is due to make its deliberations
known.
There was very little trading in the shares of the three protagonists, with
GEC and BAe notching up 3m turnover apiece and 1.2m VSEL shares changing
hands. A big 12m volume in the BAe units mostly took place during the
morning.
Most dealers were agreed that a potential bid of some description for VSEL
was still in the wings, and that the submarine group's shares could well
prove oversold. GEC's interim statement - due today - was eagerly awaited.

FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had another volatile day, with early gains eradicated in
later trading as Wall Street opened lower, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,007 at the close of pit trading,
down 15 points for a two-day decline of 34 points, wiping out nearly the
whole of Monday's strong rise.
At the official 4.10pm close there was a discount to the cash market of
almost five points. For fair value the December contract needs to stand at a
two-point premium.
Trading was again average at best, with 17,453 lots traded, but within this
total more than 5,000 were spread trading as investors rolled over into the
March contract.
The session started strongly, with a steady premium to the cash market
building to around five points. But there was never any real attempt to lead
cash equities upwards and when Wall Street opened the mood turned sour.
The premium to cash equities was quickly replaced by a discount, and having
touched a day's best of 3,047 during the morning, December was down to 3,002
at one time just before pit trading ended.
Traded option volume was also slow, falling from Tuesday's 43,188 lots to
33,407. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business was some 22,000 lots. National Power
was the most active stock option, with 973 contracts dealt.

FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market struggles after
interest rate rise - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market successfully rode out potentially one of the most
turbulent trading sessions in recent months, in spite of a major defeat of
the government in the House of Commons, a rise of  1/2 percentage point in
domestic interest rates, a Pounds 2bn gilts auction and a warning of
possible further US interest rate increases in the short term.
One of the top dealers at a leading UK securities house described the
trading session as 'one of the most difficult for many months; all the big
traders are reluctant to get involved in such awkward markets'.
At the close of a dramatic day the FT-SE 100-share Index was down a mere 3.6
at 3,012.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem, finishing 4.9 lower at
3,425.3.
But dealers were under no illusions about the market stability in the short
term. Wall Street was swinging around during London trading hours, and was
down almost 20 points 1 1/2 hours after London closed.
Most of the drama occurred in the first two hours of trading. The
Conservative government's defeat on Tuesday evening over the implementation
of the second stage of VAT on domestic fuel was the trigger for a flurry of
selling pressure in sterlimg, gilts and equities at the outset of trading.
The market's response was to mark down both gilts and stocks, albeit by
smaller than expected amounts, to try to head off any large-scale selling.
Meanwhile, the markets picked up the scent of a possible cut in UK interest
rates to prevent a sell-off in sterling and encourage demand for the Pounds
2bn gilts auction.
As soon as the 50 basis-point rise in interest rates was known the equity
market staged a dramatic reversal, racing ahead strongly in the wake of a
gilts market that rallied from being down a half-point to up 1/4 .
The FT-SE 100, which was 13.0 lower at its worst, was transformed,
accelerating to post a near 19 points rise in mid-morning. The markets,
dealers said, were happy that the chancellor of the exchequer and the
Governor of the Bank of England had moved so decisively to prevent a run on
sterling and to choke off any build-up of inflationary pressures in the
economy.
Thereafter the pace of market activity slackened and the 100-share index
began to drift easier, with traders looking towards Wall Street for a lead.
The US stock market's good showing overnight had given a boost to European
markets early on. But with Wall Street coming under pressure at the opening,
after comments on excessive growth in the US economy by Fed chairman Mr Alan
Greenspan, the UK market fell back into negative territory.
Marketmakers remained cautious about short term trends in equities ahead of
news of the chancellor's new moves to provide for the Pounds 1.5bn Budget
shortfall. Utilities were given a thorough shaking, and closed sharply lower
amid worries that the sector may yet be the subject of a windfall profits
tax.
Some strategists refused to be panicked by the rate rise. Mr Richard Jeffrey
at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said the rise had 'cleared the air'
and that he expected the market to move higher between now and the end of
the year, as the gilts market leads people to look towards 1995.
There was general disappointment among brokers at the continuing low level
of customer business. Turnover yesterday was a poor 596.7m shares, with
non-Footsie stocks providing 58 per cent of the total.
The Office of Fair Trading produced the biggest shock of the day,
recommending that the British Aerospace and GEC bids for VSEL, the submarine
manufacturer, be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a move
that stunned the market. VSEL shares plummeted.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fear of interest rate rise
unsettles equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities zig-zagged in negative territory yesterday amid new signs that
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again in the near term and
worries about the implications of Orange County's declaration of bankruptcy,
writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.43 at 3,735.52.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.88 to 451.23, the
American Stock Exchange composite receded 1.82 to 429.19 and the Nasdaq
composite was 6.96 weaker at 734.27. Trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange amounted to 285.6m shares.
The Dow hit its low for the day as Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, told a Congressional panel that he continued to be
concerned about the inflationary pressures on the economy. Although consumer
prices have held steady so far this year, Mr Greenspan said he believed that
producers would try ultimately to pass increasing prices on to consumers.
Mr Greenspan justified the Fed's six interest rate increases this year as a
means to stamp out both inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations
and gave no indication that he believed either had been completely stopped.
The closely watched Beige Book, released yesterday in advance of the
December 20 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, reported economic
activity continuing at the strong pace of recent months and said rises in
raw and intermediate material costs were being passed through to the prices
of some final products. The Fed's report also said early holiday season
retail sales were strong in nearly all regions of the US.
Most economists believe that the Fed will boost rates again in the next two
to three months, but few place high odds on a rate increase after the
upcoming open market committee meeting, because of the proximity to
Christ-mas. The market is concerned that another interest rate increase
would slow demand and deter corporate borrowing, causing an erosion in
corporate earnings.
Also troubling the market was the announcement after Monday's close that
Orange County, California, had filed for bankruptcy protection after
sustaining Dollars 1.5bn in unrealised losses in its investment portfolio.
Shares of Merrill Lynch - one of the county's largest lenders - fell Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 on worries over exposure to the bankruptcy.
Steel companies gained ground following unconfirmed reports late on Tuesday
that USX-US Steel Group had achieved a favourable contract with General
Motors. News of the contract which, it was reported, allows a 16 per cent
price increase over two years, sent the USX price forward Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 34 5/8 .
Other steel suppliers gained after a Lehman Brothers analyst upgraded the
companies on the basis of the USX reports. Bethlehem Steel firmed Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 , Inland Steel Industries rose Dollars 1/2 to Dollars
34 3/8 , WHX put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 3/8 and Geneva Steel was up
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 13.
Continental Corporation, the holding company for Continental Insurance,
jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 18 3/4 after news that it would be acquired
by CNA Financial for Dollars 1.1bn in cash. Shares in CNA increased by
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63.
Price/Costco relinquished Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 14 1/4 on news that the
discount retailer would pull out of its joint venture in Mexico. The
company's chief rival south of the border, Wal-Mart Stores, gained Dollars
1/8 at Dollars 22 1/2 on the news.
Canada
Surging gold shares masked what was otherwise a day of fairly broad-based
losses on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The TSE 300 index ended virtually unchanged, up 0.34 point at 4,079.78, on a
day when there was little good news to support markets. Orange County's
bankruptcy filing in the US and the opening salvo in Canada of the
separatist Parti Quebecois's sovereignty campaign reverberated across
currency, bond and equity markets.
Declines outnumbered advances by 420 to 330 after volume of 54.3m shares
valued at CDollars 671m. Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were down, led by
financial services, oil, conglomerate and transportation stocks.
Gold, real estate, pipelines, industrial products and utilities made gains.
The golds index jumped 3.70 per cent.
Brazil
Sao Paulo finished 0.5 per cent firmer in light trade after the
privatisation of aircraft manufacturer Embraer, and on continued
position-squaring ahead of the futures index and option markets settlements
on December 14 and 19. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares gained
242 at 45,972.
Earlier, Brazil's government sold a 55.4 per cent controlling stake in
Embraer for RDollars 154.1m (Dollars 182.4m), up just 0.3 per cent from the
RDollars 153.7m minimum price. Embraer preferred plummeted after the auction
to close 17.2 per cent down at RDollars 65.40.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Positive 1995 scenarios for Asian
equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a disappointing performance for Asian equity markets during 1994 at
least two brokers have produced positive scenarios for the region next year,
writes John Pitt.
Salomon Brothers is on record with a prediction that while turbulence is
likely to continue, a rise of some 20 per cent in individual indices could
be attained. However, the broker notes that liquidity is likely to be down
from the levels seen in 1994.
Mr Alan Butler-Henderson, Baring's director of Asian strategy, was equally
upbeat at a presentation in London earlier this week. He saw markets
accelerating by between 20 to 30 per cent in 1995. In common with Salomon he
picked the Philippines as having the potential for the strongest
performance.

Gold shares made most of the running in Johannesburg as stable bullion
prices and a weaker financial rand triggered foreign buying. The golds index
forged ahead 90 or 4.8 per cent to 1,971, while the overall index put on 51
at 5,773.
Among active gold issues, Randfontein Estates advanced R4.25 to R42 and
Harties R1.25 to R20. Driefontein and Kloof finished at R60.25 and R57.50
respectively, R2.50 and R2 stronger.
De Beers continued its recent recovery, closing R2.75 higher at R93.25.
Industrial shares were steady, the sector index rising 6 to 6,922. AECI, the
chenicals group, was unchanged at R34 after an announcement that ICI had
sold its 13.3 per cent stake to the UK merchant bank SG Warburg for Pounds
80m.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei takes its lead
from Chicago futures
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 eased 166.24 to 19,174.23 as traders cashed in two days of
gains and arbitrageurs unwound positions due to lower overnight Chicago
futures prices, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The 225 index slid from an early high of 19,305.56, traders attributing a
decline of 105.42 in the first 15 minutes of trading to futures-led sales
followed by a wave of profit-taking. In the afternoon the market continued
its decline as the index fell to a low of 19,138.83, then recovered slightly
by the close.
Volume was estimated at 222m shares. The first-section Topix index slipped
10.14 to 1,525.35 and the Nikkei 300 ended at 281.45, down 1.90, while falls
outstripped rises by 742 to 259, with 181 issues unchanged. But in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.24 at 1,263.77.
A dip in the dollar below Y100 undercut remaining bullish sentiment, and
renewed exchange rate concerns. Most large exporters, including the
high-technology companies which led Monday's advance, suffered. Sony fell
Y180 to Y5,330 and Pioneer Electronic, which earlier in the day announced an
advanced commercial karaoke on-line system, closed at Y2,300, off Y80.
The major brokerage houses retreated: Nomura shed Y50 to Y2,040 and Nikko
Securities Y40 to Y1,160.
Steelmaker NKK, the volume leader, held at Y278. Nippon Steel, the third
most active issue, was up Y1 at Y374.
Privatised stocks were mixed. NTT retreated Y11,000 to Y835,000 after a
newspaper reported that the government was considering the issue of bonds
convertible into NTT stock. Eight years after privatisation, the government
remains the majority shareholder in NTT. East Japan Railway, ending
unchanged in the last three sessions, gained Y4,000 at Y473,000. Japan
Tobacco firmed Y1,000 to Y956,000 and Japan Telecom, on the second section,
remained at Y3.25m.
Daiei moved up Y30 to Y1,430 on reports that the major retailer plans to
enter the personal handy telephone system market through capital
participation with Astel Tokyo, a PHS operating company.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 107.08 to 21,213.50 in volume of 53.5m
shares. Roundup
A weak trend afflicted much of the region.
SEOUL encountered late profit-taking in blue chips and some
smaller-capitalised shares after three days of gains. The composite stock
index lost 6.08 at 1,068.93, after a day's high of 1,080.66.
Hyundai group shares gained momentum on the belief that they had been
undervalued. Hyundai Pipe went limit up by Won800 to Won167,000 and Hyundai
Engineering and Construction rose Won700 to Won41,600.
Hyundai Precision appreciated Won700 to Won23,600 on news that the
government had given the company the go-ahead to assemble Mitsubishi's
mini-van.
HONG KONG was indecisive, awaiting further direction from London and Wall
Street, and the Hang Seng index ended down 64.15 at 8,268.50. Turnover crept
up to HKDollars 2.7bn, from HKDollars 2.6bn on Tuesday.
BOMBAY fell 1.5 per cent amid widespread selling by foreign and domestic
mutual funds and an absence of buying support, ahead of today's close of the
monthly account. The BSE 30-share index shed 61.98 to 3,978.39.
Analysts said the weakness was triggered by hectic selling of India's top
two blue chip companies. Reliance lost Rs17.50 or 4.6 per cent at Rs366.25
and Tisco slid Rs13.75 or 4.9 per cent to Rs265.
SINGAPORE managed to pare some of its early losses but still closed lower.
The Straits Times Industrial index ended 6.69 off at 2,180.38 and the UOB
OTC index, tracking Malaysian stocks, slipped 1.1 to 1,083.78.
KUALA LUMPUR turned softer in the afternoon amid dwindling volume, with the
composite index closing 2.0 down at 951.68, off an early high of 962.58. The
index was again pulled down by falls in the utility giants Tenaga Nasional
and Telekom Malaysia, which saw continued foreign fund selling.
Tenaga and Telekom dipped 10 cents each to MDollars 10.10 and MDollars 17.10
respectively.
BANGKOK was lower in thin turnover ahead of today's vote on a proposed
constitutional amendment which could reduce the power of many local
authority officials. The SET index finished 12.24 points down at 1,330.35.
SYDNEY was weaker in light volume after the Reserve Bank failed to unveil a
widely expected rise in official short-term interest rates before the start
of trading. The All Ordinaries index ended 21.9 or 1.2 per cent down at
1,869.2, just off its intraday low of 1,868.8.
WELLINGTON was pulled down to a low for the year by weakness among leading
stocks, and particularly Telecom, 6 cents cheaper at NZDollars 5.16. The
NZSE-40 Capital index fell 10.16 to 1,931.29.
TAIPEI closed 1.0 per cent higher in heavy trade which saw the weighted
index rise 68.21 to 6,777.68. Turnover amounted to TDollars 86.2bn.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Orange County aftermath hits
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reaction to the Orange County derivatives debacle in California led to a
sharp sell-off at the long end of the US bond market; German bunds moved
from consolidation into decline and Continental equity bourses from mundane
to morose, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT traders mooted a switch from banks to automotive stocks as the Dax
index rose 8.72 to 2,055.60 on the session, but a lot of heads were
retracted as it eased to an Ibis-indicated 2,044.04 after hours.
Turnover fell from DM5.3bn to DM5.1bn. Gains of over a percentage point for
both Daimler and Volkswagen almost disappeared, with the former unchanged at
DM747 by the end of the afternoon, and the latter only DM2 ahead at DM422.
With BMW down DM5 to DM750, this left the automotive trio roughly parallel
with the big three banks.
Deutsche Bank fell DM3.30 to DM732.60 after its 10-month figures, Dresdner
recovered a token 60 pfg to DM409.10 and Commerzbank, a touch oversold on
Tuesday, rose DM2.10 to DM322.10.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said it was not the time to get into
auto stocks; and he did not agree with predictions of an early rise in
German interest rates. 'Germany is two years behind the UK in the economic
recovery process,' he said, 'and UK interest rates did not rise until last
September.'
ZURICH was unable to hold on to early gains after Wall Street's weak opening
and the SMI index finished 4.8 lower at 2,584.3, off a high of 2,601.9.
Banks remained under pressure, with investors still switching between the
big three and into insurers, amid worries about sluggish 1994 earnings. Bank
Vontobel downgraded its 1994 earnings forecasts for the three this week but
raised its 1995 estimates.
UBS bearers dropped SFr12 to SFr1,122, SBC gave up SFr8 to SFr362 and CS
Holding ended SFr5 lower at SFr536. Swiss Re, recommended by a private
Geneva bank, picked up SFr2 to SFr791.
A SFr100 fall by Interdiscount to a low for the year of SFr1,640 was
attributed to a bearish note on the electronics retailer by Credit Suisse.
PARIS ended with a rise of just 0.89 at 1,969.84. Turnover was unexceptional
at FFr3.2bn.
In the automotive sector, Michelin slipped FFr2.70 to FFr197.20 on
unconfirmed reports that the stock had been downgraded, while Valeo, which
supplies parts to the industry, fell FFr10.70 or 4 per cent to FFr255.30.
Valeo has fallen some 20 per cent since it reached a year's high in the
middle of January, but has improved 8.5 per cent since its 1994 low in June.
Nikko Europe, earlier this month, revised upwards its 1994 profits forecast
for the company to FFr995m, and estimated profits at FFr1.15bn for 1995,
based on an expected improvement in the European car market.
MILAN had many absentees ahead of today's national holiday, as the Comit
index gave up 1.76 to 613.60.
Credito Romagnolo rose L491 or 2.8 per cent to L17,900 as speculation
continued that the offer from Credito Italiano at L20,000 a share, approved
yesterday by the Bank of Italy, still faced a challenge from Cariplo or IMI.
Italiano slipped L13 to L1,581 and IMI was L10 lower at L9,621. Cariplo has
made no public comment but IMI yesterday kept its options open, although it
ruled out a lone bid for control.
Telecom Italia declined L67 to L3,965 after a government committee postponed
a decision on liberalising analogue mobile phone tariffs and lowering its
licence fee.
Autostrade preferred stock jumped L55 to L2,032 after the public works
minister said ordinary shares in the state controlled motorways group could
be listed next year.
AMSTERDAM searched around to find direction and closed with the AEX index
off 1.09 at 410.09.
Hoogovens, down 90 cents at Fl 75.40, attracted further positive comment
from Goldman Sachs, which remarked that, in spite of the stock's recent
underperformance, the group remained one of the best in the sector, lifting
its 1994 earnings forecast to Fl 6.55 per share from Fl 6.00.
MADRID, in a week shortened by holidays on Tuesday and today, played
construction stocks for gains as the general index eased 0.45 to 304.21.
Turnover was Pta22.2bn, boosted by block trades. Dragados rose Pta50 or 2.4
per cent to Pta2,085.
WARSAW blamed a delayed reaction to Monday's announcement of a new 0.2 per
cent stock transaction tax from January 1 as the Wig index closed 343.7 or
4.3 per cent lower at 7,702.5.
After the tax was accepted by parliament, the Wig index dropped to a 1994
low of 6,716 on November 16, but last week it pushed back to 8,177 on
revived optimism.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Pound firms as base rate rises to 6.25 per
cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling gained ground on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the UK base
rate was raised to 6.25 per cent, from 5.75 per cent, writes Philip Gawith.
The Bank of England's decision to lift rates, announced before 10am, took
the market by surprise. While a minority of analysts had predicted that
rates would rise this month, there had been little expectation of an
announcement before today.
The early move would appear to be the result of the Treasury and the Bank of
England wanting to calm markets, following the government's defeat in
parliament the night before on a VAT vote.
Analysts agreed that sterling should benefit from another pre-emptive rise
in interest rates, but said political uncertainty would continue to cap its
gains.
The pound closed in London at DM2.4576, up from DM2.45 before the rate
announcement. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5644, down from an
earlier high of around Dollars 1.5685, as the US currency strengthened in
afternoon trading.
Elsewhere, the dollar staged a strong recovery after congressional testimony
from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised expectations
of another rise in US interest rates. The dollar had earlier fallen below
Y100 as the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, unsettled investors.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.571, some  1/2 pfennig up from an earlier
low of DM1.5647. Against the yen it finished at Y100.15, up from a low of
Y99.70. It closed in New York at DM1.5675 and Y99.95.
Ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting, a Reuters poll of 20 City
economists found none of them expecting official interest rates to be cut.
Sixty per cent of them believe there will be no further reduction in German
rates.
The measure of the market's approval of the rise in UK rates could be found
in the behaviour of the short sterling futures contracts. The general
message, over all maturities, was that the market believed UK short-term
interest rates would now have less to rise than had been anticipated before
this latest move.
Volumes in the futures markets were heavy, with the March contract trading
around 71,000 lots, to finish at 92.56, up from 92.50 on Tuesday, and a low
for the day of 92.40.
One money market source said he now doubted whether rates would be moved
again before February at the earliest. He predicted a slowdown in the
economy during the first quarter of 1995. He said the levels of rates being
discounted in the futures market - 7.4 per cent in March 1995, 8.8 per cent
by December 1995 - were 'ludicrous'.
As regards sterling, Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in
London, said political uncertainty could depress the currency in the short
term. After that, though, the monetary tightening would be seen 'ultimately,
as a bold gesture, designed to keep inflation at bay and likely to bring
credibility to UK policy, if not its politicians'.
Mr Persaud added that high real interest rates could push sterling to DM2.50
in the next three months.
Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, said the base
rate rise was a 'significant boost for sterling'. While political
uncertainty remained a problem, he said the pound would benefit from the
authorities having removed any doubt about the monetary policy outlook.
The combination of Mr Greenspan, and the release of the Fed's beige book,
was enough to perk up the dollar. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank
of America in London, said they 'greatly increase the chances of a
tightening at the December 20 FOMC'.
Mr Persaud said the spate of recent stories, indicating weakness in the US
financial sector, could undermine the dollar; if the Fed took financial
sector weakness as a reason not to raise rates, 'that would be a very
dangerous cocktail for the foreign exchange market'.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided late assistance to UK
money markets of Pounds 170m, after fore-casting a Pounds 950m shortage.
Earlier it had provided Pounds 573m assistance at the new rate of 6 1/8 per
cent, where bills were purchased outright, and 6 5/32 per cent where bills
were for resale to the market. Three-month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 7/16 per
cent.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia puts its oil industry
on the back burner - The country could soon become Opec's first net importer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty years ago this week Japanese troops in the jungles of central Sumatra
used abandoned American equipment to drill the only wildcat exploration oil
well in Indonesia during the long Pacific war.
The oil-soaked sand that the drill bit struck during the night of December 4
1944 turned out to be the Minas field, the largest oil accumulation east of
Iran and east Asia's only 'super-giant' field.
Its discovery came too late to change Japan's military fortunes. But in the
42 years since commercial production began Minas's low sulphur crude oil has
helped to fuel Japan's economic transformation.
It has also helped to pay for Indonesia's ambitious industrialisation plans.
But just as south-east Asia has become the fastest growing international oil
market, Indonesia is about to lose its status as a net oil exporter.
Many western companies say the day could be staved off if the government
eased the conditions under which they operate as contractors to Pertamina,
the state oil company. But the government appears to be betting that it can
be the first member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
switch its energy exports from oil to natural gas, the world's fastest
growing fossil fuel market. A recent World Bank report predicted that the
oil sector's share of gross domestic product would drop to about 6 per cent
by the year 2010, compared with 18 per cent in 1990 and 28 per cent in 1980.
Last month President Suharto told the Opec meeting in Bali that oil 'no
longer plays an important role' in the Indonesian economy.
But in spite of such statements there is considerable sensitivity about when
the country will become a net oil importer.
The government says Indonesia can maintain its current status well into the
next decade. Oil industry executives say it is likely to become a net
importer before 2000, in spite of some easing last year of exploration
terms.
'The government is not seriously encouraging exploration,' said one US oil
company executive in Jakarta. 'Even if they change their terms now they
might find they have done so too late because the exploration cycle takes so
long.'
A British executive said: 'Pertamina understands the need to modify their
exploration terms, but the government does not.'
Some executives say Indonesia's success in diversifying its export base has
had a big impact on the government's thinking about the importance of the
oil industry.
The World Bank predicts that the decline of oil export earnings means that
non-oil exports will need to generate about 85 per cent of Indonesia's total
export earnings in 2000.
Textile and timber products, the two main non-oil exports, are not showing
substantial growth. Textile exports are actually slowing down. But there are
fast-growing sectors, among which the World Bank lists ceramics, non-ferrous
metals and electronic goods, which are poised to take over from oil.
Oil industry dissatisfaction with the government's current terms are
reflected in the downturn in recent exploration activity. A report by Mackay
Consultants of the UK says the number of offshore exploration and appraisal
wells drilled this year has fallen to 45, compared with 48 in 1993.
Other analysts, such as Mr Gavin Law of international oil consultants Wood
Mackenzie, say the downward trend is likely to continue, even though
Indonesia has attractive frontier acreage, especially in the eastern part of
the country around Irian Jaya.
He believes part of the problem is that Jakarta does not allow companies to
offset high frontier exploration costs against their more mature production
elsewhere in the country. A single exploration well in Irian Jaya can cost
Dollars 20m or more because of the remote location and harsh conditions,
compared with Dollars 2m or so in more developed areas.
The lack of exploration success has caused some western companies to reduce
their presence in the country, concentrating, in preference, on neighbouring
Malaysia and Vietnam where they say terms are better.
Other companies, however, are responding to the government's greater
emphasis on gas. The signing last month of the Dollars 40bn contract with
Exxon, the US energy group, to develop the giant Natuna gas field should
help Indonesia to maintain its status as the world's largest exporter of
liquefied natural gas.
Other gas fields are being developed for power generation within Indonesia,
although questions over future government policies on electricity pricing
and regulation could still hamper plans for gas to increase its share of
domestic primary energy consumption to 32 per cent by 2000, from the current
level of 25 per cent.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU eases 'mad cow' curbs on
British beef
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's veterinary committee yesterday lifted restrictions
on some beef exports from the UK which were introduced in July because of
fears about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or 'mad cow disease'.
Farmers welcomed the move as it eases controls on the most lucrative section
of the export market for prime beef.
The vets decided producers no longer needed to certify that animals born in
the UK after January 1 1992 had not been in herds affected by BSE if they
wanted to export carcass meat.
Rules introduced in July at the insistence of the Germans forced producers
to go on a time-consuming search for the history of the animals they were
selling to ensure they had not been in herds affected by BSE in the previous
six years.
Since 1992 the incidence of BSE in the UK has declined to a rate naturally
occurring in most European Union countries, so animals born after that date
are unlikely to be affected.
'The change in the rules is a considerable alleviation of a bureaucratic
burden for many farmers and should be a welcome boost for the beef export
market,' said an official at the National Farmers' Union.
The easing of restrictions affects around a third of carcass beef exports.
And as the meat comes from prime beef cattle it is the highest-value part of
the market. Most beef exported to EU countries is from old cows, which will
still be subject to the rules.
There was a drop off in prime beef exports from Britain following the
imposition of the new rules.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tanzanian farming embarks on a
quiet revolution - Paula Hawkins on a privately-backed programme emphasising
science-based agricultural technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the village of Imbaseny, Tanzania, a slow and quiet agricultural
revolution has been taking place over the past few years.
John Elisamia, an Imbaseny farmer, points to his healthy maize crop, the
cobs twice the size of those grown by farmers just two miles along the road.
He is expecting yields of 18 to 20 bags (90kg each) a hectare this year. Six
years ago, he was getting only two or three bags.
His secret is simple: correct spacing, timely weeding and, most important,
the use of chemical fertilisers.
Environmentalists need not cry 'foul' as the volume of fertiliser used -
about 25kg a hectare - is still well below the average used even in
low-income economies. According to Norman Borlaug, winner of the 1970 Nobel
Peace Prize for his part in India's 'Green Revolution', Mr Elisamia's
methods are those which must be adopted by Africa's peasant farmers on a
wide scale if the continent's agricultural decline is to be reversed.
'The single most economically viable and environmentally friendly action to
be taken is to promote moderate and proper use of chemical fertilisers in an
aggressive manner,' he says.
Mr Borlaug is president of the Sasakawa Africa Association, part of Sasakawa
Global 2000, an international agricultural programme financed by Japanese
businessman and philanthropist, Ryoichi Sasakawa, and supported by former US
president Jimmy Carter.
The programme emphasises science-based agricultural technology as the key to
increasing food production worldwide - an increasingly urgent task. Over the
past 80 years, the world's population has grown from 1.6bn to 5.6bn. In 1990
the world's food production could have provided an adequate diet for 6.2bn,
yet that same year more than 100m people in Africa faced food insecurity.
It is in rural Africa, home to more than 70 per cent of the continent's
population, that the problem is most pressing. Population is growing at an
annual rate of 3 to 4 per cent while agricultural output continues to
decline. If these trends continue, Africa will be able to supply only 75 per
cent of its own food by the year 2000.
SG 2000 came to Tanzania in 1989 and now has projects in seven regions,
involving more than 35,000 small-scale farmers. The scheme operates through
demonstration and training. Management test plots are established on land
owned by farmers involved in a three-year training programme. In the first
year inputs are provided on 100 per cent credit; in the second on 50 per
cent credit; and thereafter farmers must pay for inputs themselves.
Sasakawa provides vehicles, tools and comprehensive training. The project is
time-consuming and costly. Given SG 2000's annual budget (only USDollars 7m
worldwide), the scheme could not possibly be extended to every village in
Tanzania.
Michael Foster, SG 2000's country director in Tanzania, says that
'Sasakawa's primary objective is to form an education base' that will give
the revolution its own momentum, so that Imbaseny's experience might be
replicated countrywide.
More than half of the village's farmers have adopted some or all of
Sasakawa's methods.
According to Mr Foster, it is not essential that farmers use the precise
technology package advocated by SG 2000, nor even that all the correct
fertilisers and hybrids are readily available and affordable. What is
essential is that farmers understand the concept underlying the package, and
can thus adapt the methods to their particular circumstances.
The problems facing Tanzania's peasant farmers are immense - simply
increasing yields is not enough.
Agricultural budget cuts have led to lower agricultural imports, with the
result that fertiliser imports meet only 39 per cent of demand.
Storage also presents problems. John Elisamia estimates that he will lose
about a third of his harvest because he has inadequate storage facilities.
SG 2000's post-harvest technology programme involves building storage
facilities, but materials are neither cheap nor readily available.
The other main problem concerns marketing. There is no guaranteed market for
maize, and simply getting crops an outlet is a daunting task. Tanzania's
weak infrastructure and transport difficulties raise overheads considerably:
even in the relatively wealthy region of Arusha, roads are riddled with
potholes. The World Bank is funding the renovation of trunk roads, but
feeder roads to the rural areas receive little attention.
Any agricultural sector operates within the wider context of the economy as
a whole: in Tanzania, that economy happens to be enormously aid-dependent
and the second poorest in the world. Imbaseny's agricultural revolution
stands little chance of spreading unless this general economic climate
improves; if it does not, SG 2000's project may be relegated, like so many
before it, to Africa's aid programme junkyard.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Integrated farming groups to
link up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five British groups promoting sustainable agriculture are expected to band
together this week in an informal alliance to pursue less-intensive
production methods.
The umbrella group, to be called the Integrated Arable Crop Production
Alliance, will enable the groups to work more closely together, spread
resources more effectively and achieve better publicity for the results of
their studies.
Integrated farming aims to reduce the application of artificial inputs such
as herbicides and pesticides while maintaining profitability. Most of the
current research projects are investigating the environmental benefits of
cutting inputs and how far they can be reduced without hurting profits.
The new group will include: Life, a project funded by the Ministry of
Agriculture and part of a European network of integrated farm research;
Link, which is looking at integrated farm systems on different soil types;
and Leaf, which promotes farm practices where care for the environment is
combined with modern methods.
The other two members will be Focus on Farming Practice, a study conducted
by the Co-op's farm branch in Leicestershire, and the Farm and Wildlife
Advisory Group, which works with farmers to minimise their impact on the
environment.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Big money yet to be seen - Lack of
infrastructure is constraining tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1970s Bui Xuan Nhat was a key figure in the Paris negotiations
aimed at ending the war in Vietnam and putting a stop to US involvement in
the country. Twenty years on, Mr Nhat, a former diplomat, now deputy
chairman of Vietnam's tourist authority, is trying to woo Americans back to
explore the beauties of his country and revisit old battlefields.
'We think the US is a very big market for our tourism industry,' says Mr
Nhat. 'Hundreds of thousands of American troops were here. Many of them want
to come back and see where they fought.'
Already there are special tours for American war veterans, with visits
organised to battle sites such as Khe Sanh and along the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Vets can see some of the mountain of US weaponry left behind when Vietnamese
forces finally took control of Ho Chi Minh City in 1975. They can even buy
back some of their old kit from souvenir shops at the city's war crimes
museum.
But the US tourist assault on Vietnam has yet to take place. The French, in
the country long before the Americans, are back in large numbers. Vietnam
has become the latest vogue tourist spot for many other Europeans. Numbers
are rising fast: according to official statistics Vietnam had 250,000
tourists in 1990. This rose to more than 650,000 in 1993 and forecasts for
this year predict at least 900,000 visitors.
'We aim to have more than three million tourists by the end of the century,'
says Mr Nhat. 'Tourism will make a big contribution to our foreign exchange
earnings. There are some problems in the industry but we are confident they
can be overcome.'
Some might feel Mr Nhat is being overly optimistic. For the moment, Vietnam
is an excellent destination for the more adventurous type of traveller. But
the real tourist revenues come from big tour packages, not from small groups
of intrepid explorers.
Vietnam's chronic lack of infrastructure - from paved roads to power and
drinkable water - is a serious constraint on any large scale development of
the tourism sector. Tourist facilities outside the main cities are virtually
non-existent.
There is already a serious shortage of hotel accommodation in both Ho Chi
Minh City and Hanoi. People are hungry for jobs. But the country lacks a
pool of trained hotel staff. Hotel operators have to build up their
businesses from scratch.
A standard room in Hanoi's leading hotel costs nearly Dollars 200 per night.
Top class hotels in other parts of Asia offer both better rates and service.
Officials say that Vietnam now has a total of 32,000 hotel rooms, with only
half of them considered fit for foreign tourists. New hotels are being
built. A US group has plans for a Dollars 240m tourist complex on the coast
near Danang in central Vietnam. Foreign investors, led by Singaporeans and
Malaysians, are queueing up to build hotels in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
Progress on these projects is slow. More than 100 foreign-funded tourist
projects involving investments of more than Dollars 1bn have been registered
with the authorities but few have progressed from the paperwork stage.
As in many sectors of Vietnam's economic planning, developers have found
that official central government policy is often at variance with the views
of politically powerful local Peoples Committees. Establishing land titles,
moving people from development areas plus settling compensation claims have
proved serious obstacles for tourism-related projects.
Mr Nhat is aware of the bureaucratic hold-ups in the system. But there is
also the danger that by allowing a haphazard, unregulated approach to
tourism, Vietnam might risk destroying the very things visitors want to see.
One of the attractions of Hanoi is its old style French colonial
architecture and its tree lined boulevards. Many of the old villas are
crumbling and in dire need of repair. But unregulated property development,
including a mushrooming of small, often ugly, hotels with modern facades, is
already threatening to spoil the look of parts of Vietnam's capital.
Mr Nhat says that he does not want to see Vietnam developing the same sort
of tourist industry as that of Thailand. Yet signs are already emerging that
Ho Chi Minh City is reverting to its old ways with a recent proliferation of
massage parlours and risque bars.
Vietnam might not be able to keep the bulk of its tourist earnings within
the country. Every sector of the economy lacks capital. Foreign tour
operators, having invested funds in order to set up various facilities in
Vietnam, could insist that they retain a sizeable slice of the revenues.
'We have no choice,' says Mr Nhat. 'We have to seek partnerships with
foreign companies, not only to use their capital resources but also to learn
the industry from them. We are just starting. I hope we can learn from the
experience and mistakes of others.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Capital the crucial element - Kieran
Cooke finds starting a private business is still not easy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Le Van Kiem sits at his desk in his office in Ho Chi Minh City, a large
diamond ring glinting on his finger. 'I describe myself as a socialist
capitalist,' says Mr Kiem with a smile. 'I believe the two are not
necessarily contradictory. People sometimes say the rich do not work. Now
I'm in charge of a big business and yes, I have money. But I have never
worked harder in my life.'
Mr Kiem is founder of Huy Hoang, one of Vietnam's largest private groups.
The private sector has only emerged in Vietnam in the past few years with
much of the activity centred on Ho Chi Minh City. In 1988 there were only 22
private sector enterprises in the city. Now there are more than 2,000.
The Huy Hoang group employs more than 3,000 people, most of them at a
garment factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. It is also involved in
the construction industry, real estate and tourism development.
Founded in 1990, Huy Hoang's turnover has grown from Dollars 5m to more than
Dollars 40m this year. When Vietnam's stock exchange gets off the ground -
possibly next year in Ho Chi Minh City - Mr Kiem says a listing of at least
part of the group is likely.
'We have ambitions of turning Huy Hoang into a company involved in most
sectors of the economy,' says Mr Kiem. 'Vietnam needs companies like ours,
to provide jobs and to develop skills. Perhaps our workers will one day
start their own businesses.'
Getting a private company started in Vietnam is not easy. While the
country's leadership heartily endorses the concept of the market economy,
lingering distrust within the bureaucracy of the entrepreneur and the
capitalist often results in contradictory regulations and delays in winning
project approvals.
However, shortage of capital is the greatest handicap for the private
sector. Most private businesses have a large quantity of foreign sourced
capital behind them. Mr Kiem was able to start his company using savings he
had made from a home-based paint business in the 1980s and money sent by
relatives in the US.
Bitis, another large Vietnamese company involved mainly in the shoe
manufacturing business, is run by the family of Vuu Khai Thanh. Mr Thanh is
a Chinese Vietnamese. Vietnam's Chinese community, numbering about 500,000
and mostly centred on Ho Chi Minh City, has the advantage of being able to
call up capital from relatives in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur or Taiwan.
Bitis, now in a joint venture with a Taiwanese group, makes about 12m pairs
of low-cost sandals and shoes each year. At a factory on the outskirts of Ho
Chi Minh City 1,800 workers earning about Dollars 40 per month glue shoe
materials together. The smell is overpowering. About 80 per cent of
materials are imported - mostly from Taiwan.
A large slice of Bitis' production goes for export to Japan and China.
However, the company is selling increasing amounts of its slippers, priced
at about Dollars 2 a pair, on the home market.
Mr Kiem of Huy Hoang admits that Vietnam's industrial sector is still
undeveloped. About 80 per cent of the materials for Huy Hoang's garments
have to be imported.
Garment companies in Europe have signed long-term production contracts with
Huy Hoang. They have also advanced the company capital for expansion.
'Raising the initial capital is the big problem for Vietnamese enterprises,'
says Mr Kiem.
'I think the Vietnamese are skilful and have a talent for business. Some
have capital, a lot of it hidden under the bed, but are frightened to take
risks. I was one of the first. I'm sure others will follow.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Doing business is a costly affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GAUNTLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Vietnam is making progress towards ironing out the wrinkles in the
country's legal system and improving its tangled bureaucracy, the cost of
getting established and doing business, already alarmingly high, is rising
fast.
Basic overheads are among the highest in the world and commercial rents in
the capital, Hanoi, and in the bustling southern industrial hub of Ho Chi
Minh City have already overtaken those of some of the world's leading
cities. Residential rates are not far behind.
While prime office rents are officially capped at about Dollars 18 per
square metre per month in Ho Chi Minh City foreign businesses hunting for
what little international-standard space is available are often asked for as
much as Dollars 50-Dollars 60.
Making phone calls abroad is almost prohibitively expensive and resident
business people advise newcomers to get their headquarters to call them back
to save money. A severe shortage of trained personnel, even those with the
most basic office skills, is nudging local salaries higher. Poaching of
qualified staff is rife.
A young local graduate with some work experience and good English - firmly
established as the lingua franca of business - can command a monthly salary
of up to Dollars 400, almost double the figure in 1993. Unaware of how fast
costs are rising, many foreign investors fail to make allowances in their
feasibility studies and find themselves drastically revising budgets or even
pulling out of projects.
This partly explains why only about a quarter of the roughly Dollars 10bn in
foreign investment pledged so far has actually been invested.
'It's fairly easy to get a joint venture going but it's the implementation
that's the problem,' says an Australian lawyer with seven years of
experience advising clients on start-ups in Vietnam. 'People should double
their estimates of administrative costs, for example.'
In spite of a much-trumpeted government campaign against corruption,
incidents of graft are on the rise. In property, for example, even once
suitable premises have been found for representative offices, investors
often find themselves having to pay unofficial 'fees' to secure the site.
One leading European bank early this year was told there was a Dollars
200,000 price tag on a prestigious, French-era villa in Ho Chi Minh City and
drafted a contract on that basis. Shortly after the US lifted its trade
embargo on Vietnam in February, bank executives negotiating the deal were
told the price had risen to Dollars 250,000. They assumed the contract would
be re-drafted but were shocked to find that the official negotiating the
deal would only accept the difference in cash, payable on the spot.
Residential space, also in short supply, is best sourced through one of the
few official state agencies (which charge hefty fees) or by contacting the
numerous private 'agents', who can often be little more than well connected
individuals. Many will also demand high fees.
For property developers, one headache is how to gauge compensation to be
paid to people living on land designated for development. Officially-set
rates are usually ignored, by the Vietnamese partner or by residents facing
relocation. Project delays can be severe as the two sides in the joint
venture wrangle over how much should be paid.
'I think the government is trying to do its best to solve the problems but
on a day to day basis you've got people grabbing what they can,' says the
director of a US property firm planning to develop a hotel in Hanoi. His
joint venture partner has asked him for Dollars 1.5m to build a road nearby
as well as a Dollars 250,000 'lobby fee', apparently to be used to speed up
licensing procedures.
Although the government is acutely aware of the need to streamline the
bureaucracy and plans a vigorous campaign of what it calls 'administrative
reform' in 1995, the project licensing procedure is still clogged with
unnecessary paperwork.
The State Committee for Co-operation and Investment is responsible for
licensing all forms of foreign investment, usually a joint venture, a 100
per cent foreign-invested enterprise or the looser Business Co-operation
Contract. Although it was planned as a 'one-stop' shop for foreign
investors, more than 10 ministries claim jurisdiction on some aspects of
foreign investment and much time is spent shepherding paperwork from
ministry to ministry. Many businesses save time and money by hiring foreign
consultants on the ground to ease applications through the system.
But today's business climate is still in stark contrast to when the country
first started opening up to foreign investors as part of its policy of doi
moi. Vietnam's only telephone links with the outside world in 1986 were
nine, scratchy, international lines, most of them connecting Hanoi with
Moscow, then the country's main benefactor. Today, 1,500 lines offer clear
connections to almost anywhere in the world. Mobile phones are common in
Saigon and have recently appeared in Hanoi.
Regular domestic flights, most using European Airbus aircraft, connect the
capital with Ho Chi Minh City, the coastal town of Danang and other
destinations.
The legal environment, although still murky, has improved slowly but
steadily. This year has seen a surge in the amount of regulations issued,
most of them aimed at clarifying aspects of the Foreign Investment Law.
Among them, a radical ruling dating back to July allows foreigners to buy
property in their own right. Property analysts say the move has put Vietnam
ahead of jurisdictions in Thailand and even Singapore, where foreigners are
limited to ownership of certain floors of a building.
Another decree, passed in March, sets out guidelines for settling economic
disputes involving foreign investors at a special economic court. However,
foreign lawyers based in Vietnam say most investors will prefer to seek
remedies offshore until the precise mechanics of the court are clearer.
Foreign investors complain that inadequate consultation at the drafting
stage means laws are often incomplete, requiring clarification later through
the issuance of guidelines.
Recent currency regulations outlawing the use of the dollar in domestic
transactions, for example, leave open the question of whether sectors that
rely on foreign currency revenues to repay debts offshore (such as hotels)
have to receive income in the local, non-convertible currency.

Getting there
Air France, Lufthansa and the Dutch airline KLM fly routes from Europe.
British Airways plans to start flights from London in mid-1995. Otherwise
most Asian carriers have services to and from their capitals and Qantas runs
one flight a week from Sydney. No direct flights run to and from the US,
however. A handful of US airlines are waiting for commercial flight
agreements to be worked out between the two countries. Business visas are
needed for extended business trips but first-time visitors investigating
opportunities can get by on a tourist visa.
Currency
Sweeping new rules issued in October theoretically banned the use of the
dollar in Vietnam for most transactions. But bring sufficient dollars in
cash for purchases or for exchange into dong, although many exchange bureaux
will not accept old or worn notes. Most leading hotels accept credit cards
and traveller's cheques.
Information
Economic and business news about Vietnam may be patchy outside the country
but in the country it is difficult to escape. Many English language
publications are produced in Vietnam, the most useful being the weekly
Vietnam Investment Review, published by the SCCI (investment news) and the
monthly Vietnam Economic Times (analysis and business tips). The local
English-language directory enquiries telephone number is 108.
Where to stay
Hanoi. While it is relatively easy to book accommodation in Ho Chi Minh
City, a severe shortage in Hanoi often means a frustrating search for rooms.
The Metropole Hotel (tel: 84-4-266919, fax: 266920, Dollars 179-Dollars 394
a night) is running at 95 per cent occupancy and rooms are scarce. Try
smaller hotels such as the Army Hotel (tel: 252896, fax: 259276, Dollars
50-Dollars 75 a night) and the Defence Ministry Guest House (tel: 265540,
fax: 265539, Dollars 60-Dollars 150 a night). If you are really stuck, the
'mini-hotels' that have sprung up in the past year are perfectly respectable
(Melody Hotel, tel: 263029, fax: 243746, Thuy Lam Hotel, tel:/fax: 250468).
Ho Chi Minh City. Leading hotels include the Omni Saigon (tel: 84-8-449222,
fax: 449200) and the vast, 540-room New World Saigon (tel: 228888, fax:
230710) and the Rex Hotel (tel: 296043, fax: 290536), famous for its rooftop
bar. The Floating Hotel (tel: 290783, fax: 290784), a renovated barge with
international standard rooms, is moored on the Saigon River at Nguyen Hue
Boulevard but may have to move next year if its licence is not renewed.
Danang. Standards in Danang, on the central coast, have yet to catch up with
the north and south. The Bach Dang Hotel, (tel: 84-51-23649, fax: 21659) is
fine. Do not miss fish and chips at Christie's Waterfront bar just down the
road, run by New Zealander Bob Christie and his Vietnamese wife.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (6): Fluctuating fortunes - Kieran Cooke
on agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors and local entrepreneurs are busy weighing up opportunities
in Vietnam's industrial and service sectors. But agriculture is still the
foundation of the country's economy, involving more than 70 per cent of the
population.
In 1993 agricultural goods, including forestry and fishery products,
accounted for more than 50 per cent of total export revenues. Vietnam now
ranks as the world's third biggest rice exporter, after Thailand and the US.
The fortunes of the agricultural sector have fluctuated both because of the
weather and the vagaries of government policies. According to officials,
recent widespread flooding has resulted in losses of more than 1m tonnes of
rice.
But earlier surpluses mean that Vietnam is still likely to achieve a record
production figure of 25m tonnes of rice and paddy equivalent this year, of
which about 2m tonnes will be exported. The export figure includes an
estimated 300,000 tonnes of rice that is smuggled across the northern border
and sold in southern China.
Government policies have had a more serious effect on agricultural
production. When the country was reunified in the mid-1970s, the Hanoi
leadership embarked on a five-year economic plan which sought to integrate
the northern and southern economies.
Agricultural collectives, formed in the north in the 1950s, were introduced
in the south, which accounts for about 70 per cent of Vietnam's total rice
production. The idea was for the richer south to help the poorer north, with
southern earnings from agricultural surpluses funding industrialisation,
particularly in the north.
The policy was a failure. Michael Williams, in his book 'Vietnam at the
Crossroads' outlines the reasons. 'The plan took little account of the
resistance of the peasantry in the south to collectivisation and was anyway
far too ambitious in thinking that the land would generate sufficient
surpluses to fund industrialisation. It also took insufficient account of
the damage inflicted on the country by decades of war. Finally, in its hopes
for international funding of postwar economic reconstruction, it was wildly
optimistic.'
By the early 1980s the government was rolling back its collectivisation
policy, allowing families to control some land and permitting the sale of
produce surplus to quota requirements on the open market. Production soared.
By the late 1980s the family farm was established as the main unit of
agricultural production: state sector farms now account for only about 4 per
cent of the agricultural sector. In 1989 Vietnam turned from being a rice
importer to exporter.
But while Vietnam, is one of the world's most densely cultivated countries,
population growth of more than 2 per cent each year means the country still
faces problems feeding its people.
Furthermore, Vietnam once relied on the old Soviet Union and countries of
eastern Europe as a market for its rice exports. Though it has recently
entered into long-term rice purchase agreements with Malaysia, Brazil and
the US, it lacks marketing expertise. Compared to other big rice producing
countries in the region, such as Thailand and Indonesia, yields in Vietnam
are low and quality is poor. Thai rice fetches Dollars 50-Dollars 100 per
tonne more on the international market.
The main problem is a lack of rural credit,' says Chu Van Lam, a Hanoi based
agricultural specialist. 'Most farmers cannot get hold of funds to improve
their land, to buy fertilisers, to purchase tractors. It's the same in most
sectors of the economy - everyone is in need of capital.'
The state run Agricultural Bank gives loans to about 40 per cent of rural
households, but at high interest rates and for only six-month periods. The
World Bank has given Vietnam a Dollars 96m loan for restructuring the
agricultural sector - with Dollars 50m of the loan going to rural credit
programmes.
'The policy of the government is to keep rice exports at about 2m tonnes
while putting more emphasis on cash crops such as rubber, coffee, tea, fruit
and vegetables,' says Mr Lam. 'These crops offer far better returns but
again there is a need for capital to rehabilitate old plantations and
improve the land.'
Some progress has been made. Rubber production rose by 10 per cent in 1993.
Corn production has also increased recently. Over the past three years the
coffee crop has nearly doubled.
But Vietnam lacks not only marketing skills but processing facilities. Most
of the benefits of its seafood industry - a potentially big growth area -
are reaped by Thai traders who buy seafood from Vietnam and carry out the
high value added processing and marketing.
The years of war continue to take their toll. The spraying of 'Agent Orange'
defoliants by the US in many parts of the country poisoned the land. A large
percentage of the rubber plantations were destroyed by US bombing.
A headache for the government is a growing imbalance between incomes in
urban and rural areas, and the resulting rural migration to urban areas.
National average per capita income is estimated at more than Dollars 200 per
year. But in many rural areas it is probably less than half that figure.
Donor agencies estimate that 51 per cent of Vietnam's population lives below
the poverty level, most of these in rural areas.
The government, aware that such developments threaten long-term social
stability, is encouraging investors, local and foreign, to set up plants in
rural areas. Under a new scheme the official Farmers Association has created
Vinanimex, a company charged with channelling investments into the
countryside. Vinanimex intends to establish hundreds of garment
manufacturing facilities in the countryside and says it has found at least
one foreign company willing to co-operate.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Ambitious targets to meet - Obstacles
could dampen investors' enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Where the Americans once fought, they are now preparing to manufacture
toilets. American Standard, the sanitary ware maker, recently held a party
at Ho Chi Minh City's Unification Palace to announce plans to invest Dollars
17m in a factory in Vietnam.
Similar parties are held each week by new investors, and the Americans (who
were banned by the US embargo until February this year) are only the latest
arrivals. The biggest investors are Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea;
Daewoo of South Korea is investing more than Dollars 300m to make products
ranging from pesticides to electronic components.
Since Vietnam enacted a foreign investment law six years ago as the
centrepiece of its economic reform programme, foreign companies have
promised about Dollars 10bn of export-oriented and import substitution
projects. They will transform the economy and help Vietnam to emulate
fast-growing, export-driven south-east Asian economies such as Thailand and
Indonesia.
Commodities, such as crude oil and rice, still account for most of Vietnam's
exports, but processed foods, garments, televisions and other goods
manufactured in Vietnam will play an more important role in the economy as
foreign investment projects come on stream.
American Standard, for instance, says its joint venture in Song Be province
will save Vietnam Dollars 10m of foreign exchange in its first year of
operation alone by replacing imported toilets, basins and baths with
locally-made wares. Eventually the factory may export products too.
For all its success in attracting foreign investors, Vietnam may find it
hard to meet its own ambitious targets. Of the Dollars 45-Dollars 50bn in
capital Vietnam wants in the current decade to increase the income of its
inhabitants, about Dollars 20bn is expected to come from foreign direct
investment; but out of the Dollars 10bn promised so far, only about Dollars
3.5bn will have been spent by the end of this year.
Although foreign investors will complete more of their promised projects and
make new commitments in the years ahead to take advantage of Vietnam's
market of 72m people and the opportunities for export, they still face
numerous difficulties that could dampen their enthusiasm.
The initial approval process for foreign investment is slow and
bureaucratic, involving the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment
(SCCI) and various ministries and local authorities.
And once a project is approved, investors find that the laws and regulations
governing their business are vague or non-existent and arbitrarily enforced.
Physical infrastructure is inadequate - ports are congested and
ill-equipped, for example - and the skills and raw materials required may be
hard to find locally.
Construction is a case in point. Investors keen to profit from the shortage
of hotels, housing and office space often find themselves saddled with
delays and budget overruns. Even materials which are locally available -
marble, for instance - are sometimes of low quality because the equipment
used to manufacture the product is old and worn.
There is no clear process for approving building projects, investors say.
The proposed Construction Law is in its 14th draft and has yet to be passed
by the National Assembly, which meets for about a fortnight twice a year.
When it is passed, subordinate regulations will have to be written by the
relevant ministry.
A barrage of complaints from investors has made the Vietnamese government
aware of the obstacles to foreign investment and it has plans to simplify
licensing procedures for new projects. 'Any investors coming to Vietnam face
some major difficulties,' admits Bui Huy Hung of the SCCI in Hanoi. 'Our
policy is to set up a one-stop shop system, but we cannot fulfil it in one
day.'
By the end of the year, the government is expected to announce a new package
of investment promotion measures. Feasibility studies will probably no
longer be required for smaller projects and the time taken by the
authorities to evaluate and license them should be reduced to less than six
weeks from three months or more at present.
In line with World Bank recommendations, the central government is expected
to devolve decision-making power to local authorities for some matters
affecting new projects such as land pricing, although the central government
will attempt to retain overall control.
Mr Hung, who recently visited China, said the decentralisation he saw there
was less viable in a smaller country such as Vietnam. 'Even in China they
face a big problem with decentralisation,' he said. 'Each province issues
another incentive. They forget the national way . . . each province issues a
car assembly licence - it's a crazy situation.'
Foreign companies have hitherto concentrated their efforts on investments
offering a quick financial return in foreign exchange, such as hotels and
light industry. In an attempt to lure money into infrastructure projects
with longer payback periods, Vietnam this year announced special incentives
for 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) projects.
The SCCI says Vietnam guarantees that BOT investors in such sectors as
electricity generation and water supply can convert their dong profits into
hard currency. In addition, BOT investors are allowed to mortgage their
long-term land-use rights as security for loans from foreign banks.
Vietnam has also started granting licences for the establishment of what it
calls 'concentrated industrial zones' (CIZs) - the first should go to Nomura
of Japan for an industrial estate in Haiphong - to complement the six export
processing zones (EPZs) already approved.
Factories in EPZs must export 100 per cent of their production, but CIZ
factories will be permitted to sell some of their output to the domestic
market.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Winners yet to appear - Foreign
exploration indicates gas could have greater potential than oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GAUNTLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A string of disappointing results from oil blocks in Vietnam's southern
waters has punctured the optimism of the foreign energy companies which have
been prospecting since 1992. Indications are that gas, not oil, could be the
country's fuel of the future.
None of the eight foreign operators that have drilled in the Nam Con Son
basin (an area 350km south of the coastal town of Vung Tau) has struck
commercially viable amounts of oil. Many, including big names such as Shell,
Total and British Petroleum (BP), are still committed to drilling
exploration wells as part of contractual arrangements with state oil agency
PetroVietnam, but a major discovery of natural gas by BP in September has
shown that the region is not as rich in oil as many firms expected.
BP said when it announced the find that recoverable reserves could be about
2,000bn cubic feet, enough to generate electricity for the southern
industrial centre of Ho Chi Minh City for 25 years at current levels of
consumption.
'The fact that the Nam Con Son Basin is more gas prone than was first
thought has become clearer and it could yield more gas discoveries,' said
Michael Yeldham, BP chief executive in Vietnam.
Vietnam plans to pump 7.1m tonnes of crude this year, up from 6.3m in 1993.
Most of it comes from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, operated by the
Russo-Vietnamese joint venture VietSovPetro and which was the country's only
producing field until Australian operator BHP started producing small
amounts at the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field in October. BHP hopes to have
tapped 250,000 to 350,000 tonnes by year's end.
Nearly all the crude is exported to Japan and is Vietnam's largest source of
foreign currency revenue. However, these amounts are not enough to ensure
Vietnam achieves targeted double digit economic growth by 2000. Hanoi is
therefore keen to develop gas as fast as possible to increase foreign
currency earnings and has charged the State Planning Committee with mapping
out a master plan for the gas industry. Under a 'fast track' programme,
priority is being given to building the infrastructure needed to bring
commercially viable amounts of gas onshore.
The first phase was the installation of Vietnam's first gas pipeline early
this year by Korea's Hyundai Heavy Engineering. The 107km undersea pipeline
runs from the Bach Ho oilfield and is designed to tap gas being flared off
at a rate of 3m cubic feet a day. Test flows, due to start in November, were
delayed because of an accident which damaged the pipe.
The second phase involves the construction of an offshore compression
platform and a liquefied petroleum gas plant on the coast near Vung Tau.
British Gas and Mitsui last month finished work on a feasibility study for
the Dollars 450m project.
Industry sources say the speed at which Vietnam can develop its energy
sector will depend on financing. Although the technical aspects of the
British Gas study are clear, industry sources say there are doubts about how
the second phase of the project, and any others, will attract project
financing without government support. Vietnam's sovereign debt risk is still
high and there is no precedent for large-scale financing. Projects would
have to demonstrate sufficient foreign exchange revenues to justify any
financing.
'The gas that comes ashore will be two and a half times as expensive as
(that in) Indonesia or the Middle East because of the infrastructure needed
to bring it ashore,' said Marie Belsey, British Gas Vietnam country manager.
BP told the communist party daily Nhan Dan that it and its partners could
spend as much as Dollars 1bn building production facilities offshore and an
undersea pipeline to make use of the gas in Block Six, where it found gas.
Up to a further Dollars 1bn could be needed to develop a market for the gas
onshore, it said.
Although Vietnam needs the gas domestically for power generation and
fertiliser production, the government is also keen to export as much as
possible, possibly to Thailand, which is known to be looking at further
import sources.
However, Hanoi will probably have to wait until next year to see how much
gas is offshore. US firm Mobil, returning to Vietnam after a 19-year
absence, is testing for gas at the Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) field but with
no luck so far.
Foreign firms say government planning will be crucial to successful
exploitation of the country's gas. Late last month Vo Van Kiet, the prime
minister, decided PetroVietnam should carry out a feasibility study looking
into building Vietnam's first oil refinery in the poor province of Quang
Ngai in the country's central region. The province, 525km north-east of Ho
Chi Minh City, is hundreds of miles away from the offshore oilfields.
Foreign oil firms were puzzled. A consortium of France's Total and Taiwanese
partners had been working on a feasibility study, commissioned by state oil
agency PetroVietnam, for a Dollars 1bn plant near Khanh Hoa, close to the
oil industry hub of Vung Tau.
The issue underlines the difficulty foreign firms prospecting for oil and
gas sometimes have in gauging whether commercial priorities take precedence
over political considerations as Hanoi decides how best to harness the
country's energy resources.
The country is also spending huge sums importing refined crude to fuel
industrial growth and desperately needs its own refining capacity.
PetroVietnam officials hope that as much as a third of the 6m tonnes of
crude to be refined at the planned Quang Ngai plant will be shipped from
Indonesia or the Middle East.
But Danang, the nearest port, is too small to accommodate the kind of
traffic anticipated and is not linked to major shipping lanes. Transporting
the country's own crude northwards to the refinery from offshore fields off
the southern coast of Vung Tau will add further costs.
Meanwhile, bids have just closed on a promising oil block in the Mekong
basin, closer to Vietnam's coast than the Nam Con Son basin and next to
blocks with modestly encouraging finds by Japanese and Malaysian firms in
June.
'The game's by no means over yet,' said BP's Mr Yeldham. 'There's still a
lot of competition and the shakeout has yet to occur.
'We're not at the stage where you can say there are obvious winners and
losers.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (2): Completing the transformation -
Obstacles hinder further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<TEXT>
Three years ago the Vietnamese capital Hanoi was a city of quiet avenues
frequented by cyclists, pedestrians and the occasional army lorry; at night
the gloom was pierced only by flickering lanterns and low-wattage light
bulbs.
Today the city is experiencing its first taste of traffic congestion and
noise pollution. New hotels, karaoke bars, pizza restaurants and massage
parlours, adorned with multi-coloured lights and signs, are springing up
across the town; motorcycle delivery men speed along the streets with
towering cargoes of television sets and cigarettes.
Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre has already undergone this
transformation; now it has chic bars, fashionable boutiques and traffic
jams. Danang in central Vietnam is also developing fast.
Vietnam's economy has gone from strength to strength since the ruling
communist party decided to loosen central control and encourage private
enterprise with its doi moi programme in the late 1980s.
Remarkably, the first reforms - including devaluation - were undertaken
without financial help from multilateral institutions, because the US had
vetoed such assistance.
Since the lifting of the veto last year, Vietnam has sealed agreements with
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, as well as bilateral donors such as Japan.
The benefits of reform are not in doubt. Latest Vietnamese government
estimates suggest that real gross domestic product will grow by 8.8 per cent
this year, rising to nearly 10 per cent in 1995 and perhaps more than 10 per
cent per year thereafter.
Foreign donors have heaped praise on Vietnam for its handling of
macro-economic issues. Firm control of the money supply helped bring
Vietnamese inflation down to 5.2 per cent by the end of 1993 from nearly 70
per cent in 1991.
Inflation has recently risen to more than 11 per cent - above the
government's 10 per cent target - but most economists say Vietnam is
unlikely to face the surge of inflation experienced by neighbouring China,
whose much larger economy is undergoing similar reforms.
A rise in Vietnam's retail prices this year on the back of high demand for
everything from consumer goods to construction materials was regarded as
inevitable.
The current account showed an alarming deficit of Dollars 1.1bn or 8.3 per
cent of GDP in 1993, after being nearly in balance in 1992, but that was
partly due to a sharp rise in imports of equipment for foreign investment
projects which will help to increase exports in the future.
Furthermore, the current account deficit was brought under control in early
1994 with the help of tighter fiscal and monetary policies. Import growth
slowed while exports continued to rise, and the current account deficit is
predicted to fall to about 5 per cent of GDP this year.
The government spending curbs have also reduced the budget deficit to an
estimated 3 per cent of GDP this year from a worrying 6.2 per cent in 1993.
'This reflects the fact that they have been able to respond to reality,'
said an official from one international donor agency. 'They were put to the
test this year and they responded well at the macro-level.'
The government and donors agree, however, that several obstacles to rapid
economic growth will have to be removed in the next few years. Ports, roads,
railways and power and water utilities are all in urgent need of improvement
and foreign aid is pouring in for this purpose.
But probably the most important challenge facing Vietnam's leaders is the
need to reform and educate the government bureaucracy so that it can rid
itself of corruption, shake off the old-fashioned mentality of central
planning and restrict itself to establishing laws and regulations that will
allow business to flourish.
'It is still very common that scarce (state) funding resources are used to
build offices, buy expensive equipment and organise showy activities,' Vo
Van Kiet, the prime minister, told the National Assembly in October.
'Corruption and bureaucratism remain serious . . . Public administration
reform is becoming an urgent issue.'
While the broad outlines of government policy may promote economic growth,
government officials are often reluctant to implement it. 'What needs
attention today is not so much the identification of new policies but rather
a wholesale renovation of public institutions to make them more efficient,'
says Roy Morey, resident representative in Hanoi of the UN Development
Programme.
A typical crisis of economic management arose in August when the government
suddenly announced that transactions in Vietnam would have to be in dong,
the local currency, rather than the US dollar, which is widely used.
Although businesses and donors sympathised with Vietnam's desire to restore
the dong to its rightful place, the initial announcement was so vague that
foreign investors feared they would not be able receive dollar earnings and
meet hard currency obligations abroad.
'There was total panic here for several weeks,' said one foreign banker. It
subsequently turned out that the decree appeared to affect only domestic
transactions, and that it was being enforced only gradually.
The World Bank, in its latest report on the Vietnamese economy, suggests
that the government is attempting to keep too much central control of
decision-making, a tendency which it believes will strangle investment and
growth and breed corruption as the economy becomes more complex.
The answer, according to the World Bank, is to decentralise, for example by
allowing local authorities to raise and spend taxes for local services.
However, the recommendation is controversial. Some local communist
authorities have proved to be extremely corrupt and are already being
accused of running their own fiefdoms, defying national laws on everything
from prostitution to investment.
Several senior members of the government also have an ideological bias in
favour of central control, and the public sector is still officially
supposed to play a leading role in the economy.
While farmers and small traders have flourished under the economic reform
programme, there are still only a few substantial Vietnamese private
companies.
All over Vietnam, the communist people's committees, the armed forces and
various ministries which control most of the country's assets have used
their influence to enter into joint ventures with foreign companies. Foreign
investors have little choice, because in most cases there is no-one else
with whom they can do business.
Managers of state enterprises and government officials still tend to think
in terms of quotas, plans and volume of production, rather than profit or
rates of return.
For the time being, Vietnam is a hybrid economy in which the state -
represented by the communist party, the army and various ministries - will
continue to play an important role.
'This period in Vietnam is transitional,' says Do Duc Dinh of the Institute
on the World Economy in Hanoi. 'We have not yet up set up a very clear
framework, unlike other countries where they have built market economies for
three or four decades.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Legal framework vital to progress -
Prospects for capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam's urgent need for funds to rebuild the economy - combined with a
widespread lack of faith in domestic banks that has kept savings rates low
by east Asian standards - has convinced the government it needs to establish
local capital markets fast.
Whether it will be able to do so as planned during the coming year remains
an open question. The first step is expected to be the formation of a
National Securities Commission, but the finance ministry and the central
bank have been arguing over which of them should be in control.
The new body would then set up a secondary market for the handful of bonds
issued by the government and state enterprises, followed by a stock exchange
for the shares of joint stock companies such as banks and partially
privatised state companies.
'We anticipate a small-scale bourse being established some time in 1995,'
said Nick Freeman, Vietnam analyst for Baring Securities. 'The arguments for
a stock market are widely accepted. It's now a case of putting together the
legislative framework to make this a possibility.'
But sceptics believe that the shortcomings of the legal system and other
problems will delay the establishment of a market beyond the end of 1995.
The underdeveloped banking system, for example, may make capital markets
seem attractive by comparison as a way of mobilising savings, but it also
hinders the operation of such markets.
Among recent improvements to the banking sector, the authorities permitted
the use of personal cheques for the first time since 1975, but bankers say
most cheques have to be individually certified by the issuing bank, making
the transaction very cumbersome.
Another problem is the shortage of companies that could be listed on the
future stock exchange. Large, domestic private companies are few in number
and privatisation of state firms has stalled.
Of more than 6,000 state-owned enterprises that survive in Vietnam, only
three (a transport company, a shoe factory and a refrigeration firm) have so
far been successfully prepared for privatisation. The government is
reluctant to privatise prime companies such as Vietnam Airlines.
'It's still very difficult,' said Do Duc Dinh, a government economist. 'The
accounting system is still not good and we can't calculate the value of an
enterprise and divide it into shares.'
It will also take time to overcome basic legal obstacles, let alone
formulate complex regulations for capital markets. Vietnamese bankruptcy
rules and a commercial code have yet to be finalised.
Lastly, some Vietnamese worry that a hurriedly established stock market in
Ho Chi Minh City would be so speculative and poorly regulated that it would
quickly discredit itself without doing much for business in Vietnam.
'We need a legal framework first and the government must educate people on
the functions of such a market,' says Huynh Buu Son of the Saigon Bank for
Industry and Trade, a bank owned by a mix of private and public shareholders
that would probably be among the first companies to be listed. 'We must be
sure before we start.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (1): Catching up with its Asian rivals -
While the business acumen of the Vietnamese is fuelling an economic boom in
the cities, rural life is also beginning to improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When Vietnamese communist party officials laid bouquets of flowers before
Lenin's statue in Hanoi last month to commemorate the Russian revolution, it
was more a nostalgic gesture than an act of ideological homage and
commitment.
For it is the ideology and practice of capitalism - known officially as
'socialism with a market economy' to spare the blushes of communist
stalwarts - that is spreading throughout Vietnam at breathtaking speed.
Among the first Vietnamese to seize the opportunities presented by doi moi
(renovation), the policy of reform introduced by the party in the late
1980s, were the entrepreneurial residents of Ho Chi Minh City, the southern
commercial and industrial centre previously called Saigon.
The south's businessmen and women, who had lain dormant since the communist
victory over the US-backed South Vietnamese government in 1975, responded
enthusiastically to the reforms by opening trading companies, factories,
banks, restaurants and chic boutiques.
The streets of Cholon, the ethnic Chinese business district, seethe with
commercial activity. In 1988, Ho Chi Minh City had only 22 registered
private companies; today it has 2,600, not to mention tens of thousands of
small shops. Traffic jams and ugly concrete buildings are becoming more
common.
Hanoi and the north did not take long to follow suit. Only three years ago
the capital was a quiet, spartan backwater of south-east Asia with almost no
modern facilities.
Now it has pizza restaurants, satellite television, meter taxis, karaoke
bars, private hotels and mobile telephones, a transformation reinforcing the
view that each industrial revolution in east Asia happens quicker than the
last.
Few opportunities are missed to make money. Last month the Dollars 25m Do
Son Casino near the port of Haiphong, a joint venture between Hong Kong
investors and the local government, opened its doors to visiting foreign
gamblers. On the streets of Hanoi, hawkers openly sell confidential
government and World Bank reports on the economy, and photocopies of books
banned in Vietnam for criticising the communist party.
Less obvious to outsiders than the economic boom in the cities, but just as
important, are the changes in the countryside.
Most rural Vietnamese are still desperately poor and are forced to choose
between surviving on their overcrowded farmland and migrating to the towns,
but the situation seems to be improving slowly.
The United Nations calculates that 51 per cent of Vietnam's 72m people live
below the most basic poverty line - the level at which they can afford 2,100
calories of food a day - but that is down from 70 per cent of the population
a decade ago.
Peasant farmers, taking advantage of secure land tenure and the chance to
make money in a liberalised agricultural market, have sharply increased
their output. Vietnam, which once used to suffer from rice shortages, has
become the world's third largest rice exporter after the US and Thailand.
The private sector's share of gross domestic product has risen to 45 per
cent from 10 per cent in less than a decade, Vietnamese government
economists say, and the reforms have led to rapid economic expansion; real
GDP growth is expected to reach nearly 9 per cent this year.
Foreign investors and aid donors, along with hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese exiles and the overseas relatives of the ethnic Chinese, are
providing much needed capital to finance economic development in a country
where average per capita income is still only about Dollars 250 a year.
Last month donors pledged Dollars 2bn to support Vietnam at a meeting in
Paris, adding to the Dollars 1.86bn that was agreed last year.
Foreign investors have promised Dollars 10bn of projects since 1988, with
the emphasis on the textile industry, oil and gas exploration and new
hotels.
Five international investment funds have been established to direct money
into what has become Asia's most fashionable emerging economy.
Vietnamese and foreign companies are quick to complain about the many
problems that remain to be solved: cumbersome bureaucracy, corruption, the
reluctance of state enterprises to undergo privatisation, the lack of
economic and commercial legislation, the primitive state of the domestic
banking system and conflicts between central and local governments.
But Vietnam's leaders, from prime minister Vo Van Kiet downwards, are by
Asian standards remarkably frank about the government's shortcomings and
eager to accelerate economic reforms wherever possible to achieve the
official goal of 'a prosperous people, strong country, and just and
civilised society'.
In the next few weeks the government is expected to respond to criticisms
about the complexity of licensing procedures for foreign investors by
announcing a new package of investment rules. Among other changes, a
requirement for feasibility studies is likely to be waived for small
projects.
'I myself say we Vietnamese are moving too slow,' says Tran Ba Tuoc of VP
Bank, a newly-founded private bank in Ho Chi Minh City. 'But looking back,
we have done a lot. In the next two to three years I'm sure we will get
almost everything in place.'
Several central government ministries, the army, and the local communist
people's committees in different provinces have adapted capitalism to their
own ends. They have set up their own businesses or entered into joint
ventures with foreign investors who cannot find big enough partners in the
fledgling private sector.
The government nevertheless wants free enterprise to thrive so that Vietnam
can catch up with and compete with its Asian rivals. While it concentrates
on economic development, Vietnam is urgently seeking to make friends in the
region and the wider world.
President Bill Clinton finally lifted the US economic embargo against
Vietnam in February this year, but the US administration feels unable to
restore full diplomatic relations with the communists who won the Vietnam
war for fear of protests by American conservatives; the two governments are
expected to open 'liaison offices' in each other's capitals shortly.
Vietnam, meanwhile, hopes to join the Association of South East Asian
Nations next year and is trying to resolve its territorial and maritime
disputes with China.
When it comes to domestic politics, Vietnam's communists - like their
Chinese counterparts - have no intention of abandoning the single-party
system, even if Marx and Lenin are not much talked about in Hanoi or Ho Chi
Minh City these days and constructive criticism of the government is
officially welcomed.
'The government is very wary of losing control,' says one diplomat in Hanoi.
'The trouble is, as you get more and more foreigners coming in, more and
more Vietnamese travelling abroad and more telephones, it becomes more
difficult.'
Vietnamese officials have trouble defining the ideological basis for
communist party rule in a free market economy. Asked to explain what he
means by socialism, Le Mai, the deputy foreign minister, says: 'Socialism is
bringing better material and spiritual living conditions for the people as a
whole.'
Government leaders are adamant, however, that economic reform should precede
political change (unlike in much of eastern Europe) and they insist that
one-party rule is essential for stability, a view shared by other
authoritarian governments in east Asia.
'The people here are very careful to maintain political stability,' says Mr
Mai. 'And they understand that by maintaining that, the economy can continue
to grow.'
Eventually the Vietnamese communist party, which earned its nationalist
credentials fighting off French, Americans and Chinese, may have to confront
popular challenges to its legitimacy and abandon the ritual obeisances to
Lenin.
But for the time being it faces only spasmodic opposition from Buddhist
monks and south Vietnamese exiles living in California. Almost everyone else
is too busy trying to make money.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally sharply on rise in UK base
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the action in the European government bond markets took place in the
UK, where gilts were whipped around by political worries and an interest
rate increase by the Bank of England.
Gilt prices fell  1/2 point at the opening on the government's parliamentary
defeat over increasing VAT on domestic fuel. However, they rallied sharply
on the Bank of England's unexpectedly early announcement that it was raising
its minimum lending rate by  1/2 percentage point to 6 1/4 per cent, nipping
rate-rise speculation in the bud.
This supported the auction of 10-year gilts, which was in full swing when
the rate rise was announced, and dealers reported good retail interest in
the issue.
Although weakness in the US Treasury market depressed gilts in the
afternoon, they ended the day in positive territory, with the March long
gilt futures contract on Liffe up  5/16 at 101 25/32 .
Before the rate rise, the sharp fall in gilt prices caused their yield
spread over German bunds to widen as far as 150 basis points but the rally
which followed the tightening pushed it back to 134 basis points at the
close.
'The general reaction to the move was favourable, and people were especially
impressed with the speed with which it was done,' said Mr Adrian James, bond
strategist at NatWest Markets.
Some traders complained that the base rate increase - announced only some 20
minutes before the deadline for auction bids - left them little time to
formulate their bids.
However, 'it was probably the best they could do under the circumstances',
said one dealer. 'If the Bank had waited, it would have run the risk of not
getting enough bids in.'
The bid-to-cover ratio for the Bank's Pounds 2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts due
2005 - next year's 10-year benchmark - was a respectable 1.34. Allotment at
the lowest accepted price of 98 13/16 , where the bonds yield 8.66 per cent,
was 98 per cent.
The average accepted price was 98 15/16 with a yield of 8.64 per cent,
giving a tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the
average accepted yield - of two basis points.
German bonds ended slightly lower, in sympathy with the US market. The March
bund futures contract on DTB fell by 0.21 to 90.84.
Dealers will focus today on third-quarter gross domestic product and
November jobs data. The Bundesbank council is expected to leave interest
rates unchanged.
US Treasury prices fell from Tuesday's highs yesterday after the chairman of
the Federal Reserve said he continued to be concerned about inflationary
pressures in the economy.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/16 at
95 15/32 yielding 7.890 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 19/32 , yielding 7.456 per cent.
In Congressional testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that
he expected producers to begin to try and pass on increased raw material
costs to consumers. He also said that the Federal Reserve's six interest
rate increases this year were made in an effort 'to forestall a new round of
higher inflation and inflation expectations'.
Investors appear to have taken the Fed at its word about its promises to
hold the line against inflation.
This sentiment has caused the market to see-saw this month as investors
alternated between optimism that full-scale inflation will not be allowed to
occur and pessimism that another rate increase could cause more price
instability.
Also affecting the market yesterday was the announcement late on Tuesday
that Orange County, California, filed for bankruptcy protection after
posting a Dollars 1.5bn loss in its investment portfolio.
Two-year bonds held relatively strong in spite of Mr Greenspan's comments as
investors pulled money from municipal bonds and put it into short-term
Treasuries. Early falling prices in the muni bond market pushed yields up
about 15 basis points.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Brazil move for Paribas

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paribas Capital Markets has teamed up with one of Brazil's smaller banks in
a co-operation agreement which shows continued foreign interest in Brazil as
an emerging market.
Paribas has entered into the agreement with BBA Creditanstalt, a private
sector investment bank in which Creditanstalt of Austria holds a third of
the voting shares.
The two sides hope the arrangement will give Brazilian issuers greater
access to international investors. They will also combine to market
Brazilian fixed income and equity products to local and international
investors.
Interest in Brazil has grown steadily this year, helped by a new currency,
lower inflation, and the conclusion of a Brady-style debt renegotiation.
Foreign investment is at record levels, and there has been a steady stream
of private sector companies launching issues on the Euromarkets or preparing
American Depositary Receipts programmes.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Bonds: South Africa's debut global issue
increased to Dollars 750m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of demand for South Africa's debut bond offering under the
country's new government led to the issue being increased from Dollars 500m
to Dollars 750m.
The long-awaited global offering of five-year bonds was launched yesterday.
Dealers expect a price margin at the lower end of the launch spread of 193
to 198 basis points over US Treasury bonds when the exact pricing is
announced today at 10am, New York time (3pm GMT).
Traders said more than half the offering was sold to investors in the US,
with European investors accounting for about 35 per cent of the deal and
Asian investors for about 15 per cent.
Asian interest was relatively weak largely because 'Asian investors will
want to see how the new credit performs before buying the new issue,' one
dealer said. 'They will also be waiting to see whether South Africa decides
to issue a yen-denominated bond in the future, which will be more attractive
to Asian investors,' he added.
Some investment fund managers said the bonds looked expensive at any price
below 200 basis points, but thought the offering would nevertheless be
successful.
Caja de Madrid, Spain's second largest savings institution and the country's
highest rated bank credit, made its debut in the euromarket with a Dollars
200m offering of floating-rate notes.
The issue, which offered a coupon flat with three-month Libor, found early
demand with European investment accounts, joint-lead manager Lehman Brothers
said.
Some traders said the bonds were priced aggressively, but a Lehman official
said the pricing was justified by the bank's Aa2/AA - credit rating.
Activity in the floating-rate note sector increased markedly yesterday with
borrowers bringing two dollar and two D-Mark FRN issues to market.
In the dollar sector, Bristol Oaks, a special-purpose limited partnership
backed by non-performing residential mortgages, launched a multi-tranche
global issue of FRNs.
Around 75 per cent of the main tranche, a Dollars 275m offering of FRNs due
July 1999, was placed mainly in Europe among corporate investors, banks and
fund managers, said joint lead manager Citicorp.
ANZ Banking Group launched a Dollars 250m issue of three-year floating-rate
notes via UBS offering a coupon of 10 basis points over three-month Libor.
In the D-Mark sector, BBDO Canada, part of Omnicom group, the US advertising
company, issued DM200m of five-year floating-rate notes though Morgan
Stanley.
The notes offered a coupon of 65 basis points over three-month Libor. This
represented an attractive pick-up in yield compared with borrowers of a
similar credit, such as a Citicorp's D-Mark issue currently trading at
around 20 basis points over Libor, syndicate managers said.
The bonds found demand with UK fund managers, German commercial banks,
retail investors in the Benelux countries, and with some high net worth
individuals, lead manager Morgan Stanley said. The proceeds were not
swapped, according to market sources.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Dual-currency Pounds 300m
facility for Britannia BS - Syndicated loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Britannia Building Society has asked Westdeutsche Landesbank to arrange
a Pounds 300m dual-currency revolving loan with multiple maturities.
The loan, which has a swingline option, has a commitment fee of 8 basis
points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) for the first four
years and a day, rising to 8.25 basis points up to five years and 8.5 basis
points for the sixth year.
The margin fee is 18 basis points for the first four years and a day, 20
basis points for year five and 22 basis points for year six. Participation
fees are 5.5 basis points for Pounds 10m, 7 basis points for Pounds 15m and
8.5 basis points for Pounds 20m or more.
A presentation was made on Monday and banks have until December 19 to join
the syndicate. A banker close to the deal said there had been a good initial
response and the loan should be signed in early January.
A Dollars 700m revolving credit for Svenska Cellulosa, one of Europe's
largest paper companies, arranged by Chemical Bank and Handelsbanken
Markets, has been signed.
The loan was oversubscribed in general syndication and increased from
Dollars 500m. A total of 31 banks joined the syndicate.
A Pounds 120m revolving credit for General Utilities, the holding company
for the UK water company assets of Compagnie Generale des Eaux of France,
has been increased to Pounds 126m after being oversubscribed in syndication.
A total of nine banks joined the syndicate.
A Pounds 237.5m revolving loan for MAI Finance, the international financial
services and media company, has been signed. It was increased by Pounds
37.5m in syndication. Chemical Bank was the arranger and a further 12 banks
joined the syndicate.

Brierley Investments, the New Zealand-based hotels and investment company,
says it will sell its 28 per cent stake in newspaper publisher Wilson and
Horton. However, it wants Wilson and Horton to find a buyer willing to pay
the right price, writes Terry Hall in Wellington and AP-DJ.
Brierley said yesterday it bought the 28 per cent stake in November, with
the intention of becoming a 'long-term, supportive shareholder' of Wilson
and Horton. However, 'the board of Wilson and Horton considers it would be
in the best interests of the company to have a media industry participant as
a strategic shareholder'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: US-backed consortium wins
control of Embraer

Wasserstein Perella, the US financial house, yesterday emerged as a
significant investor in the privatisation of Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft
manufacturer.
Wasserstein is the single largest member of a consortium headed by Bozano
Simonsen, the Brazilian investment bank, which won control of Embraer at an
auction at the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
The consortium, which will control 45 per cent of the voting stock, is made
up of Wasserstein Perella, which holds 41 per cent of the consortium's
shares, and the pension funds of the government-controlled companies
Telebras and Banco do Brasil, which together hold about half the capital.
The rest of the consortium is made up of Bozano Simonsen and a foundation of
Cesp, a state-controlled electricity company.
Mr Paulo Ferraz, chief executive officer of Bozano Simonsen, said that
Wasserstein, partly-owned by the Japanese financial house Nomura, had been
examining Embraer for some time and was acting as an investor and not as a
representative of other overseas buyers.
Hundreds of riot police and troops with machine guns closed streets around
the exchange before the sale, after fears of demonstrations by disgruntled
workers. However, the auction passed off peacefully.
The federal government sold 55.4 per cent of the voting stock for Rl 154.2m
(Dollars 130.5m), slightly above the reserve price.

The Czech government has delayed approval of an agreement with Volkswagen
which was to give the German carmaker majority control of Skoda Auto by the
beginning of 1995, the Czech news agency CTK reported, Reuter reports from
Prague.
CTK quoted government spokesman Mr Vadim Petrov as saying the reason for
delaying the approval was 'uncertainties concerning ecological aspects'. CTK
said Mr Petrov declined to comment on when final approval of the deal would
be discussed.
Volkswagen in November initialled an addendum to the original 1991 joint
venture contract with the Czech government for Skoda, which VW's
supervisory's board later approved.
The Czech government has yet to give final approval for the deal, which was
negotiated by the industry and trade ministry, and Mr Ivan Kocarnik, Czech
finance minister.

Tongaat-Hulett, the South African food and industrial group, has sold an 80

Mr Cedric Savage, Tongaat-Hulett chairman, said yesterday the company had

'The move is a major step in the group's black economic empowerment

FirstCorp; and Supervision's senior management, each of which have taken 20

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Regulatory focus shifts to
protection for customer - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen months ago, the popular concern about derivatives in regulatory and
political circles was their potential threat to the integrity of the banking
system. Good old boys with banking roots fretted that these new fangled
financial gizmos with trillion-dollar valuations might somehow set off an
economic catastrophe of undetermined depth and severity.
Derivatives dealers have since successfully educated their detractors,
convincing entities as notable at the Federal Reserve and the Bank for
International Settlements that further regulation is not required. As 1994
comes to an end, not one piece of new derivatives legislation has been
enacted in the US.
A cornerstone in the derivatives community's defence was an industry-funded
report by the Group of Thirty (G30), issued in July 1993, that recommended
guidelines for managing derivatives. So long as prudent risk management
practices are followed and understood, derivatives offer no more of a
financial threat than conventional securities such as bonds or shares, the
report suggested.
The report offhandedly stated that it was a good idea for derivatives
end-users, as well as dealers, to adhere to these 'best practices'
recommendations. However, when questioned closely, prominent backers of the
G30 recommendations, including J. P. Morgan chairman, Sir Dennis
Weatherstone, said they did not believe it was a dealer's responsibility to
give customers the tools to perform these risk-monitoring tasks.
This attitude, that derivatives end-users are sophisticated enough to take
care of themselves, has come back to hit the dealing community a serious
blow to their flank.
Among the many sore losers in interest rate derivatives transactions this
year, the most prominent has been Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products
group. In its lawsuit against Bankers Trust, it claims a derivatives dealer
engaged in misleading sales practices, and failed to provide the information
the corporation needed to properly monitor the value and risks of its
derivatives position.
That suit remains in court. However, this week Bankers Trust consented to a
written disciplinary agreement with the Federal Reserve, promising, among
other things, to give reasonably transparent pricing and valuation
information, sometimes on a daily basis, to customers who are counterparties
in leveraged derivatives transactions.
It is clear from the Federal Reserve's broad statement attached to the
agreement that the regulatory focus on derivatives has now shifted from
systemic banking concerns to customer protection.
'Banking institutions engaged in derivatives activities,' the Fed said,
'should maintain effective policies and procedures relating to client
selection, sales practices, and pricing and valuation.' Client suitability
and sales practices standards are common in the securities industry.
However, assisting clients with transaction pricing and valuation once a
deal is done is not common, or particularly necessary in larger, more liquid
and more transparent deals in conventional bond, foreign exchange, or equity
markets.
With leveraged derivatives, where deals are structured individually to meet
a client's needs and where pricing is done by the dealer as counterparty, it
can be nearly impossible for an end-user to measure, as is recommended by
the G30,how much of the investment could be lost given changes in market
parameters, across the term of the deal.
The customer is almost always dependent on the dealer for this information,
a factor that apparently is attracting more regulatory attention.
In fact, insiders expect that now Bankers Trust has settled with its chief
regulator, the Fed, two other agencies, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will also issue
disciplinary judgments. Neither agency will comment on this, but it appears
both are anxious to demonstrate their interest in OTC derivatives cases to
an extent that frightens lawyers for trade groups such as ISDA.
The 'hawks' in the derivatives dealing community contend that OTC
derivatives are neither securities nor futures, and so do not come under the
jurisdiction of either the SEC nor the CFTC. However, there is little to
stop either or both agencies from extending their reach by issuing
enforcement actions in a derivatives case.
An aside to all the derivatives publicity this week has been the G30's
release of a follow-up survey to its 1993 internal controls recommendations.
Buried in the data was news that 50 per cent of the biggest end-users
surveyed allow their treasury departments to use derivatives to create risk
exposures rather than just perform hedge functions.
The survey showed that more than a quarter of even the smallest end-users
allow their derivatives managers to speculate. Less surprising, but equally
revealing, the treasury departments of dealing firms themselves are allowed
to use derivatives to create risk exposures, rather than to mitigate them.
The G30 survey said 58 per cent of dealers gave this freedom to treasury
operations.

Mr Eric Molobi, the Trust's executive director, will be chairman of SPS,
which will be renamed Kagiso Khulani Supervision Food Services, while
existing management will be kept in place. SFS has long been one of South
Africa's largest catering companies and has 5,000 employees and a turnover

Singapore Airlines (SIA) has linked up with India's Tata industrial grouping
to form a joint venture company to develop computer software. The new
company, to be based in India, will concentrate initially on developing
SIA's computer system.
The move is the latest by international companies to make use of the
plentiful supply of high-skill, low-cost software engineers in India.
Airlines, hotel chains, banks and other operators of large computer systems
are among those which have moved parts of their programming operations to
India.
SIA is increasingly moving its backroom operations out of Singapore because
of labour shortages and also to cut costs. Last month, Singapore's national
carrier announced it would be moving part of its accounting operations to
China.
SIA said that India was a good choice for developing computer systems due to
the country's many information technology professionals. 'India has the
third largest pool of software development expertise in the world after the
US and the former Soviet Union,' said SIA.
An SIA study recently recommended that the airline join with the Tata group
to form a joint venture domestic Indian airline. It is believed that SIA
would have a 40 per cent stake in such an airline, with Tata controlling the
remainder.
The Indian government is expected to announce soon the conditions under
which foreign investment is to be permitted in the fledgling domestic air
industry. About 10 companies have been launched since private capital was
permitted into the industry two years ago. Exceptionally, one already has
foreign shareholders - Jet Airways, which is partly owned by Gulf Air and
Kuwait Airlines.
Rolls-Royce has scored its first success in Singapore's fast-expanding
airline market with Silk Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SIA, selecting
two of the RR Tay-engined Fokker 70s for services on regional routes.
Airline industry analysts say RR is also favoured to supply its new large
Trent engines for the latest stage in a multi-billion-dollar fleet expansion
and renewal programme being undertaken by SIA. The Singapore carrier has
traditionally chosen American Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its large
aircraft.

stake

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the country's largest resources groups,
is proposing to buy a 45 per cent stake in National Consolidated (NCL), the
listed Australian engineering group, for about ADollars 110m (USDollars
84m).
The purchase, which is subject to various approvals, would be the latest in
a series of Australian investments taken by MMC. It already holds stakes in
Ashton Mining, the diamond mining company, and Plutonic Resources, the
goldmining and minerals exploration group.
The seller in this case is Tooth &amp; Co, an investment holding company and
part of the troubled Adsteam group. Tooth currently owns almost 49 of
National Consolidated, and proposes to retain a 3.74 per cent stake if the
MMC sale, at ADollars 1.26 a share, is approved. Adsteam itself owns a
further 17.8 per cent of National Consolidated.
The sale is subject to approval from National Consolidated and Tooth
shareholders, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, and Central Bank
Malaysia. Tooth has also granted MMC an option over 19.9 per cent of
National Consolidated's shares, exercisable if a third party emerges to bid
for NCL and shareholder approval for the Tooth/MMC deal is not forthcoming.
Yesterday, in a statement, MMC said that it was not 'the present intention
of MMC to launch a takeover bid for NCL but, as in the case of its other
large investments in Australian listed companies, to maintain a substantial
long term shareholding'.
The company pulled out of tin mining, previously its core activity, last
year, and has been diversifying activities. NCL returned to profit in
1993-94 after several years of losses, on a reduced sales base of just over
Dollars 200m, having sold its building materials operations in 1993.

Indonesia plans to sell a stake in the national flag carrier, Garuda
Indonesia Airways, to a foreign investor through a direct placement before
offering its shares on the stock market, according to local press reports,
AP-DJ reports from Jakarta.
'The strategic investor must be a foreign airline which has a good
reputation internationally,' Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's finance
minister, was quoted in the Jakarta Post as saying. He said the government
would tender the sale of the stake among prospective investors who would be
able to improve the performance of the 45-year-old airline. However, he
declined to say what percentage of Garuda would be offered.
He said that Garuda was still a long way from being able to list its shares
on the stock market, and finding a 'strategic investor will help the
performance of Garuda before it can meet the requirements for going public'.
Garuda's latest financial report was given qualified opinions from the
government audit agency. After-tax profit in 1993 dropped about 21 per cent
to Rp73.44bn (Dollars 2.3bn) from Rp92.98bn in 1992.
The finance minister said the privatisation of the airline would also make
it more independent financially from the government.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Brierley set to sell 28% holding
in publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brierley Investments, the New Zealand based hotels and investment company,
said yesterday it would sell a 28 per cent stake in newspaper publisher
Wilson and Horton, but only if Wilson and Horton could find a suitable buyer
willing to pay the right price.
Brierley said in a statement it had told the Wilson and Horton board that it
acquired its 28 per cent stake in the company early (in November) . . . with
the intention of becoming a 'long-term, supportive shareholder'. However,
'the board of Wilson and Horton considers it would be in the best interests
of the company to have a media industry participant as a strategic
shareholder.'
Brierley's purchase of a stake in Wilson and Horton, costing NZDollars 280m
(USDollars 177m), prompted speculation about an imminent takeover bid.
Horton family interests, which control the company, subsequently maintained
they had sufficient support to block any bid by Brierley for the newspaper
group.
Instead, Brierley has agreed to sell its holding in Wilson and Horton if a
buyer can be found willing to pay a price that reflects the 'strategic
value' of its stake. 'In the light of the Wilson and Horton board's view,
Brierley is allowing Wilson and Horton an opportunity to identify a suitable
purchaser for its holding,' Brierley said.
A number of overseas media industry participants have already expressed an
interest in buying the stake, Brierley said, and discussions were continuing
with these, and other, prospective buyers.
Wilson and Horton directors initially accepted Brierley as the new majority
shareholder, but subsequently reversed this position in a campaign led by
its chief executive, Mr Michael Horton, a great grandson of the founder of
the 127-year-old company, and his son, Matthew, the business editor of a
Murdoch-controlled Australian tabloid, the Telegraph Mirror.
The prospect of another bid for Wilson and Horton surfaced late last week
when a mystery bidder bought 3.6 per cent from UK shareholders for NZDollars
36m. Both Brierley and Wilson and Horton, who between them control more than
50 per cent of the shares, say they do not know the identity of this buyer.
On the New Zealand stock exchange yesterday, Brierley's shares closed down 1
cent at NZDollars 1.17 Wilson and Horton's were unchanged at NZDollars 9.15.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Price/Costco plans withdrawal
from joint venture in Mexico

<TEXT>
Price/Costco, the US discount retailer that last year took its first step
into the UK, has decided to pull out of Mexico by selling its 10 membership
warehouses there to its joint venture partner.
The move is a setback for the company because its scope for further
expansion is limited in its saturated domestic market. It also highlights
the difficulties retailers face in attempts to spread outside the US.
Price/Costco's shares, quoted on the Nasdaq screen-based market, closed
Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 14 1/4 yesterday.
According to news agency reports, Price/Costco has entered a non-binding
expression of intent to sell its Mexican operations to Controladora
Comercial Mexicana for Dollars 95m. Price/Costco had no one available for
comment yesterday.
Three years ago, Price/Costco became the first US discount retailer to enter
Mexico when it set up Price Club de Mexico with Controladora Comercial
Mexicana. It has invested Dollars 71m in the venture.
According to a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Mexican stores are profitable, but sales at stores open a year or more
have been declining for the past three months.
The prospectus cites growing competition, a slowdown in the Mexican economy,
and dilution of sales at existing outlets as the venture opens new stores.
Saturation of the US retail market has led an increasing number of US
retailers to look outside their domestic market for growth. With last year's
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico and Canada have
become two popular areas for expansion.
Recently, however, there have been signs that the number of store openings
in Mexico is far exceeding the rate of growth in the population's spending
power. US retailers have also had to contend with unfamiliar distribution
systems, and have sometimes struggled to provide the goods that Mexicans
want at prices they are prepared to pay.
Price/Costco's difficulties have been exacerbated by the arrival in Mexico
of Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart. Both companies have set up joint ventures
there, and although Kmart's presence is still small, Wal-Mart had 52 stores
as of October 31.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge to take Dollars
135m charge in quarter

<TEXT>
Phelps Dodge Corporation, one of the world's largest copper producers, said
it would take a one-time pre-tax charge to fourth-quarter earnings of
Dollars 135m to reserve funds for environmental clean-ups and for losses
related to closing unspecified operations.
The charge, which on an after-tax basis will amount to about Dollars 87m, or
Dollars 1.22 a share, was unexpected on Wall Street, where securities
analysts had forecast the company's fourth-quarter earnings at about Dollars
1.34 a share. Phelps Dodge's share price closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 56 7/8 in New York.
Of the total charge, Dollars 100m will go to environmental reserves.
Including this amount, Phelps Dodge will have a year-end reserve for
environmental matters of about Dollars 164m.
The remaining Dollars 35m pre-tax charge will cover losses associated with
shutting down unspecified operations before the year end.
Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman, said: 'The operations being closed or sold are
peripheral to our business and their disposition should not have any adverse
effect on the company's future earnings.' He said the portion of the charge
related to environmental matters represents the company's 'reasonable
estimates for future environmental obligations'.

<TEXT>
French carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen plan to shed a total of at
least 2,900 jobs next year in spite of a strong recovery in French car
sales, car company and union officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Paris.
Union sources at Renault, which was partly privatised last month, said the
company planned to cut 1,735 jobs in 1995 through early retirement
programmes.
Since 1990, it has cut more than 21,000 jobs, or about 13 per cent of its
workforce.
Citroen plans to cut 1,180 jobs in 1995, and newspapers report that sister
company Peugeot is also planning to trim its payrolls next year.
The cuts are in addition to 18,400 job losses, representing nearly 12 per
cent of PSA's total workforce, since the beginning of the decade.
Although new car registrations in France rose 21.4 per cent in November from
a year earlier, industry analysts said the magnitude of the recovery partly
reflected the depth of the recession in 1993, and they added that it may be
short-lived.
Mr Jacques Calvet, PSA chairman, said recently he expected growth in west
European car sales would reach about 5 per cent this year and then taper off
in 1995, recouping only about half the 15.1 per cent drop in car sales
recorded in 1993.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: MGM hopes for a happy ending -
Its new films are critical for sale prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to the critics, Stargate was sure to fail. Rolling Stone magazine
described the Dollars 70m science fiction film as a 'giant-size loser',
'oppressively snoozy' and 'hell' to watch.
Yet Stargate has been one of the most successful films in the US this
autumn, taking Dollars 61m in five weeks, according to Variety magazine.
Its success could not have been better timed for MGM, its US distributor,
which is struggling to regain its reputation as one of the great Hollywood
studios.
Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank which reluctantly took
over MGM in a 1992 bankruptcy case, is compelled under US law to reduce its
investment to 25 per cent by May 1997. It has appointed Mr Frank Mancuso, a
long-time Paramount executive, as MGM chairman with a brief to prepare it
for sale.
Stargate was one of the first films to be released after Mr Mancuso's
arrival in July 1993. It is also in the forefront of a series of new films
which MGM and United Artists, its sister studio, will release over the next
year. Mr Mancuso sees Stargate as 'a great start' that 'shows what we're
capable of'. However, he is well aware that the next releases will be
critical in determining the prospects for MGM's sale.
The company was a wreck when Mr Mancuso arrived. United Artists was defunct.
MGM had sold its famous production lot at Culver City to Sony, the Japanese
electronics group. It had also sold its library to Mr Ted Turner, the CNN
television mogul, although the company had held on to the UA library of
1,500 films.
Mr Mancuso's first objective was to assemble a new team to revitalise MGM
and to resuscitate UA. He hired Mr Michael Marcus, an executive at CAA
talent agency to head MGM and Mr John Calley, a veteran US producer, to run
UA.
Mr Calley's appointment was a popular choice in Hollywood. Mr Mancuso also
scored points for shoring up MGM's finances by securing a Dollars 350m
revolving credit line from a consortium led by Chemical Bank, in addition to
a Dollars 400m commitment from Credit Lyonnais.
However, Mr Marcus was accused of favouring his old CAA clients at MGM. The
group's troubled history was also said to deter stars and directors from
signing up with the studios.
MGM and UA are now set to release 20 films over the next year. The premieres
begin with next week's US opening of Speechless, a comedy starring Mr
Michael Keaton and Ms Geena Davis. Next year's releases include a film
version of Tank Girl, the cult cartoon, and Rob Roy, a historical epic
starring Mr Liam Neeson, culminating with the Thanksgiving Day premiere of
Goldeneye, the new James Bond film.
Releasing films is not enough. As one rival studio chief said: 'So what if
they're opening 20 new movies? That could mean 20 opportunities to lose
money.'
However, Rob Roy and Tank Girl have attracted favourable advance publicity
and Mr Mancuso claims to be confident that the group's 1995 performance will
be 'at least in line with the industry average'.
He has also been building up other parts of the business. MGM Television has
been relaunched by adopting what he calls the 'bread and butter approach' to
television with LAPD, a police drama, and a new series of UA's The Pink
Panther.
Mr Mancuso's latest venture is to try to copy the retailing success of Walt
Disney and Warner Brothers with the opening this month of a flagship MGM
Studio Store.
Meanwhile MGM is under scrutiny from its prospective purchasers. The group
has already attracted a string of suitors including PolyGram, the
London-based entertainment group, Bertelsmann, the German media concern, and
Mr William Koch, the US computer mogul.
Film studios are sought-after commodities - as illustrated by the recent
fight for Paramount. MGM may be in very different shape from the profitable
Paramount, but is still, according to Mr Michael Kuhn, chairman of PolyGram
Film Entertainment, 'a great brand name'.
Credit Lyonnais has so far spurned all the bids in the hope that Mr
Mancuso's strategy will pay off and it will be able to sell MGM for more
than the estimated Dollars 2bn it has sunk into the company. The success, or
failure, of Speechless and the 1995 releases will help determine how high
that price will be. There is also the possibility of Mr Mancuso joining the
fray by mounting a management buy-out.
'That was one of the reasons why I took this job,' he said. But this does,
of course, leave Mr Mancuso in a tricky position - given that the more
successful he is at reviving MGM, the higher the price of the company will
be.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool buys majority of
Chinese microwave unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the world's largest producer of white goods, is expanding its
presence in the fast-growing Chinese home appliance market by acquiring a
majority stake in SMC Microwave Products, China's largest microwave
producer.
The deal will make Whirlpool one of the top five microwave oven producers
worldwide. It comes two days after Whirlpool signed an agreement with
China's Snowflake Electrical Appliance Group to make refrigerators at a
Beijing plant. Whirlpool is already a partner in SMC, a joint venture
company with annual revenues of Dollars 100m.
Terms were not disclosed, but Whirlpool said the current partners, Shell
Electric Manufacturing (Holdings) and Shunde County Beijiao Economic
Development Company, would hold minority stakes in the venture.
SMC has about half of the Chinese microwave market, which totals about
500,000 units a year, and exports more than 500,000 units to other Asian,
European and Latin American markets from its factory in Shunde, Guangdong
province. Whirlpool said it expects SMC to produce about 1.5m units a year
by 1997.
The rapid growth forecast for the Chinese white goods market is attracting
growing interest from western producers. Last month, Munich-based
Bosch-Siemens said it would link up with China's Wuxi Little Swan to build a
washing machine factory in China.
Whirlpool said talks with Chinese manufacturers for washing machines and
compressors were 'progressing smoothly' and could result in joint venture
agreements in early 1995.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Daimler approves micro car
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group, has given formal approval for
the production of the pioneering micro city car that is being developed
through a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz, its automotive subsidiary,
and SMH, the Swiss watch maker.
The company will decide this month on the site for a new assembly plant for
the project, but is expected to choose a site in France, the first time
Mercedes-Benz will have chosen to assemble vehicles in the country.
Mercedes-Benz is planning a radical approach to car assembly, with a modular
assembly system relying heavily on outside suppliers.
The company said yesterday that the level of vertical integration - the
share of in-house production versus bought-in components - would be cut to
20 per cent from 45 per cent of existing Mercedes-Benz car operations.
More than half the components and systems for the micro car will be supplied
from existing Mercedes-Benz plants or other suppliers in Germany, with the
remainder from components producers in west Europe.
The 'unusually low' level of vertical integration was a precondition for
producing the car at a very low cost and 'highly competitive prices', the
company said.
Mercedes-Benz, which holds a 51 per cent stake in the Micro-Compact-Car
joint venture, and SMH, the maker of Swatch watches, which holds 49 per
cent, aim to launch the 'micro compact car' in Europe by 1997/98, with an
initial production capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 cars a year.
They aim to open up a new segment at the bottom of the European car market
for a two-seater urban micro car that would be only 2.5m long -
significantly shorter than the Mini - allowing it to be parked in congested
cities head-on to the pavement.

BCE Mobile, the fast-growing Canadian cellular communications and paging
company which is 65 per cent owned by BCE, plans to raise up to CDollars
213m (USDollars 155m) in debentures to refinance existing long-term debt and
support system expansion.
The cellular business has grown at an average annual rate of 25 per cent
since the company was launched nine years ago.
Growth is expected to rise to 40 per cent in 1995.
BCE Mobile plans to expand its networks, geographically and by adding
equipment in large metropolitan areas.
Refinancing will take CDollars 88m of the new issue.
Morgan Stanley, the New York investment banker, has been appointed financial
adviser for the financial structure of the USDollars 2bn Odyssey low orbit
wireless communications system planned by TRW of the US and Teleglobe Inc,

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: A&amp;P cuts payout and makes
Dollars 165m provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea, the troubled US supermarket group better known
as A&amp;P, has slashed its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 20 cents and
announced that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 165m in its
third quarter to December because of continuing problems with its Canadian
operations.
It also warned that these actions would make it necessary to seek a
renegotiation of its covenants with bank lenders, but said it believed fresh
agreements would be achieved on satisfactory terms.
A&amp;P, which is 52 per cent owned by Tengelmann, the German food retailer,
made net profits of Dollars 379,000 on sales of Dollars 2.3bn in last year's
third quarter.
The company said its US operating results had posted a strong improvement,
but its Canadian operations were showing substantial losses.
As a result, it was taking a third-quarter charge to include the write-off
of goodwill, previously recognised tax benefits and certain long-lived
assets of its Canadian subsidiary.
A&amp;P said it was strengthening its efforts to turn round the Canadian
operations which were suffering from low-cost competition. It said it would
convert a number of Canadian stores to low-cost formats, resulting in a
further pre-tax charge of Dollars 25m.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: France tests interest in media
superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French budget and communications minister, yesterday
called on private-sector companies to take part in trial services to prepare
the way for a planned information superhighway.
'I don't want just France Telecom to respond,' he told a conference in
Paris, in a reference to the state-owned operator. 'One system for
experiment could be exclusively private, one public and one mixed,' he said,
referring to trial services to be launched at a local level next year, after
a selection process in the spring.
The services are aimed at testing technologies, equipment and regulations
for the government's plans to develop a national information superhighway by
2015.
The network, aimed at enabling the transmission of data, voice and images,
has drawn interest from French telecoms and communications groups such as
Alcatel, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
The last two are principally involved in water distribution and public
works, but have diversified into media and telecoms. Media and retail
companies have also expressed interest in providing multimedia services.
Both Mr Sarkozy and Mr Jose Rossi, the industry and telecoms minister,
outlined a pragmatic approach to the development of an information
superhighway. 'We must avoid the temptation of a dirigiste approach,' Mr
Rossi said, citing previous policy errors.
In particular, the Plan Cable, launched in the early 1980s and designed to
provide a national cable-television network, has failed.
Cable operators have suffered big losses, and the country has one of the
lowest subscriber rates in Europe. Mr Sarkozy said he hoped to use the
national cable-television network for information services. 'It would be bad
if the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.4bn) invested in these networks turned out to be
wasted,' he said.
However, a report commissioned by the government from Mr Gerard Thery, the
former managing director of France Telecom, has called for a substantial
investment in new infrastructure to achieve the government's objective.
According to the report, an investment of up to FFr200bn is needed by 2015.
Much of this would be used to extend a fibre optic network.
Yesterday's conference drew interest from French and international business
groups.
Mr Jacques-Henri David, managing director of Generale des Eaux, said his
company hoped to participate in the trials, offering telecoms and media
services through its existing cable networks, as it does in the UK via its
General Cable division.
He said the company also planned to work with partners from the computer and
telecoms equipment industries to develop other services.
Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom said the state-owned operator
would participate in the trials by providing networks, services and the
systems which co-ordinate services and their distribution.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Alcatel buys into mobile
telephone operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and communications group, yesterday
announced it is to buy a 20 per cent stake in the mobile telephone
operations of Generale des Eaux, the utilities and construction company.
It will buy the stake from Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned bank
which is implementing a programme of asset sales as part of a rescue
package. The price paid for the stake was not disclosed.
The decision by Alcatel to take the stake in Generale des Eaux's Cofira
followed its failure in October to win the licence for France's third mobile
telephone network.
Conclusion of the deal was delayed, however, by the need for approval from
France's telecoms authorities, which yesterday granted permission for
Alcatel to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in Cofira.
According to Alcatel, the investment in Cofira will be held by General
Occidental, its media and communications subsidiary.
The company said this would allow 'an absolute separation' between its
activities as an equipment supplier and its new participation in a service
provider.
Alcatel is one of the world's biggest telecoms equipment manufacturers, a
factor which contributed to its failed bid for the mobile licence.
The fiercely-contested licence was awarded instead to Bouygues, the
construction and communications group.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel chairman, has long sought to enter the market for
telecoms services. The company said yesterday the participation in Cofira,
which operates one of the two existing mobile networks, confirmed its
strategy of developing in this sector.
Industry observers forecast rapid growth in the French mobile telecoms
market, which has trailed other European countries. At the end of August,
France had 730,000 subscribers, compared with 2.2m in Germany.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hopewell turns to banks to fund
share purchase

<TEXT>
Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by Mr Gordon Wu, has opted for bank finance to buy shares in one of its
subsidiaries.
Its decision yesterday to turn to two leading banks for loans of about
HKDollars 7bn (USDollars 905m) come after it received a lower credit rating
than other leading Hong Kong companies.
The award of an indicative rating of BBB- from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation
has prompted a review of the company's financial arrangements, and a
decision to rely primarily on bank borrowing.
However, Hopewell's subsidiary Consolidated Electric Power Asia (Cepa), the
main vehicle for the group's power projects, still intends to raise bond
market finance. It was floated on the stock exchange as a separate entity
last year.
Hopewell's indicated rating puts its senior debt only just within the
investment grade category, and compares with a single A rating received by
Wharf (Holdings).
Yesterday's credit from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Hang
Seng Bank includes a novel feature giving the two banks options to subscribe
for new shares in Hopewell.
Hopewell will use the bulk of the loans to pay the final instalments on its
partly-paid holding in Cepa.
It bought 800m Cepa shares at the time of the power company's flotation, but
paid only half the HKDollars 10-a-share price up-front. A further HKDollars
2.50 a share was paid off this week, using the loan proceeds, and the
remainder will be paid next December.
Cepa plans to issue a bond in the capital markets for which it will seek a
credit rating. It will also consider using project bonds to partly finance
its power schemes in Asia, notably two current proposals in the Philippines
and Indonesia.
The options issued by Hopewell in connection with its loan will allow the
two banks, both members of the HSBC group, to subscribe an aggregate
HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for new shares in Hopewell from the
beginning of next year until to December 5 1999. They may only be
transferred by the banks to their own holding companies or wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and will not be listed on the stock exchange.
If the options are fully exercised, Hopewell will issue 182.9m new shares,
representing around 4.2 per cent of its existing issued share capital.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano cleared to
relaunch bid - Rolo investors will decide whether to accept a new offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Italy, which supervises Italy's fragmented banking sector, has
given Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank, the formal go-ahead
to launch an improved bid for 65 per cent of Gruppo Bancario Credito
Romagnolo (Rolo) of Bologna.
The central bank's approval, which came late on Tuesday, removes another
hurdle from Credit's path, but it could be well into the new year before it
knows whether it has persuaded Rolo's shareholders that its approach is a
friendly one.
In the meantime, the door has been left ajar for a counter-bid.
At a crucial board meeting on Saturday night, Rolo directors agreed
unanimously that Credit's plans for a new offer respected shareholders' and
the group's interests more than the Milan bank's original proposal. Those
proposals were announced at the end of October and promptly rejected as
hostile and inadequate.
Although Rolo's attitude to the new plan was widely interpreted as
supportive, the bank has since made clear that shareholders alone must
decide on the merits of the new Credit offer.
While they are ruminating, Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is
understood to be considering an alternative offer. This would probably be in
alliance with IMI, the former state-controlled financial services and
banking group, and supported by Bank Austria, in which Cariplo has a stake.
It is unlikely to make a move until Credit has formally launched its own
bid, but the terms Cariplo and its allies would have to beat are already
clear.
Credit has said it will offer L20,000 for each Rolo share, compared with
L19,000 in the original plans, and extend the offer to 65 per cent rather
than 48 per cent of the company. If successful, Credit would pay some
L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn) for the 65 per cent stake.
Under Italian takeover rules, the overall value of a counter-bid would have
to be at least 5 per cent higher - a requirement which could be met by
bidding for more shares or increasing the price per share.
Funding a bid is unlikely to be the main challenge for Cariplo. Like many
Italian banks, it is unquoted and controlled by a charitable foundation.
Earlier this year, the bank postponed plans for a L1,650bn share issue which
would have given it a stock market listing for the first time in its
170-year history. But the bank was not compelled to raise funds, and
advocates of a counter-bid believe Rolo is within Cariplo's range.
More important for Cariplo is that it should win an enthusiastic
recommendation from the Rolo board.
This could be more problematic, given the conflicting reactions to Credit's
latest plans, welcomed as 'friendly' by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's
chairman and one of Rolo's largest shareholders, but still eyed with
suspicion by some local investors.
Credit itself had to work hard to win even Saturday's dry statement from the
Rolo board, struggling to dispel the impression that Rolo might simply
disappear inside a less efficient 'national' bank.
Credit, privatised only a year ago, has argued strongly that it should not
be judged only on the basis of relative efficiency. Until the late 1980s, it
and other large Italian banks were constrained by archaic Italian banking
regulations to operating in parts of Italy - in particular Lombardy and
Piedmont - dominated by mature industry.
Smaller banks in regions such as Emilia Romagna, where Rolo operates, have
been able to take advantage of the faster growth of dynamic small and
medium-sized export-led companies.
Managers of some of those companies in Emilia Romagna point out, however,
that their needs tend to leapfrog national banks such as Credit. Either they
require local service, from small regional banks, or detailed export advice
and support in foreign markets, where the likes of Credit (and Cariplo, for
that matter) are still outclassed by well-established investment banks.
'Small entrepreneurs need a frank relationship with bank managers, and I
think it's difficult for bank managers to assume responsibility for
decisions if they are employed from Milan or Turin,' says Mr Manlio
Maggioli, president of the local employers' association in Rimini, on the
Romagna coast.
To win over such clients - and, in turn, a whole range of local Bolognese
interests from the church to academia - Credit has now made firm
commitments, albeit with a time limit, to preserving Rolo's strong regional
identity, maintaining a healthy dividend policy, and giving minority
shareholders board representation.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, is expected to approve the new
Credit plan at the end of this week, or the beginning of next.
This would allow Credit to announce the detailed terms of its bid formally
around the middle of next week and launch it a week later with a closing
date in mid-January.
Whether or not Cariplo then decides to enter the fray, it is clear the
complex struggle for control of the Bolognese bank could finally be won or
lost on Rolo's own territory.

FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Perstorp surges 66% to SKr551m
for year

<TEXT>
Perstorp, the Swedish specialty chemicals and plastics group, yesterday
reported a 66 per cent jump in profits after financial items, to SKr551m
(Dollars 73.1m) in the year to the end of August, compared with SKr331m last
time.
The improvement was attributed mainly to the benefits of investment in new
products and new markets.
Mr Gosta Wiking, chief executive, said the group anticipated a further
improvement in the current September-August fiscal year, in spite of rising
raw material prices in the early stages.
He said the return from investments, favourable market conditions in North
America and Asia, and an upturn in Europe were all having a positive impact.
Sales in the full year rose 21 per cent to SKr10.3bn from SKr8.6bn last
time. Operating profits before depreciation reached a record SKr1.2bn, up
from SKr930m.
Perstorp said sales improved in all its six divisions.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential plans changes to meet policy
sales rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation yesterday became the latest life insurer to respond
to new rules on giving more information to customers buying policies, by
promising to introduce changes next year.
The new requirements on those selling investment, pension and life policies
to inform customers about the policies and costs of selling, are causing
significant changes in products, payment methods for sales agents and
advisers, and brochures across the retail financial services sector.
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has already made several changes
to its product range and the costs of selling, but is planning more changes,
including discontinuing a handful of unpopular policies.
In particular, the balance of commission paid to the direct sales force for
pension policies is expected to shift towards renewal payments and away from
the heavy emphasis on initial commission.
The commission structure for savings products was similarly changed when the
Prudence savings account was launched in the summer.
Regular premium pensions policies sold by independent financial advisers
already give them the option of spreading commission over the lifetime of
the policy rather than from early premiums.
In both cases, Prudential is bearing more of the cost of the initial
commission than occurs with many traditional products.
This means that the values available if a policy lapses early should be
higher than they would otherwise be.
The moves are also intended to give sales agents and advisers more incentive
to ensure policies do not lapse.
Mr Jim Sutcliffe, managing director of Prudential's home service division,
said the group's worst lapse rates, where 25 to 30 per cent of policies were
surrendered in the first couple of years, were in pensions policies sold to
young people.
However, other pensions policies had the lowest lapse rates of just 2 per
cent in the first two years.
Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of Prudential financial services,
said the cost of meeting the compulsory elements of the new disclosure
regime came to about Pounds 3m each for the direct-sales operation and the
services for independent financial advisers.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Avon Rubber falls to Pounds 8.55m -
Lossmaking operations, since sold, behind decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lossmaking operations, which have since been sold, reduced Avon Rubber's
annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.55m, from a restated Pounds 11m. But on
continuing activities, the group achieved a 16 per cent rise from Pounds
11.6m to Pounds 13.5m.
Turnover on continuing activities in the 12 months to October 1 increased
7.6 per cent to 272m (Pounds 253m). Mr Stephen Willcox, chief executive
designate, said: 'I think it is a year when we've done quite a lot of
sorting out and are now well-positioned to go forward.'
Disappointment at the figures caused the share price to be marked down 26p
to 494p.
The final dividend of 11.5p maintains the total at 16.5p. Basic earnings per
share were 14.2p (30p) and on continuing businesses 32p (32.4p).
During the summer, Avon Rubber disposed of its inflatables business, which
accounted for about 5 per cent of group sales and had lost Pounds 3m in
three years. A 30 per cent stake in Motorway Tyres and Accessories was sold
to the majority holder, SP Tyres.
Mr Willcox said the group, which employs 5,700 people, was now shaped into
the divisions it wanted, consisting of one division in North America and
three in Europe.
'We are beginning to see a strengthening in all our major markets.' The
acquisition in October last year of a two-thirds holding in Avon-Rubena in
the Czech Republic had performed better than expected.
Automotive components, the main division, increased operating profits by 79
per cent to Pounds 6.98m, on sales up 23 per cent to Pounds 122.6m.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 20m included investment in Avon-Clevite in
Europe and Cadillac in the US, which were reported to be progressing
strongly.
A net cash outflow this year had been expected and gearing rose from 23.8
per cent to 42.2 per cent. Mr John Harper, finance director, said the rise
in base rates would not have a significant effect.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Innovative Technologies to float with
Pounds 25m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Innovative Technologies Group, the manufacturer of polymers and
seaweed-based products for the healthcare industry, said it aimed to raise
Pounds 4.46m from its forthcoming flotation, valuing the company at Pounds
25m.
Funds raised from the placing at 120p per share will be used to repay Pounds
1.3m of borrowings and expand manufacturing facilities for products ranging
from wound dressings to gloves and textiles.
The company already supplies a number of healthcare companies, including
subsidiaries of AP Moller of Denmark and Hafslund Nycomed of Norway, and
said it was close to signing potentially lucra-tive licensing deals with
other partners.
Unlike existing healthcare products on the market, said Mr Keith Gilding,
managing director, its dressings were longer-lasting and could enhance
patient care.
The value of the global market for such products has been estimated at
Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.07bn).
Following the placing, handled by Allied Provincial Securities, dealings are
expected to start on December 15.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Border TV 6% ahead to Pounds 849,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Border Television, the Carlisle-based independent television company, lifted
pre-tax profits by 6 per cent, from Pounds 802,000 to Pounds 849,000, in the
half year ended October 31.
The result, on turnover up 15 per cent at Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 4.85m), was
after a Pounds 46,000 loss from an associated company and a Pounds 297,000
exceptional charge relating to start-up costs of Century Radio and Scot-FM.
Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said that radio operations were expected to
contribute to profits in mid-1995.
Earnings slipped to 6.1p (6.7p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.6p
to 1.9p. The company trades on the USM.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hill Hire float delayed again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Market conditions forced Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle hire company, to
postpone its share placing yesterday for the second successive day.
Renegotiation between the vendor, Birkby, and institutions devalued the
market capitalisation by an estimated 2 per cent.
Birkby, the business property manager, had hoped the float of 60 per cent of
its equity in Hill Hire would value the company at more than Pounds 26m. If
the placing goes ahead today as planned, it is likely to be valued at about
Pounds 25.5m.
Hambros, the adviser, was still bullish about the float despite the delay.
Mr David Ewart-James, a director, said: 'It's a very difficult market out
there, but it shows you can still do good issues in it.'
The float follows Birkby's March acquisition of In Shops, the retail space
rental business. Hill Hire became a non-core operation. 'With the success we
have had we can stand on our own,' said Mr Jeffrey Chapman, Hill Hire chief
executive. 'We won't be competing for capital in the group.'
Hill Hire operates 2,050 vehicles at seven commercial vehicle rental sites
in the M62 corridor, including five under its Ember arm. It aims to open a
Manchester branch in April 1995 and is confident of expanding its fleet.
Pre-tax profits in the half year to September were Pounds 900,000.
Trading in the shares is now expected to begin on December 29.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exports help Mansfield Brewery increase 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased beer exports to the former Soviet Union helped Mansfield Brewery
raise its lower margin take-home volumes by 39 per cent in the first half.
The group reported pre-tax profits 17 per cent ahead for the six months to
October 1, from Pounds 7.47m to Pounds 8.76m. Total turnover rose by almost
11 per cent from Pounds 60m to Pounds 66.5m.
Earnings per share increased from 8.04p to 9.36p, and the interim dividend
is raised from 1.25p to 1.5p.
The shares closed yesterday at 236p, up 6p.
Mr Paul Handley, finance director, said the group had begun exporting beer
to the former Soviet Union 12 months ago, but it had 'taken off in the last
six months'.
The beer, sold in plastic bottles, is designed specifically for the market,
and features new brands - Monarch and Majesty.
However, the group warned that the Russian beer market tended to be quieter
in the winter.
In the UK, take-home beer volumes were ahead just 4 per cent, and margins
were static. On-trade beer and cider volumes were 2.3 per cent higher.
Mr Handley said that in a recessionary environment the group had pushed up
profits in all sectors, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. The
results had been helped to some extent by the warm summer weather.
Like-for-like volumes were static at the managed houses, but profits were 6
per cent up, reflecting higher margins and increased food sales.
The group acquired 10 new houses in the half, and expects another 10 to be
on stream by Christmas.
It now owns 485 houses in Nottinghamshire and Humberside, and has started to
expand southwards into Northamptonshire.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 2.17m, and gearing edged
ahead to 44.9 per cent.
Mr Handley said yesterday's rise in interest rates would not affect the
group before the end of the financial year.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chairman retires with BTP ahead at Pounds
18.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the speciality chemicals group, reported a 39 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 13m to Pounds 18.1m as it announced the
retirement of chairman Mr Frank Buckley after 27 years with the company.
Mr Buckley steps down at a time when the group is riding high following last
year's Pounds 107m acquisition of most of MTM's assets. On the back of the
deal BTP's earnings per share rose from 7.04p to 9p in the six months to
September 30, on turnover 23 per cent higher at Pounds 161m, compared with
Pounds 131m last time.
Mr Stephen Hannam, who moves up from managing director to chief executive,
said there was more to come. 'What we got was a fantastic set of assets
which will be the base for organic growth for many years,' he said.
Along with other speciality chemicals companies BTP has seen a sharp
increase in raw material costs over the last few months. But Mr Hannam said
it would be pushing through price rises ranging from '5 per cent to well
into double figures' next month and was confident that it would pas on all
its increased costs by the end of the financial year.
Demand in most of BTP's main markets is improving. Its adhesives and textile
coatings division, which was hardest hit by the recession, saw operating
profits recover to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.79m) while performance chemicals
rose to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 3.29m). Boosted by the MTM deal, biocides and
fine chemicals jumped to Pounds 8.62m (Pounds 4.43m), while the industrial
division held at Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 3.41m) after last year's strong
growth.
The dividend rises 8.7 per cent from 3.45p to 3.75p.
The shares firmed 1p to 283p, valuing the company at Pounds 382m. When Mr
Buckley, now 66, joined what was then British Tar Products in 1967 it was
valued at just Pounds 137,000.
Mr Buckley became chairman and chief executive in 1978 and dropped the chief
executive role only last year. He will receive Pounds 393,000 for the rest
of his two-year rolling contract and has been invited to become honorary
president.
The new non-executive chairman is Mr John Ketteley, 55, who has been
non-executive deputy chairman since 1979.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ICI to make Pounds 45m from sale of SA
chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI is to make a Pounds 45m exceptional fourth quarter pre-tax gain on the
sale yesterday of its remaining stake in AECI, the South African chemicals
company.
The sale of 20.6m shares raised about Pounds 80m and leaves as ICI's main
interest in South Africa a 51 per cent stake in AECI Explosives.
About two thirds of the shares were bought by South African institutions and
the remaining investment came from the US and Europe.
The sale followed a prolonged and steep rise in the AECI share price from
less than R6 to almost R35 since early 1993.
ICI held 38 per cent of the company until October 1993, when it announced an
exchange of part of its stake for a direct 51 per cent holding in AECI's
explosives division.
Apart from the explosives business, which employs about 5,000, ICI's South
African businesses are:
ICI South Africa, a wholly owned subsidiary selling imported products made
by ICI and other companies. The business employs 100 people
Tioxide Southern Africa, with 330 staff, is 60 per cent owned by ICI
subsidiary Tioxide. The rest belongs to AECI.
ICI will keep strong links with AECI, besides those through the explosive
and titanium dioxide businesses. Mr Alan Pedder, Tioxide's chief executive,
who represented ICI on the AECI board, will continue as a non-executive
director of AECI.
The sale was conducted by SG Warburg over a two-day period. It is the latest
in a series of modest transactions this year by ICI, which is seeking to
divest its self of businesses and minority holdings deemed not to be
central.
Mr Martin Evans of Hoare Govett said the sale of the remaining stake in AECI
was not a surprise. 'It is part of the long-running reorganisation that has
been carried out before and especially since the demerger of
(pharmaceuticals company) Zeneca.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hozelock at Pounds 7m after interest
charges fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased demand for hoses and sprinklers, courtesy of the UK's hot summer,
helped lift pre-tax profits at Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer,
by 85 per cent in its first year since coming to the market.
The result for the 53 weeks to October 1 of Pounds 7m (Pounds 3.8m), was
struck on turnover 20 per cent ahead at Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 32.3m).
Operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 7m (Pounds 5.1m). Interest
payable fell to Pounds 222,000; last year's figure of Pounds 1.35m included
charges relating to the 1990 management buy-out structure.
Operating margins increased from 15.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent as a result
of productivity improvements and tighter costs control.
Capital expenditure over the year reached Pounds 10m, most of which related
to the construction of Midpoint Park, the company's new Pounds 7.9m factory
in Birmingham, which began operating in July.
City analysts reconsidered their profits forecasts to around Pounds 6.75m in
August after Hozelock's trading statement announced strong summer sales
following a disappointing spring. 'We have come in on the right side (of the
forecasts),' said Mr David Codling, chief executive.
Strong progress was recorded in the watering products and new aquatics
division, which specialises in decorative ponds. Around 40 per cent of the
UK's watering products are estimated to be in hose storage systems. However,
with only 28 per cent household penetration compared to 48 per cent in
France and 64 per cent in Germany, Hozelock believes there is room for
development. Year on year growth in watering products was 36 per cent.
Mr Codling said his primary goal was further progress in Europe, while
development in Australasia and Africa remained a long-term aim.
Earnings per share were 20.2p (12.7p). A final dividend of 5.05p is
recommended, giving a total of 7.35p for the year.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Management plans Ferranti Technologies
rescue with Pounds 3m bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferranti Technologies, which makes fuses, gyroscopes and artificial horizons
for the UK and US defence industries, is expected to be rescued from
receivership this week by a management buy-out.
The components company, which was affected by the fraud that wrecked most of
the Ferranti group, has been in receivership since December last year. It
operates from the old Cairo mill in Oldham, Greater Manchester, employing
308, after shedding nearly 500 jobs to survive.
The buy-out has been organised by the Manchester office of Murray Johnstone,
the Glasgow-based finance house, and led by Mr Trevor Tuckley, headhunted
this summer by Arthur Andersen, the receiver, to restructure the Ferranti
business.
The price is believed to be about Pounds 3m, of which Pounds 1m is being
deferred for two years. Murray Johnstone is providing Pounds 1m of equity
and the Royal Bank of Scotland a Pounds 1m term loan and a Pounds 2.8m
overdraft for working capital.
Mr Gary Tipper of Murray Johnstone said yesterday that Ferranti Technologies
had been able to continue because of support from customers and creditors,
led by GEC, the UK Ministry of Defence, the US Department of Defense, and
British Aerospace.
It has a Pounds 17m order book, mainly fuses for mines and warheads,
gyroscopes for aircraft and missiles, cockpit equipment and computerised
military electronic systems.
This business is expected to continue for several years but Mr Tuckley and
Mr Peter Davies, operations director, and Mr David Platt, commercial
director, hope to develop some civil applications.
These include sensing devices that would automatically brake a car too close
to the vehicle in front, or engage safety brakes on trains if something is
detected on the line. The company already does similar work for the London
Underground.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury advances to Pounds 2.35m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaftesbury, the specialist property company, reported pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 2.35m for the year ended September 30.
The improvement was achieved on operating income up from Pounds 5.87m to
Pounds 6.25m and was struck after an exceptional debit of Pounds 433,000 on
termination of an interest rate swap agreement and a reduced interest charge
of Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 4.12m).
The group's investment properties have been valued at Pounds 77.1m, showing
a net surplus of Pounds 4.67m, while shareholders' funds grew by Pounds
6.99m to Pounds 48.7m at the year end - equivalent to net assets of 100p
(86p) per share.
After a tax refund of Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 49,000 charge), net profits
advanced to Pounds 2.82m (Pounds 963,000). Earnings were 8p (3.5p) and there
is a dividend of 1p (nil).

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Datrontech placing postponed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned flotation of Datrontech, a supplier and distributor of computer
memory and other PC components, has been postponed because of adverse market
conditions, the magazine Electronics Times reported yesterday.
The placing was expected to value the company at Pounds 50m and raise about
Pounds 5m.
The Aldershot-based firm confirmed the delay but said the float would
eventually go ahead. It is believed the share placing will take place in the
first half of 1995.
The company, formed in 1987 by Mr Steve King, managing and marketing
director, and Mr Ian Boyle, sales director, reported pre-tax profits in the
half year to June of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.4m). Memory products accounted
for 88 per cent of last year's Pounds 46m turnover.
Datrontech has a close relationship with Kingston Technology of the US,
whose products account for about 40 per cent of its sales.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Anglo United reduces loss to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo United, the loss-making fuels distributor and a preferred bidder for
the smokeless fuels arm of British Coal, has halved its interim deficit
through cost-cutting and lower interest charges.
The group, which has had two debt restructurings and a Pounds 25m rescue
rights issue since 1991, is also in talks with its bankers to seek support
for a further refinancing and cash call to fund the Coal Products bid.
The acquisition is crucial to the future of Anglo United, which faces a
mature and declining market in its main Coalite smokeless fuels business.
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said he hoped the negotiations would 'clear the
way to achieve a successful conclusion.' Anglo is believed to have offered
between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m for Coal Products.
Meanwhile, Anglo announced a reduction in pre-tax losses for the six months
to September 30 from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 3.2m. Sales of Pounds 90.2m
compared with Pounds 236m previously, which included Pounds 135m from
discontinued activities. The change reflected the Pounds 30m disposal in
March of Charrington Fuels.
Mr Cottam said that both the uncertainty surrounding the privatisation of
British Coal and falling demand for domestic solid fuel had hit sales.
In spite of these difficulties, operating profits from the core manufacture
and distribution of solid fuels and chemicals rose by 28 per cent to Pounds
4.6m.
Cost-cutting in the Coalite business and increased market share in fuel
distribution and chemicals helped to buoy profits.
Anglo United's debt fell Pounds 26m to Pounds 102m, following the
Charrington sale.
The loss per share halved from 0.8p to 0.4p. There was no dividend.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bowater sniffs profit in Pounds 66m perfume
pump deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the printing, packaging and coatings company, yesterday announced
the Pounds 66m cash acquisition of a French pumps manufacturer.
The company is buying SOFAB - the world's leading manufacturer of the
miniature pumps and valves used in luxury perfumes - from Bic, the ballpoint
pens maker.
The acquisition comes just a month after Bowater announced it was leaving
the paper business with a deal to sell its Australian tissue and other
interests for Pounds 158m.
After last month's sale and yesterday's purchase are completed, Bowater is
expected to have gearing of about 33 per cent.
Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said SOFAB would complement the
existing haircare pumps business. It would be managed as a separate business
within Bowater's beautypackaging operations.
He said it also offered substantial growth opportunities, with the market
for SOFAB's products growing at an estimated 20 per cent a year.
Mr Lyon said the fragrance market was growing rapidly because customers were
buying perfume in smaller packages and using more varieties for different
occasions.
Last year, SOFAB's achieved operating profits of FFr43.8m (Pounds 5.2m) on
sales of FFr171m.
Net assets before debt were FFr113m. Mr Lyon said the purchase was not
expected to be dilutive.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Swalec lifts dividend by 47% - Cost
reductions help pre-tax profits advance 21% to Pounds 53.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Wales Electricity yesterday saw its shares rise 9p to 780p as it
announced a 47 per cent rise in its interim dividend.
The increase, on the back of a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 53.6m, was partly the result of a rebalancing of
dividends between the two halves of the year.
The dividend increase was also assisted by the company's recent purchase of
7 per cent of its shares.
The company said profits next year would be likely to fall following the
introduction of the new regulatory regime next April. It said it hoped to
keep the post-tax earnings reduction to within 10 per cent of this year's
total.
Swalec's pre-tax result for the six months to September 30 was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 289.6m (Pounds 274.7m).
Earnings per share advanced to 39.2p (31p) and the dividend is 11p (7.5p).
Mr David Myring, finance director, said the underlying dividend rise was
between 15 and 20 per cent. The buy-back enabled the company to lift
dividends by between 2 and 7 percentage points.
The rest of the increase was the result of the rebalancing. Mr Myring said
the company expected the interim dividend to represent about 35 per cent of
the year's total.
Part of the profits improvement resulted from a 6 per cent reduction in real
costs during the period. Mr Andrew Walker, chief executive, said about 100
staff would go during the year.
The company was also benefiting from the renegotiation of pay and conditions
which has introduced a single table bargaining system and flexible working.
Mr Walker said there was more scope for cost cutting than the company had
previously thought.
Swalec has increased provisions by Pounds 8.5m since its March year end to
Pounds 33.2m, with the restructuring element rising from Pounds 4.8m to
Pounds 8.9m.
The company said it intended to continue buying shares up to the 10 per cent
limit for which it had authority, depending on market circumstances.
Mr Myring said the company would be comfortable with gearing of up to 40 per
cent.
COMMENT
Swalec's rating in the City has traditionally suffered, in part because of
its geographic circumstances - its heavily rural area is expensive to
service - and because of a perception that its cost cutting is not as
rigorous as that of other recs. It can do little about its geography but it
is showing progress in the management of its business. The core business
costs are coming down more quickly than expected and the company is getting
to grips with its other businesses. It has already divested itself of
retailing, something other recs are considering; contracting profits are a
healthy Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 200,000) and CableTel has some promise for
the future. The shares are trading on a prospective yield of 5.1 per cent,
suggesting that there could be room for further share price rises.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Amberley rise to Pounds
0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolstered by acquisitions, Amberley Group, the USM-quoted building services
company, reported a healthy advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 21,000 to
Pounds 552,000 for the six months to end-September.
The pre-tax outcome was struck after interest receivable of Pounds 21,000
(Pounds 1,000 payable) and came from turnover up from Pounds 2.14m to Pounds
5.21m, of which Pounds 1m came from acquisitions.
Lawrence Industries, acquired in September last year, contributed its first
full six months' profits, and Metacol, bought in June this year, made a near
three-month contribution.
Earnings emerged at 1.16p (0.21p) per share and an interim dividend of 0.25p
(nil) is declared.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RM dismisses Pounds 38m proposal from Misys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research Machines, the educational computer and software supplier which is
due to come to the market later this month, yesterday rejected an approach
from Misys, the computing services group.
Misys is offering 235p a share, subject to pre-conditions on the RM board,
which would value the group at Pounds 38m. RM shares, which are due to be
priced in the next few days, are likely to be valued at about 170p apiece.
However, Mr John Leighfield, chairman of RM, dismissed the Misys offer.
'This proposal does not value the company at anywhere near its true worth.
If we had wanted a trade sale, we would have sought out a company which fits
our culture and which would maintain our leading position in our market.
Misys does not fit these criteria.
'We are determined to press ahead with our strategy to improve our value as
an independent company.'
Following the rejection, Misys said it would be proposing an alternative
offer to SG Warburg, RM's advisers, immediately. Sources at Misys indicated
this would take the form of a partial offer.
A company statement said: 'The RM board has chosen to rebuff our approach
without any discussions with Misys, and RM's announcement omitted to
disclose that the offer proposal was a minimum price, was in cash, and that
the pre-conditions were waivable.
'The board of Misys believes its proposal represents a clear premium for RM
shareholders, compared to what might be achieved in the placing.'
Mr Leighfield said that he did not believe the Misys approach would affect
trading in the shares once dealing started, nor that the company would make
a hostile bid.
However, Misys sources said it was an option the company would consider.
Following the flotation, in which 25 per cent of the company is on offer,
management and employees will speak for about 36 per cent of RM shares.
Mr Strone Macpherson, deputy chairman of Misys, recently resigned as a
non-executive director of RM.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Annual review of FT indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothmans International, Vendome Luxury Group and newly floated TeleWest
Communications are among seven companies which will be included in the FT-SE
Mid 250 index from Monday December 19 following a quarterly review of
constituents yesterday by the the FT-SE A UK Indices committee, which
oversees the FT-SE A set of UK market indices.
In a separate annual review of index constituents, the committee also
approved the inclusion of 127 new companies in the FT-SE SmallCap index,
with 81 existing companies being removed, resulting in an additional 46
companies. These changes will be made after close of business on December
30.
In the Rothmans and Vendome case, the committee had to consider the
weighting in the indices of the two companies, each of which have a complex
corporate structure, with one UK company share and one foreign company share
traded in 'stapled units'.
The two companies were formed in October last year through the
reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods group, but they were
initially excluded from the FT-SE indices. Dunhill, their previous
incarnation, had been included.
Last April the FT-SE A steering committee approved a new rule on the
treatment of stapled units making Rothmans and Vendome eligible for the
indices, but said the weighting of the two would be determined in December,
after publication of the two companies' audited accounts.
Yesterday the UK indices committee included Rothmans with a weighting of 30
per cent and Vendome with a weighting of 10 per cent.
* Quarterly Review:
The quarterly review produced no changes in the constituents of the FT-SE
100 index.
The review of the FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350 produced the
following changes, to be made on Monday, december 19:(rankings by
capitalisation shown in brackets):
For inclusion: Telewest Communications (98); Rothmans International
(152);Man (ED &amp;F) Group (237); Vendome Luxury Group (281), Perpetual (305);
British Biotech (315); Cobham (328).
For exclusion: Asprey (551); AMEC (469); Bardon Group (411);APV (407);
Spring Ram (389); ML Labs (382); Staveley Inds (377). Companies excluded
from the Mid 250/350 will be included in the FT-SE SmallCap.
The committee also approved the inclusion of the following new issues in the
FT-SE SmallCap, with effect from December 19: Exco; Pillar Property
Investments, Argent Group.
* Annual Review.
The committee set the minimum size of constituent for the the FT-SE SmallCap
and FT-SE Actuaries All-Share at a market capitalisation of Pounds 40m.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost buys Dewey Waters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hicking Pentecost, the textile and industrial products group, is to acquire
Dewey Waters, the Bristol water storage systems business, for Pounds 2.7m
cash.
The deal follows April's receivership of DW's parent, Bimec Industries,
which bought the operation for around Pounds 11m in August 1991.
Hicking Pentecost bought Barbour Campbell, the industrial thread
manufacturer and a former Hanson offshoot, for Pounds 5.33m in May. The
Cardiff-based business helped its parent increase half-year operating
profit, before exceptional costs, to Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.04m).
An exceptional item of Pounds 357,000 to reduce costs has been charged
against profits. Pre-tax profits, after exceptionals, in the half year to
September 30 were Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 1.98m).
The company also announced its intention to keep hunting for
manufacturing-related businesses, particularly those where operating
efficiency can be improved, to add to its portfolio.
It also pledged continuing organic growth.
'In the last six months we have continued to improve profits at our existing
businesses and made excellent progress with our most recent acquisition,
Barbour Campbell ..This acquisition has doubled our size and spread the
group's activities across new markets,' said Mr Tudor Davies, chief
executive.
Earnings per share after exceptional items were 8.4p (8.8p). The interim
dividend rises to 1.8p (1.55p).

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow yesterday became the first company in the property and
construction sector to buy back its own shares.
The company said it would acquire up to 10 per cent of its share capital, or
42m shares, at prices up to net asset value - 128.8p per share at June 30.
Through its agents Hoare Govett and James Capel, Taylor Woodrow yesterday
bought about 28m shares in the market, or 7 per cent of its capital.
The shares closed up 5p at 124p.
The company said the programme would result in a more efficient capital
structure and enhanced earnings per share.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, added: 'The repurchase programme will not
restrict the expansion plans within the company's strategic business plan.
Taylor Woodrow's own assets represent a first class investment opportunity
at the discounted price, which cannot be matched externally.'
Taylor Woodrow has made a number of land acquisitions this year, including
purchasing the assets of Heron Homes for Pounds 30m in March and deals in
the US and Australia.
At the end of the last financial year, gearing was about 16 per cent. The
maximum expenditure under the repurchase programme is Pounds 54m.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Countryside Properties rises 74% and plans
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Countryside Properties, one of the largest housebuilders in the south of
England, reported a 74 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds
8.2m, against Pounds 4.74m, and further expansion of its housing activities.
The company completed 1,506 new homes in the year to September 30, up from
1,295. Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, said he expected the company to build 2,400
homes this year.
The government's decision to cut grants available to housing associations
will reduce the amount of social housing work available. Last year,
two-thirds of Countryside's homes were built under contract for housing
associations and others.
However, Mr Cherry said that the company would make up any shortfall from
projects which attracted urban regeneration funding. Orders for contract
housebuilding were more than Pounds 100m, against Pounds 85m.
Countryside has opened offices in Surrey and Bristol during the year and
plans to increase its speculative housebuilding programme from 550 to 800
homes this year.
Turnover rose from Pounds 91.7m to Pounds 149.1m, including Pounds 4.37m
from the commercial property investment portfolio, which was sold for Pounds
60m in June.
Sales of residential property increased from Pounds 76.9m to Pounds 130.1m.
About 40 per cent of house sales did not contribute to profit because they
were built on land acquired in the late 1980s at prices higher than today's
values. This year, the proportion will fall to about 12 per cent as old land
is used up, leading to higher margins.
Turnover from commercial property development rose from Pounds 9.1m to
Pounds 14.6m.
Last week, Countryside announced that the Post Office had agreed to pre-let
a 190,000 sq ft processing centre at Chelmsford, Essex. The development has
been sold forward to PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund.
Earnings per share were 8.4p (5.9p) and the proposed final dividend is
raised by 0.1p to 2.8p, making a total for the year of 4.21p (4.11p).

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Time and Security helps Blick to 30%
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Blick rose 12p to 430p yesterday as the communications and time
products company announced a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the
year to September 30.
Included in the results is a 10 1/2 -month contribution from Time and
Security, bought in October 1993 from Cable &amp; Wireless for Pounds 55.8m.
Group profits expanded to a record Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.41m) pre-tax on
turnover up 56 per cent to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 32.8m).
The turnover included Pounds 12m from the acquisition, which also added
Pounds 65.4m of gross-contracted rental to make the total Pounds 161.4m
(Pounds 87.8m).
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, group managing director, said he was 'delighted with the
organic growth' and said that three years of the expanded group's cashflow
would pay off the acquisition costs, which included about Pounds 20m in new
equity.
He had maintained that when the recovery came, the group's profits would
rise as demand increased and companies started to spend more freely.
'It was as if a dam burst about a year ago,' Mr Scott-Gail said. Blick
capitalised on this as the salesforce was divided into 'hunters', to seek
out customers and sell new contracts, and 'farmers', who service them.
Having paid Pounds 3.2m earlier this month for TR Services, a company with
similar interests in South Africa, Mr Scott-Gall said the group would look
towards Europe for expansion.
Mr Alan Elliot, chairman and holder of 30.25 per cent of the group's shares,
said he expected to announce an acquisition in 1995.
Group operating profits expanded 47 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 8.89m)
after which there was a net interest charge of Pounds 782,000 (credit Pounds
517,000). At the acquisition gearing was 167 per cent. That fell to 77 per
cent at the year-end.
Profits in the time division rose 74 per cent to Pounds 6.16m on turnover of
Pounds 20m (Pounds 13.3m). The communications side lifted profits 29 per
cent to Pounds 6.88m on turnover up 61 per cent at Pounds 31.3m.
Earnings emerged at 29.7p (26.28p) and a final dividend of 8p makes a total
of 11.5p, up 13 per cent.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RTZ completes Colowyo deal at double the
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation, the mining company, has finally completed the acquisition,
first announced in April, of most of the Colowyo Coal Company, which has a
mine in Colorado, at a cost of Dollars 25.5m (Pounds 15.5m) cash, compared
with the Dollars 13m originally intended.
The seller, WR Grace, the US speciality chemicals and health care group, now
receives Dollars 218.3m instead of Dollars 233m.
RTZ said the deal remained a good one as Colowyo produced 4m tonnes a year
of low sulphur, high-energy coal with about 180m tonnes of mineable
reserves. The operations complemented those RTZ acquired last year in the
Powder River Basin, which made it the fifth largest coal producer in the US.
RTZ has not bought an interest in some long-term coal contracts, involving
60m tonnes of Colowyo reserves. Instead these have been used to secure
non-recourse finance, which has given Grace Dollars 192.8m.

Mr Michael Green, the chairman and chief executive of Carlton
Communications, is noted for his caution. In the pioneer days of satellite
television in the early 1980s Mr Green was enormously interested, but kept
his cheque book firmly shut and instead made money by selling editing time,
studio space and other back-up facilities to those who rushed in.
Mr Green is the first to admit that he is no innovator, but someone who
watches carefully for the moment when innovation is about to result in
commercial products.
Yesterday Carlton announced a 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to
Pounds 190m. The figure was boosted by an eight-month contribution from the
acquisition of Central Independent Television, but was still ahead of the
most optimistic analysts' forecasts.
However, in a small piece of corporate innovation, Mr Green accompanied the
results for the year to September with the sort of detailed information on
strategy and performance usually reserved for annual reports. It amounted
almost to a conservative media manifesto for the foreseeable future of
Carlton Communications.
Carlton's strategy was not to plunge down 'super-highways' with high-risk
ventures dependent upon a particular view of how multimedia markets will
evolve.
The aim would be to stick to 'sound commercial judgments about what
consumers wanted' and to areas where Carlton could bring added value.
'ITV holds the dominant share of the UK commercial market and will retain
that position by continuing to invest in new domestic channels,' said Mr
Green.
The rise of cable and satellite would fragment the television audience and
as a result ITV would remain the channel which would deliver the
consistently largest audience for advertisers.
Yet, since April, Carlton has been turning out CD-Roms to address the
educational and games market from an optical media unit within its
Technicolor video cassette production plant at Camarillo, California.
At the same time, Carlton, the world's largest duplicator of video tapes,
expressed the belief that video cassettes have a long future as a means of
delivering entertainment to the home.
Not only had retail sales of videos doubled over the last five years, but
they are forecast to double again over the next ten. Snow White, released by
Disney at the end of October, was believed by the industry to have sold 10m
copies in the first week. Next year the Lion King, one of the most
successful cinema releases ever, was expected to be released on video.
Mr Tom Hall, media analyst at stockbrokers SJ Warburg, said yesterday that
the City increasingly realised that the video recorder was not going to
become obsolete overnight and that network television would remain strong.
With strong advertising revenue and growth likely in its professional video
and sound products division, Warburg believes Carlton will make between
Pounds 238m and Pounds 240m in 1994-95. After that that the crystal ball
begins to fade, but some analysts are already starting to talk about a
possible Pounds 270m to Pounds 280m for 1996.
Mr Hall, and many others, believe there is a degree of uncertainty about
what direction Carlton will take in the medium term. Although Mr Green
argues that after a period of rapid change and large acquisitions it is
perfectly proper to concentrate on organic growth and managing existing
assets, it is difficult to imagine that Carlton's acquisition days are over.
In the past year, its centre of balance has shifted heavily towards
television as Carlton Television produced its first full-year since its
launch and Central kicked in with its contribution.
As a result, operational profit in broadcast television jumped from Pounds
8.3m to Pounds 71.6m. Despite the large growth in earnings from UK
broadcasting, more than half of Carlton's turnover and operating profit came
from outside Britain. North America contributed operating profits of Pounds
89.7m and the rest of the world added only Pounds 10.5m.
As Mr Green looks cautiously forward to the multi-media future, he
emphasised yesterday that the one near certainty is that 'irrespective of
how they are delivered, original, quality programmes are the key to
attracting audiences and advertisers.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
St James Beach Hotels, which operates hotels in Barbados, cut interim
pre-tax losses from Pounds 253,000to Pounds 51,000Turnover for the half-year
to September 30, traditionally the low season, was 12 per cent ahead at
Pounds 3.5mcompared with Pounds 3.1m
The result included an exceptional cost of Pounds 119,000relating to
severance payments.
Mr Ray Horneychairman, said the figures were 'satisfactory', taking into
account the closure of two hotels for redevelopment, and below the budgeted
level.
Losses per share at the group, which obtained a full listing in April, were
reduced to 0.58p(2.15p).
The interim dividend of 1.25pis in line with the prospectus forecast and
shareholders will be offered shares in lieu of cash.

pre-tax profits of Pounds 241,000 compared with Pounds 24,000 last time. The
result included profits totalling Pounds 221,000 on the sale of properties.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bass advances 9% to Pounds 552m - Strong
growth at Holiday Inn but brewing side declines 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brisk profits growth at Holiday Inn, the global hotel chain, allowed Bass to
report a 9 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits despite a further fall
in beer profits and sluggish performances from pubs and leisure.
Profits for the 53 weeks to September 30 of Pounds 552m against Pounds 508m
also benefited from an extra week of trading. Turnover for the year was flat
at Pounds 4.45bn.
Current trading was encouraging, however, said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman. UK
consumer spending was picking up in areas such as pub retailing and soft
drinks, although brewing was 'just grinding along'. The continental economy
was showing some signs of improvement.
Overall, the City was encouraged by the results and a few analysts raised
their forecasts slightly for the current year.
The shares, which had been weak in recent weeks on fears of mixed news from
the group, rose 15p to 519p.
Holiday Inn operating profits rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 151m. US hotels,
contributing Dollars 203m (Pounds 124m), enjoyed increased occupancy rates
and a modest improvement in room rates. Holiday Inn's best region was
Europe, the Middle East and Africa with profits up 57 per cent to Dollars
22m thanks to aggressive promotion and UK growth.
Brewing was Bass's only setback. Profits fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 140m
(Pounds 156m). The company stressed, however, that the latest period
included an extra Pounds 12m in duties and Pounds 16m in restructuring
charges. The underlying fall in profits was about 3 per cent, one analyst
calculated.
Beer volume was up 1 per cent with Bass maintaining its position as the
largest UK brewer with some 23 per cent of the market. However, analysts
believe volume was down 1 per cent, adjusting for the extra week's trading.
Bass reported strong growth in its national brands such as Carling and
Grolsch lagers and a 6 per cent rise in cask ales.
Pub profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 220m.
The number of managed pubs fell by 10 per cent but beer volume per pub was
up 3 per cent and food takings rose 5 per cent in the Toby chain and 20 per
cent elsewhere. Profits from leased pubs rose 3 per cent.
Bass's leisure division reported a Pounds 2m rise in profits to Pounds 74m.
Coral was the best performer, benefiting from a new format in some of its
betting shops. Gala, the bingo chain, was ahead only Pounds 1m at Pounds 40m
but will benefit this year from a trend towards much larger clubs.
A final dividend of 14.5p is proposed for a total of 21.1p, up 6.6 per cent.
Earnings per share were 40.1p, up 10.5 per cent from 36.3p.
COMMENT
Bass deserves full credit for progress at Holiday Inn which will likely
continue for the foreseeable future. However, it is underperforming its
competitors in UK brewing and pub retailing and it is finding it hard to
grow turnover in a low inflation environment. A slow improvement in consumer
spending will help it achieve pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 580m
for earnings of 42.3p. This puts the shares on a realistic discount of 8 per
cent to the market multiple. Other stocks exposed to consumer spending or
restructuring of the UK brewing industry offer better earnings growth than
Bass.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Overseas growth behind 20% advance at
Courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courts, the home furnishings retailer, achieved 20 per cent rise in both
pre-tax profits and turnover in the six months to September 30, fuelled by
overseas sales sharply up by 30 per cent.
The shares edged ahead 3p to 798p.
At group level, profits grew to Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 2.72m) pre-tax and
turnover to Pounds 124.6m (Pounds 103.7m). Operating profits of Pounds 8.06m
(Pounds 6.89m) were boosted by a Pounds 663,000 exceptional gain from the
disposal of shares in the Mauritian subsidiary as a result of its rights
issue. Interest charges were up at Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 3.31m) as borrowings
grew to Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 43.5m). Gearing, including deferred profit,
rose from 35.5 to 38.4 per cent.
The transfer to the deferred profit reserve almost trebled to Pounds 1.94m
(Pounds 770,000) as a result of the increased overseas sales. Mr Bruce
Cohen, chief executive, said the size of the rise in the transfer was
because of a big increase in the group's in-house credit business. The
amount comprises the interest element and the gross profits on goods sold.
The deferred profit reserves now total nearly Pounds 50m, which Mr Cohen
said would flow into future profits over a maximum of three years. If the
credit business was not handled by Courts itself, Mr Cohen said, the group
would be ungeared.
Turnover in the UK increased 9 per cent. Here, expansion was concentrated on
the Superstore format. Courts' 32 Superstores account for about 70 per cent
of sales, with the 58 high-street shops making up the balance. So far, only
the south is represented, but Mr Cohen expects to go national in the next
two to three years.
Overseas sales grew so strongly on the back of expansion in south-east Asia,
particularly Singapore and Malaysia. There are now 120 stores in 13
countries; 14 were opened in the first half and six have been opened since,
with three more due soon.
Earnings expanded to 6.84p (3.94p) and the interim dividend is held at 2p.
While the pay-out is not a foreign income dividend, last year's final was
and this year's final might be.

FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Downturn at upholstery arm behind
Airsprung's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Airsprung Furniture Group have again been checked by a poor
result in its upholstery division. Its pre-tax profits in the half-year to
end-September slipped from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.33m.
The Wiltshire-based group's three other divisions all achieved significant
advances, with total sales rising by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds
33.1m).
Mr Michael Coppel, joint chairman, described it as 'a good result, bearing
in mind the current trading environment'. The interim dividend is being
maintained at 1.7p, covered 3.5 times by earnings per share of 5.89p
(6.41p).
Airsprung is the second biggest UK manufacturer of beds, and this division
saw a profits rise of 6.4 per cent on sales up 7.7 per cent. Profits and
sales of the show-wood division increased by more than a third. The fillings
division improved profits by 6.2 per cent on sales up nearly 10 per cent.
In upholstery, there was static turnover and an adverse swing of Pounds
420,000 took the division into a small loss.
Mr John Pierce, chief executive, said one problem had been a new range which
had not been thoroughly costed and had effectively sold at a loss. But the
company was pleased with the way the division was pulling round and he
expected it to return to profit by the end of the year.
Mr Pierce said Airsprung's margins had suffered from substantial increases
'with yet more to come' in the costs of imported raw materials, especially
of timber, wire and fabrics.
The group would have no option but to pass on the costs in higher prices
early in the new year. 'I think all companies in the furniture industry face
this pressure and can't absorb the cost increases further.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Successful start to S African bond issue

Investors greeted South Africa's first international bond offering since the
end of apartheid with enthusiasm yesterday, leading to an increase in the
size of the issue from Dollars 500m (Pounds 304.8m) to Dollars 750m.
The launch of the global issue of five-year bonds marked the country's
return to international capital markets since the elections in April.
Its success suggests that the country's reintegration into the international
financial community is now all but complete.
A flood of new issues from South African companies in the public and private
sector may follow.
Many South African companies and institutions were closely watching the
performance of the offering as a measure of the acceptabilty of South
African bonds on the global market.
'Although the issue is small, the reception is a welcome signal of
international confidence in the country's economic future,' said Mr Tony
Twine, an economist at Johannesburg-based consultants Econometrix.
'It will help smooth the way for other public issuers like (electricity
utility) Eskom.'
Eskom, the state-owned electricity utility, and Telkom, the
telecommunications company, among others, as well as several private
companies, are expected to approach the international capital markets soon.
The South African government is expected to make a second issue, possibly
after the next budget, due in March. 'South Africa remains grossly
underborrowed internationally, relative to other emerging markets of a
similar size,' says Annelise Peers, of Johannesburg brokers Frankel Pollak
Vinderine. 'There's room for a lot more borrowing.'
As a result of the strong demand, the bonds are expected to be priced at the
lower end of the launch spread of 193 and 198 basis points over US Treasury
bonds.
The exact pricing is expected to be confirmed today.
Investor demand was greatest in the US, with European and Asian investors
also making a strong showing.
Swiss Bank Corporation and Goldman Sachs are the banks arranging the deal.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Deutsche Bank dips on dimmer outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank chairman, yesterday downgraded his
assessment of business prospects, presented unexpectedly poor interim
results, and prompted Frankfurt stock exchange traders to mark down the
banking group's shares.
Announcing a 19 per cent fall to DM3.57bn (Pounds 1.45bn) in operating
profits for the first 10 months - earnings at this level were up 1 per cent
after six months - he predicted only a 'satisfactory' outcome for the full
12 months.
That contrasted with his assessment of an 'above average' performance at
halfway after an 'exceptional' year in 1993, and led analysts, due to meet
board members tomorrow, provisionally to reduce their earnings per share
forecasts for 1994.
Deutsche shares closed down DM2.50 at DM735.80 in Frankfurt yesterday, while
Dresdner Bank stock, affected on Tuesday by worse-than-expected losses on
own-account trading, recovered DM2.30.
According to Mr Kopper, Deutsche's earnings from its own account dealings -
down 67 per cent at DM543m, the same proportion as at halfway - were
generated mainly by equities trading.
The own-account securities business, on the other hand, was affected by
DM327m in write-offs on bonds in the 10 months under review. Deutsche wrote
down some DM147m on its bonds business in the first half.
Net commission income was virtually unchanged on the comparable part of 1993
at DM4.87bn after being up 6 per cent in the first six months. Interest
earnings, unchanged at halfway, fell 2.7 per cent to DM9.5bn. Heavy risk
provisions, after rising during the recession, were still needed to cover
potentially bad loans especially in the domestic market, Mr Kopper said.
About DM1.5bn of provisions were written back compared with DM1.3bn in the
comparable part of 1993, reducing net provisions to DM1.6bn. Group loans
outstanding at the end of October totalled DM327bn, 1.8 per cent less than
at the end of the last financial year. There was a fall of DM11bn in short
and medium-term loans to customers, while long-term lending increased by
almost DM7bn.

FT  08 DEC 94 / VSEL put into deep freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a government tenderly nursing its political bruises, the prospect of
entering a very public fight over an obscure submarine maker cannot have
been very appetising. Hence the stock market's assumption that the trade and
industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, would not refer either British
Aerospace or General Electric Company to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in their bids for VSEL.
What upset that calculation was the Office of Fair Trading's insistence that
there was a competition issue raised by GEC's bid, since it already owns
Britain's other large warship maker, Yarrow on the Clyde.
Once GEC was headed to the MMC, effectively freezing its bid, then the least
contentious option was to send BAe too. Both now will face three months of
scrutiny, GEC on competition grounds and BAe on the rather murkier issue of
'public interest involving national security'. Since BAe is not normally
considered a threat to national security this phrase may more accurately be
read as 'political expediency'.
Yet it was not supposed to be that way. The Ministry of Defence, currently
VSEL's only customer, had raised no competition worries about either
company. If the MoD as customer was not concerned, why should anyone else be
worried?
It was the intervention of the Treasury which tipped the balance. The
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is thought to have been concerned about
competition and argued that it was not the MoD but the taxpayer who was the
customer. As a procurement agency, the MoD should not dictate the public
interest.
There is certainly a great deal for the MMC to mull over. UK defence
competition policy seems to be heading in two directions. Market testing is
introducing more competition to parts of the MoD, while shrinking defence
budgets are forcing consolidation and a reduction in competition.
For the companies involved in this battle, the next three months will
require a great deal of management time to be spent at the MMC, one reason
perhaps why GEC is considering whether it wishes to continue.
BAe, which has said it will fight on, will also continue its restructuring
programme. It has raised Pounds 178m as a result of the first phase of its
rights issue. That money will probably be used to rationalise its turboprop
regional aircraft business. Negotiations between BAe and ATR, the
Franco-Italian company, are progressing and a joint venture could be formed
before the VSEL issue is resolved. BAe is also negotiating a merger of its
missiles business with Matra, which also may be concluded in the next few
months.
For VSEL shareholders and employees, the uncertainty continues. If the MMC
investigation is drawn out, it might also interfere with the bidding for the
next batch of Trafalgar class nuclear hunter-killer submarines.
That is due to be decided next year and GEC is a possible bidder against
VSEL for the Pounds 2.5bn contract. It would be possible for the MoD to slow
down the Trafalgar bids, but VSEL cannot afford to wait long as a gap is
beginning to open up between the end of work on Trident and the beginning of
Trafalgar. Work on Trident has been slowed once to ease that problem. But
however politically convenient it is to stick VSEL into the deep freeze, the
company cannot afford to wait forever.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Putting a premium on cost-cutting and consolidation: Patrick
Harverson examines two US insurance deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the troubled US property and casualty insurance business is still a
long way from recovery, industry analysts are hailing two deals this week -
the Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 670m) acquisition of Continental Corporation by
CNA Financial and the Dollars 420m rescue of Swedish-controlled Home
Holdings by a group of US investors - as important steps in the right
direction.
The industry is plagued by:
over-capacity which has led to intense price competition,
rising claims from natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and hurricanes,
increasing pressure from regulators and ratings agencies to acknowledge
longstanding asbestos and pollution losses, and
declining capital among several big companies.
As a result, insurers have reported sharply lower earnings or losses on
their property-casualty businesses, and the poor results have prompted the
ratings agencies to downgrade the debt of several leading companies
(including, in recent weeks, Cigna, Aetna, Continental and Home Holdings).
The downgrades only exacerbate the industry's woes, because insurance agents
and brokers tend to shy away from lower-rated companies.
In spite of this gloomy scenario, analysts say some of the the
property-casualty industry's worst problems can be solved by cost-cutting
and consolidation. Hence, the acclaim on Wall Street for Tuesday's
announcement that CNA will be acquiring its troubled rival Continental - a
deal which should enable the two companies to realise considerable economies
of scale.
Ms Anna Iacucci, insurance analyst at the ratings agency Moody's, says the
CNA-Continental merger is a welcome consolidation within the industry. 'We
have seen companies buying books of business or buying smaller companies . .
. but this is the largest yet.'
The merger will create the seventh largest insurance company and the third
biggest property-casualty group in the US, with combined assets of Dollars
58bn and revenues of Dollars 16bn. Although some observers expressed
surprise that CNA - which has earned a reputation as one of the most
conservatively run of US insurers under the ownership of the New York-based
Tisch family - was buying a company plagued with losses, a capital shortage
and doubts about the adequacy of its reserves, most said the deal made
sense.
CNA will pay Dollars 20 a share in cash for Continental, a hefty premium
over the pre-bid price of Dollars 14, but well below the insurer's Dollars
24.75 book value. Aside from the Dollars 1.1bn it will spend on acquiring
Continental, CNA will also have to invest Dollars 275m which had been
pledged by the investment group Insurance Partners in an earlier
refinancing. CNA plans to finance the acquisition either with long-term
debt, or some combination of debt and equity.
The immediate task is to wring as many cost savings possible out of the
merger. The combined operations employ 21,000 people, and big job cuts are
likely. Similarly, there will be considerable early gains to be achieved
from merging back-office operations and systems. Benefits should emerge from
combining CNA and Continental's complimentary product lines, most notably in
personal insurance (particularly motor and home policies), commercial
insurance and specialty insurance (especially marine and professional
liability).
It is vital for CNA to achieve all potential cost savings because of fierce
competition. Ms Iacucci says: 'Both companies are competing in lines of
business that face commodity-type pricing.'
Some analysts believe the main impact of the merger will not be on pricing,
but on the approach of other insurers to cost cuts. Mr Alan Levin of
Standard &amp; Poor's believes that while the merger 'will probably reduce the
potential for a tightening of rates, because CNA is saying it will
restructure itself to live in a world where rate competition is very high',
it will also 'put significant pressure on their competitors, who will need
to find ways to reduce their own cost bases.'
Although the rising claims, falling prices and inadequate capital that
forced Continental into CNA's arms are the same problems that persuaded a
group of US investors to bail out Home Holdings this week, the motivations
behind the two deals are different. As Mr Levin points out: 'CNA is a
classic strategic investor. Jack Byrne and his group are classic financial
investors. They believe they have uncovered a diamond in the rough and
therefore they're buying at value. CNA is buying a company which it hopes to
restructure fundamentally.'
Under the deal between Mr Byrne and Home's current majority owner, the
Swedish insurer Trygg-Hansa, the US investor group will inject Dollars 420m
into Home in return for ultimately taking control. The deal is regarded as a
much bigger gamble than CNA's purchase of Continental, because Home has some
of the largest exposures to environmental losses.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Carlton sets sights on the continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications, the television and television services company which
yesterday announced full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 190m, is planning to
increase its presence in continental Europe.
Mr Michael Green, the Carlton chairman and chief executive, is intent on
pushing into Europe, which accounts for Pounds 119m turnover of a Pounds
1.4bn total.
Carlton's operating profit in Europe fell year-on-year from Pounds 4.4m to
Pounds 3.8m largely because of the losses of the French division of
Pickwick, Carlton's video publisher and distributor. The French business has
now been sold.
Carlton's 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the 12 months to
September was lifted by an eight-month contribution from Central, the
Midlands ITV company acquired at the turn of the year. Central contributed
Pounds 219m to turnover and Pounds 47m to pre-interest operating profits.
Excluding Central, pre-tax growth was 22 per cent with all four Carlton
divisions, broadcast television, video &amp; audio production and distribution,
film &amp; television services and video &amp; sound products increasing sales and
profits.
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 54p. The final net dividend was
12.5p, bringing the total for the year to 20.65p an increase of 10 per cent.
Exports from the UK rose from Pounds 161m in 1993 to Pounds 187m this year.
Mr Green yesterday renewed his appeal for the replacement of existing
cross-media ownership restrictions, 'with the normal machinery of
competition law'.
The integrated Carlton and Central Television companies cover 35 per cent of
the UK population and account for more than 30 per cent of ITV's advertising
revenue. Shares in Carlton, which is expected to produce at least Pounds
240m in pre-tax profit in the current year, rose 16p yesterday to close at
868p.
Mr Green promised to build on Carlton's export performance, 'by using our
programme libraries and our substantial investment in original productions
to increase our sales of television programmes into overseas markets'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Auditing changes aim to curb company fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of the auditor faces its biggest reform for 15 years under
proposals yesterday from the audit regulator to tackle fraud and improve the
accuracy of company accounts.
The Auditing Practices Board, which issues standards with the force of law,
published measures to extend the scope of the audit in listed companies and
tackle public scepticism over the effectiveness of auditors.
Mr Ian Plaistowe, chairman of the board, said: 'The key to confidence in the
capital markets is a sound independent audit function. The proposals in this
paper set out to ensure that my profession fulfils this role to the full.'
Professor Ian Percy, chairman of the task force that produced The Audit
Agenda, said: 'The fundamental objective of auditing is to uphold the
integrity of financial reporting and business conduct.' He said binding
rules based on the report could be issued in 1996.
The report follows on from the establishment of the Audit Practice Board in
1991 after a series of corporate collapses in which auditors were blamed for
not detecting fraud or inherent financial difficulties.
The report includes proposals to:
Extend audit for listed companies to include scrutiny of the chairman's
report.
Order periodic special audits designed to catch fraud.
Require the auditor to sign the accounts personally - not just use the name
of the firm of accountants.
Allow audit committees, which include non-executive directors, to appoint
and set fees for auditors on behalf of the shareholders.
Toughen up penalties for misleading auditors.
Teach auditors how to spot fraud and fraudsters.
Yesterday's report steps back from some of the more radical ideas floated in
the controversial McFarlane Report of 1992.
The report was immediately welcomed by Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG
Peat Marwick, who said it was more 'usable' than the earlier report. He
added: 'I know that it may not be universally popular, but the suggestion
that the partner should sign the audit report in his or her own name as well
as in the name of the firm will help to focus minds on where responsibility
really lies.'
Mr Roger Davies, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The APB is
getting into choppy waters in suggesting that audit committees of
non-executive directors should have a Continental-style supervisory role in
the board.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Morgan Grenfell fined over Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell Investment Management has been fined Pounds 180,000 by Imro,
the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, in connection
with losses from pension schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The fine is the third largest ever imposed by Imro. Morgan Grenfell has also
agreed to pay costs of Pounds 95,000.
Imro has also levied Pounds 170,000 in fines on two other former fund
managers of Maxwell pension schemes for different rule breaches, neither of
which led to losses for pensioners.
Morgan Grenfell said the error, which was administrative, had been committed
in February 1989, and 'we accept that we are guilty'. Morgan Grenfell has
offered to make restitution of Pounds 276,000 to one of the Maxwell company
pension schemes which trustees say had been lost as a result of the
transaction.
The charges stem from Morgan Grenfell's role as fund manager for the AGB
Group Retirement Benefit Scheme. After AGB had been acquired by Mr Maxwell,
a separate AGB Directors Scheme was set up with its own trustees. However,
Morgan Grenfell said it had never been made aware of the distinction between
the two.
Imro said that Morgan Grenfell authorised its custodian bank to transfer AGB
directors pension plan assets to a third party custodian bank without
authority of that scheme's trustees. In total, according to Morgan Grenfell,
the AGB group and directors scheme assets were worth about Pounds 8m, of
which roughly Pounds 800,000 belonged to the directors' scheme.
Also, Imro agreed a fine of Pounds 110,000 with NatWest Investment
Management, in connection with a discretionary investment management service
it provided for the Maxwell Communication Pension Scheme. NWIM also agreed
to pay costs of Pounds 70,000.
According to Imro, NWIM failed to make adequate arrangements for the
verification of individuals authorised to give instructions relating to cash
payments or asset transfers.
On one occasion, Imro said, NWIM received instructions to transfer shares
using blank stock transfer forms.
Imro also said that Nikko Capital Management (UK) Ltd agreed to pay a fine
of Pounds 60,000 and costs of Pounds 42,500 in connection with a significant
breach of financial resources rules. In September 1991, Nikko extended a
Pounds 6m loan overnight to Bishopsgate Investment Management.
However, Nikko's rules required it to have minimum capital resources of
Pounds 193,000 and it had negative capital of nearly Pounds 6m until the
following day.

Deutsche Bank has had a dreadful year. The collapse of Metallgesellschaft
and the Schneider scandal have dented the bank's reputation and profits. The
recent rebound in the bank's share price suggests investors are beginning to
look on the catalogue of mishaps as a thing of the past. But yesterday's
10-month results are unlikely to encourage any further re-rating.
The figures are discouraging on a number of points. The 2.7 per cent drop in
interest income on the comparable period of 1993 contrasts starkly with
gains of more than 10 per cent at Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank in the same
period. Clearly Deutsche's mainstream lending business is performing more
sluggishly than those of its smaller rivals. This is in part due to
Deutsche's prudent policy of scaling back loans during the German recession,
but there has been no corresponding decline in risk provisioning. New
provisions remain high and it is little consolation that the extraordinary
gains on the sale of stakes in Daimler-Benz and Karstadt have been swallowed
up by big write-offs against Metallgesellschaft and Schneider.
Deutsche has avoided the loss on own-account trading experienced by
Dresdner, but analysts are still downgrading forecasts. As a result
Deutsche's shares now look fairly valued versus other German banks. Another
drag on the share price is the possibility that Deutsche will back up its
ambitions in the investment banking field with a big acquisition. This would
entail a large goodwill write-off and the bank might have to turn to
shareholders to rebuild core capital.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to refer both the British Aerospace and GEC bids
for VSEL to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is bizarre. The
competition argument is thin. True, a GEC takeover would reduce the number
of UK warship manufacturers from three to two. But the Ministry of Defence,
as a monopsonist, is quite capable of looking after itself in negotiations.
The public interest argument for referral is even stranger. The government
cannot seriously be suggesting that either BAe or GEC is a threat to
national security.
The referrals are an irritation for all three companies. VSEL shareholders
obviously lose out, since there is some doubt whether a lucrative bidding
war will resume in March. BAe can at least comfort itself with the knowledge
that the first part of its 'trombone' rights issue, worth Pounds 178m, is
still intact. That can be used to restructure its loss-making turbo-prop
business. Its shareholders, though, can hardly be pleased that more money
will presumably have to be spent on underwriting fees post-March on top of
the vast sums that have already been spent on the trombone. Meanwhile, GEC
can draw grim satisfaction from the fact that it has managed to drag BAe
into the Monopolies Commission with it.
Ministers are embracing the idea of greater cross-border collaboration
between Europe's defence groups. That may count against an eventual merger
of GEC's and BAe's defence businesses. But ministers should note that, while
European link-ups are fine in theory, other governments are wary of moves
that would undermine national sovereignty.

FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Base rate basics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The midwife of yesterday's rise in UK interest rates was a political crisis.
But the increase was due anyway. The economy is growing at an unsustainable
rate of over 4 per cent a year. Even if inflation is at a 27-year low, fears
about inflationary pressures remain justified because the gap between output
and capacity is narrowing so fast. A rate rise was needed. By unexpectedly
announcing it yesterday, the government could shift the political blame to
its rebellious backbenchers.
For all the drama caused by a humiliating parliamentary defeat and the
surprise rate rise, the markets ended the day surprisingly undamaged. Given
the sudden increase in political risk, it remains unclear whether corporate
earnings growth can underpin the equity market. Certainly, most of the
improvements will have to come from corporate rationalisation and exports
rather than consumer demand. The rate increase will eventually feed through
to mortgages, undermining the housing market still further. That will affect
already weak high street spending; Christmas and New Year are likely to be
unseasonably bleak for retailers.
Moreover, the UK markets' main focus in the coming weeks will be the US, not
Westminster. US equity markets are doubly troubled. Yesterday's hints by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, that rates may have to rise
again do little for sentiment. Meanwhile, the difficulties in Orange County
and at Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund are raising fears that other big
investors may be having troubles. Hopes of a year-end rally could be dashed.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Struggling on regardless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The classic response to even the fiercest storm is to put up a 'business as
usual' sign. Mr John Major has little option but to follow this rule. The UK
prime minister has been buffeted by events since sterling was ejected from
the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major has made a series of efforts to regain
the confidence of his party, but has been tripped up after every few steps
forward.
This is, perhaps, the inevitable fate of any leader of a divided party with
a small and dwindling overall majority. Over the past few days the trip-ups
have become serious. To discipline his backbenchers the prime minister
declared last week's vote on funds for the European Union a matter of
confidence. When a handful of Conservatives defied the subsequent three-line
whip, they were in effect expelled from the parliamentary group. On Tuesday
night all but one of the now semi-detached Tory rebels failed to support the
party under whose banner they had been elected.
In consequence, the chancellor of the exchequer was obliged to rescind the
proposed increase in VAT on domestic fuel. Today he will announce the
measures necessary to replace it; yesterday interest rates were increased.
The government's determination to hold down inflation is laudable. Yet there
is no justice in politics. The economic news is excellent, but the prime
minister is the most unpopular since polling began.
Nevertheless, Mr Major has to soldier on. The alternative is Tory suicide.
No potential successor would be better able to unite the party. The prime
minister might offer the Eurosceptics a referendum on a single currency in
return for more obedient voting in future. Even that could fail. The most
convinced doubters would settle for nothing less than a referendum on the
outcome of the 1996 inter-governmental conference; some might demand a
plebiscite in advance of negotiations.
Beneficial effect
Mr Major may reasonably hope that the beneficial effect of his economic
policies will eventually be felt. There is little he can do to hasten the
day. Meanwhile, it would be absurd to step down half-way through the term
for which his administration was elected in April 1992. The government can
only get its head down, and carry on as best as unfavourable circumstances
allow.
Mr Michael Heseltine's decision to refer both the GEC and British Aerospace
bids for shipbuilder VSEL to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission looks
like an example of soldiering on in poor circumstances. The Office of Fair
Trading had argued for the referral of the GEC bid, but there were no
obvious competition policy grounds for referring BAe's, too. Not to do so
would, however, have probably decided the contest. Now that decision is at
least postponed. Unfortunately, there are also questions about the
appropriate structure of the UK defence industry that the MMC is hardly the
right body to resolve.
More satisfactory
This looks like the action of a weak government. Yesterday's interest rate
rise was more satisfactory. The Bank of England's November inflation report
admitted 'the outlook for inflation was favourable'. But it also forecast
inflation two years hence 'at the top of the lower half of the target range'
of 1-4 per cent. While this was the most likely outcome, the risks were
judged higher on the upside than the downside.
The most important information since that date has been the upward revision
to GDP, which means that the economy is now estimated to have grown by 4.2
per cent in the 12 months to the third quarter of 1993. That is certainly
unsustainable. More important, it is undesirable. Because the level of full
capacity is unknowable, there has to be concern over how fast the economy is
growing.
It is no surprise that the governor of the Bank of England pushed for an
interest rate increase at yesterday morning's meeting with the chancellor.
In accepting that advice, the latter may have been influenced by Tuesday's
political events and, in particular, by concern over the markets' reaction.
But there was a good enough argument, in any case.
The costs of action were rightly judged smaller than those of inaction. At
this stage in the recovery - particularly given the poor credibility of
British monetary policy - it would be far more damaging for inflation to
jump above the target range than for the reverse to happen. That is the
governor's judgment, the chancellor's judgment and also the right judgment.
The chancellor is also obliged to replace the Pounds 1bn or so in net fiscal
revenue he lost on Tuesday night. He must do so, not because the economic
arguments for doing so are overwhelming. The sum is not large enough for
that. What matters is the government's ability to stick to any fiscal
strategy. A government unable to tax and spend as it judges fit - at least
in terms of the overall balance - can no longer govern. Its new proposals
have to succeed. Should it be rebuffed another time, it will probably be
swept away by the storm.

How exciting - an invitation for Observer to toast the festive season in the
company of The International Security Command of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office. Some very hush-hush gathering of top military bods, no
doubt.
Sadly no. The ISCFCO, it transpires, is nothing more than a fusion of three
FCO departments dealing with non-proliferation, security policy and the
CSCE, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Commanding the
command is the resolutely civilian assistant undersecretary David Logan.
Well, if you can't stop Balkan conflagrations, you might as well have a
party, eh chaps?

<TEXT>
Nicholas Winterton's path into the Aye lobby on Tuesday night is not likely
to lead him to a place of honour on the Olympic podium.
The VAT-on-fuel rebel has agreed on behalf of the British Olympic
Association to launch a private member's bill giving the BOA exclusive
rights in Britain over the five-ringed Olympic symbol of the games.
Increasingly, the association raises its multi-million pound funds through
sponsorship and, not surprisingly, those companies which cough up want
guarantees that they have exclusive rights to the logo in the UK.
'Until now we haven't been able to give that assurance because the rings
have been in the public domain for a long time,' a BOA spokesman explains.
Indeed, he admits, the organisation has quietly had to spend money on buying
off companies intent on encroaching on the territory of the official
sponsors.
However, Winterton drew an unlucky 13 in the ballot for private member's
bills; success also depends to a great extent on the popularity of the
sponsoring MP.
This has already been found wanting. Cancelling plans to address the
Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance at Westminster yesterday
afternoon was one Kenneth Clarke. And guess who's the chairman of this
increasingly prominent industry lobby? Right. Nicholas Winterton.

Has prominent Budapest stockbroker Csaba von Csiky lost his shirt in the
market? Sharp-eyed delegates to the Budapest gathering of the CSCE this week
would have noticed von Csiky flashing an identity pass describing himself as
a 'janitor' at the Hotel Kempinski.
As far as Observer is aware his finances are in perfect order, but he has
had a spot of bother of a different kind. For the duration of the
conference, Hungarian police had ordered that no one could stay or enter the
Kempinski - normally a salubrious enough pad - or any of the city's top
hotels, for that matter, unless part of an official delegation, or a member
of staff.
It didn't matter one jot to the police that von Csiky is actually a resident
at the Kempinski. He was told he had to move elsewhere.
Consequently, the embarrassed hotel management found the only way it could
outwit Hungary's notorious ex-communist bureaucracy was by putting von Csiky
on its staff.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Not shopped quite rite
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strange tale emerges of a Dutch fund manager from a tiny village outside
Gouda besting the London investment bank BZW during the rescue of discount
grocer Shoprite last month.
Henk van Heyst, via his 5-year-old fund, Van Heyst Investments, is clearly
something of a dab hand in that under-researched corner of the market, the
UK preference share.
Quick to spot trouble developing in Shoprite preference shares, 15m of which
had been issued at 100p in February, and which bottomed at 24p in October
after the second profit warning from the company in four months, he stepped
in smartly and bought a fat chunk - at what price he will not say, but
within a penny or three of the low.
Days later, Shoprite announced the sale of most of its stores to Kwik Save,
and offered to repay the preference shares at 85p in the pound (reflecting
the move in gilts since February). Van Heyst was not pleased and, at a
meeting just over a week ago at the offices of BZW, the company's broker, he
rallied other preference shareholders around him to try and block the rescue
package. Speedy climbdown of Shoprite, advised by BZW, which agreed to
redeem the prefs at 100p in the pound.
BZW, meanwhile, as sponsor to the pref issue and its lead agent, had been
criticised in June for keeping on its books some Pounds 3m of the shares
without making this clear to subscribing institutions.
In October, though, the market-making arm, it would seem, had a bit of a
panic and off-loaded most or all of the shares near the 24p floor - days
before the sale of Shoprite on which its corporate financiers were beavering
away.
Van Heyst discreetly declines to confirm he bought BZW's holding. One source
close to Shoprite merely says: 'Let's say that BZW's Chinese Walls are in
good order.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is fitting that the tribulations of Mercury, main competitor for British
Telecommunications, should have surfaced in the week that Oftel, the
telecoms watchdog, set out its views on the future regulation of the UK's
telecoms industry. It would be wrong, however, to attribute Mercury's plight
to regulatory failings, and still more mistaken for overseas observers to
believe it reveals the limits to effective telecoms competition.
On the contrary, Mercury's difficulties reflect the flourishing state of
competition in UK telecoms. Mercury's success in the late 1980s spurred BT
into making the impressive efficiency gains which are haunting its rival in
the mid-1990s. Since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, 57 new
licences have been granted, many of them to operators targeting the
corporate market with lower prices than Mercury's.
The government's policy of opening the market to all qualified comers has
yielded benefits to companies and consumers. And Oftel's tough price cap on
BT has produced large tariff cuts, even for those who have not benefited
directly from new competition.
Over-detailed
However, three issues require attention if the second decade of competition
in UK telecoms is to be as successful as the first. First, the over-detailed
regulation of retail prices and of inter-connection terms for operators
needing to use BT's national network. Second, the role of Oftel in policing
a tough pro-competition regime. Third, the shape of pan-EU regulation as
telecoms liberalisation advances on the mainland.
To reduce the need for intrusive regulation, BT's prices need to be brought
more closely into line with its costs, and its accounts ought to be fully
transparent to prevent undue cross-subsidy. Oftel has made strides on both
fronts, but more needs to be done. It is essential that Oftel withdraws from
the dubious process of charging BT's competitors 'access deficit
contributions' to cover the supposed loss BT incurs in maintaining line
connections. With competition in local telephony well established, Oftel
should give BT freedom to set line rentals, provided BT was required to
maintain a uniform national charge and to protect low users. ADCs could then
be abolished.
Effective sanctions
Oftel is careful in its paper to talk in terms of options, but its thrust is
away from prescriptive rules and towards effective sanctions to deal with
abuse of dominant position. This is to be welcomed, although fairly exacting
price controls on BT must continue for as long as it remains dominant.
However, if this approach is to bear fruit, competitors must have confidence
in the ability of the regulator to police abuse. They have little reason for
such confidence at present. Regulatory authorities in the UK have no power
to offer relief through injunction; nor are the UK's courts and competition
agencies well equipped to offer swift and effective remedies. Changes in the
law may be necessary to strengthen the regulators.
Without such changes, aggrieved competitors may look to Brussels for
redress. There are those who would in any case welcome a single EU telecoms
regulator as liberalisation advances across the EU. Yet it is hard to square
the idea of a single EU regulator with the principle of subsidiarity, given
Oftel's proven capacity to police the emerging UK market over the last
decade. Far better to agree principles for application in each country - one
of which must be the conferring on regulators of sufficient powers to
enforce fair competition swiftly.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Bonds that bind a hemisphere: Latin America and the US are
agreed on the importance of regional trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former US President Jimmy Carter once said he understood why Latin Americans
mistrusted the United States. 'The Mexican people know what Yankee
imperialism means, and being from Georgia, I have also heard the same phrase
used.'
For nearly 50 years, Latin America was the backyard where Washington fought
an often dirty war against the perceived Soviet threat. But tomorrow night,
when President Bill Clinton, another southern Democrat, greets 33 heads of
state and government gathering for the Summit of the Americas in Miami, he
will deliver a message that US policy towards its neighbours in the
hemisphere has changed.
Things have certainly changed in Latin America itself. Over the past decade,
a quiet revolution has sent military rulers back to the barracks and
jettisoned an exhausted protectionist economic model. Latin economies are
now more open to foreign trade and market forces than they have been since
the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The difficulty Mr Clinton faces is that, since he secured passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico
through the US Congress late last year, the western hemisphere has appeared
on his policy screen only twice. Both episodes - the US military
intervention in Haiti and the Cuban refugee crisis - suggest that US
attitudes to Latin America have not changed much. Unless Latin America
manifests itself as a domestic US policy problem - related, for example, to
immigration or drug trafficking - it seems Washington will not pay much
attention.
This impression has been reinforced by US officials' vigorous downplaying of
what it might be possible to achieve at this week's summit, called by the US
following Nafta's ratification.
So successful have these efforts been that some Latin American leaders have
wondered whether it will be worth the trip. All the more so after Mr Clinton
was forced to put off until next year 'fast track' negotiating authority for
talks on the expansion of Nafta from the US Congress.
But the prospects for the Miami summit have been looking up lately - despite
the blow dealt to the host by the Democrats' defeat in last month's mid-term
Congressional elections. Latin American governments want to talk trade and,
since he secured passage for the Uruguay Round world trade agreement last
week in Congress, Mr Clinton has indicated he wants to talk trade too.
'There will be hemispheric concurrence that economic integration is a vital
goal for this hemisphere, that there will be a call for the construction of
the Americas Free Trade Area, or Afta, and that the process of integration
should begin immediately,' said Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade
representative.
Mr Clinton and the leaders of Canada and Mexico are also expected to
announce their intention to start negotiations soon on Chile's accession to
Nafta.
The opportunity for winning US congressional approval for bringing Chile
into Nafta is narrow, ahead of the 1996 US presidential election campaign.
'To try to strike a deal in the middle of an election is impossible. We have
a year and a half now,' said Mr John Biehl del Rio, Chile's ambassador to
Washington.
Nafta's extension to Chile is of little economic consequence to the US -
Chile's economy is less than 1 per cent of the size of that of the US, and
most of its exports to North America are already subject to low tariffs. It
is, however, of symbolic importance.
It would give impetus to the idea that Nafta could be the basis of
hemispheric economic integration. 'It's like a bicycle; if we stop
pedalling, everyone will fall off,' said one official involved in the
participants' pre-summit deliberations.
Brazil is one reason why the US cannot take it for granted that the whole
region will queue up to sign up to Nafta. Now emerging from years in the
economic doldrums, the largest economy in Latin America sees itself as the
centre of a South American Free Trade Area - Safta. The core of this will be
Mercosur, which from the start of 1995 will become a customs union tying
Brazil with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Brazil's official attitude is that there is no antagonism between Safta and
Nafta. But underlying this is a barely hidden suspicion of US motives in the
region. Mr Rubens Barbosa, the Brazilian ambassador to London, argued that
joining Nafta would mean South American countries 'would lose their capacity
for adopting autonomous policies in sensitive areas such as investment,
services and intellectual property'.
Complicating matters, the European Union last month tossed a joker into the
Miami deliberations, saying it would negotiate a free trade zone with the
Mercosur countries, and indicating it would not stand by and watch its
trading relationship with the southern cone countries eroded by the US. One
official at the pre-summit talks said this announcement galvanised
proceedings, making the North Americans more determined to push Nafta
forward.
If this were not complicated enough, Nafta and Mercosur are not the only
trade agreements being forged in the region. The Andean Pact of Colombia,
Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia enter into a customs union of their own
on January 1. The Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Economic
Community and a plethora of other bilateral agreements and sub-regional free
trade accords have also been put in place.
For the first time Latin companies are seeking new markets regionally,
boosting intra-regional trade to 21 per cent of regional exports in 1993,
from 13 per cent in 1988. Mr Pedro Vallenilla, president of Venepal,
Venezuela's largest pulp and paper company, said: 'We don't consider
Colombia, where we have 10 per cent of our sales, as an export market.'
While this represents a profound change, many trade experts are worried that
a patchwork of accords could hinder free trade rather than help it. Mr
Sidney Weintraub of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies
decribes further proliferation of bilateral and sub-regional agreements in
the western hemisphere as 'a hypothetical horror scenario'.
With this in mind, the Miami summit will aim to freeze protectionism in the
hemisphere, ensuring no increase in tariff or non-tariff barriers. Ms
Barshefsky said the Organisation of American States would begin an immediate
analysis of the compatibility of existing trade pacts in the region. A
target date, perhaps 2015, is also being discussed for hemispheric free
trade.
The hope in Washington is that this would fix Latin America's political and
economic revolution, the durability of which cannot be taken for granted.
Political reforms remain vulnerable, because the military still plays an
important role in many states, particularly in central America. And drug
traffickers are still undermining and corrupting many governments.
Doubt also still hangs over economic development, as growth has so far
delivered little to the poor, whose lot worsened in the 1980s, with wealth
in Latin America still more concentrated than in any other region.
Also of concern are Mexico's and Argentina's large current account deficits,
which underline their dependence on fickle foreign capital markets. Fears of
another financial crisis in the region have not vanished.
Another area of uncertainty is the ability of regional governments to
oversee market economies. A recent paper by Mr Moises Naim, the former
Venezuelan industry minister now at the Carnegie Endowment, the Washington
think-tank, argues: 'Governments in Latin America are not up to the tasks of
sustaining and deepening economic reforms, overseeing newly liberalised
private sectors, dealing with the problems of poverty and inequality, or
consolidating democratic politics.'
Trade, however, remains the top priority for the Latin American participants
in the Miami meeting. As Mr Kim Holmes, head of the foreign policy studies
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think-tank, said:
'President Clinton needs to tell his Latin American colleagues that he will
go to the mat for 'fast track'. Trade is the only issue in this hemisphere
that the Latin Americans and the US can come together on across the board.'

<TEXT>
Training currently enjoys an almost undisputed reputation as the engine of
economic success and the panacea for the long-term unemployed.
Industrialists can be relied upon to endorse the value of any new training
initiative. Politicians reaffirm their commitment to parity of esteem for
vocational and academic education as a symbol of their economic vision.
The UK's latest initiative in vocational training and education is the
introduction of new qualifications: General National Vocational
Qualifications. GNVQs (and their Scottish equivalents) are supposed to
herald enhanced status for vocational education to the benefit of industry
and the enterprise culture. They are intended, says the government, to
provide a bridge between the academic and vocational, leading into the
workplace, giving credit towards more specific vocational qualifications,
but also allowing progress into higher education.
GNVQs have certainly recruited successfully among 16-18-year-olds. But this
has little to do with their novel or vocational character. Research* just
completed shows that GNVQs are taught, in classrooms, to teenagers whose
main aspiration is higher education and who have no intention either of
combining their GNVQs with the narrowly occupational NVQs (National
Vocational Qualifications), or of moving on to NVQs in the future. Why are
young people so apparently blind to what industrialists and politicians see
as the needs of the labour market?
In fact, the same patterns are to be found in other industrialised
countries. In the Netherlands, the old-established junior vocational
programmes are in near-terminal decline. In France, the government expanded
the traditional baccalaureat programme with first technical and then
vocational baccalaureats. Both were conceived as entry routes to employment,
but have instead fuelled huge increases in university entrants and in
numbers attempting higher technical awards. In Germany, famous for the dual
system of apprenticeship, there are now more young people in higher
education than there are in apprenticeships. Qualification panic has come
late to England - but there too the demand is for more education. NVQs have
failed as an attractive qualification for young people.
People are generally more rational in serving their own interests than in
their advice to others. Nothing suggests that teenagers are any different.
On the contrary, their educational choices are a clear response to what
employers look for when hiring.
A central function of any education system is to sort people. Employers want
the best employees they can find; young people want to differentiate
themselves from their competitors. When few people possessed advanced
educational qualifications, employers knew that the less qualified would
include many able people. However, the more numerous the highly qualified,
the less attractive those with few or no qualifications become.
Moreover, the rhetoric about parity of esteem obscures the fact that, for
most jobs, the relevant vocational skills are academic. An economy with a
growing proportion of office-based jobs is one in which grammatical writing
(not touch-typing) is the crucial requirement. A world of data-processing
requires new and greater levels of numeracy, not a reduction in mathematics
teaching. Japan's general education produces workers with many vocational
skills and the capacity to learn fast on the job.
The rationality of teenagers puts that of many policymakers to shame. In the
UK, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress
apparently believe that what the unemployed require is government training
programmes that equip them with skills. But what most companies actually
look for are candidates who can be trained quickly for jobs that change
constantly. That means people with high levels of general (notably academic)
skills, and evidence of application, for example in pursuit of education.
Little wonder that short-term government training schemes have such a dismal
record, worldwide, in raising par-ticipants' chances of finding a job.
Throughout the west, vocational education is converging with academic in the
emphasis it gives to language skills, mathematics and science. It is doing
so because of pressure from young people and parents: those affected most
directly by what educational programmes offer. It is a pity that the
suppliers of GNVQs have not yet learnt that the customers really do know
best.

LOOKING AT THE SUN
By James Fallows
Pantheon, Dollars 25, 517 pages
Just as looking at the sun causes blindness, so gazing at Asia's fast-
emerging economic and social systems can dazzle the mind. James Fallows,
Washington editor of the Atlantic Monthly, comes to the rescue, by holding
up a polarising filter, through which one clear message can be seen. The
main secret of success in the Japanese economy is the country's ability to
apply a judicious mixture of government intervention and the free market, he
argues.
The government picks targets; the market selects the winners to achieve
those targets. Add to that the Asian respect for wider collective interests
over individual freedom - only visible in western democracies during times
of war - and you have an unbeatable recipe.
Such theories make Fallows a leading proponent of revisionism, the school of
thought that holds that Japan is so different from the west that foreign
pressure is the only way to bring change. For that reason, Looking at the
Sun is unpopular in Japan - in the mistaken belief that it is anti-Japanese.
In fact, Fallows goes out of his way to argue that the west would do well to
follow the example of some of Japan's Asian neighbours in adapting some of
the strengths of Japanese capitalism to their own systems. The weakness of
this book is not that it is anti-Japanese, but too pro-Japanese in paying so
little attention to the way in which recent political and economic upheavals
have exposed weaknesses in the system.
Japan's model is not as mysterious or unfair as many free-market minded
critics, especially the US government, believe, argues Fallows. America's
own economic power was born from its ability to violate the principle of
laisser-faire. The federal government used high import duties to protect the
domestic steel industry in the 19th century and did not start espousing free
markets until after it had become strong, in the 1940s. Britain and Germany
followed similar patterns.
Japan is only following the west's well-tried path, for example, by forcing
foreign electronic companies in the 1960s and 1970s to license semiconductor
chip technology to Japanese, as a condition of doing business in Japan. That
laid the base from which Japan grew to dominate the world chip market by
1990.
This does not mean that the US should try to adopt the Japanese model
wholesale, says Fallows. Rather, it should think back to the strategies that
helped it succeed in the first place. Despite the rise of multilateral
trading rules, the world economy still turns on the battle between the weak
and strong, leaders and followers, rather than on the fair and unfair, he
argues.
What makes the strong succeed? Japan and its most successful neighbours have
little time for the philosophy of competition between individuals, as
advocated by economist Joseph Schumpeter and seen as one of the great assets
of the US.
Rather, they follow Friedrich List, the 19th-century German economist, who
believes that a nation's wealth depends on its skill at producing, rather
than consuming, and that individual wealth is therefore dependent on that of
the group. It is no accident, argues Fallows, that List is little known in
the US and popular in Tokyo and Seoul.
Japan's List-like ideas set the tone of the rest of Asia's economic
development, just as Japanese government assistance, commercial lending,
technology and industrial power, set the pace. But beware of thinking of
east Asian countries as like-minded planets of the Japanese sun.
Fallows divides Japan's neighbours into four sets. First, there are
countries experiencing growth without development, such as Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia. Their economies are primarily objects of Japan's
dynamism, as cheap assembly sites and fast growing markets for Japanese
goods. They are driven by forces beyond their control, unable to steer their
own economic destinies. They are almost economic colonies of Japan.
Second come countries on the sidelines, such as Burma, North Korea, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, which have missed out on the
region's growth through bad leadership, natural disaster or bad luck. They
could well prosper in the future, but for the time being are left in the
shade.
Third are the contenders, whose systems closely resemble Japan's - South
Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. They could catch up with Japan, in the sense of
developing independent technology, commercial and political leverage, though
they could never surpass Japan in size, predicts Fallows.
The final category is the wild card, China. It could either come, within 50
years or so, to dominate east Asian economies more completely than Japan
does now, or it could stagnate indefinitely. Either way, the economic future
of Hong Kong and Taiwan will be increasingly bound to China.
Above all, one thing will determine the chances of success of Asia's
different categories of player. That will be their governments' ability to
borrow Japanese-style industrial and trade policy to build up the productive
base of their economies.
Here, Fallows has no truck with Washington's present line that Asian
countries should adopt western-style free markets, and that their
governments should intervene as little as possible.
He advocates, instead, the European Union strategy that the state's job is
to set rules that best serve broad economic interests. One example is local
content requirements, which put pressure on Japanese manufacturers to build
plants in Europe in the 1980s. The Europeans interfered with the free
market, yet ended up expanding world trade. Japan and Asia are not as
different from the west as they look.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opinions on EU swayed by poll
questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord PLUMB DL MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The survey of attitudes to the EU in Britain and Germany ('Poll shows
wide opposition to single EU currency', December 5) reveals that popular
bewilderment, not to say sourness, takes a very similar form in both
countries.
But I was also heartened to learn that 39 per cent of British respondents
thought the present very close political links between EU member states
should 'remain unchanged'; of those 40 per cent, a majority thought they
should be even closer.
German opinion is very similar.
The respondents' demand for a referendum on a single currency stands at 64
per cent in Britain, and 1 percentage point higher in Germany, which did not
surprise me. On the great majority of important subjects, proposing a
referendum is invariably popular.
The hard fact remains that some issues lend themselves better than others to
the kind of 'yes' or 'no' decision-making, which is all that a referendum
can offer. There is clearly no way of forcing the electorates to concentrate
on the issue at hand.
The September 1992 Maastricht referendum result in France was, for instance,
above all a reflection of the low standing of the government of the day.
In Ireland the treaty was widely thought to mean abortion on demand would be
introduced as of right.
I hesitate to be pedantic, but note that the exact form of the question in
your survey relates to a referendum on whether the EU should introduce a
single currency.
The question for us is rather: should Britain remain outside a single
currency were the EU to go ahead with the commitment (contained in the
Maastricht treaty) to introduce the single currency by 1999 at the latest?
This is a clear pointer to the prodigious difficulty of formulating
questions not only in referendums but in opinion polls. There was one thing
in your report that took me aback. I had always assumed the German public to
be well-informed.
You have put me right.
The 57 per cent in Brandenburg who know the Commission is based in Brussels
get a pat on the head for their 'above-average' performance. I will draw a
veil over the 38 per cent in the East Midlands who got it right. It
depressed me but I was not very surprised.
As Goethe put it, against stupidity the gods themselves strive in vain.
Henry Plumb,
leader of the Conservatives
in the European Parliament

FT  08 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The political itch to spoil it all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To anyone of any political party who was pleased that the UK was showing the
best prospect of sustainable non-inflationary growth for more than 30 years,
the government's defeat on the second and final stage of the planned
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel was an irritating
self-inflicted blow.
Many Conservatives fail to realise quite how remarkable the change in the
economic prospect has been. Unemployment started to turn down far earlier
than normal. Pay rises have remained subdued and productivity has risen
faster than expected. As a result unit wage costs have fallen. Sterling has
remained steady and growth has been increasingly export-led and is set to
have a strong investment component. Even the published current balance of
payments deficit has been disappearing - and all at a time when the UK's
recovery has been ahead of its main trading partners and a deterioration
might have been expected.
The continuation of these benign processes cannot be taken for granted and
is vulnerable to the confidence wobbles and the waves of pessimism to which
business is so prone. At this delicate juncture along come a handful of
populist Conservative backbenchers, an opportunistic Labour opposition and
some unprincipled small parties to defeat a commonsense measure to raise
needed revenue, spread the indirect tax net - which has still far too many
exemptions - a little more widely, and to make a modest contribution to
energy saving and a cleaner environment. The top table shows that VAT on
domestic fuel raises more from better-off than from poor families. It would
have accounted for a higher proportion of the household spending of the poor
 -but this would have been more than offset by the benefits package, now
also withdrawn.
The reaction of John Major, UK prime minister, to being re-elected with a
small majority was precisely the wrong one. He concentrated on a small group
of Tory hardliners with a mixture of threats and appeasement, as a result of
which he is more in their hands than ever. The statesman-like approach would
have been to recognise the new political balance and negotiate with Labour
and Liberal members who were nearer to his own way of thinking on both
Europe and other matters than are the Conservative diehards.
But equally, the parliamentary opposition compares badly with the US
Republicans who in the end helped President Bill Clinton to get legislation
on the Uruguay Round world trade agreement through Congress. The real reason
why the British parliament counts for so little has nothing to do with
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, but stems from its
constituting the background noise to a non-stop general election rather than
making a genuine contribution to policy.
Making the increased contribution to the European Union budget a matter of
confidence and treating a vote on its own Budget as an ordinary
parliamentary manoeuvre was precisely the wrong way round. It is desirable
for the government to honour international obligations. But if parliament
had prevented an increase in EU contributions it would not have been the end
of the world. One does not have to be a flag-waving nationalist to query the
high-spending interventionism of Brussels. A federalist of classical liberal
persuasion who believed in a strong but limited European government,
confined to defence, law and order, currency and international trade
negotiations, could take the same line. The EU has too much to spend rather
than too little; the instances of fraud are almost an inevitable consequence
of the handouts, payouts and levies, mainly but not only in agriculture, by
the EU.
Given everything that has happened, the package of fiscal measures to be
announced today to plug the tax gap and the  1/2 per cent rise in base rates
announced early yesterday morning are the absolute minimum required to
maintain, not political stability - which is now all but hopeless - but
business confidence and the momentum of non-inflationary expansion.
There was indeed a strong case for a base rate increase - made out, for
instance, in my pre-and post-Budget articles well before the VAT defeat. The
signs are that expansion is gathering too much momentum. The likely increase
this year of nearly 4 per cent in non-oil gross domestic product is well
above the economy's underlying growth rate; and the margin of unused
capacity is dwindling quickly. Kenneth Clarke's chief economic adviser,
Professor Alan Budd, put the remaining margin at 1-4 per cent in evidence
before the Treasury Committee on Tuesday evening; and if he is anywhere near
the mark the latest interest rate increase is unlikely to be the last.
The clinching evidence has come both from rising material and component
prices and from growing signs that businessmen are planning to increase
prices. Finally - and least emphasised in the parochial debate - are the
many signs of world economic recovery advancing much more quickly than
anyone had supposed earlier in the year. This shifts very starkly the
balance of risks. For even if UK interest rates rise slightly too early or
too far, there is plenty of world demand to maintain the momentum of
recovery. On the other hand, if errors are made in the other direction, it
will become difficult and costly to reverse any rebuilding of inflationary
expectations.
But despite these strong arguments it is hard to believe that the chancellor
would have agreed so quickly and so readily to this base rate increase
without the VAT defeat. Indeed, desirable though the increase was, its
manner reeked of the alarms and emergencies of the 1970s - which indeed also
often followed political defeats for the Labour government, itself often in
a House of Commons minority.
The official reason for bringing forward the meeting between the chancellor
and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, from 9.30am to 8.45am
yesterday was to remove uncertainty before the gilts auction. Yet the
auction date is normally fixed 12 days in advance. The whole concept of
these pre-announced monthly meetings was to allow for a calm and unhurried
discussion. The idea cannot have been a rushed breakfast meeting followed by
an announcement at 9.45.
On the fiscal side, the rationalisations for not having proceeded with the
increase in VAT on fuel and for not replacing it with anything else now
become ever more unconvincing. For instance Andrew Dilnot, director of the
Institute of Fiscal Studies, was not doing his duty when he belittled the
Pounds 1bn at stake as a small fraction (0.3 per cent) of total public
sector revenue. As one senator said to another: 'A billion here and a
billion there and soon we are talking of real money.'
A large part of public sector revenues comes from individually small taxes.
The full 17 1/2 per cent VAT on domestic fuel was expected to raise Pounds
2.8bn - equivalent to the whole of the yield from spirit and wine duties.
The most plausible sounding argument is: 'Why raise an unpopular new tax or
replace it with anything else, when you know that you will be able to return
it in tax cuts in a year or two?' On this basis a good part of the extra
Pounds 17bn raised by the Lamont and Clarke budgets of 1993 was
questionable.
The missing element, however, in all the dialectics is any recognition of
uncertainty. The reason why the government was right to raise taxes as soon
as the economy could stand it was that the Treasury could not be sure how
much of the Pounds 50bn (subsequently trimmed to Pounds 45bn) would vanish
automatically with economic recovery. Today, no one can be at all confident
that there will be any taxes to remit in 1995 or 1996. The government
cheer-leaders (known by the peculiar name of whips) have only themselves to
blame after their heavy hints about so-called income tax cuts to come.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: British Telecom is able to deliver
cable services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD WOOLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to the impression Tony Young creates (Letters: December 1), BT
is not prevented from using its network to deliver the same services as
cable.
When the government created the cable licensing regime in 1984, it envisaged
that BT would run one-third of all cable franchises and could use its
existing network to deliver broadband services in these areas. BT could have
been the largest cable operator, but it spurned the opportunity.
Even now, BT could fill its ducts with fibre and deliver its current
services more efficiently, offer extra services (such as those on France's
Minitel system) and invest in an entirely new market - that of interactive
communications. Instead BT, Britain's biggest and most profitable company,
wants a new monopoly.
The cable industry is investing billions of pounds in Britain, creating new
local companies and with them tens of thousands of jobs. Why does Tony Young
want to destroy this? The government has created a new market and Britain is
leading the world. Tony Young and BT should recognise and accept this.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Reforms of Customs work announced' (December 1), reports
Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, as promising that
'there are not going to be any customs-free ports or airports'. If she means
what she says, it will be a welcome development.
Only recently (November 25), in a written answer to a parliamentary
question, Mr David Heathcoat Amory, the paymaster-general, listed six
airports which receive scheduled flights from abroad and currently do not
have full-time customs staff. The cuts of 550 anti-smuggling staff announced
this week will add to this list.
At these airports, instead of being met by customs officers, incoming
passengers simply find a notice next to a telephone which they are asked to
use if they have anything to declare.
I suspect that smugglers of drugs, firearms or pornography are unlikely to
use this 'more efficient' service.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Markets divorced from real world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From HERBERT E. MEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Any doubts that the stock markets are discon-nected from planet earth
were laid to rest by the astonishing headline on the front page of your
edition of November 30, 'Big surge in US consumer confidence alarms
markets'.
Would someone please explain to these idiots in the City and on Wall Street
that surging consumer confidence is good news for those of us scrambling to
sell real products and services, and for those who invest in our
enterprises.
If our success is bad news for speculators and gamblers - which is what
these City and Wall Street types mostly have become - then I for one hope
they all go bust and make room for professionals who understand the
importance of consumer confidence to growth, and the importance of growth
not merely to make the rich richer, but to create new jobs for those who
need them.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pain or privileges control?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs HELEN TAFT GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was in New York on Sunday October 30, a warm, sunny, delightful day,
and visited New York's Central Park Zoo. In due course I paid a call to the
ladies' loo and I record a vignette of NY life below.
A mother, with pram and a three to four-year-old child in it, repeated and
repeated 'stop that, stop that' as the child in a tantrum continued to kick
the wall with its feet. Finally, in desperation, the mother said: 'If you
don't stop that, I'll take all your privileges away.'
The recent publicity about the UK's child minders brought this scene to the
forefront of my mind. Will the child connect her loss of privileges with her
behaviour in the ladies' loo at the Central Park Zoo?
Perhaps the mother would have taken more striking action if there had not
been two witnesses.

As with some momentous state occasion, BBC2 has changed its schedules at the
last moment to accommodate the Royal Opera's new production of La traviata
from Covent Garden. This is the collaboration between Sir Georg Solti and
the National Theatre's Richard Eyre. On the first night the reception was
ecstatic. Why? The conductor was precise, energetic and unfeeling. The
director had patently never worked in opera before, had nothing to offer in
the way of characterisation or interpretation, and was uncertain what to do
with the chorus. The leading soprano is young, pretty and mellifluous, but
barely scratches the surface of Verdi's moving vision of the lady of the
camellias; yet the audience reacted as if she were a combination of Maria
Callas, Mother Teresa and Samantha Fox. It may be better on the box, and you
can watch programmes in those interminable intervals (they're just as long
in the Opera House). At least it makes a change from those obsessive relays
from the New York Met, another of the BBC's little mysteries.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: Arnie's natal attraction - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

JUNIOR (12) Ivan Reitman
ABOVE THE RIM (15)Jeff Pollack
THE PUNK &amp; THE PRINCESS (15) Mike Sarne
THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT] III (PG) Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan
Junior is the sort of comedy that relies on a single, big concept for its
laughs. In this case, it is the spectacle of Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant.
What better way to pack theatres with sniggering fans than to cast Arnie as
a research scientist who impregnates himself with a fertilised egg to prove
that his experimental cure for miscarriage is effective?
But a funny thing happens on the way to the box office - the sight of
Schwarzenegger pregnant is considerably less hilarious than director Ivan
Reitman intended. While the thought of the world's foremost macho hero
carrying a child seems at first to be the pinnacle of gender dissonance, the
strange fact is that Arnie does not look all that different from normal with
a bun in the oven. After all, there has always been something faintly
prenatal about the guy, with his bulging pectorals, venous flesh and
stiff-backed gait. The extra bit of distension is hardly noticeable. Once
that rippling stomach begins to bulge, you find yourself thinking that if
any man can carry a child, it is Arnie.
Robbed of its big shock value, the film flounders in a sea of cliche.
Writers Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad fail to milk this potentially fertile
subject for its satiric worth, while Reitman foregoes wit for a parade of
visual gags and tame one-liners. Despite a welcome breath of worldly sarcasm
from Danny DeVito, the film keeps to the sentimental middle ground as Arnie
decides to bring the child to term, a decision which allows him to get in
touch with his feminine side. So instead of cutting satire on the often
bogus politics of the 'new man', we get faithful old chestnuts about morning
sickness, bizarre food cravings and the importance of family values. What
few potentially funny lines exist are hopelessly mangled by Schwarzenegger's
ham-fisted delivery.
And though Reitman and company toil laboriously to explain how a fertile egg
might be lodged in the male body, they then neglect to mention how a
wombless man could possibly nourish a foetus. The film has a sheen of
science, but it is ultimately deeply illogical. But its most disheartening
aspect is the presence of Emma Thompson who, cast as Arnie's love interest,
seems completely at a loss. She had better watch out - the enormous amount
of good feeling she has generated with her Merchant/Ivory work will
dissipate very quickly if she insists on involvement with such tired fare as
this.
Despite a welter of rap music, urban slang and noisy violence, Above the Rim
is actually a deeply, even quaintly, old-fashioned movie. It tells the story
of a young Harlem basketball star (Duane Martin) who tries to use his
athletic prowess to escape the poverty, drugs and violence of the ghetto.
Along the way he is tempted from the path of righteousness by a local
gang-banger (Tupac Shakur) while also contending with a former basketball
hero who is courting his mother. Not surprisingly, the whole thing winds up
in a noisy shoot-out (first with basketballs, then with bullets) in which
good overcomes evil.
Writer/director Jeff Pollack keeps things moving along at a fast and furious
pace, and his depiction of the high-pressure world of urban basketball is
assured. He is greatly aided by some sterling performances, particularly by
Martin, Shakur and Marlon Wayans as the neighbourhood clown. Where the film
suffers is in its over-reliance upon on-court action and its supremely
simplistic morality - virtue is rewarded, heroes prevail and the bad guys
are the ones wearing black basketball jerseys.
The Punk &amp; The Princess, on the other hand, could have benefited from a bit
more simplicity. This unfortunate attempt to set Romeo and Juliet in
contemporary Notting Hill is a messy stew of confused pretension and
overwrought trendiness. The film concerns an aimless young punk (Charlie
Creed Miles) who falls in love with a rich American girl (Vanessa Hadaway)
when he stumbles upon her performing as Juliet at the Gate Theatre. Their
affair sets off all the usual gang rivalries and familial ructions,
resulting in fights, stabbings and ultimately death.
Director Mike Sarne wears neither his learning nor imagery lightly - the
film is fraught with hackneyed Shakespearian references, most notably a
midnight balcony scene, a swordfight with pool cues and a very dodgy
reference to 'Star-cross'd lovers'. There are some nicely done knockabout
scenes between Miles and his mates, though these are ultimately sunk by the
film's leisurely pace, careless camerawork and some truly appalling American
accents.
That's Entertainment] III is another welcome raid on the archives of MGM's
legendary musical division. While it is hard to imagine how anybody could go
wrong compiling this material, director Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan
have concocted a skilful piece of nostalgia, including not only standards
from the likes of Esther Williams, Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, but also
a number of gems scooped from the editing room floor. Among these prized
out-takes are Cyd Charisse brilliantly performing a dance number which Joan
Crawford ultimately turned into screen suet, and Judy Garland's first use of
her trademark half-tuxedo in a scene inexplicably cut from Easter Parade.
There is also a remarkable sequence in which two takes of a Fred Astaire
number are juxtaposed. They duplicate each other move-for-move in a stunning
demonstration of the great dancer's sublime perfection. But the most
memorable contribution to the film comes from Lena Horne, who with dignified
yet justifiable anger protests at not being given the lead in Showboat for
the simple reason that she was black. Her worthiness for the role is proven
beyond doubt when her performance is compared with Ava Gardner's rather
shaky, dubbed effort. It is a sad commentary on contemporary films that the
stuff they used to leave out makes for better viewing than much of what they
now put in.
